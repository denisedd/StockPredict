{"Headline": "Land Prices in Japan's Largest Cities Rise for First Time in 6 Years", "Date": "2014-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Land prices in Japan\u2019s largest cities rose for the first time in six years in 2013, while declines slowed in the rest of the country, government data showed on Tuesday, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s loose-money policies encouraged asset purchases.Commercial land prices in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya rose 1.6 percent on average last year, reversing a 2012 fall of 0.5 percent, while residential land was up 0.5 percent, compared with the previous year\u2019s 0.6 percent decline, according to a survey released by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.In other cities, prices declined for a 22nd year, highlighting the stark divide between the biggest urban centers and smaller ones. Nationwide land prices, excluding the top three cities, fell 1.7 percent last year, compared with a 2.8 percent decline in 2012.Mr. Abe\u2019s government spending and the central bank\u2019s flood of cash into financial markets, aimed at ending 15 years of deflation, have weakened the yen and brought a surge in corporate profits and stock prices.\u201cBecause of the stock market rise, wealthy individuals were encouraged to invest in housing in exclusive residential areas,\u201d said Isao Ishibashi, a member of the ministry\u2019s land appraisal committee.Although some market players have expressed concern that low interest rates, an ocean of liquidity and a hunt for yield are prompting land speculation, Mr. Ishibashi insisted there is no bubble. \u201cThe recent rise in land prices reflects the real economy,\u201d he said.Land prices were especially strong near manufacturing centers, reflecting the way exporters have benefited from the weaker yen. The Nagoya area of central Japan, home to the world\u2019s largest carmaker, Toyota Motor, led the top three cities in commercial and residential land prices, which rose 1.8 percent and 1.1 percent respectively last year.Tokyo residential land prices were up 0.7 percent, led by the upscale Chuo ward in the center of the capital, up 8.7 percent. Part of Chuo, in Tokyo Bay, a major staging ground for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, climbed 10.9 percent.In Fukushima Prefecture, home of the nuclear power plant wrecked in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, overall residential land prices rose 1.2 percent, reversing a 1.6 percent decline in 2012, as people near the stricken reactors sought land in other parts of the same prefecture.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Review of Banks in Europe Gets Results", "Date": "2014-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceWhat is an asset worth? How much capital does a bank really have?Since the financial crisis showed that banks in many countries had reported capital levels that turned out to be wildly optimistic, investor cynicism has grown, and with it fears that a genuinely stringent evaluation of a bank\u2019s books could produce disastrous results. Nowhere is that truer than in Italy, where in the past national regulators sometimes appeared to be more like cheerleaders than stern judges. A 2010 stress test of large European banks, which found they were generally in good shape, was widely derided because it assumed no risk in government bonds \u2014 the very asset that was arousing the most concern among investors at the time. Passing a test widely viewed as rigged does not add much to a bank\u2019s credibility.In buying shares, investors were in effect saying that they found the UniCredit numbers credible and that they were not nearly as bad as had been feared.And because the announcement was widely assumed to be an attempt to get out in front of the European Central Bank, which will opine on the status of all large European banks later this year, it represented evidence that investors trust that review is being done well. Its results are expected in October, before the central bank takes over regulation of the large banks in November.The asset quality review, and a stress test to determine how well each bank would do in a specified crisis, are being conducted by the E.C.B. in conjunction with local central banks. In a fractious Europe, the evidence so far is that the process is going well.\u201cBy and large, talking to E.C.B. staffers and reading the documents, I think the E.C.B. is conducting a competent process,\u201d said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, an economist with the Peterson Institute for International Economics.He noted that Italy was the only one of the troubled peripheral countries in the euro zone that had not had its banks carefully vetted by European institutions in connection with a possible aid plan.\u201cIt is clear,\u201d he added, that \u201cfor political reasons, the one country where Mario Draghi cannot be seen to be lenient is Italy.\u201d Mr. Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, was previously the governor of the Bank of Italy, that country\u2019s central bank. The hope is that the E.C.B. will assure consistent standards across Europe. \u201cThis is about moving from 18 supervisory approaches to one,\u201d said Stephen G. Smith, a partner in the British affiliate of KPMG. \u201cIt represents a change for every bank. It will have consequences from a capital, liquidity and funding perspective.\u201dBut if the E.C.B. looks good so far, the UniCredit report also provided evidence of just how disconnected \u2014 and in some ways political \u2014 the world of European accounting has become.The bank, which went on an ill-conceived acquisition binge in Central Europe in the years before the credit crisis, wrote off \u20ac9.3 billion in good will and customer relationships \u2014 essentially an admission that it overpaid. And it more than quadrupled its provision for loan losses, raising the figure by \u20ac7.2 billion, to \u20ac9.3 billion.But even though the bank\u2019s net worth on its published financial statements fell by 24 percent, bank capital is computed differently. There the decline was much smaller, and UniCredit concluded it did not need to raise capital. It even decided it could raise its dividend. It forecast a profit of \u20ac2 billion in 2014 and \u20ac7.5 billion in 2018. The fourth-quarter loss would have been more than a billion euros larger had the bank not been able to report a profit on a presumed increase in the value of its stake in the Italian central bank. It is likely to sell a part of that stake within a few years, but it has not done so yet, and there is currently no market in the shares. The Italian central bank has reorganized its capitalization, with new shares issued to replace old ones. The shareholders plan to raise the book value of their central bank shares to the current value.In the absence of a market, how do they know the new value? It was set by a law passed by the Italian Parliament. A \u201cHigh Level Group of Experts\u201d \u2014 that was the official name of the group \u2014 concluded that the central bank was worth \u20ac5 billion to \u20ac7.5 billion. The Parliament chose the high figure.Why didn\u2019t we think of that? Instead of using many billions of dollars to bail out the banks in 2008, perhaps Congress could have simply passed a law declaring them solvent. High-quality accounting standards, some would say, should be based on reality, not political convenience. But among European accounting regulators, there seems to be no hesitation to accept the number chosen by the politicians.But there is a dispute over which accounting rule applies. If this transaction is deemed to be a sale of the old shares and a purchase of the new ones, then there is a profit to be realized under the international accounting standards used in Europe, and UniCredit is entitled to a profit of \u20ac1.3 billion before taxes, just as it said it expected to report.But if the transaction is just an exchange of shares, then under the international rules the increase in value should be recorded in something called \u201cother comprehensive income\u201d and not be recognized in the profit and loss statement. UniCredit would have a bigger loss than it reported.In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission can, if it wishes, determine the proper accounting in a controversial area and can force a company to restate its books. But there is no comparable body in Europe. Instead, the European Securities and Markets Authority, composed of securities regulators in all European countries, last week held a European Enforcers Coordination Session to discuss the issue. They did not disclose an agreement, and even if they had it would not be binding on the Italian regulator.As a result, UniCredit said the accounting might change. \u201cWe changed our accounts several times this weekend,\u201d said Federico Ghizzoni, the UniCredit chief executive, as he explained the situation on Tuesday, \u201cand according to the most recent guidance we\u2019ve received from regulators, this was the best solution.\u201d It is that kind of indecision, and possibly conflicting interpretations of rules from country to country, that has been cited in the United States by opponents of international accounting standards. The S.E.C. has said that it wants to see evidence of consistent application of rules before it allows American companies to use the standards. Another accounting issue that has ignited controversy is whether companies should be required to change accounting firms periodically, perhaps every seven or 10 years. Proponents say that audit quality would improve if a second set of eyes looked at the books \u2014 and if auditors knew that such a review was going to happen. Opponents say it would raise costs while accomplishing nothing.An unintended consequence of the current process appears to be something close to providing a second set of eyes. As part of the asset quality review, national regulators have hired accounting firms to review loans and other assets at banks. A bank\u2019s auditor cannot receive that assignment, so this year at least two auditing firms will be looking at each bank\u2019s books. An audit is not the same thing as the E.C.B. review, having nothing like a stress test. But because both the audits being done now and the E.C.B. reviews are to be based on year-end 2013 numbers, it will be easy to determine whether bank audit clients of particular firms are more likely than others to be forced by the E.C.B. to raise additional capital.Conceivably, that could cause auditors to be more conservative this year than they have been in previous years. Add that pressure to the general worry about the E.C.B. reviews, and the result may be a lot of red ink in bank financial statements that are released in the next month.Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

The developers are counting on their ability to draw tourists and residents from the city, bringing jobs and revenue to an economically depressed region.\u201cAs a major Sullivan County landowner, we are very excited about the prospect of bringing the Adelaar vision to life,\u201d said David Brain, chief executive of EPR Properties. \u201cThis new world-class destination resort will deliver significant economic benefits for local businesses, create dependable employment and have a positive impact on tourism.\u201dWith the state expected to begin soliciting proposals at the end of the month, Empire and EPR are hoping to solidify their position as a front-runner for a casino license, in part because they have deep pockets and the ability to begin construction quickly.\u201cIt was our intent to help upstate counties that had high unemployment and low median income,\u201d said State Senator J. John Bonacic, a Republican from the Hudson Valley who helped write the legislation legalizing full-scale casinos. \u201cI don\u2019t think Orange County fits into that category.\u201dNew York State voters approved the legislation in a referendum last year.At least a dozen developers have issued at least sketchy plans for casino resorts in the Catskills and several other regions. But the number of contenders may fall significantly in the coming weeks, since applicants are required put up a $1 million nonrefundable fee and demonstrate the ability to build their project quickly. The State Gaming Commission\u2019s site-selection committee is expected to choose winners in the fall.The competition to build a casino resort is sharpest in the Catskills, where there has long been political support for gambling. There have been efforts to use gambling to revive that region\u2019s economy since the 1970s.In recent years, Empire struck a deal with EPR Properties, a publicly traded real estate company that owns the Camelback Mountain Resort in Pennsylvania, to build a resort on the grounds of the old Concord complex. The companies had planned to move the track and the slot machines to the Concord property. But their latest proposal, now that full-scale casino gambling is permitted, envisions a casino-hotel with 2,150 slot machines and 32 tables for blackjack, roulette and other games.Empire and EPR have brought in Hart Howerton to plan the Adelaar resort; Rees Jones, the golf course designer, to reconfigure the Concord\u2019s Monster golf course; and the Aquatic Development Group to design and build the water park. Plans call for several hotels, a snow tube run, zip lines and a mountain coaster.Also, Triple 5, the company that operates Mall of America in Minnesota, is set to resume construction of a long dormant $1.9 billion shopping and entertainment mall in the New Jersey Meadowlands, five miles west of Manhattan.Triple 5 is calling the project American Dream and plans to add indoor sky-diving, a major indoor water park, a giant Ferris wheel and a 14.7 acre amusement park in conjunction with DreamWorks Animation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "James R. Schlesinger, Willful Aide to Three Presidents, Is Dead at 85", "Date": "2014-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJames R. Schlesinger, a tough Cold War strategist who served as secretary of defense under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford and became the nation\u2019s first secretary of energy under President Jimmy Carter, died on Thursday in Baltimore. He was 85.His death, at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, was confirmed by his daughter Ann Schlesinger, who said the cause was complications of pneumonia. He lived in Arlington, Va.A brilliant, often abrasive Harvard-educated economist, Mr. Schlesinger went to Washington in 1969 as an obscure White House budget official. Over the next decade he became chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, director of Central Intelligence, a cabinet officer for three presidents (two of whom fired him), a thorn to congressional leaders and a controversial national public figure.His tenure at the Pentagon was little more than two years, from 1973 to 1975, but it was a time of turmoil and transition. Soviet nuclear power was rising menacingly. The war in Vietnam was in its final throes, and United States military prestige and morale had sunk to new lows. Congress was wielding an ax on a $90 billion defense budget. And the Watergate scandal was enveloping the White House.In the days leading up to Nixon\u2019s resignation in August 1974, Mr. Schlesinger, as he confirmed years later, became so worried that Nixon was unstable that he instructed the military not to react to White House orders, particularly on nuclear arms, unless cleared by him or Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. He also drew up plans to deploy troops in Washington in the event of any problems with a peaceful presidential succession.Mr. Schlesinger, a Republican with impressive national security and nuclear power credentials, took a hard line with Congress, and the Kremlin, demanding increased budgets for defense and insisting that America\u2019s security depended on nuclear and conventional arsenals at least as effective as the Soviet Union\u2019s.With Europe as a potential focal point for war, he urged stronger North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces to counter Soviet allies in the Warsaw Pact. His nuclear strategy envisioned retaliatory strikes on Soviet military targets, but not population centers, to limit the chances of what he called \u201cuncontrolled escalation\u201d and mutual \u201cassured destruction.\u201dAfter succeeding Nixon, Ford, for stability, retained the cabinet, including Mr. Schlesinger. But the president and Mr. Schlesinger were soon at loggerheads. Ford favored \u201cleniency\u201d for 50,000 draft evaders after the Vietnam War. Mr. Schlesinger, like Nixon, had opposed amnesty. Unlike Mr. Schlesinger, Ford was willing to compromise on defense budgets, and he recoiled at Mr. Schlesinger\u2019s harsh criticisms of congressional leaders. These were not grave policy disputes, but the two were personally incompatible.\u201cThere was a tension,\u201d Mr. Ford acknowledged later.Mr. Schlesinger\u2019s blunt talk and uncompromising ways seemed insubordinate to Ford, and struck many White House officials as arrogant and patronizing. Besides his prickly relations with the president, Mr. Schlesinger differed with Mr. Kissinger over nuclear strategy, aid to Israel and other issues. In November 1975, after 28 months in office, he was dismissed.While often criticized by political opponents and in the press, Mr. Schlesinger was viewed by many historians as an able defense secretary who modernized weapons systems and maintained America\u2019s military stature against rising Soviet competition.In his 1976 presidential campaign, Mr. Carter consulted Mr. Schlesinger and was impressed. Taking the White House in 1977, Mr. Carter named him his energy adviser and, after the Energy Department was created in a merger of 50 agencies, appointed him its first secretary. The only Republican in the Carter cabinet, he was in charge of 20,000 employees and a $10 billion budget.Mr. Schlesinger, an outspoken advocate of nuclear power, shared with Mr. Carter a belief that fossil fuels were destined for exhaustion, and warned that Arab oil supplies were unreliable. As oil prices rose and acute shortages and long lines at gasoline pumps formed, he and Mr. Carter endorsed conservation, tax incentives and synthetic fuels. The crisis passed, but not the energy problems.While he helped establish the new department and developed proposals intended to alter life in a nation addicted to enormous energy consumption, Mr. Schlesinger\u2019s performance was widely criticized. Congressional opposition contributed to his departure in a 1979 cabinet shake-up by President Carter.\u201cIn that administration, for some strange reason, I was the voice of experience, or the only voice of experience,\u201d Mr. Schlesinger said years later for an oral history project. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether that was a good thing or a bad thing. It was a mixed virtue, because that meant that in some sense I shared the contamination of the past and therefore my views, while they were interesting, and useful, had to be viewed with suspicion because they were views from the pre-1976 past.\u201dMr. Schlesinger resumed writing and speaking, served on commissions and advisory panels, testified before Congress and became a businessman and a perennial consultant to presidents. He led inquiries into the safekeeping of nuclear weapons, the abuse of detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, prisoner interrogations at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and other issues.\u201cThere was sadism on the night shift at Abu Ghraib, sadism that was certainly not authorized,\u201d he said in announcing the findings of Abu Ghraib inquiry in 2004. \u201cIt was kind of \u2018Animal House\u2019 on the night shift.\u201dJames Rodney Schlesinger was born in New York City on Feb. 15, 1929, the son of Julius and Rhea Schlesinger, immigrants from Austria and Russia respectively. He was raised in a Jewish household but became a Lutheran as an adult. He attended Horace Mann School in the Bronx and Harvard, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1950, a master\u2019s in 1952 and a doctorate in 1956, all in economics.In 1954 he married Rachel Mellinger, a Radcliffe student. Mrs. Schlesinger died in 1995. Mr. Schlesinger is survived by his sons Charles, William, Thomas and James Jr.; his daughters, Cora, Ann, Emily and Clara; and 11 grandchildren.From 1955 to 1963, Mr. Schlesinger taught economics at the University of Virginia. His 1960 book, \u201cThe Political Economy of National Security,\u201d drew attention at the RAND Corporation, which hired him in 1963. He became director of strategic studies there in 1967.Mr. Schlesinger joined the Nixon administration in 1969 as assistant director of the Bureau of the Budget, and drew the president\u2019s attention by challenging a Pentagon weapons proposal in his presence.In 1971, Nixon named him chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, formed after World War II to promote nuclear energy. Over time, critics said, the commission fell under the industry\u2019s sway. Mr. Schlesinger favored atomic power, but said it raised legitimate environmental concerns. He ordered overhauls, including a new division of environmental and safety affairs, and set the commission on a course to \u201cserve the public interest.\u201dIn February 1973, Mr. Schlesinger was named director of Central Intelligence, succeeding Richard Helms, who had been fired by Nixon for refusing to block the Watergate investigation. His five-month C.I.A. tenure was stormy. He was appalled to learn that agents prohibited from spying on Americans had carried out domestic break-ins for the White House. He purged 1,000 of 17,000 employees and ordered a sweeping investigation into past operations.That investigation eventually turned up evidence of widespread illegality. (The findings were not made public until 2007, and then were heavily censored.) But the inquiry had barely begun when, in July 1973, Nixon chose Mr. Schlesinger for the Pentagon job, replacing Elliot Richardson, who became attorney general.In recent years he was a trustee of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington research organization, and chairman of the Mitre Corporation. He wrote no autobiography, but synthesized much of his experience in a 1989 book, \u201cAmerica at Century\u2019s End.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misspelled the given name of James R. Schlesinger\u2019s predecessor as secretary of defense. He was Elliot Richardson, not Eliot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Team Debates How to Punish Russia", "Date": "2014-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As President Obama searches for a way to contain and ultimately reverse Russia\u2019s invasion of southern Ukraine without using force, his team finds itself torn over just how far to go using the economic weapons in America\u2019s arsenal.Administration officials have concluded that they have the means through sanctions to badly damage the Russian economy, and some officials think they should use that power sooner rather than later if President Vladimir V. Putin refuses to surrender control of Crimea and proceeds to annex it.But others in the administration, particularly economic officials, are wary of especially ruinous options that they argue could alienate allies as well as provoke a dangerous cycle of retaliation. The White House is under intense pressure from major American companies that do not want to lose business to competitors because of unilateral sanctions or to risk retribution from the Kremlin.Mr. Obama, who will host Ukraine\u2019s new prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, at the White House on Wednesday in a show of solidarity, has so far held off imposing measures with any financial bite, in part to give diplomacy a chance. While he has canceled trade talks and military cooperation, his only move on sanctions has been to ban visas for fewer than a dozen Russian and Ukrainian figures deemed responsible for undermining Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty.By all accounts, Mr. Obama has the power to go much further even without new legislation from Congress, which nonetheless is advancing competing bills to punish Russia. He signed an executive order last week authorizing not just additional visa bans but also asset freezes and other financial moves. But he did not actually invoke it against any targets, preserving what he called \u201cthe flexibility to adjust our response going forward based on Russia\u2019s actions.\u201dAdministration officials said the internal debate was not whether to penalize Russia for its actions \u2014 there is broad consensus for that, one that hardens with each passing day \u2014 but when, and how hard. Beyond freezing assets of individuals, the administration could sanction banks and potentially cut the country off from the dollar economy.\u201cThere are people who are cautious about going too far too quickly, and there are those who want the president to show resolve,\u201d said a former administration official in touch with the White House.According to current and former officials, those most supportive of strong action include officials closest to the situation in Ukraine: Victoria J. Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for the region, and Geoffrey R. Pyatt, the ambassador to the country, as well as Daniel Fried, the State Department coordinator of sanctions. Those more wary about crippling the Russian economy include Jack Lew, the Treasury secretary; Michael Froman, the president\u2019s trade representative; and Caroline Atkinson, the president\u2019s international economics adviser.The immediate question is whether to take action before Sunday\u2019s referendum in Crimea in hopes of forestalling it or instead to wait and see what Moscow does after it is over. The issue is further complicated by the fact that financial sanctions take time to prepare. While the United States has broad latitude to bar foreigners from traveling here, the government needs to build an evidentiary case that could withstand possible court challenge when it freezes assets.The administration\u2019s handling of the issue has been improvisational. Its decision to impose the visa bans last Thursday came as a surprise to some European diplomats in Washington who interpreted it as an attempt to stiffen the resolve of their governments during a meeting that day in Brussels. European officials met again in London on Tuesday to talk about possible sanctions.In Washington, European officials emphasized privately that there was no daylight between them and the United States; German officials argued that economics were not driving their approach because even though Germany relies on Russia for a third of its natural gas, its storage tanks are full.In rallying support, Mr. Obama in recent days has made calls to beyond the usual big allies, speaking with the leaders of Spain and Kazakhstan. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called the leader of Cyprus, where a lot of Russian tycoons and companies keep their money.American officials said there would be more unanimity if Russia escalated the crisis by following through with annexation or moving further into Ukraine. Officials are increasingly worried because the Crimean Peninsula, with no land connection to Russia, depends on Ukraine for water, electricity and other energy, which means Moscow might decide to seize more Ukrainian territory to supply the enclave.\u201cIf they actually annex, if a Russian tricolor goes up, this is a whole new ballgame,\u201d said Strobe Talbott, president of the Brookings Institution and a former deputy secretary of state who has written several books on Russia. \u201cPutin is the game changer, and he\u2019s got to be tagged out in some fashion. Cautious baby steps, they just won\u2019t work.\u201dBut American businesses are warning against overreaction. Representatives of groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the United States-Russia Business Council have been holding meetings at the White House or in Congress to share their views.They are urging policy makers to be sure that any sanctions would actually have an impact on Russian behavior, that the costs not outweigh the benefits and that they be multilateral. \u201cWe are working closely with policy makers on both sides of the aisle to safeguard manufacturing employees and manufacturers\u2019 investments around the world,\u201d said Jay Timmons, president of the manufacturers association.Although the United States does only $40 billion in trade with Russia each year, American businesses argue that the amount understates the real economic ties. Ford, for instance, has two assembly plants in Russia that make cars with material that comes from Europe, so that would not be reflected in import-export figures.Boeing has sold or leased hundreds of planes in Russia and projects that the republics of the former Soviet Union will need an additional 1,170 planes worth nearly $140 billion over the next 20 years. Moreover, the company has a design center in Moscow, has just announced new manufacturing and training facilities in Russia and depends on Russia for 35 percent of its titanium.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that key economic groups, especially energy, don\u2019t want us to act,\u201d said James B. Steinberg, a former deputy secretary of state under Mr. Obama and now dean of the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University.Mr. Steinberg, who also served in President Bill Clinton\u2019s White House in the 1990s, recalled that as the administration pressured Iran over its nuclear program, it cut off a major American firm, Conoco, from business there despite the cost to the company. \u201cFor that very reason, it was critical to our credibility to act, even unilaterally if necessary, to the disadvantage of our companies,\u201d he said.The challenge for the administration is trying to anticipate Mr. Putin\u2019s next move. John O. Brennan, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said Mr. Putin was laying the groundwork for possible action in eastern Ukraine by citing concerns for the safety of Russian speakers there.\u201cHas he made a decision?\u201d Mr. Brennan said Tuesday to the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cWell, I guess only Putin knows if he has made that final decision. But what we\u2019ve tried to do is identify what would be the reasons and how he might make those moves; what are the factors that he will take into account, and what are the costs that he is willing to incur if he decides to move across the border.\u201dEric Schmitt contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With $21 Billion Loss, Italian Bank Signals Wider Vulnerabilities", "Date": "2014-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItaly\u2019s biggest bank reported a huge loss on Tuesday, foreshadowing the possibility that many financial institutions across Europe could be forced to acknowledge the full extent of their own problems under increased regulatory scrutiny.The unexpectedly large fourth-quarter loss of 15 billion euros, or about $21 billion, posted by the Italian bank UniCredit, which is based in Milan, was announced just hours after the European Central Bank disclosed details of its plan to dig deeper into the books of banks operating across Europe.The timing of UniCredit\u2019s announcement appeared to be coincidental, but it highlighted the vulnerabilities still lurking within the balance sheets of many institutions more than five years after the financial crisis led to a recession from which Europe and its banks have still not fully emerged.The central bank, newly empowered to oversee euro zone banks, plans to finish its review of institutions under its jurisdiction by October. Analysts say they expect more banks to write down the value of their bad loans and other troubled assets in coming months.Mario Draghi, the central bank\u2019s president, and other top euro zone officials have warned that some banks may be declared insolvent and forced out of business. Italy\u2019s banking industry in particular is thought to have many cases that could be problematic, as the politically unsettled country continues to labor with chronically slow growth and entrenched special interests that have impeded efforts to overhaul its economy. But even more stable and economically potent countries like Germany are thought to have banks with deep-seated problems.The specter of heightened European Central Bank scrutiny, in contrast to sometimes lax oversight by national regulators in the past, has set internal auditors at euro zone banks scrambling to try to put their books in order, according to consultants and regulators. Like UniCredit, at least some of these banks are expected to own up to problems and take corrective action before the central bank requires them to do so.If so, the long-slumbering euro zone economy could only benefit. After the financial collapse of 2008, the United States required an overhaul of its banks the following year, which is one reason the American the economy has recovered more quickly. The lack of a comparably rigorous bank cleanup in Europe has hobbled growth by causing a dearth of lending to consumers and crimping credit to businesses.In some countries, regulators were overly protective of their own banks and allowed them to avoid dealing with bad loans or other problems. As a result, many banks were too weak to lend, creating a credit squeeze that is particularly acute in countries like Italy. In addition, there was no system to shut down sick banks in an orderly way that did not require a bailout by taxpayers. In Ireland, for example, the cost of bank rescues helped cripple the economy.\u201cIt\u2019s about time Europe caught up and got on the same level as the U.S. in terms of bank regulation,\u201d said Alem Husain, a European bank analyst at SNL Financial, a research company in Charlottesville, Va. At the same time, though, shocks could be in store as new vulnerabilities in the European banking system come to light. Many lenders in Europe are struggling, including Austrian banks exposed to Ukraine or Russia, other Italian banks like Monte dei Paschi di Siena and German banks with holdings in the depressed shipping industry.The European Central Bank said on Tuesday that it would release in October the results of a review intended to make sure that banks are properly valuing assets like real estate or government bonds in their portfolios, and that they are setting aside enough money to cover possible losses. The review will examine assets that the banks, so far, have valued at \u20ac3.72 trillion. That is nearly 60 percent of the assets held by the 128 large banks subject to scrutiny, the central bank said.Although UniCredit\u2019s loss was a shock, investors seemed to applaud the bank\u2019s courage in exposing the scale of its problems. After initially falling, shares in UniCredit rose almost 7 percent on Tuesday. The bank said it expected to make a profit of about \u20ac2 billion this year and announced a five-year turnaround plan that aims to more than triple profit by 2018.Federico Ghizzoni, chief executive of UniCredit, said on Tuesday that it was encouraged by recent signs of an economic revival in Italy and the euro zone. Mr. Ghizzoni called 2013 a turning point for the bank. UniCredit also has major holdings in Eastern Europe as well as Germany and Austria. \u201cWe see some recovery coming,\u201d he said in a conference call with analysts. \u201cIt makes sense to present a plan if you see some stabilization.\u201dUniCredit booked a \u20ac9.3 billion loss from a revaluing of its holdings in Italy, Austria and Eastern Europe, while it set aside an additional \u20ac7.2 billion to cover losses from problem loans. Loan loss provisions now total \u20ac9.3 billion, the bank said. The losses were partly offset by operating profit that UniCredit put at \u20ac2.1 billion. Some analysts questioned the bank\u2019s decision to book a \u20ac1.4 billion gain from its stake in the Bank of Italy, the central bank. Without that gain, the loss would have been even greater.While the European Central Bank did not offer any major surprises on Tuesday regarding its review of the banking system, it did give lenders more details about what kind of scrutiny to expect and underscored its determination to do a thorough job to restore trust in the sector. In October, the central bank, with national bank regulators in the 18 countries of the euro zone, will disclose the results of stress tests to measure whether banks can withstand shocks like a financial crisis or recession.Banks found to have problems will be required to take remedial action, like raising more capital or even closing. It is also possible that banks will be required to act sooner, if regulators discover hidden problems during the review. Banks could also be compelled to restate their financial results if regulators decide that the lenders have not properly valued their portfolios.In Brussels this week, European finance ministers moved closer to setting up a system for closing terminally ill banks without creating a financial crisis. The Economic and Financial Affairs Council, which is made up of the finance ministers and central bank officials from the 28 member nations of the European Union, met on Tuesday to discuss the final shape of the banking resolution authority, the Single Resolution Mechanism, that ministers agreed last December to create.The Single Resolution Mechanism is meant to help end the links between banks and sovereign states that contributed to the euro crisis. The mechanism will eventually have a \u20ac55 billion war chest. But the system is subject to the approval of the European Parliament and has been delayed by debates including how much say member states will have in any decision to close big banks. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Netherlands\u2019 finance minister, who speaks on behalf of the finance ministers for the 18 euro zone countries, expressed optimism on Monday night that a deal would be reached this week.On Tuesday, Yannis Stournaras, Greece\u2019s finance minister, said the Economic and Financial Affairs Council had agreed on a common position and that he and Mr. Dijsselbloem would present on Wednesday in Strasbourg, France, where the European Parliament has its main seat. Mr. Stournaris declined to lay out the details of the proposal, saying only that if he did not believe a compromise was possible, \u201cI would not go to Strasbourg.\u201dDavid Jolly contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Foes of America in Russia Crave Rupture in Ties", "Date": "2014-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 As Russia and the United States drift toward a rupture over Crimea, the Stalinist writer Aleksandr A. Prokhanov feels that his moment has finally arrived.\u201cI am afraid that I am interested in a cold war with the West,\u201d said Mr. Prokhanov, 76, in a lull between interviews on state-controlled television and radio. \u201cI was very patient. I waited for 20 years. I did everything I could so that this war would begin. I worked day and night.\u201dMr. Prokhanov is an attack dog whose career has risen, fallen and risen again with the fortunes of hard-liners in the Kremlin. And it is a measure of the conservative pivot that has taken place in Moscow in Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s third presidential term that Mr. Prokhanov and a cadre of like-minded thinkers \u2014 a kind of \u201cwho\u2019s who of conspiratorial anti-Americanism,\u201d as one scholar put it \u2014 have found themselves thrust into the mainstream.For centuries, Russian history has been driven by a struggle between ideas, as reformers and revanchists wrestled over the country\u2019s future. Mr. Putin keeps a distance from the ideological entrepreneurs clustered around the Kremlin, leaving his influences a matter of speculation.But it became clear last week, as the United States threatened to cut off Russian corporations from the Western financial system, that influential members of the president\u2019s inner circle view isolation from the West as a good thing for Russia, the strain of thought advanced by Mr. Prokhanov and his fellow travelers. Some in Mr. Putin\u2019s camp see the confrontation as an opportunity to make the diplomatic turn toward China that they have long advocated, said Sergei A. Karaganov, a dean of the faculty of international relations at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow.\u201cThis whole episode is going to change the rules of the game,\u201d Mr. Karaganov said of Crimea, which is holding a referendum on secession on Sunday. \u201cConfrontation with the West is welcomed by all too many here, to cleanse the elite, to organize the nation.\u201dWhen he took power in Russia, Mr. Putin seemed intent on balancing the voices of strong-state nationalists and promarket liberals, among them the tycoons entrusted with Russia\u2019s corporate empires. That balance flew out the window in 2012, and with the Crimean crisis the space for liberal dissent has been melting away, a process that accelerated Thursday when the Russian authorities blocked websites used by prominent opposition figures.Mr. Prokhanov, for one, was flush with victory. His dingy office and tiny, extremist newspaper belie ties to Russia\u2019s security services, which have long employed \u201cagitators\u201d to whip up support for their initiatives. His writing about the invasion of Afghanistan earned him the nickname \u201cnightingale of the General Staff.\u201d In 1991, he co-wrote the manifesto that was published to support an attempted coup by hard-line Communists who were opposed to Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s reforms.His views have been more or less consistent for years: that the Soviet Union should be restored, by force if necessary; that America \u201cconsumes country after country\u201d and must be prevented from devouring Russia. As recently as 2003, his newspaper received a government warning for publishing material deemed \u201cextremist.\u201d But Mr. Putin\u2019s recent return to the presidency, he said, has been accompanied by \u201ca strong ideological mutation.\u201dMr. Prokhanov, who speaks in rich, metaphorical Russian and has the slightly disheveled look of a beat poet, contrasted the present government with that of Boris Yeltsin, the president in the 1990s. \u201cIn Yeltsin\u2019s time I was seen as a monster by the regime, a character out of hell,\u201d he said. \u201cI was under threat of arrest, and now I am regularly invited to Kremlin events.\u201d Though he said he had met the president only a handful of times, \u201cThe intelligence officers around him pay much more attention to ideology, and for them it is clear that ideological war is an important instrument.\u201dIf Mr. Putin himself decided to make an ideological change, Mr. Prokhanov said, it was in December 2011, when tens of thousands of urban liberals, angry over ballot-stuffing and falsification in parliamentary elections, massed on a city square, Bolotnaya, chanting, \u201cPutin is a thief!\u201d and \u201cRussia Without Putin.\u201d\u201cDuring the time of Bolotnaya, he experienced fear,\u201d Mr. Prokhanov said. \u201cHe felt that the whole class which he had created had betrayed him, cheated him, and he had a desire to replace one class with another. From the moment you got back from that march, we started a change of the Russian elite.\u201dAnother person who has been swept into the mainstream is one of Mr. Prokhanov\u2019s former prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Aleksandr G. Dugin, who, in the late 1990s, called for \u201cthe blinding dawn of a new Russian Revolution, fascism \u2014 borderless as our lands, and red as our blood.\u201dVirulently anti-American, Mr. Dugin has urged a \u201cconservative revolution\u201d that combines left-wing economics and right-wing cultural traditionalism. In a 1997 book, he introduced the idea of building a Eurasian empire \u201cconstructed on the fundamental principle of the common enemy,\u201d which he identified as Atlanticism, liberal values, and geopolitical control by the United States. Building a Eurasian economic bloc, including Ukraine, became a central goal for Mr. Putin upon his return to the presidency. His point man on the project was the economist Sergei Glazyev, an associate of Mr. Prokhanov\u2019s and Mr. Dugin\u2019s.In an interview, Mr. Dugin was evasive when asked about his personal contact with Mr. Putin, saying only that he had been \u201cin close contact with the Kremlin, and with those in the Kremlin who make decisions,\u201d for the last 15 years. But he said the president, whom he described as a Henry Kissinger-style \u201cpragmatist,\u201d had embraced a version of his ideology because it served his interests domestically.\u201cIt is popular, it is populist, it helps to explain all the processes which are going on in the country, and gradually \u2014 just by the logic of things, pragmatically, he becomes closer and closer to this ideology, just by the logic of events,\u201d he said. He also offered a more human reason: that Mr. Putin had been stung by Western leaders\u2019 apparent preference for his predecessor, Dmitri A. Medvedev, and then by the antigovernment protests that he believed were backed by the West.Though a number of high-ranking officials around Mr. Putin have argued strenuously against this ideological shift, Mr. Dugin said that their influence had been waning steadily, and that the Crimean crisis left them no option but to \u201cbe quiet, or gather up their suitcases and leave Russia.\u201d\u201cAnti-Americanism has become the main ideology, the main worldview among Russians,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, after Crimea, we have passed the point of no return. There will not be another Medvedev. There will never be another \u2018reset,\u2019 ever.\u201dIdeological mouthpieces have been used to send signals since the Soviet days \u2014 as a warning to adversaries or domestic dissenters \u2014 and it would be foolish to assume that Mr. Putin subscribes to their views. But there are important stakeholders who, faced with the threat of sanctions last week, have advocated that Russia cut itself off from the West. The most obvious among them is Vladimir I. Yakunin, president of Russian Railways and one of Mr. Putin\u2019s trusted friends, who in a recent interview with The Financial Times described the struggle against a \u201cglobal financial oligarchy\u201d and the \u201cglobal domination that is being carried out by the U.S.\u201d On Tuesday, Mr. Yakunin presented plans for a Soviet-style megaproject to develop transportation and infrastructure in Siberia, a move toward \u201can economics of a spiritual type,\u201d he said, that would insulate Russia from the West\u2019s alien values.He compared the project to monumental endeavors from the past: the adoption of Christianity in ancient Rus; the conquest of Siberia; electrification of the Soviet Union; the Soviet space program; and the Olympics in Sochi.A shift in planning to Siberia, Mr. Karaganov said, \u201chas already been proclaimed, and is happening,\u201d in part to weaken the Western influence on Russia\u2019s elites, who are seen as \u201ctoo dependent on their holdings in the West.\u201dDimitri K. Simes, president of the Center for the National Interest, said he saw the rise of people \u201cwho have very different views about the Russian economy.\u201d \u201cHard-line people, more nationalist people, they are being energized, they think this may be their moment,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can also say that this is the tip of the iceberg. These are people who are more visible, more obvious, but there is a lot behind them that is potentially more serious and more ominous.\u201dSomini Sengupta contributed reporting from the United Nations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.M. Saw Cobalt as Its Entry Into a Better Small-Car Market ", "Date": "2014-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the Chevrolet Cobalt, now at the center of a recall of 1.6 million cars, was being engineered more than a decade ago, executives at General Motors saw it as the beginning of a new era at the automaker.The 2005 Cobalt, they said, would not only replace the aging and undistinguished Chevrolet Cavalier, but it would also prove that G.M.\u2019s engineering and manufacturing skills had matured to the point that \u2014 like the Japanese automakers \u2014 it could build a world-class small car.But it was a matter of pride, said Bruce M. Belzowski, the director for automotive analysis at the Transportation Research Institute at the University of Michigan.\u201cIn terms of reputation, how can you be the major manufacturer in the U.S. and not have a competitive vehicle in that segment?\u201d he said. \u201cTo always be behind the Corolla and the Civic is kind of embarrassing.\u201dThe automaker also needed to sell a lot of small cars to help it meet the federal government\u2019s fuel economy standards, Mr. Belzowski said.It was late in 2002 that Lori Queen, who was then in charge of G.M.\u2019s small cars, got a mandate from Bob Lutz, who was chairman of G.M. North America: Make the Cobalt a world-class small car. The mechanical underpinnings for the Cobalt were developed in Europe. Its first use in the United States was for the 2003 Saturn Ion, which got unenthusiastic reviews from automotive journalists, citing a lack of finesse and mediocre handling.But suddenly G.M. was willing to spend more money, although the Cobalt would have one crucial and fatal part from the Ion carried over: the ignition switch that could allow the engine to be turned off by accident if the key ring was too heavy, if the vehicle was jolted by something like a pothole or if the driver\u2019s leg hit the key.Instead of aiming at domestic small cars like the Ford Focus, the G.M. engineers started figuring out how they could compete with what they saw as more sophisticated small cars like the Corolla and Civic.Mr. Lutz also promised more money: About $200 more per car, Ms. Queen said.That was a huge increase, Mr. Cole said: \u201cYou worry about pennies a vehicle. You get to 100-plus dollars it is extremely important.\u201dIt also made the Cobalt the most expensive small car G.M. produced, Mr. Lutz told reporters when the Cobalt was introduced in 2004.That money allowed nicer materials inside and \u201cquiet steel\u201d that has a sound-deadening material between two sheets of steel to reduce noise and vibration, the Cobalt\u2019s chief engineer, Doug Parks, told reporters.G.M. was in its chronic struggle to prove its viability and competence as an automaker, and the Cobalt was becoming a test on a worldwide stage.General Motors spent about $1 billion to upgrade the assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, where the Cavalier was being phased out and the Cobalt would be built. Worried about the plant being closed, the United Automobile Workers also agreed to using the automaker\u2019s Global Manufacturing System, which borrowed manufacturing strategies from automakers like Toyota and Honda.The Cobalt went on sale late in 2004 and generally received favorable reviews, although it was not seen as the benchmark that Mr. Lutz yearned for.In an April 2005 review, Car and Driver magazine said the Cobalt proved \u201cthat when G.M. decides to build an accomplished small car, it can.\u201dBut the Cobalt was entering an increasingly vicious market, with competitors like the Korean automaker Hyundai finally fielding more competitive vehicles, Mr. Cole said.Over all, the Cobalt\u2019s sales did not match those of the Cavalier. Sales generally hovered around 200,000 to 213,000 a year and the Cobalt never came close to challenging the Civic or Corolla. Each typically sold at least 100,000 more vehicles annually.The Cobalt\u2019s reliability fell far short of the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, according to data collected by Consumer Reports magazine.In a 2005 review in The New York Times, Jeff Sabatini wrote, \u201cThe Cobalt is a good car, if not a great one, and it is certainly a creditable competitor to the Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic and most other $15,000 cars on the market.\u201dThe Cobalt, he noted, \u201chints at a brighter future\u201d for General Motors.Ms. Queen, who headed up G.M.\u2019s small car development, retired in 2009. She recently declined to discuss the Cobalt.Mr. Parks, who was the chief engineer for Cobalt, is now G.M.\u2019s vice president for global program management. Mr. Parks was not available for interviews, Greg Martin, a G.M. spokesman, said.For G.M., the Cobalt was a test on a worldwide stage. At the time, Ms. Queen knew the risk of such aspirations.\u201cAll eyes are on this car,\u201d she told The Plain Dealer. \u201cWe can\u2019t have a false move.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Libyan Militia Selling Oil, Defying the Government", "Date": "2014-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 A militia group that has blockaded Libya\u2019s main oil ports for more than six months began on Saturday to sell the oil for its own accounts as the weak transitional government appeared powerless to stop it.The first unauthorized export of the oil \u2014 the lifeblood of Libya\u2019s government and economy \u2014 may be the most ominous indication yet that the nation is at risk of coming apart at the seams.Until now, officials of the central government had played down the impact of the blockades by arguing that the militia was not stealing or wasting the oil, only holding it back for sale by the government at a later date.The militia leader who closed the ports, Ibrahim Jathran, a charismatic 33-year-old with close ties to Eastern Libyan tribes, has maintained that he was closing the ports not for personal profit, but to press the central government to crack down on oil-sector corruption and provide more resources to the long-neglected east.In the chaos that has followed the overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi three years ago, control of the country\u2019s oil revenue was always presumed to be the greatest leverage in the hands of the fledgling government in Tripoli. Its leaders hoped to trade shares of oil revenue for the loyalty of fractious tribes and regions, and the shared patrimony of Libya\u2019s oil wealth could bind the country together.But those hopes and Tripoli\u2019s power were upended Saturday when a tanker called the Morning Glory ignored the furious warnings of the central government and arrived at the major oil port of Es Seder to begin filling up with the first unauthorized shipment of oil.Ownership of the ship was unclear, though it was flagged under North Korea. \u201cThe tanker will be bombed if it doesn\u2019t follow orders when leaving,\u201d Mr. Zeidan said. \u201cThis will be an environmental disaster.\u201dBut he also acknowledged that the military had already refused his orders to block the ship\u2019s arrival. \u201cThe chief of staff was asked to deal with that and did not,\u201d Mr. Zeidan said. \u201cWe took over a weak state and we were not helped to strengthen it. Everybody was working against us.\u201dGeoff Porter, an analyst who advises oil companies and others, called Mr. Zeidan\u2019s threats \u201cnonsense.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t even saber rattling \u2014 Zeidan\u2019s scabbard is empty,\u201d Mr. Porter said, adding, \u201cand Jathran likely knows it.\u201dThe Eastern blockade has already helped drain the government\u2019s revenues, contributing to severe blackouts and lines for gasoline in the capital.In another televised news conference, a regional leader speaking for the militia that controls the ports said it had lost patience with the transitional government. In Cyrenaica, the Eastern province, \u201cWe do not get any attention,\u201d said Abd-Rabbo al-Barassi, leader of a self-proclaimed regional authority that is pushing for a highly federalized system.Mr. Barassi said the group was exporting the oil \u201cin broad daylight,\u201d not stealing it. \u201cWe would like to assure all of our fellow Libyans that we are still standing by our pledge to preserve the wealth of Libyans,\u201d including setting aside shares of the proceeds for the two other provinces, to the south and the west.But he said that the group would distribute the revenue under a formula stipulated by a 1958 law passed under the former Eastern-based monarchy, that gave the East the biggest cut because it contained the most oil.Suliman Ali Zway contributed reporting from Benghazi.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Prime Russian Trading Partner, Germany Appears Crucial to Ending Crisis", "Date": "2014-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisIn the face of the diplomatic maneuvering over how to confront a bellicose Russia in Ukraine, one country appears to hold the key to any long-lasting entente: Germany, Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse and one of Russia\u2019s primary trading partners.Whether it is importing fuel from Gazprom or selling Mercedes-Benz to billionaire oligarchs, trade with Russia has played an important role in Germany\u2019s emergence as an economic superpower over the last decade. Germany is now heavily reliant on Russia for its energy needs, importing more natural gas from Russia than any other country in Europe.But Germany\u2019s enhanced status on the world stage \u2014 combined with the end of the commodity boom and the onset of economic stagnation in Russia \u2014 has also shifted the balance of power. Some analysts argue that it is Russia that has the most to lose if economic sanctions are ever imposed.This dynamic could offer insight into the role that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will play in any negotiations with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.So far, German diplomats have tacked away from a plan, pushed by the United States, to impose sweeping sanctions and remove Russia from the Group of 8 developed economic nations. Instead, the German chancellor has called for a more diplomatic solution, preferring more limited actions like many of her European counterparts.But Ms. Merkel, a champion of closer ties between Ukraine and the European Union, has also shown a willingness to take a hard line with Mr. Putin. In recent months, Ms. Merkel has been particularly forceful on human rights issues. For example, she played a crucial part in the release of the jailed oil executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. \u201cThe German attitude toward Russia has changed in a very substantial way,\u201d said Anders Aslund, an economics expert on Russia, Ukraine and Europe at the Peterson Institute in Washington. \u201cThe tables have been turned.\u201dTen years ago, Mr. Aslund points out, it was Russia that was in ascendance, as high energy prices, robust economic growth and political stability made the country a darling for foreign investors. By comparison, the German economy was seen as dull and less than competitive.Now, Germany has a current-account surplus that amounts to 6 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 an important indicator of economic strength and competitiveness. And Russia is being lumped together with other struggling emerging countries and has witnessed a fast erosion of its once-sizable surplus.There are two sides to Germany\u2019s economic relationship with Russia: a reduced reliance on the country as an export market, countered by energy imports that remain strong.While companies like Mercedes and Volkswagen are significant exporters to Russia, over all it ranks 11th, behind Poland, as a market for German goods. In fact, many of Germany\u2019s top exporters have for years been focusing on China and other more dynamic markets in Asia.J\u00f6rg Howe, a spokesman for Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes, said that at the moment the company did not expect the crisis to affect sales of its cars. He described Russia as an important market, though not on the same scale as China, Germany or the United States.\u201cThe situation is so fluid and volatile and fast-changing it would be irresponsible to speculate,\u201d said Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of Daimler, speaking during a company event in Geneva. \u201cIt\u2019s far too early to make any comment.\u201dRussia has become a more difficult country for business during a time of increased financial and corporate scrutiny, making German companies less excited about investing in the country. Russia ranks near the bottom in global surveys that assess levels of corruption and how easy it is to do business, said Mr. Aslund.The worsening political situation with Ukraine has already hurt trade with Germany, which fell to 76.5 billion euros ($105 billion) in 2013 from 80.5 billion euros ($111 billion) in 2012.Still, some 6,000 German companies are active in Russia, and it is an important market for midsize companies like Martin Kannegiesser, a firm in Vlotho, Germany, that supplied industrial laundry equipment for the Sochi Olympics. And there is clearly concern that the conflict in Ukraine could further hurt trade, as the market jitters on Monday underscored. German stocks were off more than 3 percent for the day.From an economic perspective, Ukraine is much less important to Germany than vice versa. German foreign direct investment in Ukraine stands at about $6.3 billion, a relatively modest sum that still accounts for more than 10 percent of the total in Ukraine, according to the German Foreign Ministry. Germany is the second-largest foreign investor in Ukraine behind Cyprus, which is a transit point for Russian money.Still, Germany does not have the upper hand entirely in its relationship with Russia. About three-quarters of the gas and oil that Germany imported in 2013 came from Russia. The country also acts as a major gas transit hub for countries like France.If there was a long-term shutdown of Russian gas, Germany would not be the only country to suffer. Prices would increase and supplies would be squeezed for countries like Turkey and Italy that also rely on Russian energy imports.\u201cGermany in particular is dependent on Russian gas,\u201d said Trevor Sikorski, an analyst at the London research firm Energy Aspects. Still, analysts point out that as energy sources multiply and gas storage levels remain high in Europe, the prospect of a long-lasting energy crisis as a result of the recent turmoil seems fairly remote.This shift in status notwithstanding, Germany has taken pains to play an engaged and nuanced diplomatic role that reflects not just its economic heft in the region, but its ability to bridge the widening chasm between Russia and the United States. It is a sensitive balance for the country, which, unlike France, has tended not to take aggressive diplomatic stands on pressing global issues.But Germany\u2019s economic power is on the rise, lifted by export success in Asia and a calming of the debt crisis in the euro zone. So economists like Mr. Aslund say the next trick \u2014 and it is a challenging one \u2014 will be for Germany to leverage that influence into a lasting diplomatic agreement between Russia and Ukraine.Jack Ewing and Stanley Reed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Big Banks Fulfill Part of Mortgage Deal", "Date": "2014-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA fifth major mortgage servicer in the settlement, Residential Capital, had already met its obligations. More than 600,000 households received some form of mortgage relief.The bulk of the money in the settlement \u2014 intended to pre-empt an onslaught of lawsuits over the use of mass-produced and faulty documents in foreclosures \u2014 was to go directly to homeowners, primarily in debt relief. The banks also agreed to meet certain customer service standards meant to end the prolonged frustration on the part of many who sought help with burdensome mortgage terms.The report on Tuesday dealt only with the financial obligations. The banks were to provide $19 billion in relief; they were credited with $20.7 billion. More than half of that went to debt forgiveness on first mortgages and refinancing assistance to families who would not otherwise have been able to take advantage of lower interest rates. The average debt reduction on a first mortgage was $109,000.\u201cWhat the results show is that the settlement pretty well achieved what they set out to achieve,\u201d said the monitor, Joseph A. Smith Jr. Housing advocates and watchdogs have criticized the settlement for not placing enough emphasis on allowing families to stay in their homes and stabilizing hard-hit neighborhoods. Some of their critique is borne out in the report: the debt on a primary mortgage was forgiven for 95,000 homeowners, and 73,000 were allowed to refinance at lower interest rates when they would not have otherwise qualified to do so. Those two types of relief are most likely to keep families in their homes.That was low compared with the 220,000 that were relieved of second-lien debt and the 184,000 who were allowed to do a short sale or give up their homes to the bank. Still, families who felt marooned in their homes by the housing crash may have welcomed the ability to move away without penalty. By far, the largest gross dollar amounts in the settlement went to short sales and relinquishments, but under the terms of the settlement, that type of relief earned less \u201ccredit\u201d than debt forgiveness. The discrepancy is rooted in the settlement\u2019s attempt to avoid allowing the banks to satisfy its terms by doing things they would have done anyway. So forgiving mortgage debt, considered painful to the banks, earned as much as $1.25 on the dollar in credit, while expunging a delinquent home equity loan, which the bank was not getting paid for anyway, was worth 10 cents on the dollar.

{"Headline": "Fed Cuts Bond Buying by Another $10 Billion", "Date": "2014-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve further curtailed its economic stimulus campaign on Wednesday, even as it said the effort would continue for the foreseeable future given the enduring consequences of the Great Recession.The Fed, as expected, announced it would reduce its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities by $10 billion, to $55 billion, because of its confidence that the four-year-old recovery is finally becoming self-sustaining. The Fed also signaled its intention to keep short-term interest rates near zero after the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent. Investors, however, drew the conclusion that the central bank might begin to raise short-term interest rates, which it has held near zero since December 2008, well before the end of 2015.But Janet L. Yellen, in her first news conference as the Fed\u2019s new chairwoman, sought to offset that optimism, saying the committee intended to raise short-term rates only gradually, because the economic environment remains weak. Importantly, she said, the Fed expected to conclude the process with rates still below the historically normal level of 4 percent.Noting that growth had repeatedly disappointed expectations in recent years, Ms. Yellen said that some Fed officials had concluded \u201cthat the potential growth rate of the economy may be lower at least for a time.\u201d She cited the lingering effects of the recession, including unpaid debts and difficulties in obtaining loans. It was the first time the Fed officially predicted that the economy might not recover completely. The Fed is taking two different tacks in its approach to its stimulus campaign. The central bank\u2019s retreat from its bond-buying campaign has been clear and consistent, and it remains on track to end the current round of bond buying this fall. But its plans for interest rates only created confusion on Wednesday.The Federal Open Market Committee said on Wednesday, in a statement issued after a two-day meeting, that it planned to keep short-term rates near zero \u201cfor a considerable time\u201d after the bond buying ends, particularly if inflation remains sluggish. That guidance replaced the Fed\u2019s 15-month-old declaration that it planned to wait at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent.The statement Wednesday from the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making group of the Federal Reserve, offers its assessment of current economic conditions.The latest statement \u2014 the longest one the committee has ever published \u2014 was careful to say that the change in guidance was not intended to alter the possible timing of a rate increase. Instead, Ms. Yellen said that new measuring sticks were necessary because the unemployment rate had fallen more quickly than expected, while other economic indicators, like inflation, remained weak.\u201cThe purpose of this change is simply to provide more information than we have in the past, even though it is qualitative information, as the unemployment rate declines below 6.5 percent,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.But the Fed also released a separate set of economic forecasts showing that officials had raised their expectations for the level of their benchmark rate at the end of 2015 to 1 percent from 0.75 percent.And, when asked to define \u201ca considerable time,\u201d Ms. Yellen responded, \u201cThis is the kind of term that\u2019s hard to define, but it probably means something on the order of around six months or that kind of thing.\u201d She added that the exact timing of a rate increase would depend on economic conditions. Investors, however, focused on the words \u201csix months,\u201d which suggested a first rate increase in the spring of 2015 \u2014 six months after the expected end of bond purchases, and considerably earlier than the timing they previously expected.The stock market fell on her words. The S.&P. 500 was down 0.61 percent on the day. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.77 percent.\u201cIt is hard to know if Yellen wanted the market, which has taken it hard on the chin following that particular remark, to start thinking of a mid-2015 hike, but that is what was implied by her statement,\u201d Millan L. Mulraine, deputy head of research at TD Securities, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday afternoon.The strategy shift has prompted internal debate. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and one of the most ardent proponents of the view that the Fed is not doing enough to stimulate the economy, voted against the new guidance. He has argued that the Fed should adopt a new unemployment threshold of 5.5 percent. Mr. Kocherlakota said that the Fed\u2019s move called into question its commitment to reviving inflation and created uncertainty \u201cthat hinders economic activity.\u201dBut it is not clear whether the cold is a complete explanation, and officials have said that judging the cold\u2019s impact will take time \u2014 and warmer weather.\u201cWe probably overdid the optimism in January,\u201d Ms. Yellen said on Wednesday.The focus of the Fed\u2019s concern is shifting from the high level of unemployment to the low pace of inflation. The Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, an index of personal consumption expenditures, rose 1.1 percent in the 12 months ending in January, below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed has made its target. Officials see this as a symptom of the broader malaise, and they expect inflation to rebound alongside the economy. Ms. Yellen also noted on Wednesday that monetary policy affects the economy slowly, a point she often makes to emphasize that current conditions are not the right scorecard.But the committee\u2019s statement once again ratcheted up the Fed\u2019s focus on inflation, and Ms. Yellen said that even the continued retreat from bond buying depended on the Fed\u2019s confidence that inflation would rise. \u201cWe need to see evidence that leaves us feeling satisfied that inflation will move up over time,\u201d she said.Still, the Fed\u2019s statement and the economic projections of its officials made it clear that the central bank remained basically optimistic about the economy.The Fed appeared \u201cto be more confident about the transitory nature of the recent slowing in economic activity and in the sustainability of the underlying economic recovery,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, United States strategist at TD Securities.The economic forecasts of Fed officials pointed to slightly softer growth and a marginally faster decline in unemployment. They predicted that growth would be no greater than 3 percent in 2014, compared to a December ceiling of 3.2 percent; unemployment was predicted to fall as low as 6.1 percent, rather than 6.3 percent.Those two trends would ordinarily move in opposite directions. But economic weakness since the recession has steadily reduced the unemployment rate by convincing people without jobs to stop looking for work.Fed officials now forecast that the unemployment rate in 2016 will reach a new equilibrium between 5.2 percent and 5.6 percent, meaning that they do not believe the rate can be further reduced without precipitating inflation. That is about a percentage point higher than the prerecession rate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pressure Rising as Obama Works to Rein In Russia", "Date": "2014-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As Russia dispatched more forces and tightened its grip on the Crimean Peninsula on Sunday, President Obama embarked on a strategy intended to isolate Moscow and prevent it from seizing more Ukrainian territory even as he was pressured at home to respond more forcefully.Working the telephone from the Oval Office, Mr. Obama rallied allies, agreed to send Secretary of State John Kerry to Kiev and approved a series of diplomatic and economic moves intended to \u201cmake it hurt,\u201d as one administration official put it. But the president found himself besieged by advice to take more assertive action.\u201cCreate a democratic noose around Putin\u2019s Russia,\u201d urged Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. \u201cRevisit the missile defense shield,\u201d suggested Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. \u201cCancel Sochi,\u201d argued Representative Mike Rogers, the Michigan Republican who leads the Intelligence Committee, referring to the Group of 8 summit meeting to be hosted by President Vladimir V. Putin. Kick \u201chim out of the G-8\u201d altogether, said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic whip.The Russian occupation of Crimea has challenged Mr. Obama as has no other international crisis, and at its heart, the advice seemed to pose the same question: Is Mr. Obama tough enough to take on the former K.G.B. colonel in the Kremlin? It is no easy task. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany told Mr. Obama by telephone on Sunday that after speaking with Mr. Putin she was not sure he was in touch with reality, people briefed on the call said. \u201cIn another world,\u201d she said.That makes for a crisis significantly different from others on Mr. Obama\u2019s watch. On Syria, Iran, Libya and Egypt, the political factions in Washington have been as torn as the president over the proper balance of firmness and flexibility. But as an old nuclear-armed adversary returns to Cold War form, the consequences seem greater, the challenges more daunting and the voices more unified.\u201cIt\u2019s the most important, most difficult foreign-policy test of his presidency,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, a career diplomat who became under secretary of state in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cThe stakes are very high for the president because he is the NATO leader. There\u2019s no one in Europe who can approach him in power. He\u2019s going to have to lead.\u201d14 PhotosMr. Obama came to office with little foreign-policy experience and has been repeatedly tested by a new world in which the main threats are Islamic extremism and civil war. While increasing drone strikes and initially building up forces in Afghanistan, he has made it his mission to pull out of two long wars and keep out of any new ones.But the limits of his influence have been driven home in recent weeks, with Syria pressing its war against rebels and Afghanistan refusing to sign an agreement allowing residual American forces. Now the Crimea crisis has presented Mr. Obama with an elemental threat reminiscent of the one that confronted his predecessors for four decades \u2014 a geopolitical struggle in the middle of Europe. First, the pro-Russian government in Kiev, now deposed, defied his warnings not to shoot protesters, and now Mr. Putin has ignored his admonitions to stay out of Ukraine.Caught off guard, Mr. Obama is left to play catch-up. With thousands of reinforcements arriving Sunday to join what American officials estimated were 6,000 Russian troops, Mr. Putin effectively severed the peninsula, with its largely Russian-speaking population, from the rest of Ukraine.\u201cRussian forces now have complete operational control of the Crimean peninsula,\u201d a senior administration official said on the condition of anonymity.No significant political leaders in Washington urged a military response, but many wanted Mr. Obama to go further than he has so far. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, has already devised language to serve as the basis for possible bipartisan legislation outlining a forceful response, including sanctions against Russia and economic support for Ukraine.The president has spoken out against Mr. Putin\u2019s actions and termed them a \u201cbreach of international law.\u201d But he has left the harshest condemnations to Mr. Kerry, who on Sunday called them a \u201cbrazen act of aggression\u201d and \u201ca stunning willful choice by President Putin,\u201d accusing him of \u201cweakness\u201d and \u201cdesperation.\u201dIn addition to Ms. Merkel, Mr. Obama spoke with his counterparts from Britain and Poland on Sunday and won agreement from all the other G-8 countries to suspend preparations for the Sochi meeting and find ways to shore up the economically fragile Ukrainian government. The administration also canceled a trade mission to Moscow and a Russian trip to Washington to discuss energy while vowing to also scrap a naval-cooperation meeting with Russia.In television interviews, Mr. Kerry suggested that the United States might impose sanctions, boycott the Sochi meeting in June and expel Russia from the G-8. Germany, however, publicly expressed opposition to expulsion, an ominous sign for Mr. Obama since any meaningful pressure would need support from Berlin. But Mr. Obama offered Russia what aides called an \u201cofframp,\u201d a face-saving way out of the crisis, by proposing that European observers take the place of Russian forces in Crimea to guard against the supposed threats to the Russian-speaking population cited by the Kremlin as justification for its intervention.Mr. Obama\u2019s aides said that they saw no evidence of such threats and considered the claim a bogus pretext, and that they wanted to call Mr. Putin\u2019s bluff. Privately, they said they did not expect Mr. Putin to accept, and they conceded that Mr. Obama probably could not reverse the occupation of Crimea in the short term. They said they were focusing on blocking any further Russian move into eastern Ukraine that would split the country in half.Some regional specialists said Mr. Obama should ignore the talk-tough chorus and focus instead on defusing a crisis that could get much worse. Andrew Weiss, a national security aide to President Bill Clinton, said the Obama administration should be trying to keep Ukraine and Russia from open war. \u201cFor us to just talk about how tough we are, we may score some points but lose the war here,\u201d Mr. Weiss said.The crisis has trained a harsh spotlight on Mr. Obama\u2019s foreign policy, with critics asserting that he has been too passive.Mr. Corker traced the origins of Mr. Putin\u2019s brash invasion to September when, in the face of bipartisan opposition in Congress, Mr. Obama pulled back from plans to conduct an airstrike on Syria in retaliation for a chemical-weapons attack on civilians. Instead, he accepted a Russian offer to work jointly to remove the chemical weapons.\u201cEver since the administration threw themselves into the arms of Russia in Syria to keep from carrying out what they said they would carry out, I think, he saw weakness,\u201d Mr. Corker said of Mr. Putin. \u201cThese are the consequences.\u201dOf course, had Mr. Obama proceeded with an attack, he would have paid a different price for ignoring the will of Congress and the grave misgivings of an American public weary of war. Republicans who opposed confrontation in Syria insist this is different.Mr. Rubio, who opposed authorizing force in Syria, agreed that that conflict had serious ramifications for American interests. But he said the showdown in Crimea was about freedom itself and the hard-fought American victory over totalitarianism in the Cold War. In that sense, even Republicans who opposed Mr. Obama in Syria were pushing for a hard line against Mr. Putin.\u201cThe very credibility of the post-Cold War world and borders is at stake here,\u201d Mr. Rubio said in an interview.Obama aides reject the notion that he has underestimated Mr. Putin. From the beginning, they said, he had a cold-eyed assessment of the possibilities and limitations of engagement with Mr. Putin. And they noted that neither President Bush\u2019s reputation for toughness nor his courtship of Mr. Putin stopped Russia from going to war in 2008 with another neighbor, the former Soviet republic of Georgia.While Mr. Obama has not gone as far as many in Washington want him to go, the president has been less focused on immediate actions than on making sure he and America\u2019s traditional allies are on the same page. Working from the Oval Office over the weekend, wearing jeans and a scowl, he called several of his G-8 counterparts to \u201cmake sure everybody\u2019s in lock step with what we\u2019re doing and saying,\u201d according to a top aide.Administration officials said Mr. Putin had miscalculated and would pay a cost regardless of what the United States did, pointing to the impact on Russia\u2019s currency and markets. \u201cWhat we see here are distinctly 19th- and 20th-century decisions made by President Putin to address problems,\u201d one of the officials said. \u201cWhat he needs to understand is that in terms of his economy, he lives in the 21st-century world, an interdependent world.\u201dJonathan Weisman contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Consumers Spent More in February, but Showed Less Optimism", "Date": "2014-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Consumer spending increased in February, but a dip in sentiment this month confirmed that economic growth slowed in the first quarter.The Commerce Department said on Friday that consumer spending rose 0.3 percent last month after gaining 0.2 percent in January. Last month\u2019s increase in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity in the United States, matched economists\u2019 expectations.While that rise indicated the economy was regaining strength after being chilled by unusually bad weather, growth this quarter remains sluggish and households have felt the impact.A second report on Friday showed the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index dipped to 80.0 in March from 81.6 in February. The index was little changed from earlier in the month.\u201cCurrent conditions in the overall economy were reported by consumers to have recently weakened,\u201d the survey director, Richard Curtin, said.A combination of bad weather, a slow pace of inventory accumulation by businesses, the expiration of long-term unemployment benefits and cuts to food stamps is expected to hold back economic growth to an annualized pace of around 2 percent in the first quarter.But a rebound is expected as these factors fade. The economy grew at a 2.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter.Consumer spending in February was lifted by an increase in services consumption, most likely because of increased demand for health care and utilities. When adjusted for inflation, spending rose 0.2 percent. January\u2019s real consumer spending was, however, revised to show a 0.1 percent gain instead of a 0.3 percent jump.This measure goes into the calculation of gross domestic product, and January\u2019s revision suggested consumer spending cooled this quarter after logging its fastest pace in three years in the final three months of 2013.\u201cThe consumer did go into hibernation this winter, but we expect consumers to be out in full force now that spring is upon us, boosting G.D.P. in the second quarter,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York.Income rose 0.3 percent last month after rising by the same margin in January. It continues to be supported by government transfers for health care payments, which offset the drag from the expiration of the long-term unemployment benefits.Income at the disposal of households after adjusting for inflation rose 0.3 percent. The saving rate, which is the percentage of disposable income households are putting away, rose to 4.3 percent last month, from 4.2 percent in January.There were few signs of inflation pressure in February. A price index for consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent in February for the second straight month.Prices in February rose 0.9 percent from a year ago, compared to a 1.2 percent advance in January over the previous 12 months. February\u2019s increase was the smallest since October.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Initial Triumph, Ukraine\u2019s Leaders Face Battle for Credibility", "Date": "2014-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From KievKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 The United States and the European Union have embraced the revolution here as another flowering of democracy, a blow to authoritarianism and kleptocracy in the former Soviet space. But successful revolutions, as the interim government here has been learning, are a lot harder to maintain than it can seem in the bright dawn of first victories.The challenges for Ukraine\u2019s new leaders are many and varied. With President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia now openly intent on a military showdown over control of Crimea, the government faces a powerful test of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity. Demonstrations are growing in the Russian-speaking east of the country, underscoring the tenuous nature of the government\u2019s control there. Washington and Brussels, Kiev\u2019s only hopes at this point for the aid necessary to avert economic collapse, are scrambling to deliver and have shown no desire for an armed confrontation with Russia.As it met for the first time on Saturday in an air of crisis, the new government also faced questions of credibility, legitimacy and inclusiveness arising from the way in which it came to power.\u201cYou have a revolution, with unelected guys seizing power,\u201d said Andrew Wilson, a Ukraine expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\u201cThe people on the Maidan might be right, they might be martyrs, and they have good arguments, but no one elected them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to get real politics and competition and more legitimacy. Of course, the counterargument is just concentrate on economy. But the credibility question is tearing the country apart, and the transfer of power cut a lot of corners constitutionally.\u201dAn early triumphalist mistake, Mr. Wilson said, was the quick overturning of a 2012 law on languages that allowed regions to make Russian a second official language, needlessly offending, even goading Russian-dominated regions like the Donbass and Crimea.Whether Egypt or Libya, post-Soviet Georgia or Ukraine itself a decade ago, recent history is littered with failed or broken dreams of new democratic beginnings. The forces of the old order retreat, regroup and capitalize on the instability or inefficiency of the new.As Russian forces appear to be establishing their control of Crimea in the name of a seemingly manufactured local cry for aid, Ukraine today is a good example of how deep, domestic, centrifugal forces can be easily manipulated from the outside to keep a new, inexperienced government shaken and destabilized.Kiev itself is not a dominant capital like Paris, said Bruce P. Jackson, president of the Project on Transitional Democracies, which has been working in Ukraine for 15 years.\u201cKiev has always been more of a compromise than a capital, and if it loses the ability to compromise, it loses its credibility as a capital,\u201d he said.What worries him, Mr. Jackson said, is that the new government is too beholden to the people\u2019s movement on the Maidan. He is also concerned that it is not reaching out sufficiently to the east and needs the credibility of both presidential and parliamentary elections to answer Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s charge, echoed in Moscow, that those politicians of western Ukraine, who have regularly lost elections, have seized power instead.In essence, he suggested, the revolutionaries \u201chave knocked out the foundations of modern Ukraine,\u201d and they need to be restored in a way that recognizes the diversity of the country.Sudden, unmediated political change in countries like Ukraine rarely goes smoothly, he said, pointing to the Rose Revolution in Georgia, whose main proponents are now out of office and many in exile after an administration that inevitably produced some achievements but considerable disappointments, aided by Russian efforts to keep Georgia unstable.Those efforts culminated in the 2008 Russian-Georgian war, when Russia provoked Georgia into skirmishes that prompted an invasion and the annexation of two Georgian regions with sizable numbers of ethnic Russians, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. That annexation has not been recognized internationally, but what is happening in Crimea seems drawn directly from the same playbook, but faster and with less pretense of responding to an endangered ethnic Russian population, which has been attacked by no one.But Crimea is only the most vivid challenge to the credibility of the new Ukrainian government. Russia possesses numerous tools to destabilize the new powers in Ukraine, from financial instruments and customs duties to energy supplies and trade sanctions. A push for decentralization in Crimea can easily be followed by similar demands from eastern Ukraine, far more dependent on Russian trade. On Saturday, for example, thousands of demonstrators shouted pro-Russian slogans in Donetsk.Mr. Putin was always said to be obsessed by the Orange Revolution, seeking to ensure that no such popular uprising could happen in Moscow, where the first sign of popular demonstrations were met with real force. But, analysts suggest, Mr. Putin also saw how the Orange Revolution unraveled.By picking sides, by pressing on economic and energy levers, by funding and favoring certain personalities, Russia helped the Orange Revolution fail, because it did not change the system of politics by oligarchy. Moscow played a longer, successful game, helped by Ukraine\u2019s own divisions and petty politics.The main fear in Kiev now is how to resist similar efforts by Moscow to destabilize, weaken and discredit the current government. Economically, it is very vulnerable, with big bills to pay for Russian natural gas and to service existing loans, and its currency is dropping. Nearly 30 percent of all its trade is with Russia, and it is almost entirely dependent on energy from Russia, which can easily renege on promised discounts for gas.On Thursday, Mr. Yatsenyuk told Parliament that loans worth $37 billion had disappeared from Ukraine\u2019s treasury during Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s three-year leadership, and warned that unpopular measures were needed to salvage the economy. He added that as much as $70 billion had been sent out of the country during Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s presidency.\u201cI want to report to you \u2014 the state treasury has been robbed and is empty,\u201d Mr. Yatsenyuk told Parliament. Last year, according to the economist Anders Aslund of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Ukraine\u2019s current-account deficit was an estimated 8.3 percent of gross domestic product. Its foreign-currency reserves cover just over two months of imports. The budget deficit is nearly 8 percent of G.D.P., he said, and the economy has been in recession since mid-2012.The West is scrambling to find cash to tide Ukraine over, with a team from the International Monetary Fund scheduled to arrive this week. Ukraine\u2019s new authorities have said the country may need at least $15 billion in new loans this year. But Christine Lagarde, the fund\u2019s managing director, warned on Friday against panic, saying that Ukraine\u2019s needs had not yet been assessed.Mr. Putin\u2019s move to seek authorization for military intervention will make the atmosphere in which the new government is operating that much more charged. And Russia is unlikely to give up the bargaining chip of Crimea quickly, and without obtaining a substantial benefit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Farmers Short of Labor, and Patience", "Date": "2014-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHURON, Calif. \u2014 When Chuck Herrin, who runs a large farm labor contracting company, looks out at the hundreds of workers he hires each year to tend to the countless rows of asparagus, grapes, tomatoes, peaches and plums, he often seethes in frustration.It is not that he has any trouble with the laborers. It is that he, like many others in agriculture here, is increasingly fed up with immigration laws that he says prevent him from fielding a steady, reliable work force.\u201cWhat we have going on now is a farce \u2014 a waste of time and money,\u201d said Mr. Herrin, a lifelong Republican who grew up in central California, adding that the country should be considering ways to bring workers in, not keep them out. \u201cWe need these people to get our food to market.\u201d California is home to an estimated 2.5 million illegal immigrants, more than in any other state. Perhaps nowhere else captures the contradictions and complications of immigration policy better than California\u2019s Central Valley, where nearly all farmworkers are immigrants, roughly half of them living here illegally, according to estimates from agricultural economists at the University of California, Davis.That reality is shaping the views of agriculture business owners here, like Mr. Herrin, who cannot recall ever voting for a Democrat. In dozens of interviews, farmers and owners of related businesses said that even the current system of tacitly using illegal labor was failing to sustain them. A work force that arrived in the 1990s is aging out of heavy labor, Americans do not want the jobs, and tightened security at the border is discouraging new immigrants from arriving, they say, leaving them to struggle amid the paralysis on immigration policy. No other region may be as eager to keep immigration legislation alive.The tension is so high that the powerful Western Growers Association, a group based in Irvine, Calif., that represents hundreds of farmers in California and Arizona, says many of its members may withhold contributions from Republicans in congressional races because of the party\u2019s stance against a comprehensive immigration overhaul.Mr. Herrin says he is constantly shifting his work force during harvest, and can often provide crews only half the size that farmers request. Like other employers interviewed, he acknowledged that he almost certainly had illegal immigrants in his work force. Would-be workers provide a Social Security number or a document purporting they are eligible to work; employers accept the documentation even if they doubt its veracity because they want to bring in their crops.\u201cWe have no choice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not getting people who are coming out of the towns and cities to come out and work on the farms.\u201d Potential workers, he said, are \u201cscared to come, scared of Border Patrol and deportations and drug lords. They can\u2019t afford to risk all these things.\u201d Roughly a third of Mr. Herrin\u2019s workers are older than 50, a much higher proportion than even five years ago. He said they had earned the right to stay here. \u201cIf we keep them here and not do anything for them once they get old, that\u2019s really extortion,\u201d he said.The region has relied on new arrivals to pick crops since the time of the Dust Bowl. For more than two decades after World War II, growers here depended on braceros, Mexican workers sent temporarily to the United States to work in agriculture. Today, many fieldworkers are indigenous people from southern Mexico who speak Mixtec and know little English or Spanish.In recent years, farm owners have grown increasingly fearful of labor shortages. Last year, the diminished supply of workers led average farm wages in the region to increase by roughly $1 an hour, according to researchers at U.C. Davis who have tracked wages for years. Now, farm owners are pressing to make it easier for would-be immigrants to obtain agricultural visas, which they say would create a more reliable labor supply.So even amid a record drought threatening to wipe out crops here, growers routinely talk of immigration as a top concern, saying they are losing some of their most valuable workers because of deportations or threats of being sent away. Kevin Andrew, the chief operating officer for Jakov P. Dulcich and Sons, which grows grapes and other produce in the region, remembers what happened to one of his workers who was simultaneously up for a promotion and citizenship a couple of years ago.\u201cJust as he goes to his final interview, they found some document where his two last names were reversed and they came after him for attempting to defraud the government,\u201d Mr. Andrew said. \u201cThis is a guy who owned two or three homes, had stellar letters written for him by supervisors, and they\u2019re looking for a reason to count him out. \u201cHe came to me afterward and was crushed, just sobbing like a baby. All of a sudden he can\u2019t be a supervisor because he\u2019s wanted by the government. He was supposedly living the American dream, and they just took everything away in an instant.\u201d Mr. Andrew saw the man several months later, working at a job that paid less than what he had been earning for years. Huron is part of an unusual congressional district: It is more than two-thirds Latino and is represented by a Republican, David Valadao. No other district represented by a Republican has more illegal immigrants. Mr. Valadao and Representative Jeff Denham, who represents a northern stretch of the agricultural valley, are two of the three Republicans who support a Democratic-sponsored bill that would grant a legal path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants.\u201cThere are people who have been employed for many years, if not decades, and are now turning to their employers saying, \u2018Look, I am undocumented,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Denham said in an interview. \u201cThese are not just seasonal workers. These are people who have almost become part of the same family. It\u2019s a problem that has grown so big and so multigenerational, we can no longer ignore it.\u201dAfter decades of immigration, the region has become home to many of the children of Mexican laborers. Mr. Denham, for example, is married to the daughter of a former bracero from Mexico who became a citizen decades after he arrived in the Central Valley.Industry groups are among the most important forces pressing Congress for an immigration overhaul. Tom Nassif, the president of the Western Growers Association, has shuttled to Washington to press members of Congress, especially Republicans, to get a bill passed this year. Mr. Nassif, an ambassador to Morocco under President Ronald Reagan, has long called for easing entry at the Mexican border to make it easier for growers to find labor.\u201cWe\u2019ve had secure borders with Mexico for the last decade; we don\u2019t have that argument at this point,\u201d Mr. Nassif said. \u201cNow we want people to see the real damage of not doing anything, which is a declining work force, and it means losing production to foreign countries.\u201dAfter the 2012 presidential election, as Republicans spoke enthusiastically about the need to court Latinos, Mr. Nassif was optimistic that immigration would become a top priority. But exasperation has replaced his confidence in recent months, and he said his group could withhold hundreds of thousands of dollars in congressional races in which it has usually supported Republicans.\u201cI can tell you if the Republicans don\u2019t put something forward on immigration, there is going to be a very loud hue and cry from us in agriculture,\u201d Mr. Nassif said. \u201cWe are a tremendously important part of the party, and they should not want to lose us.\u201dJoe Del Bosque grew up in the San Joaquin Valley after his parents came to California as children during the Mexican Revolution in the early part of the last century. A generation ago, he said, growers often pretended to have no idea that people working for them were not authorized to be in the United States. Now, there is a nearly universal recognition that the industry relies on immigrants who cross the border illegally.Like other growers in the area, he said he felt politically isolated. \u201cThe employers are more frustrated than the actual immigrants,\u201d said Mr. Del Bosque, who grows cantaloupes, almonds and asparagus near Los Banos, north of Fresno. \u201cI thought it would have been much more contentious for them, but they are not so demanding,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a revolution for them \u2014 it\u2019s more for us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ukraine's Critical Choice", "Date": "2014-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialYulia Tymoshenko, a former prime minister who was jailed until recently by a political rival, has put herself forward as a candidate for president of Ukraine. She is the most recognizable contender in the field. As both symbol and victim of the country\u2019s corrupt past, she is also potentially polarizing, underscoring the crucial electoral decision that Ukrainians face in May as they move forward at a time of crisis with Russia and domestic political instability.After running unsuccessfully for president in 2010 against her rival, Viktor Yanukovych, Ms. Tymoshenko was imprisoned by him for two and a half years on abuse-of-office charges that the West has branded as politically motivated. Parliament freed her after Mr. Yanukovych was toppled in February in the midst of Ukraine\u2019s political upheaval. He then fled to Russia. The next president, expected to be elected on May 25, will have to grapple with several formidable challenges: reforming an economy on the verge of default and crippled by corruption; rebuilding a fractured, dysfunctional government; and straddling a tense political and geographic space between the West and Russia, which recently annexed Crimea. Ms. Tymoshenko\u2019s emphasis on her past governing experience inevitably draws attention to her responsibility for many of the problems Ukraine now faces.Although President Vladimir Putin had said she was his preferred candidate for Ukraine\u2019s president in 2010, Ms. Tymoshenko was recently heard in a recorded conversation using a derogatory term for Russians and threatening to use her connections to \u201cget the whole world to rise up so that not even scorched earth would be left of Russia.\u201d A presidential preference poll by one of Ukraine\u2019s leading research institutions, SOCIS, had her behind Petro Poroshenko, an oligarch known as the chocolate king who is pro-European but politically independent. On Saturday, Mr. Poroshenko won the support of another candidate, Vitali Klitschko, the former boxer, who abandoned the race. Sergey Tigipko, a veteran lawmaker and former vice prime minister under Mr. Yanukovych, also declared his candidacy, identifying himself as an independent. The stakes in this election are higher than ever. But whether she wins or not, Ms. Tymoshenko is expected to remain a force in Ukrainian politics for some time to come. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$66,400 Answer, but What\u2019s the Question?", "Date": "2014-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel | 2015 Kia K900Kia\u2019s start in America was clandestine. It built the forgettable Festiva two-door hatchback for Ford, using plans cribbed from Mazda. With its front wheels powered by a 58-horsepower 4-cylinder engine, that 1988 Festiva wasn\u2019t much more than a stripped-down, 1,800-pound, 12-foot-long penalty box on four 12-inch wheels. According to Car and Driver magazine, it shuddered from 0 to 60 miles per hour in a lugubrious 12.5 seconds. But at least its base price was only $5,765. A bit more than a quarter-century later, the Kia K900 four-door luxury sedan will arrive this spring as a 2015 model. It weighs 4,555 pounds, stretches out nearly 17 feet and has wheels 19 inches in diameter. A 420-horsepower V8 drives the rear wheels, and the interior is covered in nappa leather, real wood and more gadgets than the robotics lab at Carnegie Mellon. No one has disclosed its acceleration yet, but it doesn\u2019t shudder lugubriously. One more thing: Its base price is $60,400.In the automotive world this is known as a \u201cmove upmarket\u201d \u2014 or progress.With fuel economy regulations growing more stringent and the reality that profits are more easily won in nappa-upholstered corners of the market, German companies like BMW and Mercedes-Benz are building smaller cars while the Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia are making bigger ones. It\u2019s the great 21st century economy-car, luxury-car convergence.Despite being about the size of a BMW 7 Series or Mercedes S-Class, the K900 does not drive like them. Kia\u2019s conception of luxury is closer to old-school Cadillac or Lexus, of cars that waft along silently as the velveteen suspension ruthlessly stifles road hiccups.Passenger comfort comes first, and driver engagement is down on the list after trunk decoration and a dazzling, Liberace-worthy spectacle of LED headlights. The feel of the steering and the responsiveness of the suspension seem like afterthoughts.That noted, the 5-liter direct-injection engine thrums out seamless torque with a hint of cop car in its exhaust note. The 8-speed automatic transmission shifts with the inscrutable subtlety of copyright law. The trip from 0 to 60 m.p.h. is likely to be in the five-second range. But it\u2019s a big engine in a heavy car, and that leads to modestly crummy fuel economy ratings of 15 m.p.g. in the city and 23 m.p.g. on the highway.In compensation, every one of those pounds is felt throughout the K900\u2019s impregnable structure. The heavy doors could be installed at Norad on Cheyenne Mountain, nearby meteor strikes couldn\u2019t be heard through the thick glass and there\u2019s never any sense the calm would be ruffled if the K900 were traversing the Rubicon Trail. While European luxury cars have been adopting aluminum structures, the K900\u2019s is steel.Combine that with a softly sprung, all-independent suspension (incorporating many aluminum castings) and the result is exceptional cabin comfort. 10 PhotosThat is particularly true when the car is equipped with the $6,000 V.I.P. Package. With power adjustments for the back seats and separate ventilation and entertainment options for rear-seated V.I.P.s, this is a near-limousine experience. It\u2019s roomy, it\u2019s cushy, it looks great and most of the surfaces are supple to the touch. This is exactly the car that exhausted travelers should have picking them up at the airport.However, that doesn\u2019t mean the interior is beyond criticism, even with an as-tested price of $66,400. The instrumentation is all on LCD screens and everything feels high-quality, but while Kia hasn\u2019t adopted many of the German brands\u2019 construction methods, it has copied some of their frustrating controls. So the transmission\u2019s shifter is a virtual clone of the counterintuitive wand found in many BMWs, and much of the on-board technology is directed by a scrollable menu system similar to BMW\u2019s notorious iDrive. There is so much technology in modern luxury cars that no one has yet come up with an elegant way to control it all. Maybe it will be Apple, which last week announced its interest in automotive controls, that will find a way to tie all this together. Or maybe some demon tweak will emerge that no one can imagine now.At the moment, though, tech-heavy cars always come with some frustration. The K900 has almost everything \u2014 lane-departure warning system, radar-based cruise control, cameras that surround the car and every sort of media player \u2014 and in that way, it keeps up with the Benzes.Kia says a version of the K900 with a 3.8-liter, 311-horsepower V6 will go on sale later this year for around $50,000.Styled in the current Kia idiom, the K900 looks handsome even if it is not as precisely drawn as its smaller brothers, the Cadenza and the Optima. But why would anyone want a luxury sedan that looks so much like cars that cost one-half or one-third as much?The K900 feels a generation or so behind other luxury cars. And in many ways, it is. It shares much of its engineering \u2014 drivetrains, suspension designs and structure \u2014 with its corporate cousins, the Hyundai Genesis and Equus. And a next-generation Genesis is about to reach showrooms. In fact, the K900 has already been on sale in other parts of the world where it\u2019s known as the K9 or the Quoris. In its South Korean home market, it is a car in which senior executives are often chauffeured, and it is optimized for that duty.While the Korean-built K900 represents a big step up in price and class for Kia, it\u2019s a relatively low-risk play for the company. It will be sold in only a third of Kia\u2019s 771 American dealerships, the sales goals are low and it uses a lot of pieces that were already in production for Hyundais. Kia has been on a sales hot streak in America for several years, and the company\u2019s success is not riding on a low-volume luxury car.Still there\u2019s something disquieting about the K900\u2019s place in the corporate lineup. Until now, Kia has been a brand keenly focused on high-value cars backed by a 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty. It\u2019s not so much that chief executives may not shop at Kia stores, but that Kia risks losing its focus on serving the humbler customer base it has already built.That old Festiva may not have been exciting or refined, but it was unpretentious and rated at an excellent 39 m.p.g. on the highway. Those are still virtues worth cultivating.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aid Package for Ukraine Advances in the Senate", "Date": "2014-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate voted on Monday to formally take up legislation to aid Ukraine and sanction Russia, beginning what promises to be a heated weeklong debate in Congress over the role the International Monetary Fund should play in the Crimean crisis.While the 78-17 vote showed considerable bipartisan support for the measure, bolstered by the votes of some Republicans who spent last week\u2019s congressional recess in Ukraine, its ultimate fate is uncertain. Conservatives remain opposed to an overhaul of the monetary fund\u2019s governance structure, which would expand Ukraine\u2019s borrowing limit at the fund but, many Republicans say, would also diminish the United States\u2019s authority and even increase Russia\u2019s.And some senators made it known that they would use the debate this week to try to toughen the sanctions on Russia beyond those already imposed by President Obama.\u201cTime is of the essence if we\u2019re going to send a message to Russia,\u201d said Senator Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana, who will try to attach an amendment expanding sanctions to Rosoboronexport, a Russian firm that handles the nation\u2019s exports of military equipment. Mr. Coats specifically would block the government of Afghanistan from using United States military aid to buy Russian helicopters.Even with Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, and its looming threats against Eastern Ukraine, the aid and sanctions package remains tangled in domestic politics. Influential conservative groups like Heritage Action, the political arm of the Heritage Foundation, are urging lawmakers to oppose the inclusion of the monetary fund\u2019s governance language, which they say would weaken United States authority and has nothing to do with the Ukraine crisis.\u201cAny attempt to conflate the two issues is politically motivated; indeed, the Obama administration is misleading the American people to make these so-called reforms appear urgent,\u201d Heritage Action charged on Monday.Republican leadership is not digging in ideologically against the fund\u2019s language, but Republicans want something in return, namely at least a delay in the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s regulations of political groups operating as tax-exempt \u201csocial welfare\u201d organizations.That, in turn, fed directly into the Democrats\u2019 continuing attacks on Charles and David Koch, the conservative billionaires who are spending millions of dollars to defeat Senate Democrats in the 2014 elections.\u201cRepublicans objected to moving forward with this aid package unless Democrats agreed to allow the Kochs and billionaires like them to continue to anonymously spend millions trying to buy America\u2019s democracy,\u201d Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe, but that\u2019s the truth.\u201dThe Senate legislation would guarantee $1 billion in loans to the shaky, fledgling government in Kiev and offer an additional $100 million in direct aid. It would also offer $50 million to strengthen democratic institutions, to improve the rule of law and civic organizations, and to help the Ukraine government recover assets stolen by the deposed Ukrainian government. It would codify sanctions against Ukrainian and Russian individuals already hit by sanctions ordered by Mr. Obama, but at the same time it would expand the list of targets who would be denied United States visas and subject to civil or criminal penalties.The fund\u2019s language, sought sporadically by the Obama administration since Mr. Obama helped negotiate the changes in 2010, would expand loan limits for Ukraine and other countries aided by the fund. It would expand the authority of emerging economies like Russia, China and Brazil, but the United States would retain its veto authority at the fund.Republicans such as Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming hope to use the Senate floor debate to add language expediting the export of United States liquefied natural gas to undermine Russia\u2019s energy stranglehold on Eastern Europe.The House already passed a Ukraine aid package, without that fund language and without sanctions on Russia. Under criticism from Senate Republicans, the House is likely to pass legislation this week similar to the Senate\u2019s except it would again exclude the fund\u2019s language.That could set up a House-Senate showdown as soon as this weekend, Senate aides said.Senators from both parties, more than a half-dozen of whom just returned from Ukraine, urged the Senate to move quickly and the House to follow.\u201cThe I.M.F. reforms are not the reason why this legislation is before us. The reason it\u2019s before us is Vladimir Putin has absorbed Crimea into Russia,\u201d said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Consumer Confidence and Home Price Data Nod to Stronger Growth", "Date": "2014-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 American consumer confidence surged to a six-year high in March and house prices rose solidly in January, positioning the economy for stronger growth after a soft spot attributed to bad winter weather.The upbeat outlook, however, was dimmed somewhat by other data on Tuesday showing new-home sales at a five-month low in February, partly because of the cold weather.\u201cThe economy is showing signs of shaking off the weather effect. We are going to get a big lift to second-quarter growth from the weather,\u201d said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics in West Chester, Pa.The jump in confidence bodes well for the economy, even though consumers were less upbeat about the labor market.An unusually cold and snowy winter has held back the economy, disrupting activity that includes hiring, spending and manufacturing. Growth in the first quarter is expected to have slowed considerably from the fourth quarter\u2019s annualized 2.4 percent pace.Separately, the Standard & Poor\u2019s/Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 0.8 percent in January on a seasonally adjusted basis. It followed a similar increase in December. Prices rose 13.2 percent from a year ago.The house price gains, driven by a shortage of homes for sale, are bolstering household wealth and helping support consumer spending.\u201cThe broad-based recovery in home prices, which started just under two years ago, remains well underway,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York. But the dearth of properties is also weighing on the housing market\u2019s recovery.The Commerce Department said new-home sales fell 3.3 percent in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 440,000 units, the lowest since September.Sales were off 1.1 percent from year-ago levels, the biggest year-on-year drop since September 2011.Last month\u2019s drop brought new-home sales in line with other data like home resales and building activity, which have offered a downbeat picture of the housing market.The weather has been blamed for some of the slowdown, but the tight supply and a run-up in mortgage rates are also taking a toll.While the 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped from a peak of 4.49 percent in September to about 4.30 percent in February, it remains a full percentage point higher than it was a year ago.\u201cWorsening affordability and still-tight inventory are leading more Americans to rethink home buying this year,\u201d said Ellen Haberle, an economist at Redfin in Seattle.Though the number of new houses on the market was the highest since December 2010, inventory remains tight. At February\u2019s sales pace, it would take 5.2 months to clear inventories, up from 5.0 months in January and the most since September. A supply of 6.0 months is normally considered healthy.Sales in the Northeast tumbled 32.4 percent, the biggest decline since October 2012 and an indication that severe weather continued to hurt activity. Sales fell 1.5 percent in the South, surged 36.7 percent in the Midwest and fell 15.9 percent in the West.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Was It Any Use?", "Date": "2014-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Donal Ryan\u2019s compact debut novel, \u201cThe Spinning Heart,\u201d effects of the economic downturn ripple through an Irish village whose laborers, flush during the boom, have been left in the lurch now that the local developer, Pokey Burke, has skipped town.The spinning heart of the title, a decorative ornament on a cottage gate, \u201cskewered on a rotating hinge,\u201d is an apt image both for the town\u2019s collective heartache and for the narrative progression, which moves continuously from one villager to the next, 21 narrators (and chapters) in all. Each speaker has been wounded \u2014 by the economy as well as by grim parents, cruel lovers, violence, mental illness and the grief of accidental loss.At the book\u2019s figurative heart is the construction foreman Bobby Mahon, a young husband and father whose moral decency anchors the story. Both his goodness and his brogue lend the novel an old-fashioned, storybook quality (\u201cHe drank out the farm to spite his father\u201d) that overlaps convincingly with mentions of Facebook, \u201cprefab\u201d doors and dubious investments in Dubai to create an affecting portrayal of contemporary rural Ireland.With the barest thread of a story line, the book suggests an intimate oral history of a moment in time, its rotation of voices \u2014 sharing regrets and desires along with town gossip \u2014 reminiscent of William Faulkner\u2019s \u201cAs I Lay Dying\u201d and Edgar Lee Masters\u2019s \u201cSpoon River Anthology.\u201d Instead of Masters\u2019s cemetery, these individuals populate a metaphorical ghost town, haunted by the dead, the departed and phantom prospects that have vanished overnight. Indeed, one character, the young single mother Realtin, lives in a \u201cghost estate\u201d \u2014 an empty residential development where she is stuck with a hefty mortgage and an unfinished house. The extensive cast spins variations on a theme, \u201csodden stories\u201d of fathers who terrorize their wives and children, and mothers who rack up pregnancies for the government\u2019s monthly 150 euros per child. While the material often feels familiar (we even meet the kindhearted town floozy, now aging and abandoned), Ryan writes with compassion, honesty and an appealing deadpan humor, as when one unfortunate character confesses, \u201cThe biggest mistake I made when I was younger was getting tattoos all over my face.\u201dThese are men and women with hard lives and soft hearts, many speaking in lively, unaffected idiom. \u201cMy tear bags are fierce close to my eyes these days,\u201d the father of Pokey Burke says. When the vernacular risks wearing out its welcome, Ryan intersperses more plain-spoken narrators like Vasya, a laborer from Siberia now left to scrounge for work. We hear Vasya\u2019s fully articulated thoughts rather than the broken English he speaks, allowing for wonderful descriptions of, for instance, \u201ca city that was spreading outwards like a dirty puddle.\u201dI felt some alarm when I realized I would continue to meet one new narrator after the next for the entire book, like a long receiving line at a party \u2014 but it is to the author\u2019s credit that I rarely had to check back to keep everyone straight. There is also the pleasant anticipation of wondering how each new character will fit into Ryan\u2019s mosaic.Most chapters are brief and hit similar notes, each speaker summarizing what has occurred, with predrawn conclusions that quell dramatic tension and limit the story\u2019s elasticity. Even when a kidnapping and a murder are introduced, the information arrives secondhand, so that we witness few actual scenes and little dialogue or action. But perhaps this lack of true forward motion is the point. These people have been left in a rut, spinning their wheels as well as their hearts. Depression has caused them to lose their former sense of themselves. One older character, longing for \u201ca time when killing was for good, for God and country,\u201d reflects: \u201cThat time is long gone.

{"Headline": "Tepid Growth in China Consumer Prices Could Worry Investors", "Date": "2014-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s consumer prices rose at their slowest rate in 13 months in February, as pork prices fell by the most in more than a year, data showed Sunday, a sign that slowing growth poses a bigger risk to the country\u2019s economy than rising prices.The consumer price index rose 2 percent in February, compared with a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said, exactly in line with market expectations. Pork prices fell 9 percent.And in an indication that China\u2019s wobbly economy is fighting substantial slack, producer prices fell for the 24th consecutive month, dropping 2 percent, slightly more than the 1.9 percent drop that had been forecast.The tepid price data could fuel investors\u2019 worries about the health of China\u2019s economy, after figures showed export growth fell nearly a fifth last month.Some analysts say that with inflation clearly not a threat, China will have room to loosen policies to bolster the economy if it needs to.\u201cLow inflation could be good news for markets, as monetary tightening is definitely not justified,\u201d said Ting Lu, an economist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. \u201cLow inflation gives the People\u2019s Bank of China more room to ease the liquidity situation and tame rising rates.\u201dAfter 30 years of annual growth rates that averaged at least 10 percent, China\u2019s maturing economy is shifting gears and moving into slower but high-quality growth, away from its previous export- and investment-driven model.But the transition has not been easy. Much of the data this year have showed factories fighting low business orders over multiple months and export growth whipsawing, unnerving global investors.That has led a growing number of analysts to say that China may need to ease policies to support growth if it wishes to meet its annual growth target of 7.5 percent, slightly below last year\u2019s 7.7 percent expansion.Yet it is not clear that the target is binding. China\u2019s finance minister said last week that it was would be all right if China missed its economic growth target slightly, as long as enough jobs were created, suggesting that Beijing was ready to stomach slower growth to make room for sweeping overhauls.For some economists, however, China\u2019s stubbornly weak producer prices are worrying.These prices have fallen every month for two years, and producer deflation shows no signs of abating. The producer price index fell by its most in seven months in February.Prices were down across the board, including for means of production and raw materials, both of which were at their weakest levels in seven months.Analysts do not agree on what is driving producer prices lower.

Some aviation experts say it is gaining steam as the search in the South Indian Ocean, one of the most remote and windy places on the planet, continues in an area somewhere between the size of West Virginia and the United States. Now, what is the zombie scenario? Well, it\u2019s a spooky possibility. That this Triple Seven, after making its famous left turn, flew on autopilot for hours with its crew and passengers incapacitated before crashing into the sea or, if you happen to think the Northern Corridor option is still open, in Central Asia. Of course, there are many theories floating around and vertical gyrations are not an autopilot maneuver and no theory at this point connects all the dots and that is why we have an investigation and why we intend to stay on top of this story.NEWS FLASH: President Vladimir Putin of Russia has invaded Crimea.Interesting development there, but back to our main story. We can reveal that everything is still on the table. There is so much inconsistent information on Flight 370 that it is frankly anyone\u2019s guess as to what to take as gospel. But here\u2019s some more breaking news: Today\u2019s search is more visual, less technical. That\u2019s because satellites from three countries have spotted what could be debris or even a wooden pallet from the plane floating in the rough seas of the \u201cRoaring Forties,\u201d where winds howl around the bottom of the world. Now the satellite images are blurry. There\u2019s lots of junk in the sea. Wooden pallets are used in airline cargo holds but also in shipping. And, as you know, there were lots of missteps early on by the Malaysian authorities. Information from them has been a mess. So everything is pretty sketchy. Right now we just need a better haystack.NEWS FLASH: President Vladimir Putin of Russia has annexed Crimea.My apologies for these interruptions, folks; we will keep them to a minimum as we move forward with the mystery of Flight 370 on which, incidentally, lamb satay with peanut sauce was almost certainly served to Business Class and peanuts to Economy just before the flight\u2019s transponder stopped. Here\u2019s some breaking news: Contrary to rumors, the last computer transmission from the plane showed no route change. Is that a game changer? No. But it could undermine theories about the pilots preplanning a hijacking. On the other hand, isn\u2019t it a coincidence too far that between Malaysian air space and Vietnamese air space, right in the dead zone, the plane disappears? Well, we\u2019ve been here before, folks. What we need is solid evidence!NEWS FLASH: President Vladimir Putin of Russia has massed troops on the eastern Ukrainian border.Other developments, schmother developments: Brian Bowman here bringing you the latest on Flight 370. I must relate a conversation I had with my neighbor this morning. I said I wondered where the plane went, and she said we\u2019ll find out soon, and I asked what she meant, and she said, \u201cWell, they\u2019re coming for America.\u201d And I said \u201cHuh?\u201d and she said, well, they hijacked the plane to come for us. So I asked, \u201cWhy us?\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, who else would they be coming for?\u201d As you see, folks, people out there are getting pretty antsy. And here\u2019s some breaking news: Mathematical techniques inspired by an 18th-century Presbyterian minister might help locate the plane. And, gosh, why the heck did the Malaysian authorities hide the fact that this passenger plane was full of lithium batteries, a hazardous and highly inflammable cargo?NEWS FLASH: Russian troops have invaded eastern Ukraine.I\u2019ve talked to my producers, folks, and there\u2019ll be no more interruptions in our Flight 370 coverage.

{"Headline": "Extra Pay for Extra Work", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialFor the first 40 years of its existence, a worker\u2019s right to time-and-a-half for overtime, established by federal law in 1938, operated as intended. It guarded against exploitation and inequality by ensuring that extra hours meant extra pay. Since the mid-1970s, however, that right has been severely eroded. The law gives the Labor Department the authority to update the salary threshold and job descriptions that define who is eligible for overtime pay. The last meaningful update was in 1975, when the Ford administration raised the salary threshold significantly to account for inflation. In 2004, rule changes by the Bush administration, which remain in force today, basically locked in the law\u2019s by-then outdated and inadequate salary threshold, while giving employers more leeway to define workers in ways that make them ineligible for overtime pay. The most important change the department can make is to raise the salary threshold \u2014 the pay level below which all hourly and salaried workers are guaranteed overtime pay. Today\u2019s threshold, $455 a week, is unacceptably low, barely above the poverty level for a family of four. The Labor Department should set the new threshold at around $1,000 a week, which is where it would be if it simply had been adjusted for inflation since 1975. White House officials told reporters on Tuesday that the president will also ask the department to write rules to end the widespread business practice of misclassifying workers as administrators, supervisors or managers \u2014 designations that can exempt workers from overtime protection. But raising the salary threshold is even more important, because doing so would automatically grant overtime protection to many workers who are misclassified, without having to clarify or redefine their job duties. Given that rule-making is a laborious process, updating the overtime rules could easily take longer than the roughly two-and-a-half years that Mr. Obama has left in office. The president would thus do well to instruct the Labor Department to focus solely on raising the salary threshold, if needed, to get reform enacted promptly. Mr. Obama knows that it is not enough to say that Americans deserve a raise. He is also urging Congress to raise the federal minimum wage and has signed an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay their employees at least $10.10 an hour. New overtime rules are of a piece with those efforts, but, to make a difference, they need to get done \u2014 and soon. Advertisement"}

Three key, but very different, questions are often confused: Has climate change caused the current drought? Is it already influencing or affecting the drought (no matter its cause)? And how will climate change affect future droughts?The most rigorous answer to the \u201ccausality\u201d question for the California drought is neither yes nor no. We simply cannot say for certain.But this is the wrong question to ask. The current drought has certainly been exacerbated by climate change for one simple reason: Temperatures in California are now higher today, as they are globally. This alone increases water demand by crops and ecosystems, accelerates snowpack loss, and worsens evaporation from reservoirs. There are other complicating effects, but the influence of higher temperatures on drought is already real and cannot be ignored.We are now unambiguously altering the climate, threatening water supplies for human and natural systems. This is but one example of how even today we are paying the cost of unavoidable climate changes.Dr. Gleick is president of the Pacific Institute. Dr. Overpeck is a professor of geosciences and atmospheric sciences and Dr. Woodhouse is a professor of geography and geosciences at the University of Arizona, Tucson. \u00a0To the Editor:Farmers continue to grow alfalfa, rice and other thirsty crops. Their resource use has been heavily subsidized by the government. According to The Economist, they have paid a paltry 15 percent of the capital costs of the federal system that delivers much of the water to their fields. Thus, farmers have no incentive to irrigate their farmlands efficiently.After a few more weeks of the rainy season, much of California will bake, increasing the likelihood of wildfires. The water table has decreased in many areas, prompting farmers to drill deeper to reach groundwater, further depleting aquifers.In January Gov. Jerry Brown issued a drought declaration and urged Californians to cut water use by 20 percent. About $183 million in federal aid that has been pledged, coupled with $687 million in California aid, should bring some relief.However, we need details about how the funds will be spent, and much greater pressure needs to be directed at farmers.\u00a0To the Editor:Your article includes no mention of desalination plants. In many cases, digging deeper and deeper has not found any water. Why not do what Israel does with its drought areas and build these plants?\u00a0To the Editor:As California endures a historic drought, many are wondering why Gov. Jerry Brown supports expanding a practice that severely jeopardizes our water: hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.Fracking uses tremendous quantities of water that are permanently removed from our supply.

But we can no longer ignore these externalized costs, as we empty our lakes and aquifers to slake the industry\u2019s outsized thirst, erode our soils to grow mountains of animal feed, poison our oceans and waterways with excess manure, pesticides and fertilizer, and increase greenhouse gas emissions past the point of no return.Animal-based foods are cheap at the cash register, while the planet and the animals pay dearly.The writer is the United States representative for ACTAsia for Animals.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Israel to Phase Out Religious Exemptions", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 After years of heated public debate and political wrangling, Israel\u2019s Parliament on Wednesday approved landmark legislation that will eventually eliminate exemptions from compulsory military service for many ultra-Orthodox students enrolled in seminaries.The issue has become a social and political lightning rod in a country where most Jewish 18-year-olds are subjected to compulsory military service for up to three years. Many Israelis, who see conscription as part of a deeper culture war between the secular and modern Orthodox Jews and the ultra-Orthodox, have been demanding a more equitable sharing of the responsibilities of citizenship and voted in last year\u2019s elections on that basis.Yair Lapid, the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid, one of the parties that promoted the new legislation in the governing coalition, wrote on his Facebook page soon after the vote, \u201cTo the 543,458 citizens of Israel who elected Yesh Atid: Today you have passed the equal sharing of the burden.\u201dBut the law, approved by 65-to-1, is unlikely to allay the acrimony over ultra-Orthodox recruitment and might even exacerbate tensions. The opposition in the 120-seat Parliament, the Knesset, boycotted the vote in an uproar over what it has called unfair political dealing within the coalition as it moved to pass military service legislation and two other contentious bills this week.Ultra-Orthodox leaders have reacted with fury and are threatening to roll back the slow, voluntary trend that was already underway in their community toward military and national service. And nongovernmental monitoring groups immediately petitioned Israel\u2019s Supreme Court, seeking to overturn the new law on grounds that it does not go far enough in enforcing the principle of equality.For one thing, the law includes an adjustment period of three years in which increased service will be encouraged but not mandatory. It also gives the ultra-Orthodox, known as Haredim, or those who fear God, a choice between military service and civilian national service, unlike ordinary recruits, and it allows students at seminaries, or yeshivas, to defer service for several years beyond the age of 18.\u201cThe whole idea that the law promotes equality is not really convincing,\u201d said Prof. Mordechai Kremnitzer, vice president of research at the Israel Democracy Institute, an independent research organization here, and former dean of the law faculty at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.By the end of the three-year period, Professor Kremnitzer said, there will be new elections and a new government, possibly including Haredi parties, \u201cand the whole law would become thin air.\u201d Given the delay, he said, \u201cIt is questionable whether the Knesset accomplished anything.\u201dMoshe Gafni of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party, said, \u201cToday Israel lost the right to be called a Jewish state,\u201d according to the Ynet Hebrew news site. He said the Haredim \u201cwill not forget or forgive\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his associates for what he called the affront to the Haredi public and to Torah study.Until a year ago Mr. Netanyahu and the Haredi parties were political allies. Those parties are not in the current coalition after years of having wielded disproportionate political power as coalition linchpins.In the streets and at the ballot box, mainstream Israelis have displayed growing resentment over benefits granted for decades to members of the ultra-Orthodox community who chose full-time Torah study. Many Israelis view the enlistment of the ultra-Orthodox minority and its integration into the work force as crucial for the country\u2019s economy and viability. The ultra-Orthodox sector now makes up about 10 percent of the population of 8 million, but favoring large families, it is expanding rapidly.The law sets modest annual quotas for the drafting of yeshiva students for military or national service and holds open the threat of criminal penalties against those who evade the draft if the quotas are not met voluntarily by mid-2017 \u2014 an unlikely possibility that has nonetheless enraged ultra-Orthodox opponents.The roots of the tensions date to the founding of the state of Israel in 1948. David Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister, granted full-time yeshiva students state financing and exemption from army service to refill the ranks of Torah scholarship decimated in the Holocaust. At the time 400 students were of draftable age. Today there are tens of thousands.In 2012, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court invalidated a law that formalized exemptions for yeshiva students, ruling that it contradicted the principle of equality. The new legislation will face a similar test, though the court deliberations could proceed for at least a year.Israel\u2019s parliamentary opposition, led by Isaac Herzog, leader of the Labor Party, was not uniformly against the new law. But the opposition took the unusual measure of boycotting the discussions in the full assembly and the votes on this and two other bills. Opposition members argued that democratic debate had been stifled because the coalition parties made a pact that all their members would vote for all three pieces of legislation. On their own, none of the bills would have garnered a majority.One of the bills, which passed into law on Tuesday, raises the electoral threshold for political parties from two percent to 3.25 percent \u2014 a move that could harm the electoral chances of small parties, including those that represent the politically fragmented Arab minority. Another bill, which passed later Thursday, calls for a national referendum on any withdrawal from sovereign Israeli territory as part of a future peace treaty with Israel\u2019s Arab neighbors.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Unskilled and Destitute Are Hiring Targets for Fukushima Cleanup", "Date": "2014-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNARAHA, Japan \u2014 \u201cOut of work? Nowhere to live? Nowhere to go? Nothing to eat?\u201d the online ad reads. \u201cCome to Fukushima.\u201dThat grim posting targeting the destitute, by a company seeking laborers for the ravaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, is one of the starkest indications yet of an increasingly troubled search for workers willing to carry out the hazardous decommissioning at the site.The plant\u2019s operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, known as Tepco, has been shifting its attention away, leaving the complex cleanup to an often badly managed, poorly trained, demoralized and sometimes unskilled work force that has made some dangerous missteps. At the same time, the company is pouring its resources into another plant, Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, that it hopes to restart this year as part of the government\u2019s push to return to nuclear energy three years after the world\u2019s second-worst nuclear disaster. It is a move that some members of the country\u2019s nuclear regulatory board have criticized.That shift in attention has translated into jobs at Fukushima that pay less and are more sporadic, chasing away qualified workers. Left behind, laborers and others say, is a work force often assembled by fly-by-night labor brokers with little technical or safety expertise and even less concern about hiring desperate people. Police and labor activists say some of the most aggressive of the brokers have mob ties.Regulators, contractors and more than 20 current and former workers interviewed in recent months say the deteriorating labor conditions are a prime cause of a string of large leaks of contaminated water and other embarrassing errors that have already damaged the environment and, in some cases, put workers in danger. In the worst-case scenario, experts fear, struggling workers could trigger a bigger spill or another radiation release.\u201cThere is a crisis of manpower at the plant,\u201d said Yukiteru Naka, founder of Tohoku Enterprise, a contractor and former plant engineer for General Electric. \u201cWe are forced to do more with less, like firemen being told to use less water even though the fire\u2019s still burning.\u201dThat crisis was especially evident one dark morning last October, when a crew of contract workers was sent to remove hoses and valves as part of a long-overdue upgrade to the plant\u2019s water purification system.According to regulatory filings by Tepco, the team received only a 20-minute briefing from their supervisor and were given no diagrams of the system they were to fix and no review of safety procedures \u2014 a scenario a former supervisor at the plant called unthinkable. Worse yet, the laborers were not warned that a hose near the one they would be removing was filled with water laced with radioactive cesium.As the men shambled off in their bulky protective gear, their supervisor, juggling multiple responsibilities, left to check on another crew. They chose the wrong hose, and a torrent of radioactive water began spilling out. Panicked, the workers thrust their gloved hands into the water to try to stop the leak, spraying themselves and two other workers who raced over to help.Although the workers received significant exposures, Shigeharu Nakachi, an expert in the health effects of pollution, said it was not enough to cause radiation sickness. Still, he said such exposures were \u201csomething that should be avoided at all cost.\u201dTepco has refused to say how experienced these workers were, but according to regulatory filings, the company that hired them signed a contract for the work a week before the leak. Tepco also refused to say whether the contractor procured them from labor brokers, which is an often illegal if widely accepted part of hiring at nuclear plants. In a written reply to questions, Tepco said it was \u201cnot in a position to comment on the employment practices\u201d of its contractors.Similarly, Tepco has refused to divulge a full accounting of a recent leak at the plant \u2014 the worst spill in six months \u2014 which occurred when workers filling storage tanks with contaminated water remotely diverted it into the wrong tank. But even the scant information available points to confusion by workers. They ignored alarms warning of an overflow because so many tanks are near capacity, alarms ring all the time. No one noticed that water levels in the tank that was supposed to be receiving the water never rose.\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely elementary mistake,\u201d Toyoshi Fuketa, a commissioner at the Nuclear Regulation Authority, said at a recent hearing. \u201cIf a fire alarm went off in your house, you\u2019d be worried, let alone a nuclear power plant.\u201dTepco\u2019s deputy nuclear chief, Masayuki Ono, later explained that \u201cit did not occur to us to actually go to the scene to check.\u201dAt the heart of the plant\u2019s problems is a multitiered hiring system in the nuclear industry that critics have long said allowed the large utilities that run the plants to distance themselves from troubles that arise. Under the system, it hires contractors who parcel out work to several layers of subcontractors. At the bottom, subjected to the dirtiest work, are the so-called \u201cnuclear Gypsies\u201d \u2014 itinerant laborers lured by the industry\u2019s generally good wages.The accident has only magnified the problems the system allows. According to company records, contract workers at Fukushima Daiichi receive, on average, more than twice the radiation exposure of Tepco employees. The layered system, many say, also allows for relatively little oversight by Tepco.In a recent interview, a Tepco spokeswoman said that the company regularly evaluated its contractors and required them to provide their workers with a class on the basics of radiation. (She denied charges of widespread cheating made by some workers.)But at a news conference last month, the chief nuclear regulator, Shunichi Tanaka, said, \u201cThere is a subcontracting structure that means even workers from third- or fourth-level contractors work at the site, and Tepco does not have a clear picture of what\u2019s happening on the ground.\u201dMr. Naka, the contractor who talked of a manpower crisis, said many of his best engineers \u2014 including those who battled explosions and fires in the early days of the crisis \u2014 have either quit, or cannot work at the plant because they have reached legal radiation limits for the year.Yoshitatsu Uechi is one of the people who has stepped in for more experienced workers. A former bus driver and construction worker, Mr. Uechi has never before worked at a nuclear plant.He was paid about $150 a day to work on one of the plant\u2019s most pressing jobs: building tanks to store the vast quantities of contaminated water at the site. He describes hurried days, saying he was told at one point by his contractor to continue sealing the seams of the tanks despite rain and snow that made the sealant slide off.He believes such slipshod work eventually compromised the tanks, some of which have since leaked.\u201cI spoke out many times on the defects, but nobody listened,\u201d said Mr. Uechi, a father of four who says he left Okinawa and its depressed economy for Fukushima to provide a better life for his children. He said he rarely saw Tepco managers while on the job. He said he expressed his worries not only to his immediate bosses, but to Tepco. (Asked about the complaints, Tepco said it could not discuss individual workers out of privacy concerns.)Tepco has promised to increase pay to make up for the risky and unstable nature of the work. Still, workers eating dinner at a dormitory near the plant were skeptical, especially over whether they would receive any extra money.\u201cOnce the many levels of contractors skim off their share, there\u2019s not very much left for us,\u201d one worker in his 40s said, as he and two colleagues washed down a simple meal of chicken, eggplant and rice with beer and whiskey.Each of the men \u2014 who feared being fired if their names were used \u2014 were housed in tiny rooms with a bed and a desk. The area around the dormitory is mainly deserted since many people refused to move back after the accident.Workers say there is little to do at night other than watch TV, play roulette at a tiny game center, and drink. A store inside \u201cJ-Village\u201d \u2014 Tepco\u2019s base outside the plant \u2014 sells beer, whiskey and sake. According to several accounts, alcoholism is rampant, and one worker said he and his colleagues sometimes showed up for work hung over.Struggling to maintain 3,000 workers at the plant \u2014 compared with 4,500 at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant \u2014 labor brokers are getting desperate. Mostly chased away by labor activists from urban areas where day laborers and homeless people congregate, the brokers have increasingly taken their pleas online and made clear their standards are low.One ad, for work involving radiation monitoring, said, \u201cYou must have common sense, and be able to carry out a conversation.\u201dAlthough it is unclear if any workers were living on the streets before they came to the plant, laborers and others familiar with the work force say many people there are living on the edge.\u201cWe\u2019re talking people who are basically living hand-to-mouth.\u201d said Hiroyuki Watanabe, a City Council member in nearby Iwaki.One worker who refused to give his name said he was already so vulnerable that he ended up homeless when he lost his job cleaning contaminated mud off workers\u2019 boots. Another, hired to check for cracks at the plant\u2019s reactors, said he arrived after losing his factory job and losing a place to live when he broke up with his girlfriend.The labor broker he said that he worked with, a company called Takahashi Kensetsu, did not ask about his credentials.He says he was often unsure what he was checking for on the reactors, and received little explanation of potential hazards. After his pay was delayed and he was denied overtime, he quit. He has since won some back pay with help from the local labor standards office.Takahashi Kensetsu had disappeared by then \u2014 empty beer cans and comic books littered its empty offices during a recent visit \u2014 so the labor advocates got the money from the contractor that hired the broker. Takahashi Kensetsu could not be found in an official local business registry, and repeated calls to the number listed in its ad rang with no answer. Other contractors in Fukushima and labor activists, say Takahashi Kensetsu is affiliated with a local chapter of Inagawa-kai, one of Japan\u2019s largest organized crime groups, or yakuza. Workers, contractors and lawyers say the yakuza has long been involved in providing workers to nuclear plants, and at least one contractor penalized over labor-law abuses at Fukushima was identified by the police as having ties to the yakuza.\u201cTokyo Electric has no idea who\u2019s really handling the job on the ground,\u201d said Takeshi Katsura, who helped the worker win back pay. \u201cIt\u2019s a free-for-all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was more expensive \u2014 2,700 meticais ($85.50) a night \u2014 but included good air-conditioning and Internet access on request. (The latter was especially welcome; after a short stay in the city you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking Maputo was the term in the local Changana language for \u201cland without Wi-Fi.\u201d)After lodging was paid for, all I had to do to keep costs under control was avoid expat haunts and dive into the messy Mozambican crowds.Those crowds are everywhere \u2014 on the nearly destroyed sidewalks around the decaying colonial buildings of the Baixa neighborhood, and on broader avenues named (with Portuguese spellings) after leaders presumably admired by the Soviet-allied, viva-a-revolu\u00e7\u00e3o-style government that ruled the decade after independence, in 1975: Avenida Ho Chi Min, Avenida Vladimir Lenine, Avenida Mao Tse Tung, Avenida Kwame Nkrumah.There are the standard visits, like Feima, a market of outdoor restaurants, art and crafts in the Parque dos Continuadores, a leafy, refreshing break from the city\u2019s bustle. And, less successfully, the Mercado de Peixe, the fish market by the beach \u2014 did I mention Maputo had a beach? \u2014 where you buy your seafood and pay one of the restaurants at the back of the market to cook it up for you. It sounds great (and my tiger prawns were huge, fresh and delicious), but from start to finish I was mobbed by salesmen hawking not just fish but key chains, toy helicopters, camera lenses and sunglasses.There\u2019s also the Feira Popular, a square block of poignantly aging amusement park rides alongside midrange restaurants, and the Mercado Municipal, in a grand old colonial hall that is a replica of the original built in 1901, where fruit and vegetable, fish and nut vendors were chatty and ready with at least basic English. One passed an indirect marriage proposal to me through her neighbor; I declined. But I did pick up a hefty bag of cashews coated with peri peri chile powder for 100 meticais.But my most memorable market experience happened by accident. Walking along Avenida Ho Chi Min, I was drawn to an opening in a rather grim concrete wall plastered with political posters. When I peeked around the women standing at the entrance, I caught sight of a claustrophobic, smoky den of food stalls. What was this, I asked them? And was it safe for a camera-toting foreigner to go in?It was, they said, although that did not stop them (or several others inside) from requesting that I buy them a beer. I declined all around, and set out looking for the least unclean looking of the cagelike stalls built of wood and chicken wire, with roofs made of corrugated metal sheets that were collapsing in more places than not \u2014 although rays of sun passing through caught the smoke from the stoves, like sun streaming into a cathedral.Hearty meals sold for the standard price of 80 meticais, and Bartolomeu, a friendly construction worker, convinced me I\u2019d be safe at the stand where he was eating a whole fried mackerel and a heap of spaghetti. I asked him why he ate here and not, say, in the Feira Popular. \u201cThis place is for workers,\u201d he said.The stand was run by a starkly beautiful woman, with a more professional air that set her apart. She was in a sharp white blouse with squared embroidered neck and a purple head scarf. I sat down near Bartolomeu, ordered what he was having and lived to tell the tale. (I have a strong stomach; your results may vary.)I did not find them on my own; in fact, I had been speeding through the rooms in order to check off the museum on a busy final day. But a young staff member, sensing, I think, I was rushing, told me I should be sure not to miss the elephant display and directed me to it. By then, I knew that was not a lucky break \u2014 it was just another Maputan clueing in a visitor on the best of his city.slide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Russia Can\u2019t Afford Another Cold War", "Date": "2014-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseRussian troops pour over a border. An autocratic Russian leader blames the United States and unspecified \u201cradicals and nationalists\u201d for meddling. A puppet leader pledges fealty to Moscow. It\u2019s no wonder the crisis in Ukraine this week drew comparisons to Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 or that a chorus of pundits proclaimed the re-emergence of the Cold War.But there\u2019s at least one major difference between then and now: Moscow has a stock market.Under the autocratic grip of President Vladimir Putin, Russia may be a democracy in name only, but the gyrations of the Moscow stock exchange provided a minute-by-minute referendum on his military and diplomatic actions. On Monday, the Russian stock market index, the RTSI, fell more than 12 percent, in what a Russian official called panic selling. The plunge wiped out nearly $60 billion in asset value \u2014 more than the exorbitant cost of the Sochi Olympics. The ruble plunged on currency markets, forcing the Russian central bank to raise interest rates by one and a half percentage points to defend the currency. Mr. Putin \u201cseems to have stopped a potential invasion of Eastern Ukraine because the RTS index slumped by 12 percent\u201d on Monday, said Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Mr. Putin seems to be \u201cfollowing the old Soviet playbook,\u201d in Ukraine, Strobe Talbott, an expert on the history of the Cold War, told me this week. \u201cBut back then, there was no concern about what would happen to the Soviet stock market. If, in fact, Putin is cooling his jets and might even blink, it\u2019s probably because of rising concern about the price Russia would have to pay.\u201d Mr. Talbott is the president of the Brookings Institution, a former ambassador at large who oversaw the breakup of the former Soviet Union during the Clinton administration and the author of \u201cThe Russia Hand.\u201dRussia is far more exposed to market fluctuations than many countries, since it owns a majority stake in a number of the country\u2019s largest companies. Gazprom, the energy concern that is Russia\u2019s largest company by market capitalization, is majority-owned by the Russian Federation. At the same time, Gazprom\u2019s shares are listed on the London stock exchange and are traded over the counter as American depositary receipts in the United States as well as on the Berlin and Paris exchanges. Over half of its shareholders are American, according to J. P. Morgan Securities. And the custodian bank for its depository receipts is the Bank of New York Mellon.Many Russian companies and banks are fully integrated into the global financial system. This week, Glencore Xstrata, the mining giant based in Switzerland, was in the middle of a roughly $1 billion debt-to-equity refinancing deal with the Russian oil company Russneft. Glencore said it expected to complete the deal despite the crisis. Glencore\u2019s revenue last year was substantially larger than the entire gross domestic product of Ukraine, which was $176 billion, according to the World Bank.The old Soviet Union, in stark contrast, was all but impervious to foreign economic or business pressure, thanks in part to an ideological commitment to self-sufficiency. As recently as 1985, foreign trade amounted to just 4 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, and nearly all that was with the communist satellite countries of Eastern Europe. But the Soviet Union\u2019s economic insularity and resulting economic stagnation was a major cause of the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. According to Mr. Talbott, the Soviet Union\u2019s president at the time, Mikhail Gorbachev, was heavily influenced by Soviet economists and other academics who warned that by the turn of the century in 2000, the Soviet economy would be smaller than South Korea\u2019s if it did not introduce major economic reforms and participate in the global economy. Even before this week\u2019s gyrations, the Russian stock market index had dropped near 8 percent last year, and it and the Russian economy have been suffering from low commodity prices and investor concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s tapering of bond purchases \u2014 factors of little significance during the Cold War. By contrast, today \u201cRussia is too weak and vulnerable economically to go to war,\u201d Mr. Aslund said. \u201cThe Kremlin\u2019s fundamental mistake has been to ignore its economic weakness and dependence on Europe. Almost half of Russia\u2019s exports go to Europe, and three-quarters of its total exports consist of oil and gas. The energy boom is over, and Europe can turn the tables on Russia after its prior gas supply cuts in 2006 and 2009. Europe can replace this gas with liquefied natural gas, gas from Norway and shale gas. If the European Union sanctioned Russia\u2019s gas supply to Europe, Russia would lose $100 billion or one-fifth of its export revenues, and the Russian economy would be in rampant crisis.\u201dDuring the Cold War, there were few, if any, Russian billionaires. Today, there are 111, according to Forbes magazine\u2019s latest rankings, and Russia ranks third in the number of billionaires, behind the United States and China. The economist noted that the billionaire Russian elite \u2014 who are pretty much synonymous with Mr. Putin\u2019s friends and allies \u2014 are the ones who would be severely affected by visa bans, which were imposed by President Obama on Thursday. Other penalties might include asset freezes. Many Russian oligarchs have real estate and other assets in Europe and the United States, like the Central Park West penthouse a trust set up by the Russian tycoon Dmitry Rybolovlev bought for $88 million. \u201cThis is what may have already forced Putin to retreat,\u201d the Russian economist said. And while the Cold War was a global contest between Marxism and capitalism, there is today \u201cno real ideological component to the conflict except that Putin has become the personification of rejecting the West as a model,\u201d Mr. Talbott said. \u201cHe wants to promote a Eurasian community dominated by Moscow, but that\u2019s not an ideology. Russia\u2019s economy may be an example of crony capitalism, but it is capitalism. There\u2019s not even a shadow of Marxism-Leninism now.\u201d What brought down the old Soviet Union and ended the Cold War \u201cwas the economic imperative to make Russia into a modern, efficient, normal state, a player in the international economy, not because of military power but because of a strong economy,\u201d Mr. Talbott continued. But \u201cto have a modern economy, you need the rule of law and a free press.\u201d Mr. Putin, he said, \u201cisn\u2019t advancing Russia\u2019s progress.\u201dThe Russian economist agreed. \u201cThe pre-2008 social compact was that Putin would rule Russia while Russians would see growing incomes,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, the growth has stalled, and he needs ideology, coupled with propaganda and repressions. Apparently, the Soviet restoration is the only ideology he can come up with.\u201dRussia does have uniquely strong ties to Ukraine. \u201cOf all the former provinces of the old Soviet Union, it\u2019s the most painful to have lost and the one many Russians would most want to have back,\u201d Mr. Talbott said. \u201cThe ties between Kiev and Moscow go back over 300 years. Ukraine is the heart of Russian culture.\u201d With Russian troops entrenched in the Crimean peninsula and some Russian Ukrainians clamoring for annexation, there may be little the United States or its allies can do to restore the status quo. \u201cContainment, in a muted and modified way, will once again be the strategy of the West and the mission of NATO,\u201d Mr. Talbott predicted. But not another Cold War, which is surely a good thing. \u201cA propaganda war is completely feasible,\u201d the Russian economist said. \u201cThe recent events were completely irrational, angering the West for no reason. This is what is most scary, especially for businesses. Instead of reforming the stagnating economy, Putin scared everybody for no reason and with no gain in sight. So it is hard to predict his next actions. But I think a real Cold War is unlikely.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misstated the purchaser of a Central Park West penthouse. It was a trust set up by the Russian tycoon Dmitry Rybolovlev, not Mr. Rybolovlev himself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine Crisis Limits Merkel\u2019s Rapport With Putin", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel, a Protestant pastor\u2019s daughter, grew up in East Germany under a system in which President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia served as a K.G.B. agent stationed in Dresden. Fluent in Russian, she literally speaks his language and, arguably, understands his view of the world better than any other European leader touched by the Ukrainian crisis.With that shared background, not to speak of the extensive economic ties between the countries, Ms. Merkel has emerged as a pivotal leader in the crisis that erupted after Russian forces overran Crimea late last month, the only one whose advice Mr. Putin might heed. But for all the familiarity, and despite hundreds of hours spent together during their years as leaders of their respective countries, Ms. Merkel has so far been unable to bridge the gap with Mr. Putin, whose German is also good.If anything, as the days dwindle before a Crimean referendum on secession, that gap is widening, and now Ms. Merkel is facing a perhaps historic decision on whether to take a harder line against Russia.Since the first Russian forces infiltrated Crimea on Feb. 28, Ms. Merkel, 59, has spoken to Mr. Putin, 61, at least four times on the phone, her spokesman says. In the space of 10 days, she went from warning him to avoid \u201cany step that could contribute to escalation\u201d to bluntly telling him that Crimea\u2019s plans for a referendum on joining Russia are \u201cillegal.\u201dAfter one recent conversation with the Russian leader, she now-famously remarked to President Obama that Mr. Putin was in \u201canother world.\u201d She appears exasperated by his unwillingness to avoid further provocative steps, much less de-escalate the crisis, and her government is increasingly signaling a willingness to depart from its preferred approach of consensus building and lead Europe toward a harder line on sanctions and other steps to pressure and isolate Russia.Germany and Russia have been trading and warring for centuries, of course, and it was a German-born princess who became czarina, Catherine the Great, who first conquered and absorbed Crimea into Russia in the 18th century. Germany was squarely on the fault line between East and West in the Cold War, and this direct knowledge of division sends a special shudder through Germany\u2019s establishment today as the threat of a new European divide looms.Germany is dependent on Russia for up to a one-third of its oil and gas and tens of billions of dollars in trade, while it is also a leading member of NATO, a pillar of Western policy and the biggest economy in the 28-nation European Union.Since the 1970s, when Chancellor Willy Brandt embarked on Ostpolitik, or conciliation with the East, the German answer in reconciling those competing tugs has been to promote dialogue. But now, with an unwilling, even intransigent, Mr. Putin, that policy may be now exhausted.\u201cThere is no compromise in sight,\u201d said Alexander Rahr, a longtime Kremlin observer and the head of the German-Russian Forum, a nongovernmental group in Berlin. \u201cNobody really wants to move toward the other.\u201dMs. Merkel\u2019s pleas to refrain from the annexation of Crimea are now outdated, he suggested, given the apparent popularity of Mr. Putin\u2019s move in Russia, which governed Crimea for two centuries before the Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev gave it to Ukraine in 1954.\u201cHe cannot turn back,\u201d Mr. Rahr said of Mr. Putin and \u201cshe is not helping him out of the situation.\u201dIn the absence of diplomatic progress, the European Union intends to move forward with tougher sanctions next Monday, and to sign, probably next Thursday, the political part of the Association Agreement with Ukraine that first sparked unrest in Kiev in November, Ms. Merkel and Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland announced on Wednesday.Speaking after talks in Warsaw, Ms. Merkel said she thought the West would need \u201ca great deal of patience\u201d before the Ukraine crisis is over. The ultimate way forward lies through diplomacy, she said, but noted that six days had elapsed since the European Union demanded a Contact Group bringing together Russia, Ukraine and other powers, making sanctions almost unavoidable.\u201cWe are in the 21st century,\u201d she told reporters, speaking of Europe. \u201cWe don\u2019t solve conflicts militarily, we\u2019ve said that. But we also don\u2019t try to avoid conflicts.\u201dAnd the current crisis, she said, \u201cis a very serious conflict in Europe.\u201dBefore Ms. Merkel\u2019s visit, Mr. Tusk took a highly unusual swipe at Germany and the chancellor as Poland proudly marked the 15th anniversary of its NATO membership.\u201cGermany\u2019s reliance on Russian gas can effectively limit European sovereignty, I have no doubt,\u201d he said, according to the news agency Reuters. \u201cI\u2019ll be speaking very openly with Merkel, making it clear that the existing climate and natural gas policies risk posing a threat to the security and sovereignty of Europe as a whole.\u201dGermany has pioneered alternative energy policies since Ms. Merkel mandated the gradual shutdown of nuclear power plants in the aftermath of the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan in 2011. Poland, which wants to reduce its dependence on Russian gas, hopes shale gas discoveries will gradually help, and in the meantime relies heavily on polluting brown coal to generate power.In recent years, Mr. Tusk said, Germany \u201chas been a strong example\u201d of where dependency on Russian energy can lead.Even so, faced with the unnerving possibility that dialogue will produce nothing in Ukraine, German leaders are sounding increasingly resigned to tighter European Union sanctions on Russia over Crimea, if only, perhaps, to draw Russia back to the bargaining table.\u201cSanctions hurt both sides, that\u2019s quite clear,\u201d Germany\u2019s defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, said Monday. \u201cBut if you look at the numbers, Russia has 15 percent of its G.D.P. depending on trade with Europe, Europe only 1 percent,\u201d she added. \u201cThat means that the reliance on a functioning business relationship with Europe is much, much bigger in Russia.\u201dThat is why sanctions should prod the oligarchs and Russian business, she contended, to lean on Mr. Putin \u201cto bring him back on to the track of talks \u2014 he must open a dialogue.\u201dThe Ukrainian crisis has increasingly brought a military response that unsettles Germans, who have largely renounced the militarism that brought World Wars I and II.The German news media has given prominent play to reports that 12 extra F-16 fighter jets were sent to Poland, whose air force already has 48 such jets, after six F-15s were sent to the Baltic states last week and reconnaissance planes were deployed in Poland and Romania.In a strong indication of how worried even conservatives are about losing good contact with Russia, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Wednesday gave a statement to Bild, the country\u2019s biggest-circulation newspaper, saying that \u201cgreat omissions\u201d had been made in policy toward Ukraine. \u201cThe mood of revolt in Ukraine was not intelligently followed. Equally there was a lack of sensitivity in the dealings with our Russian neighbor, especially President Putin,\u201d he said.\u201cWe cannot forget: War is not policy,\u201d he added.Ms. Merkel\u2019s governing partners, the Social Democrats, issued a similar warning. \u201cEurope stands dangerously close to the brink of a military confrontation,\u201d the party said this week in an unusually tense statement. \u201cOne hundred years after the start of World War I, military force should never again become the means of conducting politics.\u201d\u201cEurope stands at a crossroads,\u201d it added. \u201cWe must do everything in our power to prevent a new division of our continent and a regression into a pattern of confrontation long considered overcome.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Fifty years later, Mr. Judah says, London is notable for laundering Russian oligarchs\u2019 dirty laundry.London is now viewed as a global rival to New York. To understand how that has happened, you need to go back to 1986 and the deregulation of financial markets under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Today London is the largest foreign exchange trading market in the world. It has become the center for raising and trading share capital for enterprises in developing as well as developed economies.All of this carries high risk, as does the range of new activities that have developed in the last 30 years \u2014 hedge funds and private equity to name but two. Also, the ethos has changed, reflecting the new influence of American banks. What has not kept pace is regulation. Abuse of market procedures \u2014 whether in terms of setting interest or exchange rates \u2014 still has to be dealt with. This is London\u2019s real dirty laundry.So does the business generated by the Russian oligarchs influence markets, let alone British foreign policy? Highly doubtful.Will any of this affect moves to impose sanctions on Russia over its actions in Crimea? Again doubtful.

{"Headline": "Turkish Leader Deplores Unrest, Calling Demonstrators \u2018Fakers\u2019", "Date": "2014-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 Breaking his silence, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday condemned as \u201cfakers\u201d protesters who have been demonstrating across Turkey since Tuesday night, when a 15-year-old boy who had become a symbol of civilian resistance died after months in a coma.Mr. Erdogan said the protesters were trying to stir chaos before local elections set for late this month.\u201cThese are fakers, fakers,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said at an opening ceremony for a subway line in Ankara, the capital. \u201cThey have nothing to do with being democrats.\u201d\u201cThey do not believe in the ballot box, and can foresee their future, March 30, from now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because they do, they say, \u2018Let\u2019s inflict chaos; we may get results,\u2019 but they will not.\u201dThe boy, Berkin Elvan, was caught up in a demonstration on June 16 and struck in the head by a police tear-gas canister while out fetching bread for his family. After his death, thousands of people hit the streets in more than 15 Turkish cities. In Istanbul, scores of people were injured when the police used tear gas to stop them from reaching Taksim Square, the center of protests that began last May and were prompted by a government-backed plan to scrap Gezi Park, a beloved green spot, for a shopping mall.On Wednesday, rage and grief during the funeral procession for Berkin led to other mass confrontations with riot squads in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. An Istanbul man was shot dead in clashes between political youth groups late Wednesday night, and a police officer died of respiratory problems during protests, news outlets reported.\u201cFirst they tried with Gezi; they could not succeed,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said in a televised campaign speech. \u201cThen they started the Dec. 17 coup attempt, and could not succeed.\u201dMr. Erdogan and Fethullah Gulen, a cleric who leads a rival Islamic movement from his base in Pennsylvania, were allies and supporters of a legal campaign against the army, staunchly secular circles and critics of the government, until they broke ties during a power struggle last year.Responding to a question on a pro-government TV channel, Mr. Erdogan said he did not believe that the latest unrest would hurt the economy. After a dip in the stock market on Wednesday morning, \u201crates got back on track\u201d in the afternoon, he said.Mr. Erdogan has never mentioned Berkin or any of the eight other civilians who were killed by the police violence during last spring\u2019s protests, or sent condolences to families. However, he praised the security forces\u2019 performance in containing the gatherings.Many critics have pointed out that the death of a 17-year-old Egyptian girl, Asma Balgaty, who was killed by security forces in Cairo last August, brought Mr. Erdogan to tears during a television interview, yet he has seemed indifferent to the killings of Turkish youths.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Dakota Leads on the Road to Recovery", "Date": "2014-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsSIX years after the recession began, the United States has yet to return to where it was by any of three measures of economic activity: jobs, highway miles driven or house prices. That makes this business cycle unique among recent cycles \u2014 within four years of the recessions that began in 1981, 1990 and 2001, each of those indicators was up substantially.But within the current slow recovery over all, there is a wide gap in the performance of individual states, as can be seen in the accompanying charts.The indicators cover different areas of activity. The job count is an obvious measure of economic activity, and highway miles driven reflect how many people are driving to work each day, as well as how much is being shipped to stores. Home prices are critical in the current cycle because that was the area most directly affected by the credit crisis. At the top of all three measurements is North Dakota, a small state that has been transformed by the shale oil boom. Employment has soared by more than 25 percent, pushing up housing prices by almost a third. And the number of miles driven on the state\u2019s highways is up by about a fifth.At the bottom of the list, which is based on combining all three indicators for each state, is Florida. It is among the bottom 10 in each category, although it is not the worst in any of them. Nevada is at the bottom in terms of jobs and home prices, but perhaps oddly, the increase in driving has been greater there than in any state other than North Dakota. New York, on the other hand, has the largest decline in driving but is in the top 10 for job growth.Over all, 18 states now have more jobs than they did when the recession began. There are 15 states with higher home prices and 23 where more miles are being driven.The energy industry has been an important factor in most of the states that have done the best in adding jobs, and it has also played an important role in supporting home prices. There are signs of recovery in other areas. In 2013, the largest increases in home prices came in Nevada, California and Arizona \u2014 states where property values boomed and then collapsed. Florida and Nevada were also among the leaders in new jobs last year, although they are still well below prerecession levels in employment.Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

{"Headline": "Wishing They All Could Be California Hens", "Date": "2014-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATWATER, Calif. \u2014 Hens in California are living the good life. Many can now lay their eggs in oversize enclosures roomy enough to stand up, lie down \u2014 even extend their wings fully without touching another bird.Hens in most other states don\u2019t have it so good. Their conditions, as the head of California\u2019s egg trade group explained, are \u201clike you sitting in an airplane seat in the economy section all your life.\u201dSo if you\u2019re a hen, you want to live in California. Short of that, you want California-size leg room. And that\u2019s precisely what lawmakers in California are demanding of out-of-state farmers who sell eggs in California \u2014 setting off a feud over interstate commerce that has spilled over into the farmyard at large.The Missouri attorney general has filed a lawsuit to block the California egg rules, and at least three other states are considering doing the same. The beef and pork lobbies are also lining up against the California rules in an effort to prevent any new restrictions on raising livestock.\u201cThis is bigger than a case about egg production and bigger than a case simply about agriculture,\u201d said Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster. \u201cThese laws raise an important commerce clause question that affects many, many industries nationally, and I believe the courts need to respond.\u201dCalifornia voters set new standards for hen housing in 2008 when they approved a ballot measure that imposed more generous living conditions for egg layers in their state. When producers complained that the measure created a competitive disadvantage, the Legislature tacked on a law that mandated imported eggs be produced under the same standards.Those provisions, as well as similar laws going into effect in Michigan, Oregon and Washington State and under consideration elsewhere, inspired a national proposal to require more space for laying hens across the country, but Congress dropped it from the recently passed farm bill. Lawmakers and some companies have been responding to consumer pressure (including from several colleges) for better treatment of animals raised for food.The state\u2019s egg producers have already spent millions of dollars installing \u201ccolony cages,\u201d like those in two of the six barns at JS West & Companies\u2019 Dwight Bell Ranch here. On a recent visit, white leghorn hens craned their necks out of the cages to stare and cluck at strangers, then withdrew to the safety of perches or the privacy of the laying nest, neither of which is available in conventional cages. There are about 60 hens in each cage.The colony cages are about the size of a Ford F-150 pickup truck\u2019s flatbed, while about 90 percent of the nation\u2019s roughly 280 million laying hens are still in battery cages about as big as a filing-cabinet drawer. California\u2019s egg producers have interpreted their state\u2019s laws, which go into effect Jan. 1 next year, to require 116 square inches per bird, compared to the industry standard 67 square inches.Missouri, however, contends that California is trying to force the market in that direction, and at least three other states \u2014 Nebraska, Arkansas and the nation\u2019s largest egg producer, Iowa \u2014 are considering supporting its lawsuit, according to representatives of their attorneys general.Egg producers are warning that Californians, who consumed an estimated nine billion eggs last year, will almost certainly face higher prices as a result of the rules\u2019 import restrictions and effect on in-state producers. \u201cCome Jan. 1, I\u2019m fairly convinced there is going to be a fairly large shortage of eggs in California,\u201d said David Cisneros, chief operating officer of Dakota Layers, a large egg production company headquartered in South Dakota.Mr. Cisneros, who is based in Los Angeles where the company has its cage-free and other specialty egg business, previously worked for MoArk, the egg division of Land O\u2019 Lakes, which has closed down its California facilities. He said smaller egg farms were closing their doors because they could not afford the new housing systems.Larger California producers also are reducing their flocks. JS West, for instance, is reducing its flock to 1.4 million birds from 1.8 million, which will cut production to 372 million eggs from 480 million.Today, there are roughly 19 million laying hens in the state, which Ms. Benson estimated would drop to 10 million to 12 million next year. The state already has fewer hens than it needs to meet demand \u2014 which is why it imports eggs from states like Missouri. According to Attorney General Koster\u2019s lawsuit, about 540 million of the state\u2019s approximately 1.5 billion eggs end up in California.Already, Arnie Riebli, head of the Association of California Egg Farmers, and other producers, said retailers insisted on pricing eggs from hens living in colony cages as if they were cage-free and specialty eggs, even though the new systems are estimated to add only about a penny to the cost of producing an egg \u2014 the hens eat more but are slightly more productive and have a somewhat lower mortality rate.\u201cWe have no influence over what they charge, but if more eggs are produced this way, then the price is going to come down,\u201d Mr. Riebli said. \u201cIt\u2019s simple supply and demand.\u201dHe is pulling conventional cages out of the barns at Sunrise Farms in Petaluma where he is a partner, and either replacing them with colony cages or simply converting the barns into housing for cage-free and organically raised hens, which are becoming a bigger part of his business.He fought the new standards initially but had a change of heart after inviting people into his barns to see conditions there first hand. \u201cI brought people in for tours and showed them what we did \u2014 and women would break down sobbing,\u201d Mr. Riebli said. \u201cThe producers in other states don\u2019t want to hear about animal welfare, but they\u2019re ignoring what\u2019s going on among the public.\u201dHe noted that federal courts in California in general have ruled in favor of animal welfare advocates in other cases challenging state laws aimed at the humane treatment of livestock. Most recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld a California law prohibiting sale in the state of any foie gras produced by force-feeding birds, which was challenged as a violation of the interstate commerce clause by Hudson Valley Foie Gras L.L.C. and a group of Canadian producers.But Mr. Koster is undaunted by those precedents. \u201cI recognize that the California district courts and the Ninth Circuit have not been particularly friendly to this sort of assertion we\u2019re making here, but I also have confidence that will not be the last word on this analysis,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court is unlikely to allow a state to put this type of trade barrier in place in the agricultural arena or any other arena.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about an interstate commerce feud over California\u2019s demand that out-of-state farmers seeking to sell eggs in California meet its more stringent standards for hen housing misstated egg production at JS West & Companies, a leading California producer. The company expects production next year to drop to 372 million eggs from this year\u2019s 480 million \u2014 not to drop to 12 million from 19 million. The article also misstated the number of laying hens in California. It is 19 million, not 26 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Engages in Test of Will Over Ukraine", "Date": "2014-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin has left little doubt he intends to cripple Ukraine\u2019s new government, forcing it to make concessions or face the de facto partition of areas populated predominantly by ethnic Russians, from the Crimea to Odessa to the industrial heartland in the east.That strategy has been pursued aggressively by subterfuge, propaganda and bold military threat, taking aim as much at the United States and its allies in Europe as Ukraine itself. The pivotal question now for Kiev and Western capitals, is how boldly Mr. Putin continues to push his agenda, risking a more heated military and diplomatic conflict.So far, the Kremlin has shown no sign of yielding to international pressure \u2014 but it also has not taken the most provocative step yet, openly ordering Russian troops to reinforce those already in Crimea and expand its incursion into southern or eastern Ukraine.Mr. Putin has yet to make public remarks on the crisis in Ukraine, leaving his ultimate goals uncertain and unpredictable. Still, his strategy is aimed at blunting the impact of a popular uprising that sought to push the country away from Russia and deepen ties with Europe, and Mr. Putin has already left the fledgling government disorganized, discredited and forced to compromise on terms that would keep the country firmly within Russia\u2019s sphere of influence, especially regarding the Crimea peninsula.The Kremlin\u2019s pledge to protect compatriots in Ukraine from suppression of a Western-minded majority mirrors Russia\u2019s role in other disputed territories of the former Soviet republics over the years, including Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Those two breakaway regions of Georgia survived in a diplomatic limbo after the collapse of the Soviet Union with overt and covert Kremlin pressure until war erupted in 2008 and Russia routed ill-prepared Georgian troops.Russia brushed aside strong warnings from the United States and others at the time and recognized them as independent countries \u2014 and paid little price for it in the long run. Mr. Putin appears to be calculating again that Russia is too important for other countries to respond more forcefully, despite warnings like those by Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday that the United States would consider an array of sanctions that could include freezing assets and travel of senior officials here.\u201cAs brilliant as the man is, he has only one pattern,\u201d Nina L. Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at the New School in New York, said of Mr. Putin. Ms. Khrushcheva, the great-granddaughter of Nikita S. Khrushchev, whose decision to cede Crimea to Kiev\u2019s jurisdiction instead of Moscow\u2019s in 1954 is a disputed legacy at the heart of Russia\u2019s claims in Ukraine, added, \u201cIt\u2019s a clever pattern, but he has only one.\u201dThe stakes in Ukraine are, however, much higher than the war with Georgia. And given Ukraine\u2019s strategic position in the center of Europe, so are the risks. Russia has significant trade with Ukraine, but even more so with Europe. Its gas monopoly, Gazprom, has already made it clear that it was prepared to forgo discounts on natural gas that Russia offered the government of President Viktor F. Yanukovych and to collect on the debt Ukraine already owes. As it did in 2006 and 2009, Russia could turn off the supply to Ukraine. But since its pipelines pass west through Ukraine, that would mean cutting off Russia\u2019s largest customers in Europe, too.Any escalation of Russia\u2019s military intervention, especially if it meets resistance and bloodshed, will almost certainly rattle investors and plunge Russia\u2019s unsteady economy into free fall. With the value of the ruble already falling, there was quick speculation of a rocky start when the stock market opens on Monday.For now, such calculations appear to be secondary to the fury that the toppling of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government has caused inside the Kremlin. Ukraine has deep historical, social and religious connections to Russia that are often underestimated in the United States, especially. More significantly, Mr. Putin and the close circle of aides he relies on most, view the overthrow of Mr. Yanukovych as a coup orchestrated by the West to undercut Russia\u2019s vital interests.Sergei Utkin, the head of the Department of Strategic Assessment, part of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said that the relentless anti-Americanism on state media was in the past dismissed as crude propaganda that served a transparent political purpose but appeared now to reflect the actual worldview of the Kremlin. \u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe for Ukraine and for Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is that quite a few people in Russia don\u2019t understand the consequences. They believe the country is strong and can do whatever it wants to do.\u201dHow Mr. Putin perceives these events remains central to what happens next, experts said. Does he believe he has already succeeded by making clear that Russia has the will and the means to force its agenda in Ukraine? Or does he feel the job is only half done and that having stoked Russian nationalism, he has no choice but to plow ahead?The deployment of Russian troops across Crimea \u2014 which Mr. Peskov refused to acknowledge \u2014 has already effectively severed Crimea from Ukrainian control, even as it provoked tense confrontation with Ukrainian troops at some bases. It allowed a new regional leader to plead for Russia\u2019s protection and gave the Kremlin the pretense to oblige.Ethnic Russian supporters \u2014 abetted by Russia\u2019s secret services, according to Ukrainian and foreign officials \u2014 are now mounting demonstrations in other cities, including Kharkiv and Donetsk, that could lead to similar calls for Russian intervention.The unanimous vote by Russia\u2019s upper house of Parliament on Saturday night to authorize an intervention, after a debate that vilified the United States in ways reminiscent of the darkest periods of the Cold War, took place after the first Russian reinforcements had already begun arriving, according to Ukrainian and other Western officials. The vote nevertheless gave Mr. Putin a strong hand to play, threatening a much larger conventional military operation to protect \u201ccitizens and compatriots\u201d in Ukraine, as Mr. Putin said in telephone conversations with Mr. Obama and the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, according to the Kremlin.Mr. Peskov said that Mr. Putin had not yet ordered the operation but now had \u201cthe full array of options available to him\u201d if the crisis worsened. He emphasized that Russia supported a unified Ukraine, but also argued that the country\u2019s new leaders had violated the agreement brokered by the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Poland to establish a unity government that would leave Mr. Yanukovych in place as president until new elections in December.He suggested a diplomatic resolution would begin with a return to the terms of those agreements. That would mean the dismissal of the new interim government that the United States and others have already endorsed and the return of Mr. Yanukovych, who appeared on Friday at a surreal news conference in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don after dropping out of sight for a week. \u201cHe may be the last man to present himself for the presidency,\u201d Mr. Peskov said, reflecting the greatly diminished reputation of Mr. Yanukovych in Moscow now, \u201cbut he is the legitimate one.\u201dFor now, though, with a large-scale military exercise in western Russian already underway, the country felt very much on a war footing. By Sunday, an information campaign swept like an orchestrated gust through state-controlled news media. There were frenetic reports of clashes in Ukraine, of fascist threats to ethnic Russians and of the flight \u2014 entirely unsubstantiated \u2014 of 675,000 Ukrainians crossing Russia\u2019s frontier as refugees. (One channel, in fact, showed a short line of cars at Ukraine\u2019s border with Poland, not Russia.) The official Channel One network canceled its live broadcast of the Academy Awards early on Monday morning here.The voices of dissent struggled to be heard over the drums of war. Sergei S. Mitrokhin, the leader of the liberal Yabloko Party, denounced the Federation Council\u2019s vote as \u201cgiving a free hand to start a war with a brotherly people.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank of England Keeps Benchmark Rate at Record Low", "Date": "2014-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The Bank of England on Thursday decided to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low, as Britain\u2019s economic recovery continues and inflation appears to be stable.Britain\u2019s central bank said it would keep its key interest rate at 0.5 percent, where it has been since March 2009. The bank also left unchanged its stimulus program of holding 375 billion pounds, or $627 billion, in government bonds that it has purchased over the past five years.\u201cThere was no surprise at all to this decision,\u201d said David Tinsley, chief economist for the United Kingdom at BNP Paribas. \u201cThe U.K. economy is in a sweet spot with solid growth and falling inflation, so there is no pressure on the Bank of England to take policy action at the moment.\u201dBritain\u2019s economy grew 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter, after 0.8 percent growth in the third quarter, outpacing much of continental Europe.Inflation in January was 1.9 percent, slightly weaker than expected. Slowing inflation in the euro zone \u2014 at an annual rate of 0.8 percent \u2014 was not a deep enough concern for the European Central Bank to change tack on Thursday, when it announced it would keep interest rates at their current low of 0.25 percent.Wednesday marked the fifth anniversary of both record low interest rates in Britain, and of the government\u2019s bond-purchasing program, known as quantitative easing. What started as an unprecedented stimulus program, intended to save an economy in crisis, has almost become the norm.Some economists believe that purchases of government bonds \u2014 done in two major tranches from 2009 to 2012 \u2014 could end up pushing inflation higher because the Bank of England printed large quantities of money. There is concern about the impact that withdrawing the money will have. The central bank has indicated that it will not sell its stock of government bonds until it increases interest rates, which analysts do not expect to occur until 2015.Even then, the first step will be to stop reinvesting redemptions, not outright sales, Mr. Tinsley of BNP Paribas said.The bank on Thursday said it was reinvesting \u00a38.1 billion from government bonds held in the program that came due this month.Strong data, including lower-than-expected unemployment, has put the Bank of England in a bit of a bind. Last month, it abandoned its six-month strategy of \u201cforward guidance,\u201d or pledging to consider raising interest rates only when unemployment falls to 7 percent. The unemployment rate in Britain was 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter.The central bank announced that it would start to take into account a broader range of factors, including spare capacity in the economy, labor productivity and wage growth.Manufacturing data for February was slightly higher than in January, while service data showed a tiny drop. But the numbers remained strong and well into growth territory. At the same time, productivity and wage growth remained disappointing.When announcing the policy change, Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, emphasized that higher interest rates were still some way off and that any increase would be gradual. The central bank raised its growth forecast for 2014 again, to 3.4 percent from 2.8 percent, which it had forecast in November.\u201cAs yet the recovery is neither balanced nor sustainable,\u201d Mr. Carney said in February at a news conference, adding that the central bank would not risk messing up the recovery.Economists say the balancing act might get tougher. \u201cWe are seeing growth momentum in the U.K,\u201d said Allan Monks, an economics and policy strategist at JPMorgan in London. \u201cThe longer that continues, the greater the chance the Monetary Policy Committee will want to think about responding to that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Opponent of Mexico\u2019s Cartels Is Detained in Vigilantes\u2019 Deaths", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Hip\u00f3lito Mora often said that he started the first self-defense group in the Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n to end the boundless cruelty of the Knights Templar cartel \u2014 the killing, the extortion, and the monopolistic control it exerted over local lime growers. Now, a little over a year later, Mr. Mora, 58, whose ever-present cowboy hat and national commentary have made him the public face of Mexico\u2019s vigilante movement, is accused of the very same offenses.\u201cMora\u2019s arrest tells us about the risks of vigilantes, acting according to their own standards,\u201d said R\u00e1ul Ben\u00edtez Manaut, a security analyst at Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University. But, he added: \u201cThey are in a state where justice is a very relative thing; they are used to living in a context where justice dos not exist.\u201d\u201cThe arrest of Hip\u00f3lito Mora is a mistake,\u201d said Father Gregorio L\u00f3pez, a local Roman Catholic priest. \u201cHe is the only one not corrupted by criminals.\u201dMr. Mora and his men in the village of La Ruana have long had a testy relationship with the self-defense forces in the neighboring town of Buenavista, which are led by Luis Antonio Torres Gonzalez , known as \u201cEl Americano.\u201d In December, Mr. Mora could often be heard on his cellphone arguing with the Buenavista leadership over deals they had made related to local lime groves.Those groves, the heart and cash register of the local economy, have been crucial in Michoac\u00e1n\u2019s self-defense movement from the beginning. In December, Mr. Mora said he decided to form his group in early 2013 after a lime-packaging plant controlled by the Knights Templars refused to accept limes picked by his son. The cartel, he said, had gone too far, extorting pickers and limiting how much was packaged for export in order to drive up prices.The goal of his self-defense group, he said, was to create a better, more just economy for his town and others. In mid-December, when a government helicopter arrived in a La Ruana pasture to take Mr. Mora to Mexico City to speak with top government officials, he carried in his shirt pocket a list of requests, including money for a university.By that time Mr. Mora was already a well-known symbol of what he calls \u201cthe movement,\u201d with his comments found almost daily in Mexican newspapers. But his fame soared a few weeks later when President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto announced a $3.4 billion plan in Michoac\u00e1n for job creation, education, health, infrastructure and pensions.The government plan included efforts to work with self-defense groups, and together they have had some success against the Knights Templar. Vigilante groups control about 15 of Michoac\u00e1n\u2019s townships, and high-profile arrests and killings of gang suspects have risen.On Sunday, Mexican authorities said they had killed Nazario Moreno Gonz\u00e1lez, the head of the Knights Templar cartel, also known as the Templarios. But with some success and its spoils, the rivalry between Mr. Mora and Mr. Torres seems to have intensified. A few months ago, Mr. Mora always waved when Mr. Torres drove by in his black Range Rover \u2014 seized from a Knights Templar leader, Mr. Mora said.More recently, Mr. Mora has suggested that too many of Mr. Torres\u2019s colleagues have questionable loyalties. Critics of Mr. Mora have accused him of holding onto lime groves taken from the Knights Templar, rather than returning the land to its rightful owners. Both men have rejected the accusations.Mexico\u2019s broader question of which groups are clean, and which are criminal, has been impossible to answer. American officials say they believe some groups are receiving weapons and support from different drug gangs, but that it is hard to prove where groups fall on the spectrum of honest to corrupted.The conflict between Mr. Mora and Mr. Torres is simply the most obvious sign of the problem. On Monday, the Mexican government sent hundreds of police and soldiers to La Ruana to try to mediate between the two men.\u201cWe cannot permit this kind of confrontation to occur,\u201d said Alfredo Castillo, the federal government\u2019s envoy to Michoac\u00e1n. On Wednesday, he added that Mr. Mora refused to turn over members of his group suspected of the killings, and that there was evidence suggesting Mr. Mora knew about them in advance and may have consented.Experts warn that the longer the battle between vigilantes goes on, the greater the risk of increased violence and frustration with the government\u2019s inability to establish a lasting peace.\u201cThe government should be very careful,\u201d said Mr. Benitez, the security analyst. \u201cThey can\u2019t start arresting vigilantes indiscriminately, because people expect them to arrest Templarios, not vigilantes.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Transferred $79.6 Billion in Earnings to the Treasury Last Year", "Date": "2014-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve paid $79.6 billion to the Treasury Department in 2013 as the Fed\u2019s enormous investment campaign to stimulate economic growth continued to generate windfall profits for taxpayers.Since 2008, the Fed has expanded its holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities from less than $1 trillion to more than $4 trillion in an effort to suppress interest rates and encourage risk-taking.Some Republican politicians argue that the Fed, by reducing the short-term cost of borrowing, is enabling the growth of the federal debt. Fed officials respond that Congress itself is responsible for making those decisions \u2014 and that abandoning the policy would be counterproductive, in all likelihood.\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be helpful, either in terms of achieving the objectives that Congress has assigned to us or in terms of Congress\u2019s deficit-reduction efforts, for us to purposely raise interest rates in order to weaken the economy,\u201d the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, testified before Congress in February. \u201cThe likely impact of that in a weaker economy would be larger deficits.\u201dMs. Yellen also expressed confidence that the investments would not impede the Fed\u2019s ability to control inflation as the economy strengthens.The Fed buys bonds from banks by crediting accounts that are kept at the Fed. To keep that money from circulating, the Fed paid the banks $5.2 billion in interest last year. That could become a political liability as the economy grows, because the Fed would have to pay substantially higher rates to persuade the banks to leave the money on deposit. In effect, the Fed would be sending tens of billions of dollars to a handful of large banks rather than to the Treasury.Still, Fed officials insist that this is exactly what they will do.With lawmakers from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party as well as the Tea Party ranks of the Republican Party pressing the Fed on a variety of issues, the resulting image problem could be compounded by a decline in the profits from the Fed\u2019s investments. The central bank has transferred something to the Treasury every year since 1934. But some analysts, and the Fed itself, see a risk that transfers might have to be suspended later this decade as interest rates rise, reducing the value of low-rate bonds like those held by the Fed.The Fed spent about $5.6 billion on its own operations last year. It also provided $563 million in funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which assumed some of the Fed\u2019s regulatory responsibilities after the financial crisis.Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the Federal Reserve\u2019s $79.6 billion payment to the federal Treasury, representing profits from its investments in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, described the Fed\u2019s relationship to the Treasury incorrectly. The Fed invests in Treasuries, but it does not buy them from the Treasury. It is thus not \u201clending to the Treasury.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "North Korea Tests Rocket Launcher With Range Beyond Seoul, South Says", "Date": "2014-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea on Tuesday tested a new multiple-rocket launcher with a range long enough to strike major American and South Korean military bases south of Seoul, South Korean military officials said.Four rockets were launched Tuesday afternoon from Wonsan, a coastal city east of the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, flying 96 miles to the northeast before crashing into the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, a South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman said.The spokesman said his ministry had determined that the rockets were fired from a new multiple-rocket launcher that North Korea had been developing. He spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing ministry policy.Earlier on Tuesday, North Korea tested an older multiple-rocket launcher, firing three rockets that flew 34 miles off its east coast, the spokesman said.The country\u2019s nuclear weapons program and its development of long-range rocket systems have angered many in the West, including in the United States.\u201cWe believe this is an intentional provocation to raise tensions,\u201d the South Korean ministry spokesman said Tuesday.Despite its moribund economy, North Korea has been conducting a vigorous missile and rocket program, and it has been trying to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile. But the apparent test of the new rocket launcher on Tuesday set off special interest in South Korea.Apart from its nuclear arms, North Korea\u2019s multiple-rocket launchers and artillery pieces are the weapons most feared in the South. The North is estimated to have 13,000 of them clustered on the inter-Korean border, just 28 miles north of Seoul; the North\u2019s occasional threats over the years to turn the South Korean capital into a \u201csea of fire\u201d are presumed to be references to these weapons.The North\u2019s older, 240-millimeter multiple-rocket launchers have a range of 37 miles, putting Seoul and its 10 million people within range of rockets fired from the border. Partly for this reason, the United States and South Korea have situated major air force and other military bases well south of the capital.But South Korean military intelligence has long suspected the North of developing a longer-range rocket launcher that could reach some of those bases, including those in the Osan-Pyeongtaek hub about 60 miles south of Seoul, where the United States has been relocating many of its bases from around South Korea.South Korea recently deployed Israeli-designed Spike missiles and their mobile launchers on its western border islands. The Spike missiles, with a range of 12 miles, target North Korean coastal guns and rocket batteries. But the range of North Korea\u2019s new 300-millimeter multiple-rocket launcher means that the North can keep the launchers outside the range of the Spike missiles and still be able to hit Seoul, officials here said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emerging, but No Longer a Mother Lode of Profits", "Date": "2014-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen it comes to investing in emerging markets, few companies have been as gung-ho as Diageo, the British maker of the Guinness, Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff brands. But now that troubles are cropping up in many such countries around the world, Diageo has turned from cheerleader to excuse-monger.Government crackdowns on high-end drinking in China. Inflation and currency worries in Argentina and Venezuela. Political turmoil in Thailand; saturated beer markets in Nigeria; a religious backlash in Turkey. These and other adversities were cited by company officials this year when Diageo announced disappointing profits.And like Diageo, a number of other multinational corporations have recently blamed turmoil in emerging markets for dents in their bottom lines.From consumer-oriented outfits like Procter & Gamble, Yum Brands and Coca-Cola to technology leaders like IBM and Cisco, companies that crowed for more than a decade about their exposure to these booming economies are now eating more than a little crow. They have cut growth forecasts as debt levels rise and political complications take center stage in numerous developing nations, with attention recently swinging to the risk of war between Russia and Ukraine.The latest casualty has been Danone, the French yogurt giant, which generated more than 60 percent of its 21 billion euros ($28.9 billion) in sales last year from emerging markets. Russia is its top market in the developing world.So it was not entirely surprising that Danone reported its first profit drop in a decade last month, and that its stock took a sharp hit on Monday, when tensions were running high between Moscow and Kiev.None of the big globe-spanning companies are giving up on the developing world, of course, since prospects generally remain stronger there than in the advanced, industrial nations.But even a stellar performer like IBM \u2014 which recently announced that it was working to reach 30 percent of sales from growth economies by 2015, compared with about 22 percent when it set the target \u2014 disclosed this year that its sales to China were down 23 percent. Yum Brands, the company behind KFC and Pizza Hut, said in January that its earnings per share for 2013 were down 9 percent compared with the previous year. China, where the company gets 50 percent of its revenue, was responsible for much of the retreat, partly because of a government investigation of one of Yum\u2019s chicken suppliers.\u201cThere is a level of expectation that has been disappointed,\u201d said Tobias Levkovich, an equity strategist at Citigroup who recently published a report on which companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index had the most exposure to emerging markets.Mr. Levkovich counts 51 companies that depend on the developing world for at least 20 percent of their sales. Since worries began over emerging countries\u2019 prospects last summer, he noted, his emerging-markets index has trailed the market on the upswing, while also performing worse when stocks are heading lower.From now on, he said, \u201cinvestors will look at this stuff much more closely.\u201dThere are exceptions. Companies like Caterpillar, which sells heavy machinery, and Volkswagen, which sells cars, continue to perform well in China and other fast-growing economies.Among the excuses that companies have put forward, it is noteworthy that some of the more profound setbacks cited are those that reflect more of a cultural disconnect than economic maladies.For example, Diageo\u2019s large exposure to Turkey derives mostly from its $2.1 billion purchase in 2011 of Mey Icki, the dominant producer of raki, the country\u2019s anise-flavored national drink. Since then, Turkey\u2019s Islamist government has put in place a series of anti-drinking measures, including a ban on retail outlets selling liquor from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.Net sales of Diageo products in Turkey were down 10 percent in the last half of 2013 compared with the same period the previous year. Similarly, in China the company reported a sharp drop-off in sales that was the result of a government anti-extravagance campaign that led to state officials cutting back on alcohol-fueled entertainment.A spokeswoman for Diageo, Kirsty King, said the company remained committed to emerging markets and cited recent remarks by Ivan Menezes, the company\u2019s chief executive.\u201cWe always knew emerging markets would be volatile, and we are facing some cyclical challenges,\u201d Mr. Menezes said at the release of the company\u2019s most recent results. \u201cIt\u2019s not uniform. We achieved growth in many emerging markets, like South Africa, Brazil, India and Russia.\u201dOther companies have also been hit by unexpected blows unrelated to economic ups and downs. Analysts note that links between Cisco, IBM and the National Security Agency, in the aftermath of the eavesdropping controversy, led to a backlash by Beijing that, along with enhanced competition from local suppliers, contributed to the two companies\u2019 poor performance in China.The \u201ccultural differences\u201d between what these companies want to sell and how demand for these products evolves over time tend to get short shrift, Mr. Levkovich said.Investors are becoming increasingly wary of these companies\u2019 ability to successfully navigate the thicket of issues that can arise in such politically and culturally volatile settings.IBM\u2019s stock price, once a highflier, has barely budged in the last two years, drastically trailing the 43 percent surge in the S.&.P 500. Yum, with its even more ambitious bet on emerging markets, has fared about the same in terms of its stock price.Diageo, by comparison, has done better. Its stock increased more than 30 percent in 2012. But since the beginning of 2013, when problems in emerging markets began to develop, its share price has remained more or less flat as the broader index has soared.So even as companies vow to remain committed to the growth opportunities they see around the world, it is clear that investing in big emerging markets \u2014 be it long term or short \u2014 is no longer viewed as a simple one-way bet.\u201cThere was a really big hype,\u201d said Dani Rodrik, an expert on the globalization of finance at Princeton. \u201cBut a lot of these countries were riding high on borrowed money and high commodity prices, and hidden inside this bubble you had corruption and governance failures.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Orders Rule Changes to Expand Overtime Pay", "Date": "2014-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama, declaring that \u201cAmericans have spent too long working more and getting less in return,\u201d ordered the Labor Department on Thursday to revise federal rules on overtime pay to make millions more workers eligible for extra pay when they work more than 40 hours a week.\u201cUnfortunately today, millions of Americans aren\u2019t getting the extra pay they deserve,\u201d Mr. Obama said in an 11-minute ceremony in the East Room of the White House. He said that a federal rule meant to limit overtime \u201cfor highly paid, white-collar employees\u201d now covers workers earning as little as $24,000 a year.\u201cOvertime is a pretty simple idea,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIf you have to work more, you should get paid more.\u201dIt is the latest in a series of executive actions Mr. Obama has taken recently to sidestep Congress, where Republicans have blocked Democratic proposals to reduce economic inequality. For example, he has ordered an increase in the minimum wage paid by companies that do business with the federal government and has established a new type of tax-sheltered retirement plan for young workers.Administration officials have said these actions are needed because wages have stagnated despite soaring corporate profits, especially since the economic recovery began five years ago. Among the companies listed in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, profits have doubled since then, even as the portion of the economy that goes to worker pay has dropped to an all-time low.Business lobbying groups denounce the changes as regulatory overreach, saying that they will crimp economic growth and leave companies with no choice but to shed workers as their costs rise.\u201cThe president\u2019s plan to increase overtime pay demonstrates another antibusiness policy \u2014 coming on the heels of a proposal to increase the minimum wage, increase the minimum tipped wage, rising health care costs, as well as ever-growing, costly and unwieldy regulations,\u201d Eric Reller, a spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business lobby, said in a written statement.The White House said that as many as 88 percent of salaried workers are not guaranteed \u201ctime and a half\u201d overtime pay because they earn more than the cap of $455 a week (roughly $24,000 per year). Those workers can be denied overtime pay if they spend any time supervising other workers \u2014 the so-called white-collar exemption.\u201cIf your salary is even a dollar above the current threshold, you may not be guaranteed overtime,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if what you do is mostly physical work like stocking shelves. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re working 50 or 60 or 70 hours a week. Your employer doesn\u2019t have to pay you a single extra dime.\u201dThe proportion of workers who are not guaranteed overtime is up from 82 percent in 2004, when the current salary threshold was set, and just 35 percent in 1975. The cap has not kept up with inflation, administration officials say. It was $250 in 1975, equivalent to roughly $1,000 today, or more than double the current cap.The president\u2019s order does not prescribe a new salary threshold, and it does not take effect immediately. Instead, he has instructed Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez to come up with a plan that would expand the number of workers eligible for overtime pay. During a period of public comment, business groups will almost surely seek to pare it back by limiting the number of employees who might benefit from the change.Mr. Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress are trying to make inequality a centerpiece of their election-year debate with Republicans. The president\u2019s proposed budget for the 2015 fiscal year, for example, includes a more generous tax credit for the working poor, a reduction in tax exemptions for corporations and new spending on early education.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fear of Wages", "Date": "2014-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFour years ago, some of us watched with a mixture of incredulity and horror as elite discussion of economic policy went completely off the rails. Over the course of just a few months, influential people all over the Western world convinced themselves and each other that budget deficits were an existential threat, trumping any and all concern about mass unemployment. The result was a turn to fiscal austerity that deepened and prolonged the economic crisis, inflicting immense suffering.And now it\u2019s happening again. Suddenly, it seems as if all the serious people are telling each other that despite high unemployment there\u2019s hardly any \u201cslack\u201d in labor markets \u2014 as evidenced by a supposed surge in wages \u2014 and that the Federal Reserve needs to start raising interest rates very soon to head off the danger of inflation.To be fair, those making the case for monetary tightening are more thoughtful and less overtly political than the archons of austerity who drove the last wrong turn in policy. But the advice they\u2019re giving could be just as destructive.O.K., where is this coming from?The starting point for this turn in elite opinion is the assertion that wages, after stagnating for years, have started to rise rapidly. And it\u2019s true that one popular measure of wages has indeed picked up, with an especially large bump last month.Beyond that, we have multiple measures of wages, and only one of them is showing a notable uptick. It\u2019s far from clear that the alleged wage acceleration is even happening.Over all, then, while it\u2019s possible to argue that we\u2019re running out of labor slack, it\u2019s also possible to argue the opposite, and either way the prudent thing would surely be to wait: Wait until there\u2019s solid evidence of rising wages, then wait some more until wage growth is at least back to precrisis levels and preferably higher.Yet for some reason there\u2019s a growing drumbeat of demands that we not wait, that we get ready to raise interest rates right away or at least very soon. What\u2019s that about?Part of the answer, I\u2019d submit, is that for some people it\u2019s always 1979. That is, they\u2019re eternally vigilant against the danger of a runaway wage-price spiral, and somehow they haven\u2019t noticed that nothing like that has happened for decades. Maybe it\u2019s a generational thing. Maybe it\u2019s because a 1970s-style crisis fits their ideological preconceptions, but the phantom menace of stagflation still has an outsized influence on economic debate.Finally, although the current monetary debate isn\u2019t as openly political as the previous fiscal debate, it\u2019s hard to escape the suspicion that class interests are playing a role. A fair number of commentators seem oddly upset by the notion of workers getting raises, especially while returns to bondholders remain low. It\u2019s almost as if they identify with the investor class, and feel uncomfortable with anything that brings us close to full employment, and thereby gives workers more bargaining power.Whatever the underlying motives, tightening the monetary screws anytime soon would be a very, very bad idea. We are slowly, painfully, emerging from the worst slump since the Great Depression. It wouldn\u2019t take much to abort the recovery, and, if that were to happen, we would almost certainly be Japanified, stuck in a trap that might last decades.Is wage growth actually taking off? That\u2019s far from clear. But if it is, we should see rising wages as a development to cheer and promote, not a threat to be squashed with tight money.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An E.U. Plan That Could Work for Cameron", "Date": "2014-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyAngela Merkel\u2019s visit to London last week has been viewed by many as a snub to David Cameron\u2019s aim to reform the European Union. But it all depends on what one means by reform.Mr. Cameron, the British prime minister, called last year for a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union by the end of 2017. He promised to renegotiate Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe in the meantime \u2014 the idea being that on the back of such reforms, he would be able to persuade a skeptical electorate to vote to stay in.If Mr. Cameron focuses on subjecting the European Union\u2019s treaties to open-heart surgery, he will be disappointed. But if he puts his energy into making the Union more competitive \u2014 something that would be hugely beneficial for Britain \u2014 the prize of reforming it may well be within his grasp.That much was clear from the German chancellor\u2019s day trip. She disappointed some British euro-skeptics by arguing against \u201cfundamental reform of the European architecture.\u201d She does want to revise the European Union treaties to prevent another euro crisis. But, for her, a treaty change should be \u201climited and targeted.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, Ms. Merkel is only one voice among 28 European Union leaders, albeit the most powerful. Every nation has to agree on treaty changes. This means that trying to revamp the treaties to suit the desires of British euro-skeptics has zero chance of success.If the treaties are reopened, of course, Britain should have its wish list. But, at most, it will be able to secure changes such as giving national parliaments a greater say in Europe-wide legislation. Mr. Cameron will waste his political capital if he makes this his priority.A better approach would be to work with Ms. Merkel and other leaders to set a clear agenda for what they want the Union to achieve over the next five years, as the German leader proposed. After the European Parliament elections in May, the leaders and legislators will have to agree on who will run the European Commission, beginning in 2015. They should also agree what it should do \u2014 and what it should not do.The priority should be to increase Europe\u2019s competitiveness. This has several elements. At the top of the list should be completing the European Union\u2019s single market. At present, there are few barriers to the trade in goods but many to the trade in services. Although services account for more than 70 percent of the European Union\u2019s economy, they are often not efficiently provided \u2014 one of the main reasons Europe lags behind America.Other measures should include agreeing to ambitious free trade deals with other parts of the world, especially the United States, Japan and China; cutting red tape; and helping capital markets play a bigger role in financing the European economy.At the same time, the next commission must stop meddling in things best left to national governments. Not only do proposals such as its thankfully abandoned plan last year to ban olive oil jugs in restaurants irritate national politicians, they absorb a lot of energy that could be better used on things that really matter.A full-blown competitiveness agenda would certainly be ambitious. But it is achievable because it goes with the zeitgeist. There is widespread acceptance that the Union needs to pull its socks up. Otherwise, it won\u2019t be left with just high youth unemployment in so-called peripheral countries; it will languish as other parts of the world grow faster.Ms. Merkel gave many indications of being open to, or even in favor of, such an agenda on her trip to London. She spoke in favor of renewing the Union to make it stronger and more competitive. She said it must further dismantle barriers to trade, especially with the United States. She advocated cutting superfluous red tape.She even spoke favorably of the British banking center, saying: \u201cLondon is very important for the European single capital market and thus for the economies of all European countries.\u201dMr. Cameron should view these remarks as a golden opportunity to put forward concrete plans to help capital markets grow as a source of finance and so fill the gap being left as European banks shrink. He should also secure Ms. Merkel\u2019s agreement to make a new push to complete the single market in services.Meanwhile, Ms. Merkel was strong on the need to stop the commission from meddling. She said it \u201cmust only regulate matters which cannot be adequately regulated by the member states themselves.\u201d It\u2019s not just Germany that is keen on such ideas. The Netherlands is pushing a similar agenda and other countries are open to elements of it too. So the opportunity is there.The British government is a coalition between Mr. Cameron\u2019s Conservatives and the pro-European Liberal Democrats. The latter cannot agree to the radical plans for revamping the European Union\u2019s treaties being advocated by some Conservative euro-skeptics. Hence, Mr. Cameron\u2019s plan to wait until after the 2015 general election \u2014 which he hopes, somewhat implausibly, to win on his own \u2014 to push these ideas.But Mr. Cameron probably can get the Liberal Democrats to agree to a competitiveness agenda. And the time to push it is now. If he waits until after the next election, he will have missed the boat.Hugo Dixon is editor at large of Reuters News.An earlier version of this article misstated the year of the British general election.

{"Headline": "Producer Price Index Falls, as Does Consumer Confidence", "Date": "2014-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The prices that companies receive for their goods and services fell slightly in February, the latest sign that inflation is tame. And consumer sentiment dipped modestly in early March, entirely because of reduced expectations for the future, a survey reported on Friday.The Producer Price Index, which measures price changes before they reach the consumer, dropped 0.1 percent in February, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was the first decline since November. A sharp drop in price markups by wholesalers and retailers pushed down the index.Producer prices rose 0.9 percent from 12 months ago, the smallest 12-month increase since May.Wholesale food and energy prices increased, as did the cost of pharmaceuticals. Excluding the volatile categories of food, energy and retailer and wholesaler profit margins, core prices ticked up 0.1 percent.The data also reflects the impact of aggressive discounting by clothing and shoe stores. Their profit margins fell 9.3 percent, the steepest on record. Gas stations and grocery stores also reduced their markups.\u201cInflation pressures remain quiescent for the time being,\u201d Joseph LaVorgna, an economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients.The figures underscore that inflation remains largely in check. Businesses have struggled to raise prices because of high levels of unemployment and meager wage growth.The index was expanded in January to include services and construction, in addition to goods, making it a more comprehensive measure.Low inflation has enabled the Federal Reserve to pursue extraordinary stimulus programs to try to bolster economic growth, including keeping the short-term interest rate it controls at nearly zero for more than five years.Also Friday, the preliminary Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan overall index of consumer sentiment fell to 79.9 so far this month, down from the 81.6 final reading in February. That was below analyst expectations for a reading of 82 and the lowest level for that index since November.The index for consumer expectations for future growth dipped to 69.4 in March from 72.7, also hitting its lowest level since November, the survey said.By contrast, the assessment of current economic conditions brightened a bit, rising to 96.1 from 95.4 in February, with a slight improvement in current personal finances.\u201cOver all, consumers continued to demonstrate their resilience in the face of a long and harsh winter,\u201d the survey director, Richard Curtin, said in a statement, \u201cand have not recognized any implications for the domestic economy from the Russian incursion into Ukraine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His condoms stay wrapped. People are no longer approaching Denny to pay for sex.\u201cIn Dongguan, we have something called Dongguan-style service,\u201d the young man with dyed brown hair said as he sat in a hotel restaurant, agreeing to speak on the condition that only his English nickname be used. \u201cIt\u2019s the sex capital. It has a reputation. It\u2019s as if you have ISO 9000 certification\u201d \u2014 a reference to an international quality standard for service industries of all kinds.\u201cNow it\u2019s all stopped,\u201d he said.China is undergoing the harshest anti-vice campaign the government has mounted in years, and the crackdown is taking a toll on the economy of Dongguan, a southern city of more than eight million people. It is a manufacturing center for the export business and a Mecca for migrant workers, but it is also the nation\u2019s sin city. Now, the red-light industry here is blushing a deep pink.Nightclubs and massage parlors, whether in five-star hotels or shadowy alleys, have been shuttered. Taxi drivers who once thrived on commissions from brothels are grappling with shrinking wallets. Some landlords are having a hard time renting out apartments, as prostitutes leave town or decide not to return from Lunar New Year vacations.The campaign appears to be the latest element in a broad push by President Xi Jinping, the chief of the Communist Party, to expunge the image of corruption associated with Chinese officials.The Public Security Ministry in Beijing pledged last month to strike a blow against the \u201cthree vices\u201d \u2014 prostitution, gambling and drug use \u2014 but the focus of the crackdown is obviously on sex for sale.International brand-name hotels have not been spared. The local Sheraton has a foot massage parlor on the fifth floor that has been shut down, and the spa next to the hotel has police seals on its doors. (A manager at the Sheraton said an outside company ran the spa, though a call to the spa\u2019s phone number was answered by the Sheraton\u2019s guest services department.)So far, the biggest political casualty has been the Dongguan police chief, Yan Xiaokang, who has been dismissed and put under investigation. But it is the prostitutes who are facing the harshest consequences.\u201cThis is the most serious campaign so far,\u201d said a friend of Denny\u2019s, a male prostitute with a trucker cap and black painted fingernails. \u201cIt\u2019s the same everywhere, so we can\u2019t even go to other cities.\u201dBefore the crackdown, Denny\u2019s friend said, he could make more than $100 on a good night. But he is now wary of contact from potential clients because they may be police officers \u201cfishing\u201d for people to arrest, and the clients have the same fears about making contact.Early in the campaign, on Feb. 10, the Dongguan police announced that they had inspected nearly 2,000 entertainment sites in the city, had found 39 of them to be \u201cyellow venues\u201d (yellow is a slang term in China for erotic), and had arrested 162 people. In the first six days, according to the Security Ministry\u2019s website, more than 2,400 yellow venues across the country were shut, 73 prostitution rings were broken and more than 500 people were detained.The sex industry is more developed in Dongguan than in other Chinese cities, according to scholars, prostitutes here and the program on China Central Television, which drew wide criticism for showing prostitutes without obscuring their faces.Clubs give customers menus of dozens of services, some with names that have typically Chinese poetic flourishes (\u201cphoenix rising from the bath\u201d). Two hours with a woman in an upscale site typically costs 1,000 renminbi, or about $160. A client can hire a prostitute to be an exclusive lover: A help-wanted advertisement posted on streets in the Houjie area said that the worker could earn $1,640 to $4,900 a month. The same ad said a \u201croom princess\u201d \u2014 a woman who plies clients with drinks in karaoke clubs \u2014 could make $1,300 a month plus tips. The clientele extends beyond the mainland: Businesspeople from Taiwan and other parts of Asia often include a Dongguan stop on their China trips.\u201cI don\u2019t think Dongguan has the most prostitutes or the most expensive ones, but it definitely has the most advanced and the most mature sex industry,\u201d said Ai Xiaoming, a literature professor and gender studies scholar at Zhongshan University in Guangzhou, the provincial capital.At the clubs along the strip east of downtown known as Bar Street, business is nonexistent. The doors have all been sealed with strips of white paper bearing police stamps dated Feb. 14 \u2014 Valentine\u2019s Day. One recent afternoon, dozens of young employees of one club, Vee Plus, gathered outside its doors hoping to pick up back pay.\u201cIn Dongguan, two out of five people will lose their jobs if the situation doesn\u2019t return to normal,\u201d said Lin Yadong, a club manager, who wore a blue scarf and stiletto boots. A woman next to her said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t reopen, how will we eat?\u201d Others nodded.Ms. Lin said the club employed more than 70 people, and that customers came to drink, play dice and listen to the D.J., not to pay for sex.At the Cannes, a rival club, an accountant who gave only his surname, Huang, said the crackdown was \u201ca real pain \u2014 no one knows whether to go home or stay, or go somewhere else to look for work.\u201d\u201cThe government is trying to figure out what to do with the industry,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re reshuffling the cards.\u201dA manager at the BB Club estimated that the shutdown was costing his business about $10,000 a day in expenses and lost revenue. \u201cThe government did this for secret reasons,\u201d he said, and then quickly ushered a foreign reporter from the building as officials from the local culture bureau walked in for an inspection.A private driver said the city\u2019s hotels and clubs would not be viable without the sex industry. \u201cWho goes to a bar if there are no girls?\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep the alcohol down if there are no girls to drink with.\u201d The driver, who gave only his surname, Liu, said that he sometimes made $120 a night in commissions from brothels for bringing clients to them. \u201cIt\u2019s affected all drivers,\u201d he said of the crackdown. \u201cI\u2019ll just have to be more frugal.\u201dFrom beneath the armrest in his car, Mr. Liu produced a pile of fliers with photographs of naked women, phone numbers and lists of services. He said that he knew a man from Singapore who had paid for sex with five women at once. These days, he said, a client would be lucky to get the services of even one woman in Dongguan.Mia Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Job Creation Increases in February, Economists See Signs of a Spring Thaw", "Date": "2014-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American economy appeared to emerge from a winter hibernation in February, creating more jobs than in either of the previous two months and suggesting that momentum in the labor market might gradually build with the arrival of spring.With employers hiring 175,000 workers, the payroll gain in February was still well short of the pace needed to return the economy to full employment anytime soon or to quickly reduce the ranks of the long-term unemployed. But it was twice the number of jobs added in December, when the cold and snow arrived, and it came against a backdrop of more wintry weather last month. \u201cThe report showed solid job growth in February despite clearly negative effects from the weather,\u201d said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cIt suggests the jobs numbers should improve as the weather gets better.\u201d And even though the unemployment rate rose 0.1 percentage point to 6.7 percent, some economists were actually encouraged, paradoxical as that might seem, because they interpreted the uptick as a sign that more Americans were seeing signs of improving job opportunities and returning to the labor force. While the Fed is steadily reducing its monthly bond purchases, aimed at stimulating the economy, overall monetary policy should remain \u201chighly accommodative\u201d given the still-fragile labor market, William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in remarks on Friday.Short-term interest rates were lowered to near zero by Fed policy makers in late 2008, in the depths of the recession, and are not expected to rise before 2015 at the earliest, said Michael T. Darda, market strategist at MKM Partners, a research and trading firm in Stamford, Conn. \u201cThe debate centers on whether they will act in 2015 or wait till 2016,\u201d Mr. Darda said. The unemployment rate may have fallen to 6.7 percent from 7.9 percent at the beginning of 2013, but other labor market indicators \u2014 like the proportion of Americans in the work force and the level of long-term joblessness \u2014 remain very weak. Fed policy makers are starting to focus on these other yardsticks as well as the better-known unemployment rate, he and other analysts say, making them reluctant to start raising interest rates until the labor market improves more broadly. \u201cWe could see the unemployment rate come down to normal levels soon, but these other measures might take years,\u201d Mr. Darda said. While the number of people who have been unemployed for less than five weeks fell by 61,000, to 2.3 million, in February, the ranks of the long-term jobless, who have been out of work for 27 weeks or more, rose by 203,000, to 3.8 million. The broadest possible measure of unemployment, which includes people who are working part time but want a full-time job, fell by 0.1 percentage point, to 12.6 percent. The official jobless rate rose because an additional 264,000 joined the search for a job, adding to the overall labor force, while just 42,000, according to estimates based on a survey of households, found a new job. \u201cAs people come back and see jobs opening up, there should be a rebound in the labor force,\u201d said Joseph G. Carson, director of global economic research at AllianceBernstein. \u201cThe overall direction is a lower jobless rate and more job growth going forward.\u201dThe Labor Department also revised upward its estimate of the number of jobs created in December and January, but payroll gains for those months remained well below the recent trend of about 185,000 added jobs a month.For all the anticipation that preceded Friday\u2019s report, Wall Street\u2019s reaction was muted. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up by 30.83 points or 0.19 percent, closing at 16,452.72. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 1.01 points or 0.05 percent, finishing at 1,878.04. But the Nasdaq composite fell 15.90 points or 0.37 percent, to end at 4,336.22. In bond trading, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 14/32 to 99 21/32, and its yield rose to 2.79 percent from 2.74 percent late Thursday.One thing on which many experts did agree on Friday was that the weather in February was to blame for a slight decline in the length of the average workweek. The Labor Department also reported that 601,000 people in the household survey said they could not get to work because of the weather last month, nearly double the number who typically say that in February.White-collar professions, including accounting, bookkeeping and consulting, led the upswing, as the professional and business service sector gained 79,000 jobs.

{"Headline": "Senators Draft Housing Finance Overhaul", "Date": "2014-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Banking Committee said on Tuesday that they had agreed on a plan to overhaul the nation\u2019s housing finance system and eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage giants that were bailed out by taxpayers in 2008.The committee chairman, Tim Johnson, a Democrat from South Dakota, and Mike Crapo of Idaho, the ranking Republican, have come up with a compromise that provides an explicit government guarantee for mortgages, but only after private investors have taken the first losses. The plan would set up a new federal regulator, called the Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation, to provide the guarantee and regulate the system.More than two dozen plans have been floated for changing the housing finance system, but this one carried bipartisan clout significant enough to move markets. The price of Fannie Mae stock fell 43 percent on Tuesday, and Freddie Mac was down 33 percent. Both of the stocks had been rising on investors\u2019 hopes that the mortgage giants\u2019 functions would be privatized.The bill, to be released in the coming days, still faces an uphill battle. Although its creators were under pressure to release a plan in time for a vote this year, the chances of the legislation reaching the Senate floor are uncertain.But supporters hoped that it would put pressure on House Republicans, and the White House applauded the effort as a \u201cworkable bipartisan approach to complete the biggest remaining piece of postrecession financial reform.\u201dThe bill is modeled on an earlier bipartisan bill by Senators Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, and Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat. But Julia Gordon, the director of Housing Finance and Policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, said the new plan was centered more on housing than on the needs of investors and included an explicit commitment to serving all markets.Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, which approved its own bill last year, said the Senate plan \u201cfeatures several common-sense provisions\u201d but said he was \u201cskeptical\u201d of any plan that did not address the Federal Housing Administration, which offers low down payment loans.The new agreement would establish the Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation as the insurer of last resort, but would require 10 percent private capital reserves. The guarantee, provided for a fee equivalent to 0.1 percent interest, would not kick in until the private reserves were wiped out. Fannie and Freddie would have remained solvent during the housing crisis if they had kept 4 percent of their capital in reserve.The bill would create a single platform to standardize mortgage-backed securities, which are investment vehicles created by bundling mortgages and then selling off pieces of the bundle to spread the risk of default.The bill would also set a minimum down payment of 5 percent, except for first-time home buyers, who would have to put down 3.5 percent for the mortgage to qualify for the guarantee. Some advocates have said they would prefer that the down payment amounts be left to the new regulator, who could adjust them in response to economic conditions.Still, the agreement received tentative praise from industry and consumer groups, including the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a housing advocacy group, and the Mortgage Bankers Association.\u201cIt\u2019s a seminal moment really, because this is the first truly comprehensive and viable plan to address Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,\u201d said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, who testified before the banking committee. \u201cIt\u2019s well thought out, it\u2019s very detailed, they considered all the moving parts. And really, this is the last big thing lawmakers need to do to put the great recession in the history books.\u201dThe increased capital requirements and the government guarantee would raise the cost of borrowing for homeowners, Mr. Zandi said, because the risks of the system would no longer be borne by all taxpayers. He estimated that interest rates would increase by 0.4 to 0.5 percentage points.The bill would eliminate the affordable housing goals that governed Fannie and Freddie, which required them to make a certain number of loans to people with low incomes but which some advocates said were easily gamed and worked to discourage lending in particularly expensive markets. John Taylor, president and chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, said he had been assured that lenders would be encouraged to offer loans to low-income families through incentive pricing or would be required to do so by the regulator.\u201cIt looks like members of Congress and the administration understand the need to make sure that product is available to all income levels, including working-class people,\u201d he said.An article on Wednesday about a new Senate plan to wind down the mortgage finance agencies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae paraphrased incorrectly from comments by Julia Gordon of the Center for American Progress. She said the new plan included a commitment to serving all markets, not \u201cpeople of all income levels.\u201d Because of an editing error, the article also misidentified, in some editions, an agency that Representative Jeb Hensarling said the proposal failed to deal with. It is the Federal Housing Administration, not the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The article also misstated, in some copies, an estimate by the economist Mark Zandi of how much the proposal might increase mortgage rates. He estimated they would rise 0.4 to 0.5 percentage points, not 0.25 of a percentage point.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Income Gap, Meet the Longevity Gap", "Date": "2014-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by10 PhotosFairfax County, Va., and McDowell County, W.Va., are separated by 350 miles, about a half-day\u2019s drive. Traveling west from Fairfax County, the gated communities and bland architecture of military contractors give way to exurbs, then to farmland and eventually to McDowell\u2019s coal mines and the forested slopes of the Appalachians. Perhaps the greatest distance between the two counties is this: Fairfax is a place of the haves, and McDowell of the have-nots. Just outside of Washington, fat government contracts and a growing technology sector buoy the median household income in Fairfax County up to $107,000, one of the highest in the nation. McDowell, with the decline of coal, has little in the way of industry. Unemployment is high. Drug abuse is rampant. Median household income is about one-fifth that of Fairfax.There have long been stark economic differences between Fairfax County and McDowell. But as their fortunes have diverged even further over the past generation, their life expectancies have diverged, too. In McDowell, women\u2019s life expectancy has actually fallen by two years since 1985; it grew five years in Fairfax.This life-expectancy gap has started to surface in discussions among researchers, public health officials and Washington policy makers. The general trend is for Americans to live longer, and as lawmakers contemplate changes to government programs \u2014 like nudging up the Social Security retirement age or changing its cost-of-living adjustment \u2014 they are confronted with the potential unfairness to those who die considerably earlier. The link between income and longevity has been clearly established. Poor people are likelier to smoke. They have less access to the health care system. They tend to weigh more. And their bodies suffer the debilitating effects of more intense and more constant stress. Everywhere, and across time, the poor tend to live shorter lives than the rich, whether researchers compare the Bangladeshis with the Dutch or minimum-wage workers with millionaires.But is widening income inequality behind the divergence in longevity over the last three decades? Would an economy with a narrower gap between the haves and the have-nots lead to stronger life-expectancy gains, from the richest to the poorest? Might the expansion of insurance through the Affordable Care Act help close the gap? And might the policies that Congress is contemplating to ameliorate poverty \u2014 like raising the minimum wage \u2014 have a further effect on life spans, too?Those are questions that researchers armed with reams of data on mortality, poverty, health, social spending and income are struggling to answer. \u201cWould that be different if the income inequality were reduced?\u201d he added. \u201cIf you took a 30-year view, then yes. There does seem to be that long-run relationship between community income and these life-expectancy outcomes.\u201dLiving in Fairfax is different than living in McDowell. In Fairfax, there are ample doctors, hospitals, recreation centers, shops, restaurants, grocery stores, nursing homes and day care centers, with public and private entities providing cradle-to-grave services to prosperous communities. The jobs tend to be good jobs, providing health insurance and pensions, even if there is a growing low-wage work force of health aides, janitors, fast-food workers and the like. \u201cIt\u2019s a knowledge-based work force,\u201d Mr. Fuller said. \u201cAnd we have an economy built on services, technology-intensive services.\u201dSocial services \u2014 judged against those of poorer counties \u2014 are stellar, too. The local government, which runs some of the best public schools in the country, also offers its older citizens services as varied as rides to senior centers and \u201ccare and enrichment consultations\u201d for those looking to adopt a pet rabbit. On a cool weekday morning, John McGinnis, 57, emerged stiffly from a shallow pool at a public indoor facility, where there were also gleaming squash courts, a golf course and three bored-looking lifeguards. A water-exercise instructor had led him and nine others through a series of gentle movements with pool noodles.\u201cI\u2019ve had six back surgeries,\u201d he said, shuffling toward an oversized hot tub after the class. \u201cThis is a lifesaver.\u201dOn a sunny weekend afternoon, 350 miles away, Chea Lockwood, a registered nurse with the Commission on Aging in McDowell County, visited Melissa Courtner, 38, who lives in one of McDowell\u2019s few high-rises, a bare-bones facility for disabled and elderly residents.Coal miners still dig into and blast off the tops of steep Appalachian hills. But the industry that once provided thousands of jobs is slowly disappearing, and the region\u2019s entrenched poverty has persisted. The unemployment rate is 8.8 percent, down from more than 13 percent in the worst of the recession. The current number would be even higher if more residents hadn\u2019t simply given up looking for work.As incomes have diverged between the country\u2019s richest counties, like Fairfax County, Va., and its poorest ones, like McDowell County, W.Va., so have the life expectancies of their residents.Government assistance accounts for half of the income of county residents. Social workers described shortages of teachers, nurses, doctors, surgeons, mental health professionals and addiction-treatment workers. There is next to no public transportation. Winding two-lane roads, sometimes impassable in snow and ice, connect the small population centers of trailers, small homes and the occasional minimart. \u201cIt\u2019ll take you an hour to drive 15 miles,\u201d Ms. Lockwood said. Ms. Lockwood has lived in McDowell County long enough to be widowed twice, and on this morning she first checked on two older patients in the housing project, cheerfully going through a checklist of questions. \u201cIs your health aide on time?\u201d \u201cDo you need help washing that pretty hair of yours?\u201d She checked in on Ms. Courtner, whom she had seen for her first evaluation earlier in the week. \u201cI\u2019m going to steal your man,\u201d Ms. Courtner said with a whoop as Ms. Lockwood entered the room. \u201cYou can\u2019t have him!\u201d Ms. Lockwood said, reaching down to hug Ms. Courtner in her wheelchair before sitting down on a coffee table to talk.Ms. Courtner\u2019s medical problems started early. She dropped out of high school and started smoking and drinking at 16. She had a stroke at 21, leaving her with partial paralysis. She has multiple sclerosis and bipolar disorder. A fistula, only partially repaired, makes a colostomy bag necessary. She is unable to work, she said, so she manages with disability payments and food stamps. Before moving into her housing unit, she lived in a shed without plumbing or electricity on the property of her parents, who are also disabled.Many people have similar stories. Ms. Lockwood notes that other residents have multiple woes: \u201cDiabetes. Obesity. Congestive heart failure. Drug use. Kidney problems. Lung conditions from the mines.\u201d Problems often start young and often result in shorter lives, she said. Earlier that day, she handed me a list of recent funerals with about half highlighted in yellow; they signified that the deceased was under 50.As such, the health statistics for Fairfax and McDowell are as striking as their income data. In Fairfax, the adult obesity rate is about 24 percent and one in eight residents smokes. In McDowell, the adult obesity rate is more than 30 percent and one in three adults smokes. And the disability rate is about five times higher in McDowell. Education is also correlated with longevity, as it is with income and employment. Educated individuals are much more likely to work, and much more likely to have higher incomes. In McDowell, about one in 18 adults has a college degree; in Fairfax, the share is 60 percent. Finally, and perhaps most powerfully, researchers say that a life in poverty is a life of stress that accumulates in a person\u2019s very cells. Being poor is hard in a way that can mean worse sleep, more cortisol in the blood, a greater risk of hypertension and, ultimately, a shorter life.As southern West Virginia has foundered, northern Virginia has flourished. But do the two counties\u2019 diverging life expectancies relate to their diverging economic fortunes? And might that be true across the country?Further, there is nothing to suggest that, for a given individual, getting a raise in pay or moving between counties would mean outliving her peers.\u201cThe statistical term is the ecological fallacy,\u201d Mr. Kindig said. \u201cWe can\u2019t apply aggregate data to an individual, and that\u2019s underappreciated when you\u2019re looking at these numbers.\u201d But, \u201chaving said that, I still think that the averages and the variation across counties tells us a lot,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to let the perfect be the enemy of the good here.\u201dIn particular, changes in smoking and obesity rates may help explain the connection between bigger bank accounts and longer lives. \u201cRicher people and richer communities smoke less, and that gap is growing,\u201d said Dr. Murray at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Mr. Zheng has also posited that inequality, by socially disenfranchising certain groups and making them distrustful of public systems, may have a long-range effect on health. To some extent, the broad expansion of health insurance to low-income communities, as called for under Obamacare, may help to mitigate this stark divide, experts say. And it is encouraging that both Republicans and Democrats have recently elevated the issues of poverty, economic mobility and inequality, But the contrast between McDowell and Fairfax shows just how deeply entrenched these trends are, with consequences reaching all the way from people\u2019s pocketbooks to their graves.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Taxation Tradition", "Date": "2014-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs inequality has become an increasingly prominent issue in American discourse, there has been furious pushback from the right. Some conservatives argue that focusing on inequality is unwise, that taxing high incomes will cripple economic growth. Some argue that it\u2019s unfair, that people should be allowed to keep what they earn. And some argue that it\u2019s un-American \u2014 that we\u2019ve always celebrated those who achieve wealth, and that it violates our national tradition to suggest that some people control too large a share of the wealth.And they\u2019re right. No true American would say this: \u201cThe absence of effective State, and, especially, national, restraint upon unfair money-getting has tended to create a small class of enormously wealthy and economically powerful men, whose chief object is to hold and increase their power,\u201d and follow that statement with a call for \u201ca graduated inheritance tax on big fortunes ... increasing rapidly in amount with the size of the estate.\u201d\u00a0And this invention had deep historical roots in the Jeffersonian vision of an egalitarian society of small farmers. Back when Teddy Roosevelt gave his speech, many thoughtful Americans realized not just that extreme inequality was making nonsense of that vision, but that America was in danger of turning into a society dominated by hereditary wealth \u2014 that the New World was at risk of turning into Old Europe. And they were forthright in arguing that public policy should seek to limit inequality for political as well as economic reasons, that great wealth posed a danger to democracy.So how did such views not only get pushed out of the mainstream, but come to be considered illegitimate?In short, the demonization of anyone who talks about the dangers of concentrated wealth is based on a misreading of both the past and the present. Such talk isn\u2019t un-American; it\u2019s very much in the American tradition. And it\u2019s not at all irrelevant to the modern world. So who will be this generation\u2019s Teddy Roosevelt?

{"Headline": "Voting Dates Are Set for National Elections in India", "Date": "2014-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 India\u2019s national elections will begin on April 7 and continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16, the Election Commission of India announced Wednesday.The vote is the world\u2019s largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. This election is widely considered to be India\u2019s most consequential since 1977.Early polls suggest that the Gandhi family, which has dominated Indian politics for most of the country\u2019s 67-year history, could suffer its worst defeat ever, with some surveys predicting a rout for the family\u2019s party, Indian National Congress. A slowing economy and repeated corruption scandals have tarnished the family\u2019s image.Sonia Gandhi, the family matriarch and president of Congress, has suffered unexplained illnesses and is expected this year to pass leadership of the party to her son, Rahul Gandhi. But Mr. Gandhi\u2019s equivocal public statements and lackluster campaigning have led many to wonder whether he truly wants the job. The family\u2019s response to the results will be watched closely.Results from Uttar Pradesh, the country\u2019s biggest state with 80 seats, are expected to be crucial in determining the election winner, and the state will vote on five separate dates. State elections in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Sikkim will be conducted simultaneously.India\u2019s national elections are a huge administrative undertaking involving 11 million government workers, 930,000 polling stations and 1.7 million electronic voting machines, with administrative costs expected to exceed $645 million. The Election Commission sends personnel and supplies to every corner of India using cars, trains, planes, elephants, mules, camels and boats, said V. S. Sampath, the chief election commissioner.\u201cElections free and fair, peaceful and participative are the life force of democracy,\u201d Mr. Sampath said on Wednesday.Problems are routine. Voters are sometimes openly paid for their selections, and candidates often exceed their allowed expenditures, although a higher spending cap of $1.1 million per seat may reduce such illegal expenditures this time.Despite widespread corruption in Indian society, elections here are widely considered to be fair, and powerful legislators routinely go down to crushing and unexpected defeats.One of the most extraordinary elements of the process is the substantial turnout among India\u2019s poorest. Voting patterns in India have long been heavily influenced by caste and religious affiliations, leading to decades of legislative efforts to appease one group or another.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Imports Push U.S. Trade Deficit Higher", "Date": "2014-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBusiness BriefingThe United States\u2019 trade deficit widened slightly in January as a rise in imports of oil and other foreign goods offset a solid increase in exports. The deficit increased to $39.1 billion, up 0.3 percent from December\u2019s revised $39 billion deficit, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. Exports climbed 0.6 percent to $192.8 billion, led by increased sales of machinery, aircraft and medical equipment. Imports also rose 0.6 percent to $231.6 billion, reflecting a 9 percent jump in imports of petroleum. Imports of food and machinery also rose. The trade deficit is the difference between imports and exports. A higher trade deficit acts as a drag on economic growth because it means companies are making less overseas then their foreign competitors are earning in the United States. Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the January trade report suggested the trade deficit would remain on a gradual downward trend this year, reflecting a shrinking United States energy deficit. A domestic energy boom has increased exports and reduced America\u2019s dependence on foreign oil. Petroleum exports rose to a nominal high of $137.2 billion last year, up 11 percent from 2012. Imports were down 10.9 percent to $369.4 billion as domestic production took the place of the need for some imports. For January, petroleum imports jumped 9 percent to $31.7 billion, reflecting an increased volume of shipments. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Income Equality: A Search for Consequences", "Date": "2014-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThere are not many social scientists in the United States who have studied the United States\u2019 widening income gap longer than Christopher S. Jencks.But about a month ago, Mr. Jencks, a renowned professor of social policy at Harvard, abandoned his 10-year-old project of writing a book about the consequences of inequality on the nation\u2019s health and opportunity, on its politics and crime. Why?\u201cI came to see a book with six or seven chapters that all said the same thing: It\u2019s hard to tell,\u201d he told me.As the income gap in the United States has exploded over the last three decades, blowing past the previous record set in the Roaring Twenties, scholars in fields from sociology and economics to psychology and epidemiology have tried to answer what turns out to be a difficult question: \u201cSo what?\u201dFor all the brain power thrown at the problem since then, however, specific evidence about inequality\u2019s effects has been hard to find. Mr. Jencks said he could already picture the book\u2019s reviews, \u201cProfessor Doesn\u2019t Know What He Is Talking About.\u201d\u201cProblems related to social status get worse when you increase the differences in social status,\u201d Mr. Wilkinson told me.What\u2019s more, Mr. Wilkinson argues, inequality does a great job of making sense of the United States. \u201cYou must explain why a country like the United States does so badly on so many fronts and countries in Scandinavia do well on all these things,\u201d he said. \u201cOn drug abuse and imprisonment and obesity and everything else. It\u2019s very hard to find something else that could explain it.\u201dBut does the data really back this up? One problem with these analyses is that they are based on correlations between levels of inequality and variables like life expectancy or the odds of poor children climbing the income ladder. But such correlations can\u2019t prove inequality causes other social ills. They can\u2019t disentangle inequality from the myriad things pushing American society this way and that.Life expectancy in the United States might lag that of other countries because the United States still does not have universal health care. Scandinavia may enjoy higher upward mobility than the United States because governments in Sweden, Denmark and other Scandinavian countries invest a lot in early childhood education and the United States does not.Lane Kenworthy, a sociologist at the University of Arizona, is all too aware of these limitations. He was to be Mr. Jencks\u2019s co-author on the book about inequality\u2019s consequences. Now he is going it alone, hoping to publish \u201cShould We Worry About Inequality?\u201d next year.\u201cPeople that worry about inequality for normative reasons have been very quick to jump on plausible hypothesis and a little bit of evidence to make sweeping conclusions about its consequences,\u201d Professor Kenworthy told me.To avoid misleading correlations and better isolate inequality\u2019s impact, Mr. Kenworthy studied its evolution over time, comparing how changes in income concentration across the world\u2019s industrialized nations related to changes in a whole set of social and economic outcomes, from growth and employment to health and educational attainment.He came up mostly empty-handed: \u201cMy tests suggest it seems to be a small player in the overall story.\u201dProfessor Stiglitz notes that the United States grew faster during the decades of low inequality immediately after World War II than it did after inequality started rising in the 1980s. But Mr. Kenworthy finds no meaningful impact of inequality on growth one way or the other. \u201cIncome inequality isn\u2019t the only thing that differed between these two periods,\u201d he said.Similarly, Mr. Kenworthy found no significant relationship between increasing inequality and life expectancy, infant mortality or college graduation rates, among others. Even when some patterns do mesh \u2014 teenage pregnancy rates fell a little more slowly in countries where the share of income going to the top 1 percent grew fastest \u2014 the relationship is weak. If you take the United States and Britain off the list, the relationship disappears.So why worry about income inequality? For several reasons.The case against vast inequality is grounded in economic theory. It posits, quite reasonably, that making an extra $10,000 will improve the well-being of a middle-class family more than losing $10,000 will reduce the well-being of a billionaire. Provided it does not substantially reduce economic growth, this alone can support the case for redistribution.And while the effect of widening inequality may be exaggerated by some research, there is decent evidence that it leads to other inequities \u2014 in health and education, for instance. Given that much inequality is inherited, this strikes many of us as fundamentally unfair.Mr. Kenworthy does find that inequality has insidious effects, just not as many. He finds compelling evidence that the growing concentration of income at the very peak of success has slowed income growth for people in the middle.\u201cThis is the United States\u2019 biggest problem,\u201d Professor Kenworthy said. \u201cWages at the bottom have suffered 40 years of stagnation. I don\u2019t see any reason for that to change.\u201dOthers aren\u2019t so sure. \u201cMost economists don\u2019t feel there\u2019s a logical mechanism that really is persuasive\u201d linking the rise of the 1 percent and the stagnation of incomes for the rest, Professor Jencks said.Still, the most solid case to be made for adopting policies to resist the continued widening of the income gap may not depend on unassailable evidence of harm. It may rely, instead, on simple caution.Mr. Jencks describes the state of the debate between friends and foes of inequality in these terms: \u201cCan I prove that anything is terrible because of rising inequality? Not by the kind of standards I would require. But can they prove I shouldn\u2019t worry? They can\u2019t do that either.\u201dThat, alone, is enough to spur action. \u201cSomething that looks bad is coming at you,\u201d he said. \u201cSaying that we shouldn\u2019t do anything about it until we know for sure would be a bad response.\u201dThis is what he wants to write a book about now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Older and Out of Work, but Not Out of Contention", "Date": "2014-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Working LifeOn Thursday, the 10 graduates celebrated over spoonfuls of yellow cake with chocolate icing. They hugged, cheered and promised to stay connected, fortifying themselves for the rough road ahead.This was no ordinary graduation: The youngest to receive a certificate was 50. The oldest was 74. They had college degrees, decades of experience and had all savored sweet success in their careers.What they didn\u2019t have was work.Our churning, unsettled economy knocked them right out of their professional lives: Joyce Fish, a creative director, once oversaw art and photo shoots for retailers like Net-a-Porter, J. Jill and Macy\u2019s. Susan Pearlstein worked as an accounts receivable manager in the food industry. Sharon Cabelly was a senior medical secretary and a patient advocate in local hospitals.She\u2019s got that right. The Great Recession slammed older workers harder than any other recession since the 1940s, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. And those who have lost jobs during this sluggish recovery often struggle to bounce back.Older women have been hit hardest, finding themselves jobless for an average of 56 weeks.For the men and women who found their way to the boot camp, run by FEGS Health & Human Services, a nonprofit social services agency, losing a job was akin to being hit by a tidal wave. They expected to be enjoying their professional status and financial stability in their 50s and 60s, not cashing unemployment checks, dipping into retirement funds or battling gnawing feelings of loss and self-doubt.By the time they started the boot camp in SoHo, nearly everyone had psychic wounds, invisible scars hidden beneath their button-down shirts and turtleneck sweaters.\u201cI\u2019ve been feeling like a ship without sails; I\u2019ve always worked,\u201d explained Ms. Cabelly, who lost her job seven months ago. \u201cNot to have a job, not to have an income: How do you pick up the pieces? How do you fill the void?\u201dWith hard work. Week after week, she and the other job seekers refined their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, honed their computer skills, practiced interviews, polished their pitches and networked on social media with the guidance of Anne Friedman, a career counselor and facilitator for the program. (The boot camp is funded by the UJA-Federation of New York, which worked with FEGS to design the program.)There have been ups and downs.

{"Headline": "Making Russia Pay? It\u2019s Not So Simple", "Date": "2014-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama has warned Russia that \u201cthere will be costs\u201d for a military intervention in Ukraine. But the United States has few palatable options for imposing such costs, and recent history has shown that when it considers its interests at stake, Russia has been willing to pay the price.Even before President Vladimir V. Putin on Saturday publicly declared his intent to send Russian troops into the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, Mr. Obama and his team were already discussing how to respond. They talked about canceling the president\u2019s trip to a summit meeting in Russia in June, shelving a possible trade agreement, kicking Moscow out of the Group of 8 or moving American warships to the region.That is the same menu of actions that was offered to President George W. Bush in 2008, when Russia went to war with Georgia, another balky former Soviet republic. Yet the costs imposed at that time proved only marginally effective and short-lived. Russia stopped its advance but nearly six years later has never fully lived up to the terms of the cease-fire it signed. And whatever penalty it paid at the time evidently has not deterred it from again muscling a neighbor.\u201cThe question is: Are those costs big enough to cause Russia not to take advantage of the situation in the Crimea? That\u2019s the $64,000 question,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Kevin Ryan, a retired Army officer who served as defense attach\u00e9 in the American Embassy in Moscow and now, as a Harvard scholar, leads a group of former Russian and American officials in back-channel talks. Mr. Obama announced the first direct response after a 90-minute telephone call with Mr. Putin on Saturday as he suspended preparations for the G-8 summit meeting in Russia in June. The White House said that \u201cRussia\u2019s continued violation of international law will lead to greater political and economic isolation.\u201dMichael McFaul, who just stepped down as Mr. Obama\u2019s ambassador to Moscow, said the president should go further to ensure that Russia\u2019s business-minded establishment understands that it would find itself cut off. \u201cThere needs to be a serious discussion as soon as possible about economic sanctions so they realize there will be costs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should know there will be consequences and those should be spelled out before they take further actions.\u201dMr. Putin has already demonstrated that the cost to Moscow\u2019s international reputation would not stop him. Having just hosted the Winter Olympics in Sochi, he must have realized he was all but throwing away seven years and $50 billion of effort to polish Russia\u2019s image. He evidently calculated that any diplomatic damage did not outweigh what he sees as a threat to Russia\u2019s historic interest in Ukraine, which was ruled by Moscow until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.Mr. Putin may stop short of outright annexation of Crimea, the largely Russian-speaking peninsula where Moscow still has a major military base, but instead justify a long-term troop presence by saying the troops are there to defend the local population from the new pro-Western government in Kiev. Following a tested Russian playbook, he could create a de facto enclave loyal to Moscow much like the republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia that broke away from Georgia. On the other hand, the White House worries that the crisis could escalate and that all of Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine may try to split off.Finding powerful levers to influence Mr. Putin\u2019s decision-making will be a challenge for Mr. Obama and the European allies. Mr. Obama has seen repeatedly that warnings often do not discourage autocratic rulers from taking violent action, as when Syria crossed the president\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d by using chemical weapons in its civil war.Russia is an even tougher country to pressure, too formidable even in the post-Soviet age to rattle with stern lectures or shows of military force, and too rich in resources to squeeze economically in the short term. With a veto on the United Nations Security Council, it need not worry about the world body. And as the primary source of natural gas to much of Europe, it holds a trump card over many American allies.The longer-term options might be more painful, but they require trade-offs as well. The administration could impose the same sort of banking sanctions that have choked Iran\u2019s economy. And yet Europe, with its more substantial economic ties, could be reluctant to go along, and Mr. Obama may be leery of pulling the trigger on such a potent financial weapon, especially when he needs Russian cooperation on Syria and Iran.\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d asked Fiona Hill, a Brookings Institution scholar who was the government\u2019s top intelligence officer on Russia during the Georgia war when Mr. Putin deflected Western agitation. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about sanctions. We\u2019ll talk about red lines. We\u2019ll basically drive ourselves into a frenzy. And he\u2019ll stand back and just watch it. He just knows that none of the rest of us want a war.\u201dJames F. Jeffrey was Mr. Bush\u2019s deputy national security adviser in August 2008, the first to inform him that Russian troops were moving into Georgia in response to what the Kremlin called Georgian aggression against South Ossetia. As it happened, the clash also took place at Olympic time; Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin were both in Beijing for the Summer Games.Mr. Bush confronted Mr. Putin to no avail, then ordered American ships to the region and provided a military transport to return home Georgian troops on duty in Iraq. He sent humanitarian aid on a military aircraft, assuming that Russia would be loath to attack the capital of Tbilisi with American military personnel present. Mr. Bush also suspended a pending civilian nuclear agreement, and NATO suspended military contacts.\u201cWe did a lot but in the end there was not that much that you could do,\u201d Mr. Jeffrey recalled.Inside the Bush administration, there was discussion of more robust action, like bombing the Roki Tunnel to block Russian troops or providing Georgia with Stinger antiaircraft missiles. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice bristled at what she called the \u201cchest beating,\u201d and the national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, urged the president to poll his team to see if anyone recommended sending American troops.None did, and Mr. Bush was not willing to risk escalation. While Russia stopped short of moving into Tbilisi, it secured the effective independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, while leaving troops in areas it was supposed to evacuate under a cease-fire. Within a year or so, Russia\u2019s isolation was over. Mr. Obama took office and tried to improve relations. NATO resumed military contacts in 2009, and the United States revived the civilian nuclear agreement in 2010.Mr. Jeffrey, now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Mr. Obama should now respond assertively by suggesting that NATO deploy forces to the Polish-Ukrainian border to draw a line. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do to save Ukraine at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we can do is save the alliance.\u201dOthers like Mr. Ryan warn that military movements could backfire by misleading Ukrainians into thinking the West might come to their rescue and so inadvertently encourage them to be more provocative with Russia.Ms. Hill said the Russian leader might simply wait. \u201cTime,\u201d she said, \u201cis on his side.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Look at Global Travel Trends", "Date": "2014-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQ&ADuring a prolonged and grinding recession, the travel industry was one of the few sectors to bounce back early and help buoy the global economy. Last year, the industry accounted for 9.5 percent of the global economy (nearly $7 trillion) and employed 266 million people \u2014 about 9 percent of the global work force.Below are excerpts from a conversation with David Scowsill of Britain, president and chief executive of the World Travel and Tourism Council, on how countries can maximize the economic impact of travel and tourism.\u00a0Going into the recession, post Lehman Brothers, pieces of the industry suffered quite badly, particularly the hotel industry, because the demand for investment dried up, and during that time supply and demand were also out of kilter with the airlines. But we\u2019ve cruised through successfully with four straight years of growth, and at this point we\u2019re predicting global growth for the industry to be around 4.3 percent for 2014.Which countries were behind the growth these last four years?Much of it is coming out of Asia. Over time, the balance has gently started to move away from the U.S. and Europe. We\u2019re forecasting that China will overtake the U.S. in 2027 as the world\u2019s largest travel and tourism economy.Ernst & Young estimates that by 2030, nearly one billion people in China could enter into the middle class and have a disposable income that allows them to travel domestically and abroad. Ten years ago their government singled out tourism as a key pillar of economic growth, and as a result, they have invested well ahead of the curve in high-speed trains, hotel complexes and airports to absorb growth within the middle class. In fact, right now they are busy building 69 airports around the country, so that in the future no person in the country will be more than a 90-minute drive from an airport.And this won\u2019t be limited to domestic travel. Over the last three years, the amount of people traveling outbound from China has nearly doubled to 100 million. That figure is forecast to rise to 200 million by 2020.Statistically, around the world it\u2019s still France, United States, China and Spain, in that order. France is still way out in the lead with 83 million visitors in 2012; in the same year, the United States had 67 million and China and Spain both had 57 million.One of the major inhibitors of the travel industry is that 70 percent of people who travel still need to go to an embassy in order to visit another country.The opposite of that equation would be Mexico. If you have already fought your way through the U.S. system to get a visa, that\u2019s perfectly acceptable for them and they\u2019ll allow you to come without having to go through the process again. There are pockets of the world that have made great progress. Countries in Latin America and Asia are starting to offer common visas, which ultimately might progress into Schengen type models.What about security?\u00a0It\u2019s up to every country to decide how they want to conduct security processing to defend their country at the broadest level. But what we advocate is automating all these processes, making sure that all the security agencies that are involved are coordinated. For example, if I want to go to Australia, I put my details online and within seconds I will get a response.We\u2019re advocating for people to move toward electronic processing so 95 percent of people can automatically get visas. During the 10 years after 9/11, the U.S. lost some $600 billion of tourism income, because the State Department was not issuing enough tourism visas to keep up with demand. The U.S. system is growing more efficient, but there\u2019s still a long way to go.Advertisement"}

And so will Hillary, by the way. Let\u2019s keep the same standards for everybody.\u201dWe\u2019ve arrived at the brave new world of 21st-century technology where robots are on track to be smarter than humans. Yet, politically, we keep traveling into the past. It won\u2019t be long before we\u2019ll turn on the TV and see Lanny Davis defending President Clinton (the next one) on some mishegoss or other.When the Clintons lost to Obama, they simply turned Obama\u2019s presidency into their runway. Jim Messina, Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign manager, and a passel of other former Obama aides, are now helping Hillary. And Bill is out being the campaigner-in-chief, keeping the Clinton allure on display in 2014.The new cache of Clinton papers is benign \u2014 the press seems more enamored of speechwriters\u2019 doodles than substance \u2014 but just reading through them is draining. There are reams of advice on how to steer health care, which must have filled the briefing binders Hillary famously carried. But did she absorb the lessons, given that health care failed because she refused to be flexible and make the sensible compromises suggested by her husband and allies? She\u2019s always on listening tours, but is she hearing? As one White House health care aide advised in the new document dump, \u201cWe need to be seen as listening.\u201d Just as in the reminiscences compiled by Hillary\u2019s late friend, Diane Blair, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas \u2014 some of which were printed in the Washington Free Beacon three weeks ago \u2014 the new papers reflect how entangled the Clintons\u2019 public and private lives were in the White House.In a 1995 memo, Lisa Caputo, the first lady\u2019s press secretary, sees an opportunity for the upcoming re-election campaign by \u201cthrowing a big party\u201d for the Clintons\u2019 20th wedding anniversary. \u201cWe could give a wonderful photo spread to People magazine of photos from the party coupled with old photos of their honeymoon and of special moments for them over the past 20 years,\u201d Caputo wrote, adding that they could turn it into \u201ca nice mail piece later on.\u201dBoth sets of papers are revealing on the never-ending herculean struggle about how to present Hillary to the world, how to turn her shifting hairstyles and personas into one authentic image.\u201cBe careful to \u2018be real,\u2019 \u201d media adviser Mandy Grunwald wrote to her before the launch of her listening tour at Daniel Patrick Moynihan\u2019s farm in upstate New York. \u201cYou did this well in the Rather interview where you acknowledged that of course last year was rough. Once you agree with the audience\u2019s/reporters\u2019 reality like that, it gives you a lot of latitude to then say whatever you want.\u201dGrunwald advises the first lady to \u201clook for opportunities for humor\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t be defensive.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to understand why so many calculations are needed to seem \u201creal,\u201d just as it\u2019s hard to understand how Hillary veers from feminist positions to un-feminist ones.In the Blair papers, Hillary\u2019s private view of the Monica Lewinsky affair hewed closely to the lame rationales offered by Bill and his male friends.\u201cHRC insists, no matter what people say,\u201d Blair said, after talking to Hillary on the phone, \u201cit was gross inappropriate behavior but it was consensual (was not a power relationship) and was not sex within any real meaning (standup, liedown, oral, etc.) of the term.\u201d The president dallying with a 22-year-old intern was not \u201ca power relationship\u201d and certain kinds of sex don\u2019t count?Like her allies Sidney Blumenthal and Charlie Rangel, Hillary paints her husband\u2019s mistress as an erotomaniac, just the way Clarence Thomas\u2019s allies painted Anita Hill. A little nutty and a little slutty.\u201cIt was a lapse,\u201d Blair wrote, \u201cbut she says to his credit he tried to break it off, tried to pull away, tried to manage someone who was clearly a \u2018narcissistic loony toon\u2019; but it was beyond control.\u201dThe cascade of papers evoke Hillary\u2019s stressful brawls \u2014 with her husband, the press, Congress and the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy. And they evoke the issue about her that is so troubling and hard to fathom. She is an immensely complex woman with two sides. She is the tireless and talented public servant. And she is the tired warrior who can be insecure and defensive, someone who has cleaved to a bunker mentality when she would have been better served getting out of her defensive crouch. Talking to her pal Blair, Hillary had a lot of severe words for her \u201cadversaries\u201d in the press and the G.O.P. Blair also said Hillary was \u201cfurious\u201d at Bill for \u201cruining himself and the presidency\u201d by 1994. Hillary may have had a point when she said in 1993, after criticism of the maladroit firing of the veteran White House travel office staff, that the press \u201chas big egos and no brains.\u201d But it speaks to her titanic battles and battle scars.Hillary has spent so much time searching for the right identity, listening to others tell her who to be, resisting and following advice on being \u201creal,\u201d that it leaves us with the same question we had when she first came on the stage in 1992.Who is she?

{"Headline": "Crimea Through a Game-Theory Lens", "Date": "2014-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewA Russian occupation of Crimea raises the specter of the Cold War, in which the nuclear stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union devolved into regional disputes around the world. While military and political frictions made the biggest headlines, the Cold War couldn\u2019t be well understood without using economic theory \u2014 specifically, game theory, which analyzes the strategic logic of threats, credibility and conflict.It\u2019s worth viewing the crisis in Ukraine through the prism of game theory, too, as applied on several fronts: Eliminating its nuclear weapons may have seemed a good deal for Ukraine at the time, and it can be argued that the world became a safer place. Yet if Ukraine were a nuclear power today, it would surely have a far greater ability to deter Russian military action. First, some background: With notable exceptions in the former Yugoslavia and in disputed territories in parts of Russia and places like Georgia, the shift to new governments after the breakup of the Soviet Union was mostly peaceful. Borders were redrawn in an orderly way, and political deals were made by leaders assessing their rational self-interest.Why? The point from game theory is this: The more peacefully that disputes are resolved, the more that peaceful resolution is expected. That expectation, in turn, makes peace easier to achieve and maintain. But the reverse is also true: As peaceful settlement becomes less common, trust declines, international norms shift and conflict becomes more likely. So there is an unfavorable tipping point. In the formal terminology of game theory, there are \u201cmultiple equilibria\u201d (peaceful expectations versus expectations of conflict), and each event in a conflict raises the risk that peaceful situations can unravel. We\u2019ve seen this periodically in history, as in the time leading up to World War I. There is a significant possibility that we are seeing a tipping point away from peaceful conflict resolution now. In this case, market forces provide a relatively safe form of deterrence. Unlike governmental sanctions, market-led penalties limit the risk of direct political retaliation, making it harder for the Russian government to turn falling market prices into a story of victimization by outside powers. But for strategists in China and elsewhere in Asia seeking clues to American behavior, it\u2019s possible that the effectiveness of the United States response on Crimea will matter a great deal. For actual deterrence, the United States would mainly need to create negative consequences for Russia, not just engage in posturing.In any case, it is unlikely that Russia will happily reverse course and hand back Crimea, and so we may well see some careful calculations on how negative those longer-term consequences will be. In this sense, economics \u2014 through the medium of game theory \u2014 is again earning its moniker as the dismal science.TYLER COWEN is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

The automaker said that it would go ahead with significant investments in two Canadian factories without financial aid.\u201cIt is clear to us that our projects are now being used as a political football, a process that, in our view, apart from being unnecessary and ill-advised, will ultimately not be to the benefit of Chrysler,\u201d the company said in a statement.Chrysler confirmed that it would make a redesigned line of minivans at its 4.4 million-square-foot plant in Windsor, Ontario, which has churned out minivans since their introduction over 30 years ago, and that additional investments would come to a factory in Brampton, Ontario, a Toronto suburb, that produces rear-wheel-drive cars including the Chrysler 300.While noting that \u201cour commitment to Canada remains strong,\u201d Mr. Marchionne, who studied business at the University of Windsor, continued to argue in the company\u2019s statement that government assistance for automakers is a global reality.\u201cOn a personal note, as a Canadian, I regret my failure in having been unable to convey the highly competitive nature of markets that offer manufacturing opportunities to carmakers that operate on a global scale,\u201d Mr. Marchionne said. \u201cSome of the shots across the bow following our initial approaches to the federal and provincial governments reveal, apart from political convenience, a somewhat restricted view of Canada as an industrial player in what has become a borderless economy.\u201dHow much money Chrysler wanted and how much it planned to spend on manufacturing were never publicly revealed. A person briefed on the talks, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the company was looking for about $700 million.Both support and opposition to Chrysler\u2019s demand crossed the political spectrum. The federal government, which is held by the Conservatives, and Ontario\u2019s provincial government, currently under Liberal control, had signaled a willingness to assist the company. Leading opponents included Tim Hudak, the Ontario Progressive Conservative party leader, and Carol Goar, a prominent columnist at The Toronto Star, a newspaper that generally opposes Mr. Hudak and all other Conservatives.Jane McKenna, one of Mr. Hudak\u2019s members in the provincial Parliament, said that the company\u2019s retreat underscored her party\u2019s call for an end to corporate assistance.\u201cIt\u2019s great news that they\u2019re not going to be borrowing another $700 million,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cBut where, exactly, did they find that money? In the cup holder of the minivan where they keep the change?\u201dEric Hoskins, the minister of economic development in Ontario, welcomed Chrysler\u2019s decision, adding that his government \u201cwill continue to work positively and proactively with Chrysler and with other auto companies to partner in a fiscally responsible way.\u201d Unifor, the union formerly known as the Canadian Auto Workers, said that while it was pleased by Chrysler\u2019s investment plans, it regrets that the company felt it necessary to withdraw its request.\u201cOur leaders need to understand the importance of developing a long-term strategy, including public investment, if we want to have a strong, competitive advanced manufacturing sector,\u201d said Jerry Dias, the union\u2019s national president.

The calm market conditions on Monday suggested that no fire sale was occurring.Some investors said it appeared that the ruble was holding up relatively well, but only because of currency market intervention by the Bank of Russia, the central bank.Vladimir Bragin, head of research at Alfa Capital in Moscow, said it appeared that the central bank had spent about $500 million on Monday to support the ruble, after large-scale market intervention last week.He said that investors\u2019 nerves \u2014 stretched last week before the referendum \u2014 appeared to have been calmed by the outcome of the vote, and that it now looked \u201cimpossible\u201d for Crimea to return to Ukraine.\u201cMarkets actually have some optimism about the situation,\u201d Mr. Bragin said. \u201cThere\u2019s no panic on the Russian market.\u201dHowever, he said that if Russia were to invade Ukraine proper, it would be \u201ccatastrophic for markets.\u201dUlrich Leuchtmann, head of foreign exchange research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said any news that suggested the conflict would escalate \u201cwith stronger sanctions from the U.S. and the E.U. could have a permanent effect on the ruble.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re seeing Russian-based investors trying to transfer assets out of Russia,\u201d something that probably contributed to the strength in developed-nation financial markets on Monday, Mr. Leuchtmann said.He said that it was impossible to tell how much money had moved since the pace of capital flight from Russia picked up at the end of 2013, but that it was clear from talk in the market that the pace was picking up.Analysts said the current level of sanctions, aimed at top Russian officials, was symbolically important but would have only a limited effect on the Russian economy. But they said that if Western governments escalated sanctions to a level that left Russian businesses unable to function normally in the international financial system, there would be a very serious impact on the country\u2019s economy.The bond market, often the first place where anxieties appear, remained calm Monday.

Set to Reveal Tough New Sulfur Emissions Rule", "Date": "2014-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Environmental Protection Agency plans to unveil a major new regulation on Monday that forces oil refiners to strip out sulfur, a smog-forming pollutant linked to respiratory disease, from American gasoline blends, according to people familiar with the agency\u2019s plans. The E.P.A. estimates that the new rule will drastically reduce soot and smog in the United States, and thus rates of diseases associated with those pollutants, while slightly raising the price of both gasoline and cars. The rule will require oil refiners to install expensive new equipment to clean sulfur out of gasoline and force automakers to install new, cleaner-burning engine technology. E.P.A. officials estimate that the new regulation will raise the cost of gasoline by about two-thirds of one cent per gallon and add about $75 to the sticker price of cars. But oil refiners say that it will cost their industry $10 billion and raise gasoline costs by up to 9 cents per gallon. The E.P.A.\u2019s studies conclude that by 2030, the cleaner-burning gasoline will yield between $6.7 billion and $19 billion annually in economic benefits by saving lives and preventing missed work and school days due to illness. The agency estimates that, annually, the new rule will prevent between 770 and 2,000 premature deaths; 2,200 hospital admissions and asthma-related emergency room visits; 19,000 asthma attacks, 30,000 cases of symptoms of respiratory symptoms in children, and 1.4 million lost school and work days.\u201cThere is no other regulatory strategy that is as important from a health standpoint, in the foreseeable future,\u201d said S. William Becker, director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies. Until now, the sulfur content standards in American gasoline lagged far behind those used in the European Union, Japan and South Korea. The new rule will close that pollution gap by cutting American gasoline sulfur content by more than 60 percent, from 30 parts per million of sulfur down to 10 parts per million, starting in 2017.During the 2012 presidential campaign, the forthcoming gasoline rule was a hotly contested political target. Republicans criticized it as an example of what they called the Obama administration\u2019s regulatory overreach.But since the presidential election, some Republicans have said they welcome the rule. Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah, a conservative Republican, said that because of mountain weather patterns, tailpipe smog is often trapped around Salt Lake City, giving his state many days with \u201cgunky air that rivals L.A.\u201d Mr. Herbert said the new rule would help clean up his state\u2019s air. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to eliminate that with cleaner fuels and cleaner autos,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cDirty air is not a partisan issue. The fact that we have technology that\u2019s available \u2014 cleaner burning fuels, cleaner burning autos \u2014 we ought to embrace that.\u201d The new rule will have a significant impact on the health of low-income Americans who live near major highways, said Dr. Al Rizzo, a pulmonologist at Christiana Care Health System in Newark, Del., and a former chairman of the American Lung Association\u2019s board of directors. \u201cThe population that lives close to highways, that has the greatest exposure to these pollutants, air quality makes a big difference for them,\u201d Dr. Rizzo said. But oil refiners say that the new rule will hurt their industry.Charles T. Drevna, president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, which lobbies for the oil refining industry, said that the rule comes on top of a series of other burdensome regulations. A decade ago, American gasoline contained 300 parts per million of sulfur, but earlier rules required refiners to cut the sulfur content by 90 percent, down to the current 30 parts per million. Mr. Drevna said it was easier to comply with the earlier regulations because removing the first 90 percent of sulfur molecules from gasoline can be done without difficulty. Wringing the last 10 percent of those molecules is harder. \u201cThey\u2019re tough little buggers that don\u2019t want to come out,\u201d Mr. Drevna said. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting the last little bit of red wine stain out of a white blouse.\u201dAsked about the E.P.A.\u2019s estimate that the rule would raise prices at the pump by less than a penny a gallon, Mr. Drevna laughed out loud. \u201cI don\u2019t know what model E.P.A. uses,\u201d he said. \u201cThe math doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d His industry\u2019s estimate that the rule could raise gasoline prices by up to 9 cents a gallon comes from a study by the American Petroleum Institute, which lobbies for oil companies.Not all industries oppose the regulation. Although the auto industry estimates that the rule will cost automakers about $15 billion over 10 years, Gloria Bergquist, vice president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, whose members include General Motors, Ford and Toyota, said her group had worked closely with the Obama administration to develop the regulation, and does not oppose it. That is in part, she said, because complying with the new clean-gasoline regulation will help automakers more easily meet another set of Obama administration regulations, tightening vehicle fuel economy standards. \u201cWe understand that this is the trend, to get cars cleaner and cleaner,\u201d Ms. Bergquist said. \u201cOur engineers are prepared to work for it.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pampered Guests and Feuding Hosts at Claridge\u2019s Hotel", "Date": "2014-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the real inside tale is grittier: a do-or-die battle for ownership of the hotel between competing British and Irish magnates who have vowed to win their epic feud or, if necessary, pass it on to their children and grandchildren. \u201cClaridge\u2019s is a trophy and a corporate plaything,\u201d said David Heathcote, an architectural historian in England. \u201cIt\u2019s a flagship that says more about you than the money because it has this historical aura around it that makes it a super-brand.\u201d In the British version of Monopoly, he added, the most coveted space in the board game is Mayfair, the exclusive London neighborhood of designer shops and swank restaurants where Claridge\u2019s resides.The real-life monopoly players in this case include, on one side, David Rowat Barclay and Frederick Hugh Barclay, reclusive billionaire British media moguls and identical twins in their late 70s. They own the Telegraph newspaper and the Ritz hotel in London and live mostly on a private island off the coast of France \u2014 in a mock Gothic castle protected by a moat.Their adversary is Patrick McKillen, 58, an entrepreneur from Northern Ireland who parlayed a family auto-muffler chain into a fortune in Irish property and a 36 percent stake in Claridge\u2019s holding company, which is known as Coroin and owns two other London hotels. Mr. McKillen is so publicity-shy that for years the only photograph of him that Dublin newspapers could publish was a 1989 shot showing him in a tuxedo and bow tie. The squabble over Claridge\u2019s is part of the legacy of Ireland\u2019s economic bust, which left Irish tycoons\u2019 property vulnerable to takeover when real estate values plunged and loans were called due. But it also is a saga of business warfare waged around the globe with subplots in Monte Carlo and Qatar and a cameo role for Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, who intervened to try to broker a deal.Mr. McKillen says he has spent 20 million pounds, or more than $33 million, in legal fees fighting the Barclay brothers over Claridge\u2019s and its sister hotels. It is not play money to the entrepreneur, who says that these kinds of historic buildings become available only once in a generation. \u201cI love these hotels and have put so much into them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Barclays saw an opportunity because of Ireland\u2019s banking crisis to swoop in and try to take them for a steal in a highly aggressive way. I will not be pushed or bullied.\u201dThe Barclays and their advisers and lawyers take a more cynical view. Mr. McKillen, they argue, is holding on so that his \u201cgood assets\u201d will cushion him against his debts in Ireland of more than 800 million euros, or $1.1 billion. While the two sides agree on little, they do share the same Monopoly strategy: Show no mercy in the war for control. These days, Mr. McKillen, who still takes a guiding role in the refurbishment of the hotels, strolls through the Claridge\u2019s foyer \u2014 with its crystal Lalique panels \u2014 radiating confidence. Dressed casually in a signature black Dior jacket and crisp open-necked shirt, he looks more like an art dealer than a corporate titan. This is a very different world from the one he grew up in, on the west side of Belfast in Andersonstown, a Catholic stronghold that was a center of strife during what are known as the Troubles in Northern Ireland.The purchase of Claridge\u2019s holding company vaulted Mr. McKillen to a new level. With revenue of more than $220 million last year and a combined occupancy rate of more than 85 percent, Coroin has been valued at \u00a31.05 billion, or $1.75 billion. But the acquisition of Coroin was financed in part through loans from the Anglo Irish Bank. That bank would soon collapse under the weight of bad loans and be taken over by the state as Ireland plunged into economic crisis. With real estate values crashing and the banking system imploding, the original Irish consortium that bought the hotels started to wobble.\u201cThere was so much faith in the abilities of these property developers, who had become so rich so quickly, that the banks were overlending,\u201d said Philip Lane, professor of political economy at Trinity College Dublin. \u201cThe tragedy is that, after making large amounts of money in Ireland, they then leveraged that to make big bets elsewhere.\u201dThis is when the Barclay brothers started circling. The twins, knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2000 for their charitable contributions to medical research, are the sons of Scottish Catholic parents. The brothers got their start as house painters, moved into real estate and began buying old boardinghouses to convert into hotels. In fact, their backgrounds are not all that different from Mr. McKillen\u2019s, although their personal styles contrast starkly.In written testimony, Frederick Barclay recalls his first and only encounter with Mr. McKillen, in 2010 at the Ritz hotel, which has a formal dress code. \u201cHe was not wearing a jacket and tie and his shirt was hanging out,\u201d Frederick Barclay wrote. \u201cI made a joke that it was fortunate that I was there to meet him because otherwise he would not have got past security. Mr. McKillen took umbrage and the encounter turned distinctly frosty.\u201d Unlike some other Irish property magnates, Mr. McKillen cannily started diversifying his investments in Ireland before the downturn began in 2008. As a result, he stayed afloat, even managing to increase his share of Coroin to 36 percent, and avoiding the humiliating fate of one of his fellow hotel investors, Derek Quinlan, a former Dublin tax inspector whose houses were seized by bankers along with a Falcon motor yacht and an Andy Warhol painting of a dollar sign.Mr. McKillen had a crucial asset: an ironclad agreement among the original investors that gave him first rights to buy any shares in Coroin put up for sale. At least he thought it was ironclad.In 2011, the Barclay twins found a way to circumvent the agreement legally. They allied themselves with Mr. Quinlan, after seven meetings in the Cafe de Paris in Monte Carlo. With his empire collapsing, he shifted voting control of his 35.4 percent share to the Barclays, who bought the loans held by the Royal Bank of Scotland and secured by his shares. They also supported Mr. Quinlan, according to court documents, with loans of almost $4 million. The Barclays further increased their stake in Coroin by buying a Cyprus holding company from a different hotel investor, Peter Green, again legally circumventing Mr. McKillen\u2019s right-to-buy agreement by keeping the shares in the name of the holding company.By the time they were finished, the brothers controlled 64 percent of the shares \u2014 enough to freeze Mr. McKillen out of power but not to gain outright ownership. So far, the courts in London have backed their right to take control despite Mr. McKillen\u2019s legal challenge that the shareholder agreement was not respected. Thus, they have sway over board meetings, which Mr. McKillen now shuns. In the last 10 days, there has been a flurry of activity, with both camps bidding to buy or repay Mr. McKillen\u2019s personal loans of more than $336 million that are secured by his hotel shares. The loans are held by the state-owned Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, an institution that took over the shell of the Anglo Irish Bank and is systematically selling its loans.Mr. McKillen is pursuing a legal claim in Dublin with a court hearing next week to block the Barclays from buying his loans. He argues that the loans should not be sold to them, alleging that state and banking officials leaked a confidential financial file about him to the Barclay camp. State fraud investigators are looking into the claims. If the strategy fails and the Barclays are able to buy Mr. McKillen\u2019s debts in Ireland, the game might well be over; they would simply call in his loans, which could force him to sell his stake in the hotels.Mr. McKillen says he is lining up financial support from Colony Capital, an investment firm in California. \u201cThese hotels get into your soul and the importance is emotional as well as financial,\u201d he said, adding that he is prepared to hang on for decades if it takes that long for Mr. Quinlan to declare bankruptcy, which would free Mr. McKillen to buy his shares.The Barclays and their family-owned business also take the long view, though it is something they are loath to talk about except in court proceedings. (They declined to comment for this article.)\u201cThis is a soap opera and has a few chapters left to run,\u201d said Richard Faber, a business adviser and former son-in-law of Frederick Barclay, in an email submitted in the London court case that the judge called remarkably prescient. With the standoff dragging on, the contest has evolved into a war of nerves. Mr. McKillen recently made a surprise visit to the Channel Islands, within boating distance of the Barclay brothers\u2019 moat, meeting with locals involved in an unrelated dispute with the twins. Mr. McKillen has enlisted the help of the former prime minister, Mr. Blair, whom he first met at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Last year, Mr. Blair negotiated with a former Qatari emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, to finance a takeover if Mr. McKillen could win control of the group.But for now, the hotels are stuck in ownership limbo. That uncomfortable truth, though, does not intrude in the hushed tea salon at Claridge\u2019s, where the concierge still jokes that when someone calls and asks to speak to the king, the standard reply is, \u201cWhich one?\u201dThe day-to-day running of the hotel chain is managed by a chief executive, but Mr. McKillen still keeps a hand in the renovations underway at the hotels, recruiting designers and watching over the kitchens where he has helped to lure celebrity chefs \u2014 activities that, thus far, the Barclay brothers have not tried to stop.And through it all, Claridge\u2019s remains a refuge, a neutral zone where exiled nobles retreated during World War II.In mid-December, with the lights twinkling on Claridge\u2019s designer Christmas tree, Mr. McKillen said he encountered David Barclay and his son, Aidan, who manages businesses for the twins. As Mr. McKillen walked into the black-and-white marble lobby, he felt the eyes of the employees upon all of them. By his telling, he thrust out his hand to the men \u2014 only to be shown their backs.A few days later, Mr. McKillen followed up the meeting by renewing his demand to buy out the Barclays. Only this time, he cheekily threw in an additional offer to buy the fabled Ritz hotel from the twins.To date, he said, he has received no response.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Hearing, Fed Board Nominees Endorse Current Path", "Date": "2014-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Three nominees to the Federal Reserve\u2019s board sailed through a brief confirmation hearing on Thursday, assuring senators of their commitment to strengthen financial regulation and stimulate the economy.Stanley Fischer, nominated as vice chairman, Lael Brainard and Jerome H. Powell, a current Fed governor nominated to a new term, were all warmly endorsed by Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, who control the confirmation process. There was little sign of strong Republican opposition to the White House\u2019s choices. As a result, it appeared likely that the three would soon be confirmed, joining Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s new chairwoman.The nominees hewed closely to the Fed\u2019s official position on important issues, broadly endorsing its efforts to reduce unemployment and emphasizing their commitment to maintain low inflation. But their statements, as well as the hearing, focused primarily on the Fed\u2019s role as a financial regulator.\u201cThe Great Recession has driven home the lesson that the Fed has not only to fulfill its dual mandate, but also to contribute its part to the maintenance of the stability of the financial system,\u201d said Mr. Fischer, who led the Bank of Israel for eight years before returning to the United States last year. \u201cAlmost always, these goals are complementary. But each of them must be an explicit focus of Fed policy.\u201dMr. Fischer, 70, was the target of most questions and the recipient of the most praise. Asked by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, whether the Fed could do more to stimulate the economy, he said that Fed policy was \u201capproximately appropriate.\u201d He said the crucial question confronting policy makers was not whether but how quickly to exit its stimulus campaign.Current Fed board members generally say they believe that the central bank is reducing the expansion of its stimulus campaign, not retreating. But the effect on the economy is identical and Mr. Fischer, more bluntly, said the exit \u201chas begun.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, scheduled to meet next week, is widely expected to continue the trend by cutting another $10 billion from the bank\u2019s monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. Officials also must agree on a new way to describe the Fed\u2019s plans for short-term interest rates.Ms. Brainard and Mr. Powell, who consistently voted in support of Fed policy during his first two years in office, both endorsed the need to stimulate the economy but were not asked about the Fed\u2019s specific policies and did not volunteer opinions.The three nominees all spoke about the importance of constraining the largest banks, and ensuring that mechanisms exist to dismantle banks that fail.Mr. Powell, a Treasury official under the first President George Bush and later a successful financier, was the most assured and specific in his remarks.Mr. Powell, 60, said large banks were able to borrow money more cheaply because of the perception they enjoyed government protection, and that new measures were necessary to offset that advantage.\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal more left to do here that we\u2019re working on,\u201d he said.He offered as an example the possibility that the Fed would impose a capital surcharge on banks that rely more heavily on short-term wholesale funding \u2014 in effect, limiting borrowing by banks that rely on less stable funding sources.Ms. Brainard, 51, was more cautious, saying she lacked the necessary information to assess the extent of the problem, or to evaluate potential responses.Ms. Brainard, previously the Treasury under secretary for international affairs, said better coordination of financial regulation across borders was necessary to make sure that banks operating in multiple countries could be safely dismantled.\u201cIt would be a high priority to make sure that other financial jurisdictions have the capacity and the will to resolve their largest financial institutions and that they have legal systems in place to do so,\u201d she said.Both Democrats and Republicans expressed concern that in Mr. Fischer and Ms. Brainard, a pair of economists and veteran policy makers, the Fed is adding more of the kinds of officials it already has in abundance. There is one more vacancy on the Fed\u2019s board and Senator Michael Crapo, Republican of Idaho, said he hoped the president would nominate someone with community banking experience.\u201cI\u2019m concerned that a lack of diverse views on the F.O.M.C. could affect its ability to serve all Americans,\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee. \u201cWhat perspective do you bring that actually will matter to families in Cleveland and Mansfield, Ohio?\u201dThe nominees took turns reassuring the senator.\u201cI have worked all my professional career on making sure that Americans have economic opportunity,\u201d Ms. Brainard said.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, also pressed Mr. Fischer about his experience as a Citigroup executive, wondering aloud about the implications of asking a government well stocked with the alumni of large banks to rein in those same companies.Mr. Fischer responded that his experience at Citigroup was his most important training to be a financial regulator, because it gave him an education in the way that financial markets actually work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Central Bank Allows Its Currency More Volatility ", "Date": "2014-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 In the latest sign that China is loosening its tight grip over the economy, the government said on Saturday that the value of its currency would now be allowed to fluctuate more widely against the United States dollar.China\u2019s Central Bank said in a statement on its website that beginning on Monday, the daily trading band on the Chinese currency, the renminbi, would double to 2 percent on either side of a government-set parity rate, a move that could lead to wider daily price fluctuations. The announcement is the latest indication that Beijing is determined to make the renminbi an international currency and to give market forces a larger role in what is now the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States\u2019.Although the government still maintains tight control over large aspects of the economy, including interest rates and the exchange rate, there appears to be a growing recognition among policy makers that the state\u2019s heavy-handed role is distorting prices, intensifying inefficiencies and giving an unfair advantage to state-run enterprises, government banks and exporters.Widening the daily trading band on the currency is likely to reduce the government\u2019s control over the price of the renminbi and to signal to investors and businesses that even bolder moves are imminent.\u201cThis is a fairly significant indication of the government\u2019s commitment to market-oriented reforms,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor at Cornell and a former head of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s China division. \u201cThe government has been intervening in the currency markets for some time, but this means they will probably intervene less.\u201dAlthough China\u2019s economy is growing at close to 7 percent, the rate of growth has fallen sharply over the last few years, and there are concerns that banks and local governments are masking huge liabilities. To lower the risk of a serious downturn, and to strengthen the country\u2019s long-term prospects, Beijing is trying to push through market reforms without severely damaging those who have benefited most from state dominance of the economy.Under President Xi Jinping, the government has stepped up plans to liberalize interest rates; to open the country\u2019s capital account, allowing more capital to flow in and out of China; and to reform the financial system.The government recently said that it planned to allow more private banks to operate in the country. One official also said that within two years, China planned to free up bank deposit rates, which for years have punished savers with returns sometimes below the rate of inflation. By widening the daily trading band, the government is signaling it plans to reduce its role there, too. The government still has the power to set the daily parity rate, and it could prevent big swings in the value of the renminbi. Advertisement"}

This week, the billionaire siblings from Kansas made the top 10 in Forbes\u2019s list of wealthiest people on the planet. In fact, if you lump Charles and David Koch together, they\u2019re No. 1. Meanwhile, in the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid embarked on a rampage of anti-Koch speeches, denouncing the brothers as cancer-causing polluters who pour unlimited money into conservative political campaigns in an \u201cun-American\u201d attempt to subvert democracy. Then Charles Koch gave an interview to The Wichita Business Journal! I know, I know. But given the supreme lowness of the brothers\u2019 low profile, it was an electric moment.\u201cSomebody has got to work to save the country and preserve a system of opportunity,\u201d Koch said, explaining his late-life calling as the nation\u2019s premier right-wing megadonor.My question for today is: Do you think it\u2019s fair to call these guys oligarchs? We have been thinking about oligarchs lately since our attention has been fixed on the former Soviet Union, which is Oligarch Central. In fact, the new Ukrainian government just responded to the tensions in its eastern region by dispatching two billionaires to serve as provincial governors. \u201cOligarch\u201d sounds more interesting than \u201csuperrich person with undue political influence.\u201d The Koch brothers have a genius for being publicly boring, while plowing vast sums of money into political action groups designed to make it difficult for anybody to make a good estimate of how much they\u2019ve given to promote their goal of, um, saving the country.Maybe it would help focus the public mind if we started referring to them as the Wichita oligarchs. We do need to focus. The country has had very rich folks trying to influence national policy forever. But these days they seem to be getting very richer by the moment, and thanks to the Supreme Court, there\u2019s no longer any real lid on what they can spend. Who would you want to count as an oligarch? I\u2019d definitely vote for any billionaires who underwrite campaigns against environmental regulation while their company shows up as No. 14 on the list of Toxic 100 Air Polluters. We\u2019re looking at you, Kochs. (Thank you for the information, Political Economy Research Institute, University of Massachusetts.) Michael Bloomberg? Bloomberg bought himself 12 years as New York City mayor; his final election cost him more than $100 million, or $174 per vote, which sounds pretty darn oligarchic. Although when it comes to promoting a political career, being mayor will get you a good seat at a large number of parades.Warren Buffett? He\u2019s richer than any individual Koch. But, I\u2019m sorry. I do not see an oligarch running around demanding that the government raise his taxes.I would definitely have voted for the late Harry Simmons of Texas, who donated $31 million to political action committees in the last presidential election cycle. The collapse of campaign finance laws was a big time-saver for Simmons, whose estranged daughter once said that he gave her $1,000 for each blank political contribution card she signed. But Simmons died last year, as did Bob Perry, a billionaire Texas realtor who shared Simmons\u2019s enthusiasm for that Swift Boat campaign against John Kerry. \u201cThe question we\u2019re asking is: who\u2019s going to fill the oligarch vacuum?\u201d said Craig McDonald of Texans for Public Justice. \u201cAnd what do you call the level right under oligarchs? We\u2019ve got plenty of them.\u201dWhat comes below oligarchs? I guess mini-garchs. And below them, microgarchs. If you have a chance, try to refer to Donald Trump as a microgarch. It will drive him crazy.But back to the real money: How about Paul Singer? He\u2019s a hedge fund billionaire who\u2019s sort of famous as the conservative donor who supports gay rights. As oligarchs go, however, he has a troubled track record: Rudy Giuliani in 2008, Chris Christie in 2012, Chris Christie, um, now.Tom Steyer? This is another hedge fund billionaire. He\u2019s also an environmental activist who\u2019s investing $100 million in a fund to reward politicians who support climate change legislation and punish those who don\u2019t. The Center for Public Integrity, which dubs Steyer\u2019s new fund a \u201csingle-issue vanity super PAC,\u201d is not a fan. But at least he\u2019s not crusading for healthier hedge funds.Sheldon Adelson? You remember Sheldon Adelson. He\u2019s the billionaire casino owner who\u2019s currently funding a campaign to combat online gambling. Adelson claims he\u2019s propelled by a \u201cmoral standard,\u201d which apparently involves saving betters from losing money in any venue that does not involve going to a casino. But we will always remember him as the guy who invested more than $16 million in the presidential prospects of Newt Gingrich. This is truly only the billionaire beginning. Feel free to offer nominees. But don\u2019t get carried away. We want to be selective here. Start calling everybody an oligarch and it won\u2019t be special anymore. It\u2019ll just be like calling them lobbyists. Advertisement"}

Yet whatever becomes of it, something good can arise from its innovations \u2014 even if the results are very different from its current form or its numerous competitors. What I have in mind isn\u2019t another wave of price speculation. Instead, I believe that electronic forms of money could give us better pricing, contracting and risk management.The Bitcoin phenomenon seems to fit the basic definition of a speculative bubble \u2014 that is, a special kind of fad, a mania for holding an asset in expectation of its appreciation. Further, a bubble is publicized and amplified by news of price increases, often justified by some kind of inspiring \u201cnew era\u201d story that attracts more attention as the price rises.

The central problem with Bitcoin in its present form, though, is that it doesn\u2019t really solve any sensible economic problem. Nor should it substitute for banks and the governmental institutions that regulate them. They are reasonably effective institutions, despite their flaws, and should not just be scrapped and replaced by a novel electronic system. Unfortunately, the Bitcoin success story has been tied intrinsically with instability, with excitement and envy for those who have become rich through investing in it \u2014 rich for a while at least, because the value of the electronic currency has fluctuated wildly. The instability of Bitcoin\u2019s value in dollars is a measure of failure, not success. It means that any commerce using Bitcoin or its competitors would be buffeted by enormous inflation and deflation. But if we go back to the electronic-money drawing board, we may conclude that Bitcoin has been focused on the wrong classical functions of money, as a medium of exchange and a store of value. Bitcoin offers a way of \u201cmining\u201d electronic coins that can replace our dollar bills and bank accounts. Yet there is no fundamental need for this. Money, as we\u2019ve known it for decades, works quite well in these respects. It would be much better to focus on another classical function: money as a unit of account \u2014 that is, as a basic standard of economic measurement. Scientists spend a lot of time thinking about ways to improve systems of measurement. Business people should, too. This has already begun to happen. History shows that this unit-of-account function of money has been separated from the other two, and to good purpose. For example, since 1967 in Chile, an inflation-indexed unit of account called the unidad de fomento (U.F.), meaning unit of development, has been widely used. Financial exchanges are made in pesos, according to a U.F.-peso rate posted on the website valoruf.cl. One multiplies the U.F. price by the exchange rate to arrive at the amount owed today in pesos. In this way, it is natural and easy to set inflation-indexed prices, and Chile is much more effectively inflation-indexed than other countries are. Consider rents. Increases may seem unfair to tenants, yet they may be needed to offset inflation. In Chile, a landlord can easily set the monthly rent for the tenant in U.F.s and then never have to change it, reducing the potential for errors, delays and misunderstandings. The name \u201cU.F.\u201d reframes people\u2019s thinking so that keeping real economic values stable is natural and easy.With electronic software in the background, we can improve on the Chilean idea and make it more useful. First, we should use more evocative words and avoid jargon. I\u2019d suggest calling the unit of account a \u201cbasket.\u201d A basket is a simple description for something rather complicated. In its basic form, it is the equivalent of one day\u2019s common consumption items, like the local marketbasket of typical purchases that already underlies the Consumer Price Index. The value from one base year would be chosen so that, with inflation, the price of a basket in local currency terms would rise. A third improvement would be to move beyond just one new unit of account to a whole system of them, so that we could have baskets for different purposes. There should be senior baskets representing items consumed by older people in one day in a given country, as well as subsistence baskets representing the consumption of the poor. There should also be a day-wage unit of account representing a day\u2019s work by an average unskilled wage earner.These are ideas about simplification of complex economic calculations. But they are borrowed from behavioral economics, which has taught us that our actions are profoundly affected by framing \u2014 by the words we use and the approaches we take. And they are also ideas from cognitive linguistics, which implies that improved language, with new meanings for words like basket or day-wage, will change our thinking.Bitcoin has been a bubble. But the legacy of the Bitcoin experience should be that we move toward a system of stable economic units of measurement \u2014 a system empowered by sophisticated mechanisms of electronic payment.ROBERT J. SHILLER is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Budget Is a Populist Wish List and an Election Blueprint", "Date": "2014-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama sent Congress a $3.9 trillion budget request on Tuesday that stands as a platform for Democrats to run on in this election year, full of policies intended to invite contrasts with Republicans rather than offer compromises as he did last year, without success.Mr. Obama\u2019s budget for the 2015 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, reflects his aspirations in his waning presidency, regardless of the political reality he confronts. The document, his sixth budget, seeks to energize Democratic voters with populist proposals like a more generous tax credit for the working poor, paid for with higher taxes on the rich.The president, as before, seeks to balance calls for spending and tax-cut policies to help the economy against measures to reduce already declining deficits. But this year his emphasis is on the investment side to address the rise in economic inequality, broaden opportunities for upward mobility and spur technological innovation. Mr. Obama has reprised many spending and tax-cut initiatives for education from preschool through college, for roads and other public works, and for research and manufacturing centers, with many of the ideas popular among Republicans. But he has proposed to offset the initiatives\u2019 cost by ending tax breaks for the wealthy and some corporations, which sets up a trade-off intended to put antitax Republicans in a political vise. He would bring total new revenues to more than $1 trillion over 10 years, much of it for deficit reduction.\u201cOur budget is about choices, it\u2019s about our values,\u201d Mr. Obama said as he visited an elementary school in Washington. \u201cAs a country, we\u2019ve got to make a decision if we\u2019re going to protect tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans or if we\u2019re going to make smart investments necessary to create jobs and grow our economy, and expand opportunity for every American.\u201dRepublicans were quick to condemn the Obama budget for its proposed spending and tax increases. They will most likely succeed again in blocking much of it in Congress\u2019s appropriations process, though Democrats are typically able to salvage some initiatives.\u201cThis budget isn\u2019t a serious document, it\u2019s a campaign brochure,\u201d said Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who as chairman of the House Budget Committee will write Republicans\u2019 fiscal plan next month.Before the Obama budget\u2019s release, Mr. Ryan put out a blistering analysis of antipoverty programs of the past half-century, reflecting Republicans\u2019 goal of restructuring the safety net. Mr. Ryan\u2019s previous budgets, which the House passed but the Democratic-controlled Senate stopped, would have replaced Medicare with a voucherlike system and would have converted Medicaid into a sharply reduced block grant to states, just as both programs are facing greater demands from baby boomers.Congressional Democrats are hoping that Mr. Obama\u2019s budget will frame the election-year debate and sharpen the contrasts between the parties\u2019 views of government, to Democrats\u2019 political advantage. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to decide if we\u2019re going to keep squeezing the middle class, or if we\u2019re going to continue to reduce the deficits responsibly while taking steps to grow and strengthen the middle class,\u201d Mr. Obama said at the school. \u201cThe American people have made clear time and again which approach they prefer \u2014 that\u2019s the approach my budget offers.\u201dGone from his budget is the concession Mr. Obama proposed to Republicans last year, as his second term began, to reduce future Social Security cost-of-living increases. The president had hoped that gesture, made over Democrats\u2019 objections, would entice Republicans to compromise on a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d of long-term deficit reductions and federal investments. But Republicans refused to consider raising tax revenues from the wealthy and some businesses, as Mr. Obama sought.So the president returned this year to what the White House called \u201ca more traditional budget\u201d \u2014 one embodying his wish list. Democrats in Congress had all but demanded that he do so, fearful that giving ground on Social Security would anger the liberal base when the party needs high turnout to avoid big losses in November.Leading Democrats indicated, however, that they would join Republicans in opposing Mr. Obama\u2019s plan to spend nearly $55 billion \u2014 evenly split between domestic and military spending \u2014 beyond limits set for discretionary programs in the deal that the two parties negotiated in December to avert another government shutdown.Mr. Obama proposed to offset the added spending \u2014 half with reductions in other programs and half from limiting tax benefits for wealthy individuals in investment accounts for retirement.But Republicans said that he was reneging on the December deal, which softened across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration that had taken effect months earlier. By the afternoon, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Democratic liberal from Maryland and the chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, issued a statement saying that her panel \u201cwill adhere to the spending caps in that deal.\u201dEchoing Mr. Obama, however, Ms. Mikulski said she \u201cwill continue to fight the irresponsible sequestration funding levels we are facing in future years so we can make needed investments in our people and infrastructure.\u201dWhile the Obama budget projected nearly $4 trillion in spending for 2015, less than a third of that \u2014 under $1.2 trillion \u2014 would go to so-called discretionary programs, domestic and military, for which the president and Congress directly control spending. The rest is for so-called mandatory spending \u2014 mainly for the fast-growing entitlement benefit programs Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, as well as for interest on the federal debt and benefits for federal retirees and veterans.Mr. Obama again proposed to overhaul the corporate tax code, by ending various business tax breaks and using the savings to reduce the maximum 35 percent tax rate for corporations. With about $150 billion in additional one-time revenues that businesses would pay in the transition from one tax system to another, Mr. Obama would finance half of a $302 billion, four-year plan for work on highway, bridge, rail and mass transit projects, as he first suggested last summer.One new proposal would expand the earned-income tax credit for low-wage workers, which many Americans claim at some point in their careers, so that it better benefits childless adults and those who do not have custody of their children. The current earned-income tax credit mainly rewards workers with children, but people in both parties support increasing the credit for childless workers to encourage more single young men to join or stay in the labor force.An estimated 13.5 million workers would get a credit of up to $1,000 annually, or double the current maximum credit. To offset the cost, Mr. Obama would close separate tax breaks for self-employed professionals and money-fund managers.The president again proposed spending $76 billion over 10 years to help states provide high-quality preschool education to all 4-year-olds, given studies showing the lifelong benefits of early education, and to pay for it by raising tobacco taxes.After recent years\u2019 spending cuts, tax increases and economic growth, the Obama budget projects that the federal deficit will decline to $649 billion this year and then to $564 billion in 2015 \u2014 less than half in dollar terms of the $1.2 trillion deficit that Mr. Obama inherited in 2009.As a share of total economic output, the measure economists prefer, the 2015 deficit would be 3.1 percent of the gross domestic product, by administration projections, down from the 2009 peak of 10.1 percent and about the level considered sustainable in a growing economy. But after this decade, spending is expected to grow unsustainably as more baby boomers draw on retirement and health care benefits, and revenues do not keep pace.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Details Plans to Liberalize Interest Rates and Encourage Private Banks", "Date": "2014-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The head of China\u2019s central bank and other top financial regulators offered new details on Tuesday on the country\u2019s steps toward a more market-driven economy, including plans to liberalize interest rates as early as next year and to allow the establishment of the first privately owned official banks.Although the announcements signaled incremental progress in modernizing the country\u2019s financial system and opening its still tightly controlled capital account, analysts welcomed the development.\u201cChina\u2019s financial reforms are likely to advance faster than many had expected in 2014,\u201d HSBC analysts led by Qu Hongbin, co-head of Asian economic research, wrote in a research note released Tuesday.Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, said he expected the country to remove its ceiling on bank deposit rates \u2014 the last and most significant government restriction on interest rates \u2014 as early as next year.\u201cThe final liberalization of deposit rates is the last step of interest-rate marketization,\u201d Mr. Zhou told reporters on the sidelines of an annual meeting of China\u2019s rubber-stamp legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress. \u201cSince many other interest rates have been liberalized, deposit rate liberalization is definitely on our agenda. I personally believe it\u2019s very likely to be achieved in one or two years.\u201dBut China retains a government-mandated cap on how much the nation\u2019s traditional banks are allowed to pay on savings deposits. That ceiling is set at 3 percent annual interest for benchmark one-year household deposits and as low as 0.35 percent on demand deposits, where many savers park their funds.In addition to the potential timeline for ending interest rate controls, regulators also signaled progress on Tuesday toward opening the banking system up to greater competition.Speaking at the same news conference as Mr. Zhou, Shang Fulin, the head of China\u2019s banking industry regulator, announced that the government had approved the establishment of five new, privately owned banks by a group of investors.While China has some banks that include comparatively low levels of direct or indirect government ownership, these institutions tend to be smaller and less influential than banks where the state has majority control.For example, China\u2019s 12 \u201cjoint-stock\u201d banks \u2014 China Minsheng Bank being the best known \u2014 were, on average, 41 percent owned by private capital at the end of 2012.Other privately owned financial institutions include foreign-owned banks, which face a strict operating environment and have a tiny share of the country\u2019s deposits. Much larger \u2014 but unregulated, or in some cases illegal \u2014 are the informal lending syndicates that provide high-interest loans to borrowers that have difficulty gaining access to bank financing.Indeed, the Chinese government remains by far the biggest shareholder in the country\u2019s giant but tightly controlled banking industry, which had total assets of 151.4 trillion renminbi, or about $25 trillion, at the end of December \u2014 more than double the level of five years ago.Mr. Shang said the five new nonstate banks would operate under a pilot program in Shanghai and Tianjin and in the wealthy coastal provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong.Mr. Shang did not identify the investors behind the planned banks, but a statement posted on his agency\u2019s website on Tuesday said the applicants included 10 Chinese companies, with the Internet giants Alibaba and Tencent prominent among them.In an email Tuesday, a spokeswoman for an Alibaba affiliate focused on small loans and microfinance confirmed that Alibaba, China\u2019s biggest e-commerce group, was applying for the bank license in partnership with China Wanxiang Holdings.It was unclear from the comments by Mr. Shang, chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, what activities the five planned nonstate banks would be permitted to engage in.Patrick Zuo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Above and Below", "Date": "2014-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOutside the Royal Air Force Chapel in central London stands a statue of Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, better known as \u201cBomber\u201d Harris, the British officer most closely associated with the policy of area bombing German cities in the latter stage of World War II. On the pedestal, in honor of the bomber crews and their commander, is the legend: \u201cThe nation owes them all an immense debt.\u201dAs it reflects on Harris, that verdict is hotly disputed. When the Queen Mother unveiled the statue in 1992 she was jeered by protesters shouting, \u201cHarris was a war criminal.\u201d Hero and villain, Harris is emblematic of the intense ambivalence and confusion that still surrounds Allied bombing strategy, a source of fierce historical debate frequently skewed by myth, misunderstanding and moralistic posturing.For some, the tactic of bombing German civilian areas (as distinct from exclusively military targets) was entirely justified, a necessary and logical strategy that brought Germany to its knees, exacted righteous revenge for Nazi cruelty and hastened the end of the war. At the other end of the spectrum, the bombing is condemned as a barbaric assault on innocent civilians, unjustifiable, indiscriminate and unnecessary.What has long been needed is a sober, dispassionate, fully-sourced exploration of what the bombing campaign comprised, how it developed in the course of a long conflict and what it achieved. Richard Overy, a professor of history at Exeter University in Britain, has written precisely such a book, a detailed, meticulous analysis that is all the more powerful for eschewing the hysteria that has colored this subject for too long.Overy explores the full range of European bombing, including the London Blitz, the bombings of Bulgaria, Italy and France, and finally the ferocious Allied assault on Germany that saw Hamburg, Dresden and much of Berlin reduced to charred ruins. Overy\u2019s writing is temperate, but his judgments are devastating, and through it all runs a vein of quiet anger at the sheer profligacy, in squandered blood and treasure, of waging war this way.One by one, comforting myths are demolished. Long-range bombing by Britain and later by the Allies is usually defended as a valid retaliation in response to the indiscriminate German bombing of civilians. \u201cThey sowed the wind, and now they are going to reap the whirlwind,\u201d Bomber Harris is said to have remarked after Luftwaffe bombs rained down on London. (Notions of punishment, revenge and tactics were hopelessly entangled from the start.) Overy demonstrates, however, that the tactic of bombing urban areas had been put into action by the British before the Blitz.Winston Churchill was an early and enthusiastic advocate of wholesale bombing as the best way to defeat Hitler. In July 1940, he wrote: \u201cThere is one thing that will bring him back and bring him down, and that is an absolutely devastating, exterminating attack by very heavy bombers from this country upon the Nazi homeland.\u201d That belief was fully supported by America, for Roosevelt \u201cshared Churchill\u2019s uncritical view that bombing was a possible war winner in the face of German aggression.\u201dIn a grim cycle of escalation, the lessons learned by Britain\u2019s Bomber Command from the London Blitz would be put to use in bombing Germany. The Royal Air Force even used the Luftwaffe\u2019s attack on Coventry as a yardstick to measure what damage British bombs might inflict on German cities: one Coventry, two Coventries and so on. An attack on the scale of \u201cfour Coventries\u201d would be expected to kill at least 22,000 Germans.Promoters of the bombing campaign insisted that targeting civilians would wear down German morale and economic resilience, leading to the inevitable collapse of the Nazi regime. By 1941, bombs were aimed, as the director of Air Intelligence said, at \u201cthe livelihood, the homes, the cooking, heating, lighting and family life of that section of the population which, in any country, is least mobile and most vulnerable to a general air attack \u2014 the working class.\u201d Britain had not buckled under the Blitz, but instead of drawing a logical conclusion from this, Harris and his colleagues blithely assumed that Germans lacked the moral fiber to stand up to a concerted air campaign.American bombing policy was predicated on the same broad theory: \u201cThe will to resist, the will to fight, the will to progress, are all ultimately centered in the mass of the people. . . . Hence, the ultimate aim of all military operations is to destroy the will of those people at home. . . . The Air Force can strike at once at its ultimate objective: the national will to resist.\u201dIt served the propaganda interests of all sides to exaggerate the death toll from the bombing, and Overy is assiduous in scaling back the wilder claims. The statistics still appall: some 353,000 Germans killed by bombs \u2014 more than half the total number of civilian bombing victims \u2014 with some 82,000 deaths in the last four months of the war.These are probably the closest to an accurate death toll we will get, because the nature of the attack made a precise body-count impossible: Once the unstoppable firestorm had swept through Hamburg, doctors were reduced to estimating the number of dead by counting piles of human ash amid the debris.\u201cThe bomber will always get through,\u201d declared Stanley Baldwin before the war, when he was deputy prime minister. In fact, the bomber failed to get through with lethal frequency. A crew member on a British bomber had a shorter life expectancy than an infantryman in the trenches of World War I. For every bomber shot down by enemy fire, six were lost in accidents.The bombing certainly helped divert German personnel from industry and the armed forces into air-raid defense, and forced the Germans to redeploy troops and equipment from the Eastern Front to defend the Fatherland. But it did not win the war in the way proponents had promised.The bombs obliterated half the urban area of Germany, but signally failed to destroy the country\u2019s economy. German industry adapted and dispersed under bombardment, and until the last months of the war, production continued to increase with an effectiveness that \u201callowed the armed forces to continue fighting forlorn campaigns well into 1945.\u201dAnd though the devastation left ordinary Germans demoralized, exhausted and frightened, the bombs did not provoke internal collapse or social implosion; the German people were not bombed into revolution. In the cruellest irony, the hardship and terror may even have solidified the Nazis\u2019 grip on the populace: \u201cThe effect of the bombing was not, in the end, as the Allies hoped, to drive a wedge between people and regime, but the opposite, to increase dependence on the state and the party.\u201dThe horror of being bombed became ingrained into daily German existence. The words of a German schoolgirl reflect the grim psychological impact of the bombing. Surrounded by a devastated Berlin, braced for the next bomb, Waltraud S\u00fcssmilch wrote: \u201cBombs belonged to my life.\u201dArea bombing was a brutally wasteful way to conduct a war that might have been fought more effectively, and less bloodily, by diverting those resources to other spheres. Churchill did not mention Bomber Command in his victory speech. Ever since, the topic has been clouded by equivocation \u2014 to which this book is the ideal corrective.In 2012, 20 years after the controversial statue was erected to Bomber Harris, another memorial was unveiled in London, dedicated to the almost 56,000 men of Britain\u2019s Bomber Command who perished, but also to the civilian victims of the Allies\u2019 bombing campaign. It simultaneously salutes the sacrifice of those sent to kill and mourns those they killed, an appropriately double-edged memorial to the bombers and the bombed.THE BOMBERS AND THE BOMBEDAllied Air War Over Europe, 1940-1945By Richard OveryIllustrated. 562 pp. Viking. $36.Ben Macintyre\u2019s latest book, \u201cA Spy Among Friends: Kim Philby and the Great Betrayal,\u201d will be published in July.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Inflation Obsession", "Date": "2014-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPartly that\u2019s because Fed officials come across as essentially clueless about the gathering economic storm. But we knew that already. What\u2019s really striking is the extent to which they were obsessed with the wrong thing. The economy was plunging, yet all many people at the Fed wanted to talk about was inflation.Historians of the Great Depression have long marveled at the folly of policy discussion at the time. For example, the Bank of England, faced with a devastating deflationary spiral, kept obsessing over the imagined threat of inflation. As the economist Ralph Hawtrey famously observed, \u201cThat was to cry \u2018Fire, fire!\u2019 in Noah\u2019s flood.\u201d But it turns out that modern monetary officials facing financial crisis were just as obsessed with the wrong thing as their predecessors three generations before.And it wasn\u2019t just a bad call in 2008. Much supposedly informed opinion has remained fixated on the supposed threat of rising prices despite being wrong again and again. If you spent the last five years watching CNBC, or reading the Wall Street Journal opinion pages, or for that matter listening to prominent conservative economists, you lived in a constant state of alarm over runaway inflation, which was coming any day now. It never did.The point, however, is that inflation obsession has persisted, year after year, even as events have refuted its supposed justifications. And this tells us that something more than bad analysis is at work. At a fundamental level, it\u2019s political.The flip side of this antigovernment attitude is the conviction that any attempt to boost the economy, whether fiscal or monetary, must produce disastrous results \u2014 Zimbabwe, here we come! And this conviction is so strong that it persists no matter how wrong it has been, year after year.But I\u2019d argue that the clamor from inflation obsessives has intimidated the Fed, which might otherwise have done more. And it has also been part of a general climate of opposition to anything that might address our continuing jobs crisis.As I suggested, we used to marvel at the wrongheadedness of policy makers during the Great Depression. But when the Great Recession struck, and we were given a chance to do better, we ended up repeating all the same mistakes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Has Already Lost the War", "Date": "2014-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 OVER the past two weeks, residents of Kiev have lived through its bloodiest conflict since the Second World War, watched their reviled president flee and a new, provisional team take charge, seen Russian troops take control of part of the country, and heard Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, assert his right to take further military action. Yet the Ukrainian capital is calm.Revolutions often falter on Day 2, as Ukraine has already bitterly learned twice \u2014 once after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and then again in 2005 after the Orange Revolution. That could happen again, but the new revolution is enjoying a prolonged honeymoon, thanks to Mr. Putin, whose intervention in Ukrainian foreign and trade policy provoked the uprising in the first place, and whose invasion has, paradoxically, increased its chance of long-term success.Kiev smells like a smoky summer camp, from the bonfires burning to keep the demonstrators still out on Independence Square warm, but every day it is tidier. Sidewalks in the city center are checkerboarded with neat piles of bricks that had been dug up to serve as missiles and are now being put back.The police, despised for their corruption and repression, are returning to work. Their squad cars often sport Ukrainian flags and many have a \u201cself-defense\u201d activist from the protests with them. A Western ambassador told me that the activists were there to protect the cops from angry citizens. My uncle, who lives here, said they were also there to stop the police from slipping back into their old ways and demanding bribes.This revolution may yet be eaten by its own incompetence or by infighting. A presidential election is scheduled for May, and the race, negative campaigning and all, has quietly begun. The oligarchs, some of whom have cannily been appointed governors of the potentially restive eastern regions, are jockeying for power. But for now, Ukrainians, who were brought together by shared hatred of the former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, are being brought closer still by the Kremlin-backed invasion.\u201cYanukovych freed Ukraine and Putin is uniting it,\u201d said Iegor Soboliev, a 37-year-old ethnic Russian who heads a government commission to vet officials of the former regime. \u201cUkraine is functioning not through its government but through the self-organization of its people and their sense of human decency.\u201dMr. Soboliev is a former investigative journalist who grew frustrated that carefully documented revelations of government misbehavior \u2014 which he says \u201cwasn\u2019t merely corruption, it was marauding\u201d \u2014 were having no impact. He and a few friends formed Volya, a movement dedicated to creating a country of \u201cresponsible citizens\u201d and a \u201cstate worthy of their trust.\u201d\u201cPeople in Odessa, Mykolaiv, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk are coming out to defend their country,\u201d Mr. Soboliev said. \u201cThey have never liked the western Ukrainian, Galician point of view. But they are showing themselves to be equally patriotic. They are defending their country from foreign aggression. Fantastical things are happening.\u201dThis conflict could flare into Europe\u2019s first major war of the 21st century, and Crimea may never again be part of Ukraine. But no matter what happens over the next few months, or even years, Mr. Putin and his vision of an authoritarian, Russian-dominated former Soviet space have already lost. Democratic, independent Ukraine, and the messy, querulous (but also free and law-abiding) European idea have won.So far, the only certain victory is the ideological one. Many outsiders have interpreted the past three months as a Yugoslav-style ethno-cultural fight. It is nothing of the kind. This is a political struggle. Notwithstanding the bloodshed, the best parallel is with Prague\u2019s Velvet Revolution of 1989. The emphasis there on changing society\u2019s moral tone, and each person\u2019s behavior, was likewise central to the protests that overthrew Mr. Yanukovych.For Ukraine, as well as for Russia and much of the former U.S.S.R., the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 was only a partial revolution. The U.S.S.R. vanished, but the old nomenklatura, and its venal, authoritarian style of governance remained. Mr. Putin is explicitly drawing on that heritage and fitfully trying to reshape it into a new state capitalist system that can compete and flourish globally. An alliance with Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s Ukraine was an essential part of that plan.That effort has now failed. Whatever Mr. Putin achieves in Ukraine, it will not be partnership with a Slavic younger brother enthusiastically joining in his neo-imperialist, neo-Soviet project.The unanswered question is whether Ukraine can be a practical success. The economy needs a total structural overhaul \u2014 and that huge shift needs to be accomplished while either radically transforming, or creating from scratch, effective government institutions. This is the work Central Europe and the Baltic states did in the 1990s. Their example shows that it can be done, but it takes a long time, requires a patient and united populace, and probably also the promise of European partnership.The good news is that Ukraine may finally have achieved the necessary social unity. The bad news is that it isn\u2019t clear if Europe, struggling with its economic malaise and ambivalence toward its newish eastern members, has the stomach to tutor and support Ukraine as it did the Visegrad countries \u2014 Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland \u2014 and the Baltic states.THIS should be Ukraine\u2019s biggest problem. But with Russian forces in Crimea, the more urgent question Kiev faces is whether it will find itself at war.The answer depends in large part on Russia. Sergei Kovalev, a former dissident who became a member of the Russian Parliament in the 1990s, once told me that a good rule for understanding Russian strongmen was that \u201ceating increases the appetite.\u201d Mr. Putin has thus far lived up to that aphorism.Thanks to his agility in Syria, his successful hosting of the Sochi Olympics and even, at first, his masterful manipulation of Mr. Yanukovych, Mr. Putin has won himself something of a reputation as a master strategist. But he has made a grave miscalculation in Ukraine.For one thing, Mr. Putin misunderstands the complexities of language and ethnicity in Ukraine. Certainly, Ukraine is diverse, and language, history and culture play a role in some of its internal differences \u2014 just as they do in blue- and red-state America, in northern and southern Italy, or in the north and the south of England.The error is to believe there is a fratricidal separation between Russian and Ukrainian speakers and to assume that everyone who speaks Russian at home or voted for Mr. Yanukovych would prefer to be a citizen of Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia. The reality of Ukraine is that everyone in the country speaks and understands Russian and everyone at least understands Ukrainian. On television, in Parliament, and in the streets, bilingual discussions are commonplace.Mr. Putin seems to have genuinely believed that Ukraine was Yugoslavia, and that his forces would be warmly welcomed by at least half of the country. As Leonid D. Kuchma, a former president of Ukraine and once a senior member of the Soviet military-industrial complex, told me: \u201cHis advisers must have thought they would be met in eastern Ukraine with flowers as liberators. The reality is 180 degrees opposite.\u201dMany foreign policy realists wish the Ukrainian revolution hadn\u2019t happened. They would rather Ukraine had more fully entered the corrupt, authoritarian zone the Kremlin is seeking to consolidate. But we don\u2019t get to choose for Ukraine \u2014 Ukrainians do, and they have. Now we have to choose for ourselves.The author of \u201cSale of the Century: Russia\u2019s Wild Ride From Communism to Capitalism\u201d and a Liberal member of the Canadian Parliament.

{"Headline": "Crimea and Punishment", "Date": "2014-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president is trying to walk a tightrope \u2014 thin as a thread and dangling over danger \u2014 on the Russian invasion and annexation of Crimea.He must silence critics at home and buck up allies abroad. Neither is easy and nothing is a given.The howls on the home front have been deafening as Republicans and also-rans \u2014 I\u2019m looking at you, Mitt Romney \u2014 have suggested that the president misjudged Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s and Russia\u2019s ambition and aptitude for aggression, created an international impression of the president and the United States as timid, feckless, indecisive and without resolve, and failed, over and over, to stand strongly enough with other countries\u2019 dissidents in their quest for freedom and democracy.He continued, \u201cUnfortunately, not having anticipated Russia\u2019s intentions, the president wasn\u2019t able to shape the kinds of events that may have been able to prevent the kinds of circumstances that you\u2019re seeing in the Ukraine.\u201dThe refused-to-be-vanquished insist on being vindicated.But as is the case in many of these circumstances, the dance between diplomacy and force, between aggressive responses and appropriate ones, is more complicated than sound bites can convey.The truth is that the West \u2014 the United States and its European allies \u2014 doesn\u2019t have much leverage against Russia. And the Europeans are addicted to and reliant upon Russian gas, which adds to their trepidation about antagonizing Moscow.Recognizing this, President Obama said Wednesday during a speech in Brussels that the European Union needed to reduce its dependency on Russian energy. He has also urged European Union leaders to move forward with the pending trans-Atlantic trade pact, which would allow Europe to receive more gas from the United States.But that is a long-term strategic goal. That won\u2019t alter the geopolitical landscape of the immediate future.The president, while chastising Russian aggression, made clear:\u201cUnderstand as well this is not another Cold War that we\u2019re entering into. After all, unlike the Soviet Union, Russia leads no bloc of nations, no global ideology. The United States and NATO do not seek any conflict with Russia. In fact, for more than 60 years we have come together in NATO not to claim other lands but to keep nations free. What we will do always is uphold our solemn obligation, our Article 5 duty, to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our allies. And in that promise we will never waver. NATO nations never stand alone.\u201dWhile there has been a working partnership between NATO and Ukraine, unfortunately Ukraine is not a NATO member country.So, what to do other than apply economic sanctions and isolate Russia, and diminish a bit of its prestige, by doing things like kicking the country out of the Group of 8? Does any hit to the Russian economy move Putin\u2019s spirit or dull his ambitions? The answers to these questions are not at all clear.And the American people are conflicted about the country\u2019s current standing in the world and our role in conflicts like Crimea.While most don\u2019t agree with President Obama\u2019s handling of Russia and Ukraine, most have confidence in the president\u2019s handling of international crises.And, most approve of the sanctions the president has initiated against Russia, but most also don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll be effective.We can\u2019t call both sides of the coin, people.There are too many of our soldiers still in distant lands, wading through the blood of the fallen or being shipped home broken or maimed or dead. The American ideal of being the world\u2019s lone super power, with infinite influence and strong-arm leverage, is colliding with the reality that we are unable to police the world and that our influence has limits, as well as with our utter distaste for the morass of battle without clear objectives, time limits or exit strategies.The drums of war have been beating on and off in this country for decades; Americans ache for a moment of silence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beyond the Sea", "Date": "2014-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe sun-soaked island of Hydra has long inspired artists and intellectuals from Henry Miller to Leonard Cohen, and even today with the influx of art stars and yachting billionaires, its unspoiled charm remains intact.I had only been on Hydra a few days last summer when an astonishing boat sailed into the harbor. Shaped like a stealth fighter and bright with cartoon colors, Guilty is the private yacht of the billionaire Greek art collector Dakis Joannou. Dakis, as the Hydriots call him, is a Cypriot and one of the most famous men in this part of the Aegean. Six years ago he opened an outpost of his Athens-based Deste Foundation for Contemporary Art in an old slaughterhouse on the island. That same year he had Jeff Koons design a paint scheme to decorate his yacht, which he sails into Hydra\u2019s discreetly affluent harbor every summer.Guilty is a splash of New York art-world luridness among the elegant masts and Aegean colors of the other yachts. It\u2019s the way Dakis likes it. Strolling past the waterfront cafes with their upper-class English summer immigrants and the twee boutiques housed in old sponge factories, I made my way along the dock to meet him, wondering all the while what it was like to sleep and wake in a floating art gallery on the high seas.In almost no time a carpet had been laid out at the foot of the gangplank glittering with the word \u201cGuilty.\u201d Guilty of what? a visitor is bound to ask himself. On board, the genial billionaire waved me up.\u201cI suppose,\u201d he deadpanned, \u201cyou had no trouble finding me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been coming here for years,\u201d Dakis said as he pointed out the pair of tall harbor-front houses he owns. \u201cOnly 2,000 people live here year-round, but in the summer it\u2019s quite a scene. It\u2019s one of the most haunting of the Greek islands. Outside of this port, it is virtually wild.\u201dThe port is ringed by bare brown hills. Salt-white houses extend on either side of the harbor \u2014 that classic effect of Greek islands \u2014 and even there on the water I could hear the cicadas rasping in the pines. It made for a startling contrast with this art-filled yacht, in whose master bedroom a neon sign by Martin Creed above the bed spelled the word \u201cFeelings.\u201d The David Shrigley cartoons on the walls seemed to come from a different planet.\u201cI love Hydra,\u201d Dakis said as we came back into the sunlight and the clatter of pack donkeys on the quays (there are no cars allowed on Hydra). \u201cIt\u2019s one of those places \u2014 one of the magical places.\u201dEach June, Dakis invites a couple hundred of the world\u2019s most famous artists, dealers and collectors to mingle and celebrate the opening of the annual summer exhibition at the Deste foundation. One year, to open their show, Matthew Barney and Elizabeth Peyton orchestrated a dawn \u201cprocession\u201d with a variety of animals and a large dogfish laid on a casket.Hydra has always been a place where artists have come. It was the austere and once-primitive island that had enchanted Henry Miller in 1939 and Leonard Cohen in 1960, and which later attracted the American painter Brice Marden, who still owns a house here. As Miller described his first view of Hydra: \u201cThere are only two colors, blue and white, and the white is whitewashed every day, down to the cobblestones in the street. The houses are even more cubistically arranged than at Poros. Aesthetically it is perfect, the very epitome of that flawless anarchy which supercedes, because it includes and goes beyond, all the formal arrangements of the imagination.\u201dGreek painters have always come here. The iconic Athenian artist Nikos Hadjikyriakos-Ghikas, who was Miller\u2019s host, lived on Hydra for many years. His paintings of the island in the 1930s, inspired by Hydra\u2019s Cubist-like houses, helped put modern Greek art on the map. His ruined villa still stands above the tiny hamlet of Kamini like that of a Roman emperor.Poets have also come here. George Seferis, indeed, sang the praises of Hydra:But since I\u2019m an Englishman, this tiny island has always meant two things to me: a few pages in Miller\u2019s travelogue \u201cThe Colossus of Maroussi\u201d and the place where Patrick Leigh Fermor wrote most of his equally sublime \u201cMani: Travels in the Southern Peloponnese\u201d half a century ago, also in Ghikas\u2019s villa.Obscure literary obsessions? Not at all. Dakis was interested in both Miller and Fermor, and later, as we walked along the water away from the port, I asked him if he remembered \u201cThe Colossus of Maroussi.\u201d\u201cOf course we all read it. No non-Greek ever wrote about Hydra like Henry Miller.\u201d I said then that Miller had famously argued for the cultural importance of Greece, even in the modern age. \u201cEven in the middle of our current crisis I think it\u2019s an important idea. But then look at this place. It\u2019s eternal \u2014 isn\u2019t that what Miller was saying? You cannot help feeling that here. Greece is everlasting.\u201dHydra, as Miller wrote, \u201crises out of the sea like a huge loaf of petrified bread,\u201d with a single track carved around its northern shoreline. Slopes of stones and cactuses and wildflowers tumble down to brilliant edges of turquoise water. Soon we came to the island\u2019s old abattoir building, a modest stone structure built on a slope near the edge of the water that is now Deste\u2019s Project Space Slaughterhouse. For last year\u2019s exhibition, the Swiss artist Urs Fischer had turned it into a place where anyone on the island could come and fashion their own clay sculptures. Local children had made amazingly detailed miniature replicas of island houses; there were griffins, gods and heroes from Greek mythology and a woman in a gas mask.A few young sculptors worked in the cells, making life-size human figures, and Dakis talked to them all with a gentle touch. The Joannou family made its fortune in the construction business; today Dakis also owns assets in hotels, shipping and aviation. But he is perhaps best known for owning one of the world\u2019s greatest private art collections. Apart from Koons, he collects Maurizio Cattelan, Charles Ray, Paul McCarthy, Kara Walker, Kiki Smith and scores of others. However, he is just as interested in the unknown young Greek artists who work in the project space. He would sail away the following day, but not without having put in a personal word to the artists he is supporting. Hydra, he said, is like a family of kindred spirits \u2014 a small family at that.Turning to me as I left, he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll meet everyone here at the end of a single day. Everyone knows everyone. Everyone can walk to each other\u2019s house.\u201dHydra is indeed intimate. Yet there is also something monastic and intensely private about it. The houses have high walls, relics of a time when feuds and vendettas raged, and even at high noon the tiny whitewashed square can suddenly seem empty and guarded. In the ancient world the island was little mentioned. It was known for its inland springs, hence its name, which is derived from the Greek word for \u201cwater.\u201dBut it was not until the 17th century that Hydra began to make a name for itself with the development of its shipping industry. By that time it was a part of the Ottoman Empire, but even under foreign rule, Hydra became known for its famous Greek sea captains: Tombazi, Voulgari, Miaoulis, Tsamadou. After 1750, the island became a serious maritime power \u2014 in fact, the naval arm of the Greek rebels in the war of independence against the Ottoman Empire, which began in 1821, was largely Hydriot.After Hydra\u2019s maritime might declined in the 19th century, it turned to sponge fishing as an alternative source of income. It was still largely a sponge economy when Leonard Cohen bought his house here for the princely sum of $1,500, when he was 26. There was no electricity. As he wrote to his mother at the time:\u201cIt has a huge terrace with a view of a dramatic mountain and shining white houses. . . . I live on a hill and life has been going on here exactly the same for hundreds of years. All through the day you hear the calls of the street vendors and they are really rather musical.\u201dEvery day I wandered down to the harbor and sat at the Pirate Bar and drank ouzo with the grizzled fishermen and watched the international crowd step off yachts as if entering a playground: the zoo of contemporary \u201cleisure.\u201dHere I would occasionally see a flamboyant, slightly portly man walking a mottled dog on a leash and sporting dashing foulards. He was the Athenian artist Dimitrios Antonitsis, the director of a gallery called Hydra School Projects, which is lodged in a former school and captain\u2019s house high above the port. One day he invited me up there and we wandered around a house made of 250-year-old ships\u2019 timbers painted gray, with original pully hooks still attached. It had once belonged to a captain\u2019s family, but now it was filled with contemporary art: wall drawings by Lisa Ruyter, Mirabelle Marden\u2019s photographs of olive trees, a few paintings by the old Warhol Factory denizen, Rene Ricard.Antonitsis informed me that Ricard (who has since passed away) was arriving by boat this week. \u201cHe\u2019s quite wild,\u201d Antonitsis said. \u201cVery New York \u201970s. He lives in the Chelsea Hotel, but he comes to Hydra to see everyone. You\u2019ll find him very amusing.\u201dI noticed a small bust of Hitler smoking a cigarette backward on a windowsill and laughed \u2014 in accordance with the artist\u2019s wishes, I presumed.\u201cYes, some people don\u2019t know whether to laugh or not. But the cigarette is pretty obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Hitler led an antismoking campaign in Nazi Germany.A Greek island might seem like a strange place for art world sensibilities to take root, and Antonitsis seemed to agree. But every summer on Hydra he finds many of the people he meets elsewhere in the world during the rest of the year.\u201cIt\u2019s curious how Hydra has become this place where people gather. I don\u2019t know why it happened. I guess it all goes back to Ghikas \u2014 and to some pioneering gay men.\u201dIn the 1950s, he told me, Hydra became home to Charles Hulse and Gordon Merrick. Merrick was an American author who wrote more than a dozen novels, which were known for their gay themes. His most successful, \u201cThe Lord Won\u2019t Mind,\u201d was written on Hydra. He left the island in the late \u201970s, when tourists began to invade.We went back down to the port that afternoon and found Helen Marden, Brice\u2019s wife, at the Pirate Bar. Helen and Brice bought their first house on Hydra in 1973 and now own a historic property in the port. After drinks we went to their house. It\u2019s a fortified affair with formidable walls and a garden of lemon trees, the massive lemons scattered all over the earth. \u201cToo many to pick up,\u201d she admitted. A tortoise slowly made its way through them as if attracted to their scent.Later Helen showed me around the house, which was built in 1790. The ceilings with their latticework looked vaguely Ottoman to me, the rooms a pale gray, elegant, with low divans. The Mardens acquired it in 1990. The previous owners had been a French count and his Greek wife. Helen showed me a portrait of the wife on one of the walls, a disturbed and sadly haunted face. She was reputed to be highly eccentric.\u201cShe used to paint her donkey\u2019s hoofs gold. The count put in these odd lamps \u2014 \u201d She pointed to Dal\u00ed-esque plaster lamps fixed to the walls like mad mushrooms. \u201cWe rather like them, so we kept them.\u201dUpstairs Brice has his studio, although he was in New York at that moment. The view was exactly that described by Leonard Cohen to his mother half a century ago. From inside one of these old Hydriot houses you can see what attracted foreign artists and writers: the feeling of separation from the world, the high walls and defenses, the solitude combined with open sky and sea.During the burning and solitary afternoons, I walked along the sea path toward the port of Kamini and from there onward to the tiny sea hamlet of Vlychos and eventually the remote church at Episcopi. One day I saw a crowd of boats speeding toward a barren island, barely a few hundred meters long, between Hydra and the mainland. There was a white chapel upon it, and the music of an Orthodox wedding came drifting back to the cliffs. Farther on, the path cut between vertiginous fields where donkeys grazed. \u201cThis purity,\u201d as Miller wrote, \u201cthis wild and naked perfection. . . .\u201dReturning by a steep inland path behind Kamini, I would pass the dark shaded lane now named after Ghikas. His ruined villa sprawls over an entire hillside, a maze of burned-out chimneys and wild oleander. It is rumored that the fire in 1965 that destroyed it was set accidentally by a drunken servant\u2019s discarded cigarette. Now the place is deserted, sinking year by year into wilderness. It was sad to think of Lawrence Durrell and Miller there, Fermor and the great Katsimbalis, the real-life \u201ccolossus\u201d of Maroussi \u2014 a now-mythic Greek intellectual of the midcentury who left almost no written works behind him.One of the people on Hydra who remembers some of those men is Phainie Xydis, the daughter of a well-known Greek diplomat, who has kept a beautiful house on the island for many years. She took me to a restaurant overlooking the Saronic Gulf for early evening drinks, and we talked about the days before the Americans came in the \u201960s. \u201cI came first with my mother in 1956,\u201d Xydis said. \u201cI was about 12 when I met Patrick Fermor for the first time \u2014 you cannot believe how handsome he was. \u201dHer parents met in Egypt, married in 1944 and settled in Athens. After they divorced, her mother bought a house on Hydra, where she and the children spent their summers. \u201cShe came because it was cheap and she fell in love with it. But you can\u2019t imagine how archaic and wild Hydra was in those days. It was like the 19th century. Even a divorced woman from Alexandria like her could buy a house for $1,000. A lot of people were barefoot, totally poor. It was empty, an empty place. Look around you now!\u201dSunset fills every night with large well-to-do British, French and Italian families who are probably not much aware of either the artists or the history behind them. I doubt any have climbed up to Ghikas\u2019s house to pay homage to the ghosts of Miller or even Lawrence Durrell. Later that night, all the same, I went down to the port with some of the regulars to greet the wayward Rene Ricard off the late-night boat from Piraeus. A small, explosive fellow tumbled down the gangplank and dragged us into a waterfront cafe where we started to drink ouzo at a frantic rate. It was strangely nostalgic and incongruous. Ricard was the old New York, garrulous, impish, rakish, fast-witted, tremendously friendly and spontaneous, and here he was on Hydra among people he loved. He showed me a tooth that had chipped in half when his plane from New York made a mad landing the night before.\u201cNow I look like a ghoul,\u201d he cried, \u201cand all because I decided to come to Hydra! It doesn\u2019t matter! I could have died.\u201dIt was my last night, as it happened, and as we rambled through the white streets at 2 a.m. I wondered if what had made me so happy on Hydra for a week was simply the absence of the internal combustion engine. It seemed to throw one back into conversation itself, into companionship and even into the lowered, gentler voice. It had probably reminded both Miller and Cohen of something that they had lost as well, even decades ago \u2014 the human scale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Fall as Impasse in Ukraine Intensifies", "Date": "2014-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe escalating crisis in Ukraine created turmoil in global markets on Monday, hitting stocks from Wall Street to Ukraine and causing a spike in oil and natural gas prices that could reach into consumers\u2019 wallets.But despite fears that the conflict between Russia and the West over Ukraine could shift into a military confrontation, analysts said there was little risk of global financial contagion or of major blowback to Western economies.\u201cIf this turns into an outright war, it will be a different story,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at the private bank Berenberg in London. \u201cMore likely it will remain a Cold War-style standoff, and if that\u2019s the case the economic damage for the West and the global economy will be limited.\u201dStill, the growing crisis in Ukraine is unsettling investors, who have already been nervous about shaky emerging-market economies. The biggest impact was felt on Russian and Ukrainian markets, with the Moscow benchmark Micex index dropping 10.8 percent. The ruble fell to a record low against the dollar, with concerns spreading to currencies in nearby countries like Hungary, Turkey and Poland.In developed markets, shares sank as well, with companies with exposure to Ukraine and Russia taking the biggest beating. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of European blue chips closed down 3 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 153.68 points, or 0.9 percent, to 16,168.03. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index took its biggest drop since Feb. 3, falling 13.72 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,845.73. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 30.82 points, or 0.7 percent, to 4,277.30.At the same time, investors moved into traditionally safer assets like United States bonds and the Japanese currency. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32 to 101 9/32, and its yield fell to 2.61 percent, from 2.65 percent late Friday.\u201cThe escalation of the crisis is clearly a shock to emerging-market sentiment,\u201d said Michala Marcussen, the global chief economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. While the economic fundamentals suggest the damage should be contained to Ukraine and Russia, she added, \u201cwe have to be aware of market psychology.\u201dWhile many major indexes are trading at near-record levels, global markets have become increasingly volatile of late. Jitters caused by serious political problems in countries like Thailand, Argentina and Turkey have been exacerbated by concerns that growth in emerging markets will be stymied as the Federal Reserve reduces its monthly bond purchases.The situation in Ukraine has only played into those fears.Ukraine makes up only about 0.2 percent of global gross domestic product, according to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, and in itself has little bearing on the world economy. Rather, economists said the biggest danger to global growth, outside of outright war, was the possibility that sanctions or political theater could bring a disruption to the flow of natural gas to Western Europe, creating an external shock that could push the fragile euro zone back into recession.The crisis has energy markets worried because a large portion of Russian natural gas for Europe moves through Ukraine. Natural gas prices rose about 6 percent on the British market, and shares of Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly that counts Ukraine as a major customer, fell more than 10 percent. Oil prices also rose, with Brent crude futures traded in London adding 1.9 percent. What may be keeping prices from going higher for now is that in recent years Russia has chipped away at the amount of gas that goes through Ukraine by opening the Nord Stream pipeline, which bypasses the country. In addition, European countries have been able to build up substantial stores of gas, given that the winter has been warm.Stocks with direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine also took a hit.Several of the biggest western oil companies like ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell have major investments in Russia. BP, the British oil company, has significant interests with a 20 percent stake in Rosneft, the state-controlled oil company. Robert W. Dudley, BP\u2019s chief executive, serves on Rosneft\u2019s board, and BP has been in talks to send teams of technical experts to help the Russian company. On Monday, BP shares fell 2 percent in London.Russia is also a big player in industrial metals, and most of the world\u2019s major brands are significantly invested in the country. \u201cThat means Russia is very important for a range of European and American companies,\u201d said Chris Weafer, co-founder of Moscow-based Macro Advisory. For instance, Russia is the No. 1 market for the French dairy giant Danone and the second-biggest market for Pepsi. Shares of the French automaker Renault, which also has major operations and sales there, fell 5.4 percent.European banking shares were broadly off, led by a 9.6 percent decline in Raiffeisen Bank International, the Austrian lender that ranks as one of the Western lenders most exposed to Ukraine. UniCredit, the Italian lender, fell 6 percent, while BNP Paribas of France and Piraeus Bank of Greece each declined more than 3 percent.But the fallout to the banking sector may be somewhat limited. During the financial crisis in 2009, many Western banks pulled back from Ukraine, and Russian lenders, particularly Sberbank and VEB, stepped in to take up the slack. Raiffeisen is one of the few European Union lenders with major Ukraine business, and it said in November that it was seeking to sell the local unit, known as Raiffeisen Bank Aval.Ms. Marcussen of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said that investors would be closely watching the progress this week of an expected International Monetary Fund mission to the Ukrainian capital, Kiev. The interim Ukrainian government is negotiating with the European Union, the United States and the International Monetary Fund for a bailout of as much as $35 billion to get it through the next two years. And a team from the fund was expected to arrive in Kiev for discussions this week.Of major concern, Ms. Marcussen said, would be whether the fund will seek major \u201chaircuts\u201d on the value of Ukrainian government debt, forcing private sector bondholders to book big losses. On Monday, bond yields in Russia and Ukraine jumped significantly, suggesting investors are worried.Over all, the biggest risks of the crisis may be more specific to the Russian and Ukraine economies, which have been under pressure for a while. Even before Russia\u2019s armed intervention, Ukraine faced a possible default on its debt, and its economy was hobbled.In Russia, growth has been slowing, as commodity prices fall and foreign investment dries up. Last year, growth came in just at above 1 percent, well below the 3 percent that international economists had forecast.\u201cWhat\u2019s becoming clear is that Russia has finally come to the end of its oil-driven growth model. It needs a new investment driver, and needs to attract more foreign investment to diversify its industries,\u201d said Mr. Weafer of Macro Advisory.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the reaction in the markets for Russian and Ukrainian bonds. Bond yields rose, not prices.Andrew E. Kramer and Stanley Reed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reactions Are Mixed in Canada as Chrysler Bluntly Calls for More Help", "Date": "2014-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 Five years after Chrysler received 2.9 billion Canadian dollars from Canada\u2019s government to help it stay in business, the automaker is looking for more help. This time, it is in the form of financial assistance that it says it must have to continue producing minivans and other vehicles in Canada.But unlike five years ago, the demand is not finding as receptive an audience, even as Canadian governments begin to negotiate assistance. Made in the typically blunt style of Sergio Marchionne, chief executive of the newly merged Fiat Chrysler, the ultimatum has spurred a growing backlash. In a rare break with political tradition, the leader of the main opposition party in Ontario, a province that contributed to Chrysler\u2019s 2009 rescue, is urging that governments call Mr. Marchionne\u2019s bluff.The approach of that leader, Tim Hudak, the head of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, is unlikely to be adopted. But the debate over what Chrysler owes Canada comes at a time when the country, once the largest exporter of vehicles to the United States, finds itself slipping rapidly behind Mexico, which did not aid Chrysler or General Motors when they collapsed into bankruptcy. Of the $42.3 billion invested in the North American auto industry between 2010 and 2012, just $2.3 billion was spent in Canada.\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a feeling that we\u2019re being exploited,\u201d said Mike Moffatt, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Western Ontario\u2019s Ivey business school. \u201cThis really shows that, at the end of the day, companies are going to make decisions based on dollars and cents rather than: \u2018Six years ago you did something good for me.\u2019\u00a0\u201dChrysler is about to introduce a major redesign of those minivans, which are also exported to Europe under Fiat\u2019s Lancia brand. But in conferences with reporters, Mr. Marchionne has indicated that minivans will not continue to call Windsor home without government aid.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to decide whether you want this or not,\u201d he told reporters last month at the opening of an auto show in Toronto, the city where Mr. Marchionne, who holds dual Canadian and Italian citizenship, moved with his family at 14. \u201cWe\u2019re at the table. The car is ready. We\u2019re ready to build minivans \u2014 somewhere.\u201d Mr. Marchionne added that American states and Mexico were willing to help his company. \u201cThis is not a game for the fainthearted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes resolve and it takes cash.\u201dWhile comparing Canada to \u201ca guppy in shark-infested waters,\u201d Mr. Marchionne, who received an undergraduate degree and an M.B.A. from the University of Windsor, acknowledged that some might view him as a \u201csinner\u201d for seeking further financial help from Canada.\u201cI may be a sinner, but I make cars,\u201d he said at a news conference. \u201cYou may not like the sin, but there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I can\u2019t change my profession, unfortunately.\u201dIn the bailout, the governments of Canada and Ontario provided a 2.9 billion Canadian dollar loan at a time when the country\u2019s currency was approximately equal to the American dollar. Based on numbers from Canada\u2019s Department of Finance, Mark Milke, a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute, a right-leaning policy and research group based in Calgary, Alberta, estimated that 810 million Canadian dollars would never be recovered. That reflects loans that were assigned to Chrysler\u2019s corporate entity before its bankruptcy.Exactly what Mr. Marchionne wants from Canada this time, and how much he plans to invest in return, has never been publicly disclosed. Spokesmen for the Canadian and Ontario governments declined to comment on the negotiations, as did a spokeswoman for Chrysler Canada.A person briefed on the negotiations, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said that Chrysler was now seeking about $700 million. The two governments, the person said, are still determining what Chrysler plans to spend both in Windsor and at a plant in the Toronto suburb of Brampton, where it makes large rear-wheel-drive cars. A widely reported figure of $3.6 billion, the person added, appears to include the substantial cost of engineering and designing the new minivans, work that was largely done in the United States.The Conservative federal government telegraphed its interest in a deal with Chrysler by adding 500 million Canadian dollars to its auto industry investment fund. Ontario\u2019s Liberal government has also made clear that it is willing to lend Chrysler more money. That has left Mr. Hudak in the unusual position, for a Canadian politician, of publicly calling for an end to auto industry aid.\u201cOntario has never been the province where we had to bribe businesses to stay here,\u201d Mr. Hudak said in an interview. \u201cOur party did support the bailout because that was industrywide. We faced the whole industry getting wiped out. So we made that investment, and what did we get in return? Chrysler still owes us millions. We didn\u2019t get the jobs. We\u2019ve actually shrunk.\u201dInstead of assistance, Mr. Hudak has called for general corporate tax cuts and lower rates from the government-owned electrical power system.The move by Mr. Hudak appears to be aimed at voters in areas far from the auto manufacturing region, which runs from Windsor, at the border near Detroit, to Oshawa, east of Toronto. But within that area, it prompted a quick, negative reaction.Among those angry was Eddie Francis, the mayor of Windsor. He swiftly placed advertisements in two nationally circulated newspapers highlighting the importance of the auto industry to Canada\u2019s broad economy.\u201cWhether you agree with it or not, economic development requires that you play the game,\u201d Mr. Francis said in an interview, adding that a shutdown of Chrysler would be devastating for the city, which has 211,000 people. \u201cThe automotive sector is our No. 1 manufacturing sector. How do you not protect that?\u201dProfessor Moffatt, who teaches not far from Windsor in London, Ontario, agreed that losing Chrysler would be a major economic blow. While he said that Mr. Hudak had a point about electrical rates \u2014 which rose substantially following a decision by the province to end coal-fired generation \u2014 he said corporate tax rates were already competitive. A crucial problem with no obvious solution, he added, is the relatively high value of the Canadian dollar in recent years.Canada, he added, is not in a good position in any bidding war.\u201cLet\u2019s realize something,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Canada, we are only 35 million people. Many other markets can always outbid us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stamping With a Smile of Approval", "Date": "2014-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry CityA round of omakase at Sushi Katsuei, which opened in October in Park Slope.Three chefs stand behind the counter at Sushi Katsuei, neckties tucked inside white coats, eyes downcast. The rest of the room clatters, but they work in silence, as if of one clear mind. There is no hierarchy, no need for diners to jockey for position in front of one or another. From each chef will come the same pristine pieces of fish, sliced, patted and delivered with an economy of motion and, just possibly, a slip of a smile.It is an unlikely place for exaltation. Walls are bare, lighting blunt. The feeling is less minimalist than underdecorated. As for the menu, there is still the neighborhood to consider, and so California and spicy tuna rolls sneak in.Omakase starts at $45 for nine pieces of nigiri sushi and a hand roll, which on my visits was always a perfect loose cone of nori filled with rice, ruby-pink toro and flicks of scallion. A $65 option includes four kinds of sashimi, a hand roll and six pieces of nigiri, with further pieces available at market price. This feels just.The approach is classical, the lineup one all-star after another: hamachi dimpling from pink to red under a daub of fresh wasabi, chopped until half liquid; scallop stroked with lemon; king salmon on the verge of abandoning solidity.Among the sashimi may be an oyster topped with momiji oroshi, a slurry of grated daikon and red chile; red sea bream with the skin left on for texture, blanched with a douse of hot water; and bluefin toro, ever yielding, the only one the chefs will allow you to anoint with soy. Spanish mackerel arrives with char marks on its silvery edge from a toss on the grill. The smoke tempers the oiliness of the flesh.There is sea urchin, but sometimes only from Maine, paler than its flame-orange cousin from Santa Barbara, Calif. On a good night there will be both, and you can taste how the flavor intensifies, east to west, from a dip in the shallows to full fathom five.Ask for anago, not with the traditional sweet sauce but simply lemon and salt, which lets the warmth and flakiness of the eel come through. Afterward, if you are lucky, there will be pretty tendrils of eel spine, quickly fried, like ethereal, prickly chips.To elongate the meal, there is a diaphanous Hoyo Kura no Hana sake, as well as a few worthy smaller dishes: strands of watercress curled in dashi and littered with bonito flakes, and deep-fried blocks of tofu with their exterior slowly turning gelatinous in a broth strewn with tiny mushrooms.One of the owners, Aye Aye Swe, who was born in Burma and spent part of her life in Japan, runs the floor. She is vigilant: Twice my cooling tea was surreptitiously removed and replaced with a hot cup before I had taken a sip.The chefs watch carefully, too. One evening, Mr. Win looked uneasy as my companion clutched her just-made hand roll, still happily chatting. There were only a few precious moments before the nori would wilt from the heat of the rice. He shook his head.\u201cNo talking,\u201d he said. \u201cEat now.\u201dThen the smile.Advertisement"}

To say that I am hitting the ground running is a vast understatement.\u201dMr. Mattiello, who was House majority leader, assumed the speakership under bizarre circumstances. On Friday, seemingly out of the blue, federal and state officers staged a daytime raid on the office and home of Gordon D. Fox, then the speaker. They carted out several boxes labeled \u201cevidence\u201d without anyone ever explaining what was going on.On Saturday, Mr. Fox, a Democrat, announced his resignation as speaker, remaining silent on his reasons. Even now, no one has disclosed what the authorities were looking for or why Mr. Fox stepped down.Nonetheless, a succession race quickly ensued. On Tuesday, Representative Michael J. Marcello, a moderate Democrat, dropped out of the race, and Mr. Mattiello, an old-guard conservative, was elected with 61 votes. Six voted for Mr. Marcello, and six abstained.Afterward, Mr. Marcello, who had hugged Mr. Mattiello upon his election in the cheering House chamber, said he thought Mr. Mattiello won because he had an \u201cinstitutional advantage\u201d of being in the leadership. \u201cWhen you can give out jobs and favors and threaten people, that kind of thing, that weighs heavily,\u201d he said, but when asked if he had evidence that Mr. Mattiello had done so, he demurred.

{"Headline": "European Central Bank Holds Rates Steady", "Date": "2014-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, offered a spirited defense of the wisdom of doing nothing Thursday. That was after he and his fellow policy makers dashed expectations for an interest-rate cut or other action to stimulate the still ailing euro zone economy.During his news conference after the bank\u2019s monthly monetary policy meeting, Mr. Draghi described the euro zone as an \u201cisland of stability,\u201d gave a slightly more upbeat view of the region\u2019s growth, and delivered a lengthy discourse on all the reasons to believe that Europe was not in danger of falling into the same deflationary rut as Japan.Mr. Draghi\u2019s only concession to those looking for more energetic action was to promise that interest rates would remain low even after the euro zone economy started to recover. Rates will stay at the current low or even lower \u201ceven though we will be seeing improvements in the economy,\u201d Mr. Draghi said after the central bank left its key interest rate at 0.25 percent.Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank, summed things up curtly. \u201cIn fact, the E.C.B. did not do anything,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients.Some analysts, encouraged by statements Mr. Draghi made a month ago, had expected the bank to cut rates to a record low. But Mr. Draghi made it clear that the E.C.B. does not see conditions as being dire enough to warrant further stimulus yet.Rather, the bank issued a slightly more upbeat forecast for the euro zone economy, saying it would expand by 1.2 percent this year. In December, central bank economists forecast growth of 1.1 percent.Perhaps significantly, Mr. Draghi did not use the word \u201cfragile\u201d to describe the euro zone recovery, as has been his habit in recent months. While many risks remain, he told reporters, \u201cthe ongoing recovery is expected to proceed, albeit at a slow pace.\u201dThe news conference, after the monthly meeting of the bank\u2019s 24-member Governing Council, amounted to a rebuttal by Mr. Draghi of all the arguments that critics have used to argue for more decisive action. Although few people talk of dire outcomes like a euro zone breakup anymore, unemployment remains at 12 percent. Total economic output has not yet returned to the level of 2007. And credit remains scarce in countries like Italy and Spain.Even according to the central bank\u2019s own forecasts, which it updated Thursday, inflation will not return to the bank\u2019s official target of about 2 percent until 2017 at the earliest. The bank projected that the annual inflation rate would gradually rise from the current worrisome low level of 0.8 percent to 1.5 percent in 2016, and to 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter of that year.Some economists have warned that the 18-country euro zone is on the brink of deflation, a sustained and broad-based decline in prices that undercuts consumer spending and business investment.But when a Japanese reporter highlighted parallels between that country\u2019s years of deflation and the current situation in the euro zone, Mr. Draghi spent five minutes explaining why they are different. Among other factors, he said, euro zone banks are healthier and the central bank acted sooner than the Bank of Japan to take countermeasures.\u201cWe have been everything but inactive,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.Mr. Draghi has argued that the euro zone countries with low inflation or even declining prices are only the so-called peripheral countries that need to adjust to become more competitive, like Greece or Italy. In Germany and most other euro zone countries, Mr. Draghi has said, there is little risk of deflation.The central bank\u2019s relatively sanguine view of the euro zone economy was also not shaken by tension in Ukraine. Mr. Draghi said the crisis in the region posed unforeseeable and potentially substantial geopolitical risks. But he said that from an economic viewpoint, \u201cthe interconnections are not as important to suggest a strong contagion from that region.\u201d\u201cSo far we have a seen major impact on the Russian economy and the Ukrainian economy,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s very, very difficult to foresee what is going to be the impact over a horizon of two or three years, because that\u2019s what we have to look at.\u201dThe reluctance by the central bank\u2019s Governing Council to act Thursday may also have been a result of recent economic data supporting the thesis that the euro zone is mending slowly but surely.According to data released Thursday, German factory orders rose 1.2 percent from December, while French unemployment in the last three months of 2013 fell to 9.8 percent from 9.9 percent in the previous quarter. Workers younger than 25 accounted for most of the French decrease. Mr. Draghi pointed to other positive factors including job creation in the services sector and a slight decline in Portugal\u2019s unemployment rate.Retail trade in the euro zone rose 1.8 percent in January, compared with December, according to seasonally adjusted official data published Wednesday. In December, retail sales fell 1.3 percent from the previous month.The European Central Bank may also have held steady because it does not have many options left to stimulate the euro zone economy. Growth was a meager 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared with the previous quarter. But wholesale asset purchases \u2014 the method used by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the United States economy after interest rates were cut almost to zero \u2014 would be much more difficult to carry out in Europe.Germany\u2019s influential central bank, the Bundesbank, would probably oppose such purchases, especially if they involved government bonds. The Bundesbank has supported a legal challenge by German citizens who argue that government bond purchases would violate a rule that prohibits the European Central Bank from financing governments.Another approach, buying private assets like corporate bonds, would also be difficult. Because European businesses rely heavily on bank lending, there are fewer private assets available for the central bank to buy.The E.C.B. \u201cwas obviously further away from a rate cut than we and several other watchers had assumed,\u201d J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, chief economist at Commerzbank, said in a note after the meeting. \u201cRate cuts in the coming months are thus off the table for now.\u201dJenny Anderson contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

The region\u2019s unique ecosystem produces almost half the world\u2019s supply of wild sockeye salmon and is the spawning ground for all five species of Pacific salmon: sockeye, coho, chinook, chum and pink. \u201cThe Bristol Bay watershed is indeed one of the most productive ecosystems on the planet,\u201d Ms. McCarthy said. And the Pebble Mine, as it has been proposed in size and scope, she added, would cause \u201csignificant and irreversible negative impacts.\u201dFederal officials emphasized in the announcement on Friday that their examination of Bristol Bay and the Pebble Mine had come at the request of native Alaskan tribes in the region. The resulting investigation, begun in 2010, concluded in a final draft report in January that the mine, even without accidental spills or discharges, presented a threat of serious harm.Depending on the size of the mine, 24 to 94 miles of salmon-supporting streams and 1,300 to 5,350 acres of wetlands, ponds and lakes would be destroyed, the study said. A transportation corridor to support the mine, the study said, would also cross wetlands and about 64 streams and rivers in the Kvichak River watershed, 55 of which are known or likely to support salmon.Advertisement"}

While preventing any semblance of a repeat of instability has been the principal justification for President Paul Kagame\u2019s tight grip on power, rising living standards have helped keep a lid on renewed tension.\u201cIn terms of the economic model, I think it\u2019s a good example for the rest of Africa,\u201d said Amadou Sy, senior fellow in the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution. \u201cEverybody has a vision but these guys have been successful. The record is there.\u201dHe said that Rwanda has outperformed most others in the region in terms of indebtedness, inflation and growth. \u201cThe only downside I see,\u201d he added, \u201cI would really consult the political side.\u201dRwanda is heavily dependent on foreign assistance, which got slashed after a United Nations report accused the country of fostering a recent rebellion in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, squeezing the budget. The World Bank warned last year that the aid shock \u201cclouds the economic outlook for Rwanda.\u201dSo now, more than ever, Rwanda is on the hunt for investors rather than donors. Last April, it sold $400 million in bonds to investors from around the globe, part of a record year for African bonds that underscored how a continent once known for debt relief found a world eager to take a stake in it.The slowdown in China, tapering of bond buying by the Federal Reserve in the United States and the flight of capital from emerging markets have jeopardized some of the gains on the continent. But some analysts say that Rwanda has held up better than many and has continued to make tangible headway in living standards.The nation has reduced the percentage of people living below the poverty line from 59 percent to 45 percent between 2001 and 2011, with the share of people living in extreme poverty falling faster. Life expectancy, literacy, primary school enrollment and spending on health care have all gained in recent years.Beneath the heights of Kigali City Tower, the rusty corrugated iron roofs on the ramshackle one- and two-story buildings below testify to the challenge of Rwanda\u2019s goal: becoming a middle-income country. Beyond the city limits, an estimated 90 percent of the population is still employed in the country\u2019s terraced green hills, growing bananas, sorghum, potatoes and other crops, much of it subsistence farming.\u201cThe strategic vision behind this is a knowledge economy,\u201d said Jean Philbert Nsengimana, the minister in charge of youth and information technology. \u201cThat\u2019s where we want to go, shifting from an agrarian base to a knowledge base, leapfrogging the industrial.\u201dRwanda faces stiff competition. Kenya has a thriving start-up scene and offices for Google, Intel and Microsoft, not to mention a much larger consumer market attracting foreign companies. But the smooth roads and lack of violent crime make Kigali ever more appealing compared with the gridlocked, more dangerous streets of Nairobi.The Rwandan government famously banned plastic bags from the country to cut down on pollution. Motorcycle taxi drivers wear numbered vests and carry spare helmets for passengers without exception. As part of a modernization drive, the government demolished tens of thousands of huts with traditional grass-thatched roofs. To curb population growth, it offered free vasectomies and is embarking on a wide-ranging circumcision drive to reduce the number of HIV infections.\u201cIt is a very authoritarian political environment,\u201d said Ms. Pauletto. \u201cThere can be a failure to respect the sanctity of contracts.\u201dHuman rights groups continue to assail the government for repressive political policies. The country has been engaged in a high-profile diplomatic dispute with South Africa over attacks on Rwandan dissidents living there, including the murder in January of the country\u2019s former spy chief, found strangled in a Johannesburg hotel room.\u201cIf I need to get in touch with a minister, it\u2019s so much easier than when we started out,\u201d said Ms. Iribagiza, at a shared space called the Office where she worked alongside other young entrepreneurs. \u201cBasically I\u2019ve tweeted them and gotten feedback.\u201dLike the commodities exchange, the Rwanda Stock Exchange, which opened its doors in 2011, is still finding its footing. Pierre Celestin Rwabukumba, 39, chief executive of the stock exchange and a former stockbroker in New York, returned to Rwanda in 2004, working first at the country\u2019s central bank.\u201cWe started from blank paper nine years ago,\u201d he said of the stock exchange. Three years after getting its start, only two domestic companies, the brewer Bralirwa and Bank of Kigali, have had initial public offerings. But Mr. Rwabukumba said the Rwandan share index rose 44 percent last year, a sign in his view that the exchange, like the country itself, is headed in the right direction.\u201cWe have order; we are straightforward, clear, clean \u2014 it\u2019s a country governed by law,\u201d said Mr. Rwabukumba, sitting in his second-floor office in the Kigali City Tower.A few floors up, Ara Nashera, 27, creative director at Zilencio Creativo, was working on a crowd-funding platform like Kickstarter called eNkunga, which seeks to harness the money exchanged via cellphones in Africa. The technology may be new to Rwanda but the concept is anything but.\u201cCommunity contributions are how people get a child to university, pay for a wedding,\u201d said Mr. Nashera. The city sprawled out behind him, with new office buildings springing up in the nascent downtown. \u201cIt\u2019s the old way,\u201d he said, \u201cmade new.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Laredo, a Quiet Symbol of Closer Ties With Mexico", "Date": "2014-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneLAREDO, Tex. \u2014 A little-known customs agreement between the United States and Mexico removes a major hurdle in how goods move across the border and could be an economic boon to South Texas, trade experts and elected officials say.For more than a year, a Mexican customs inspection station has been open at the Laredo International Airport, the only airport in the United States where Mexican agents preclear cargo headed south of the border. Though officials in Laredo have praised the station as a signal of cooperation between the two countries, the celebration since the initial opening at the airport has been muted, mostly because of delays in setting up a similar station across the border in Mexico. Mexican officials would like to have the same type of customs operation, but a concern about American agents carrying weapons is stalling progress.For Mexico, the question is one of sovereignty. Despite the years of bloodshed because of drug-related violence, Mexico is one of the countries in which it is most difficult to legally obtain a gun.Carlos R. Villarreal, the city manager of Laredo, said there were reasons to hope for a breakthrough. When the issue of armed agents in Mexico arose during a recent meeting with trade officials in Washington, Mr. Villarreal said he was told Mexican officials were working to amend the law to pave the way for United States customs agents to carry guns. \u201cThat\u2019s the only issue that\u2019s pending,\u201d he said. Officials at the Mexican Embassy in Washington did not return phone calls or emails seeking comment. With the system in place at the Laredo airport, products are inspected there and then flown directly to their destinations in Mexico. Previously, cargo heading into Mexico had to be flown to an international airport in that country with inspection capabilities before heading to its final destination, Mr. Villarreal said.\u201cThis is changing how we do business with Mexico,\u201d he said, adding that some companies were interested in using the Laredo station because it allowed them to fly their cargo into Mexico rather than transport it by road. Most of the merchandise being processed at the airport are electronics, he said, but with Mexico\u2019s proposed energy reform, the airport could become a major shipping point for drilling and other extraction equipment.That would only add to the region\u2019s reputation as an international trade hub.United States Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat from Laredo, has worked on the inspection station issue with city and Mexican officials for more than five years and credited Alfredo Guti\u00e9rrez Ortiz Mena, the former director of Mexico\u2019s Servicio de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria, an arm of the federal agency that oversees tax and customs laws, for his work on the project. But he added that it was in Mexico\u2019s best interest to allow the American agents in.Some trade experts see the airport\u2019s inspection station as a positive step that could alter cross-border trade. Aside from the diplomatic gains, Mr. Wilson said, the initiative also made sense in terms of advancing the cross-border economic ties and furthering security initiatives.\u201cWhere we strategically need to be going on the border is having single ports of entry,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cIn an ideal world, we don\u2019t need to have two. We can have live intelligence sharing and not have to have monthly meetings with Mexican officials to share intelligence or strategies \u2014 we can make that happen on a minute-by-minute basis as they work right next to each other.\u201dSome see the program\u2019s potential success as containing unintended consequences. James Giermanski, the chairman of Powers Global Holdings and president of Powers International, an international security company, said that preclearance at airports could hurt the freight forwarding and warehousing industries in Laredo, a major source of revenue for the economy. The companies store and inspect merchandise before it is given final approval to continue north or south. \u201cSome of the likely impact is you won\u2019t need all the warehouses in Laredo,\u201d Mr. Giermanski said. Mr. Villarreal said that was a legitimate concern, but freight forwarding companies did not handle air cargo.\u201cThat business, right now, for the freight forwarders is flying 35,000 feet over their head,\u201d he said. And once the airport became a more popular option, he added, the warehouses would come into play more.\u201cThey start using the airport, and then with the number of trucks we process here, it will give you other options to say, \u2018Hey, let it stop here and fan out to get to other places like Houston or Austin or some other place and I\u2019ll fly just the final shipment to Seattle or Chicago. The rest will go by trucks.\u2019\u00a0\u201djaguilar@texastribune.org Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Sanctions Start, Russia Feels a Sting", "Date": "2014-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 American and European sanctions rattled Russia\u2019s economy on Friday, with Moscow\u2019s stock indexes opening sharply lower, rating agencies threatening to reduce the country\u2019s creditworthiness, and hints of trepidation coming from Russia\u2019s tycoons as they concluded an annual conference here.But if the aim of the sanctions is to put economic pressure on the wealthy allies crucial to President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s continued grip on power, there were few signs they would succeed, largely because those targeted were among the new generations of oligarchs who owe their fortunes and loyalties to Mr. Putin. \u201cIf anybody thinks he can manipulate him in any way, I suppose that would be the last attempt by anyone who did that,\u201d Mr. Yakunin said. \u201cHe will not forget that \u2014 or forgive that.\u201dBehind the bravado, however, lurked a distinct unease about the possible long-term effects on an already troubled economy.Russia\u2019s finance minister, Anton G. Siluanov, told reporters, \u201cImposition of the sanctions is definitely a negative for the general perception of our country\u2019s economy,\u201d according to the Interfax news agency. He cited more costly borrowing and the continuing pressure on the stock markets, one of which has fallen 21 percent this year.Whatever the political consequences, economists say the uncertainty that now hangs over nearly every profitable enterprise in Russia is what poses the gravest threat to the country\u2019s long-term prosperity, rather than any immediate consequence of the specific sanctions.Mr. Putin treated the sanctions as a cause to jest in his first public remarks since Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement. At a meeting of his national security council on Friday, he reacted dismissively when discussing those now on the American blacklist, as it has been called here, including three people in the room with him. \u201cWe should distance ourselves from them,\u201d he said, deadpan. \u201cThey compromise us.\u201dHe spoke shortly before the upper house of Parliament, the Federation Council, approved legislation to complete the annexation of Crimea. The 155 members present unanimously approved the measure after a brief, one-sided debate. Mr. Putin then promptly made it official in a signing ceremony at the Kremlin, a mere three weeks after Russian special operations troops began spreading through Crimea on the way to securing it.Mr. Yatsenyuk signed the central part of a so-called association agreement with European Union officials and with leaders of the body\u2019s 28 nations on the fringe of their summit meeting in Brussels. While the pact allows the two sides to deepen their economic and political collaboration, more detailed elements of the deal concerning free trade will be signed only after Ukraine\u2019s presidential election, scheduled for May.Despite the threat of diplomatic isolation and sanctions, the return of Crimea 60 years after the Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev transferred it to the administrative control of Ukraine has been greeted with overwhelming popular and political support that has sent Mr. Putin\u2019s ratings soaring to the highest level in five years.\u201cAll these sanctions aren\u2019t worth a grain of sand of the Crimean land that returned to Russia,\u201d declared a Twitter post on Friday by Dmitri O. Rogozin, a deputy prime minister who was among those targeted in the first wave of American sanctions announced on Monday.Banks are sure to be careful when considering whether to do business with any company that those on the sanctions list have even some stake in, and there are many such companies. Interest rates on business loans and mortgages, already sky high in Russia by Western standards, with mortgage rates well over 10 percent, are likely to rise still further.One unsettled question is whether the sanctions will encourage Russians to take their money out of the country and deposit it in Western banks or real estate, given the declining value of the ruble, or have an opposite effect of pushing Russians to hold their savings in rubles or domestic assets, out of a sense of patriotism or fear of sanctions.Map of European energy imports that come from Russia.Alexander N. Shokhin, the president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, a kind of club for oligarch interests, expressed concern that the consequences could be more severe if Mr. Obama and the European Union made good on threats to intensify the sanctions. At a news conference ending the union\u2019s annual conference, he noted that the United States had considerable experience punishing countries and companies for doing business with Iran in response to that country\u2019s program to develop its nuclear capacity.\u201cThere might be long-term consequences,\u201d Mr. Shokhin said. \u201cIt might be hard to attract foreign investment now until the investors already working here understand what risks they face,\u201d he added.For now, the American sanctions do not target the broader Russian economy, but rather the assets of those businessmen closest to Mr. Putin, men he has known for years, whose fortunes rose with his ascent to the peak of political authority.They include two brothers, Boris and Arkady Rotenberg, whom Mr. Putin befriended as a young man practicing martial arts in Leningrad, as St. Petersburg was called in Soviet times; Yuri V. Kovalchuk, the largest shareholder of Bank Rossiya, whom the Department of Treasury called one of Mr. Putin\u2019s \u201ccashiers\u201d; and Mr. Yakunin, a former Soviet-era commercial and trade attach\u00e9 at the United Nations who first met Mr. Putin when he was a deputy mayor in St. Petersburg.\u201cAll of the list will chafe at their inability to travel to the U.S.,\u201d the Eurasia Group, a consultancy, wrote in an analysis, \u201cbut the main and largely heartfelt reaction of these elites will be to redouble their loyalty to Putin, to whom they owe their careers and fortunes.\u201dThe group said that another close business ally of Mr. Putin\u2019s, Gennady N. Timchenko, could be the most exposed of those facing sanctions because of his holdings outside Russia, including an important commodity trading company, Gunvor Group. The day before Mr. Obama announced the expanded sanctions, Mr. Timchenko sold his share of the company to his Swedish partner, Torbjorn Tornqvist, prompting Mr. Shokhin to suggest that he might have had advance warning.Mr. Timchenko, through his holding company, Volga Group, owns a 23 percent stake in Novatek, Russia\u2019s largest private gas producer, and its shares fell nearly 9 percent on Friday in Moscow.For some conservatives in Mr. Putin\u2019s closest circle of advisers, the political conflict over Ukraine and now the economic sanctions confirmed Russia\u2019s worst suspicions of American efforts to dominate the world\u2019s economy \u2014 at the expense of Russia.In an interview in his wood-paneled office at Russian Railways, Mr. Yakunin said the United States and its allies in Europe control a \u201cglobal financial oligarchy\u201d that is determined to protect its political and economic domination of the world. In his view, the sanctions were not simply a result of Russia\u2019s move to absorb Crimea from Ukraine, but an inevitable reflex of a West that views Russia as a threat to its power \u2014 a reflex that would fail as Russia forged its own economic course with other emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere.\u201cRussia was, is and will be some kind of geopolitical competitor to the interests of Anglo-Saxon civilization,\u201d he said.Andrew E.

{"Headline": "A Body in the Snow", "Date": "2014-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe violent murder of a young innocent underpins Andrea Portes\u2019s second novel, \u201cBury This.\u201d Beth Krause is the victim in a 1978 case that is revitalized in 2003, when a group of film students starts to make a documentary of her life. The question posed by one of them is: \u201cIf 25 years can discover the Internet, the cellphone, this thing the iPod, can 25 years discover the secret of a girl murdered, abandoned, by the side of the road?\u201d But the question at the heart of \u201cBury This\u201d isn\u2019t about the possibilities brought by advances in forensic science but about the possibilities of language in the face of the ugliest truths. Portes could have taken the story, which is based on real events, copied it down straight, titled it something like \u201cPretty Murder,\u201d and had an instant best seller in a culture that gobbles up \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d with a helping of \u201cTo Catch a Predator\u201d for dessert. Instead, Portes tells this tale of violence in spiraling prose. Her empathy shies away from nothing in the tangled lives of this small Michigan town, with a young girl tied up tight in the center. \u201cBury This\u201d begins with the snowplow driver who finds Krause\u2019s body, and the writing is so exquisite it is impossible to believe that Portes could sustain its impressionistic method, at once omnipresent and precise, for the remainder of the novel: \u201cJust one doll is what\u2019s there in the snow, in the clutter, in the shutter of light, stab stab stab through the trees.\u201d But she does, with hardly a slip in tone as we move from character to character. We leave the prologue mourning for the snowplow driver and go on to mourn for this Michigan town, bereft after losing the beautiful Beth Krause. Portes brings us close to Krause, to her best friend, her parents, the detective who investigated Krause\u2019s murder as a rookie and who, thanks to the film students, returns to the case. She even brings us closer to the murder suspects. She invites us to know them, but it is never an invitation to \u201ccome stalk with me.\u201d What Portes does in \u201cBury This\u201d is less about voyeuristic thrill and more of an inspired channeling of not only the characters but the atmosphere. Everything testifies in this novel. After so many years of silence, even the Michigan landscape has a chance to speak, through the graveyard where Krause is buried: \u201cThen, the angel field near the gates, reserved for toddlers, infants, and children. The ground crying, too. Don\u2019t fill me. Don\u2019t fill me with that.\u201d Tales of a pretty innocent bruised and discarded cause books to fall off shelves and into shopping carts faster than deep-fried dough at half-price, but \u201cBury This\u201d isn\u2019t grimy pulp. Krause could be Any Girl U.S.A., and Portes delicately acknowledges the ripple effect of a failing economy, which crashes on the shores of Krause\u2019s Michigan town, when anonymous muscle is brought in during a union standoff. \u201cBury This\u201d doesn\u2019t breathe life into Krause to titillate us but to allow us to participate in the mystery \u2014 of her death, yes, but also of her life and of small-town America. Portes takes a tale of personal tragedy and marries it to one of national weight. Throughout, her writing about this dirty, awful thing is so fresh it falls on readers bright and clean as north-country snow. BURY THISBy Andrea Portes260 pp. Soft Skull Press.

{"Headline": "A Top-Heavy Focus on Income Inequality", "Date": "2014-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewI worry about growing income inequality. But I worry even more that the discussion is too narrowly focused. I worry that our outrage at the top 1 percent is distracting us from the problem that we should really care about: how to create opportunities and ensure a reasonable standard of living for the bottom 20 percent. But primal emotions are not always noble ones. Of course, when I see a colleague receive some award, I covet it. But this is not me at my best, and these are not the feelings we would instill and promote in our children. So why would we want public policy to cater to such feelings? These are real and important concerns, and we should address them. But we shouldn\u2019t let these arguments serve as handmaidens to our emotional outrage \u2014 or to a misguided belief that the economy is a zero-sum game and that reducing the position of the top 1 percent automatically improves everyone else\u2019s. This focus on the wealthiest has a cost. When we talk about the top 1 percent, we aren\u2019t talking about the complexity of life for the bottom 20 percent. For example, hourly workers face an increasingly volatile working life. Imagine not knowing how many hours of work you will have, or when you will work them. How will you juggle your work and your family? What kind of parent will you be? How do you make a rent payment that doesn\u2019t adjust for the fact that you may be working fewer hours? And consider that all this volatility comes in what often feels like a dead-end job. We should try to ensure that everyone has a fair opportunity to find a great life. It\u2019s a quest that will require political will and ingenious policies. President Obama\u2019s proposed expansion of the earned-income tax credit goes in this direction, but we need more.Doing more also requires money, which probably means taxing the rich. But this would be a tax on the rich as a means, not as an end in itself. Good policy-making differentiates between objectives and the means to achieve them. Objectives are the yardsticks by which we measure success, on which we base our identity. We sometimes make small compromises about these goals for pragmatic reasons, but we do so reluctantly. The means, however, are always being analyzed and revised. Consider a city that is raising taxes on the very rich. Should we worry that this move might cause some of the wealthy to leave the city? When taxation of the rich is the end, raising these concerns seems petty and politically motivated. If anything, suggesting that the rich may behave this way only adds to the outrage toward them.But if our goal is to fix the problems of the bottom 20 percent, we should weigh all these concerns. We should study the empirical evidence and coldheartedly understand which tax rates and policies will raise the most revenue. That\u2019s what will help achieve our goal. We must be passionate about our objectives, but dispassionate about the means. And taxing the rich is merely a means, not an objective.Alan S. Blinder, the Princeton economist, argues in his book \u201cHard Heads, Soft Hearts\u201d that great policy requires both of the elements in the book\u2019s title. Our soft hearts tell us it\u2019s wrong to have people living under a bridge or sleeping in tents in the bitter cold. Our hearts are unconvinced by vague appeals to personal responsibility as an excuse to keep us from providing basic living conditions for all. Our soft hearts are what tell us that, whatever the circumstances of birth, everyone must be given opportunities to do well. Our hearts are unconvinced by self-serving assertions that this is a land of opportunity, when facts suggest otherwise. But it is our hard heads that must focus on fixing these problems. They will ensure that we are pragmatic in policy choices. I fear that the focus on inequality has made us less pragmatic and more dogmatic.

Playing on these monitors are tired-looking moments from late-1990s and early-aughties cable television. The sound is on. The tensions between silence and sound, painterly and digital, flickering brushwork and flickering light parody the ideal of \u201cpresence\u201d of painting while providing a lively literal substitute. The eye is pulled back and forth between the layers of information and gesture, and among seeing, watching and looking. Adding to the confusion: The screens are turned on their sides, which makes the digital images harder to read while echoing the vertical rectangle that is painting\u2019s most conventional (and implicitly human) proportion. Where, if anywhere, Mr. Okiishi takes this conceit remains to be seen. But, for the moment, his show is among the more uncanny, unexpectedly arresting pictorial experiences to be had in New York.

{"Headline": "Domestic Crude Oil Drives a Cautious Refining Revival", "Date": "2014-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNIXON, Tex. \u2014 Since its construction in 1980, the small hard-luck refinery on the outskirts of this little cattle town has been locked shut for more years than it has been open.Situated a hundred miles inland and with domestic crude oil production declining year after year, the refinery could not compete with the large refineries on the Gulf Coast that imported vast supplies of high-quality oil from Nigeria, Angola and North Africa. Rust built up around the refinery\u2019s pipes and storage tanks over the decades, just as it did on dozens of other refineries that closed.But suddenly a technological drilling revolution has unlocked a gusher of superior-grade sweet crude from the Eagle Ford shale field just east and south of Nixon. Two years after a small Houston company named Blue Dolphin Energy reopened the mothballed plant, trucks now line up to take fuels for shipment across the state.Local residents complain a bit about the traffic. But otherwise Nixon, a town of 2,500 people outside San Antonio where the roads are lined with cactus and many storefronts downtown are still empty, is buoyant with newfound optimism.The refinery has employed more than 50 local residents who were mostly out of work. The local barbecue joints and Mexican restaurants are full with workers and truck drivers, sales taxes have doubled and property values have quadrupled since the refinery reopened. Along with the local oil boom, the reopening of the refinery has allowed the town to add a policeman to its five-man department, repave streets and add a well to its water system. Investors are even talking about building a hotel in town.\u201cWe were a dead town before the oil industry came in,\u201d said George Blanch, Nixon\u2019s city manager. \u201cNow we\u2019re on the edge of a boom.\u201dThe rebirth in Nixon could be a symbol for what is happening in the refinery business around the country.Long plagued by boom and bust cycles, refiners are now enjoying a rare golden age fueled by cheap and plentiful domestic oil and natural gas. Major refiners like Tesoro, Valero, HollyFrontier and Marathon Petroleum are expanding existing refineries in Utah, Texas, Kansas and Illinois to process the light grades of oil that come out of the new shale fields like Eagle Ford. Smaller companies are investing in \u201cteapot\u201d refineries like Nixon\u2019s to take advantage of the new market conditions.\u201cThe flash of expansion over the next two years of refining capacity is the biggest that I\u2019ve seen in 30 years,\u201d said Greg A. Haas, director of research at Hart Energy, a research and consulting company.The expansions come at a time when plentiful American energy supplies give the refiners a competitive advantage with foreign refiners as they expand their markets in Latin America and Africa for diesel fuel and other products.But they also represent an effort by the refiners to nimbly navigate an uncertain market. Domestic consumption of gasoline has lagged in recent years because of the weak economy and increasingly efficient automobiles.Refiners are taking a cautious approach to expansion, analysts say, because the refiners worry that a reversal in the current government policy of banning most exports of domestic oil would raise the benchmark prices for American oil and strip them of their competitive edge with foreign refiners. Otherwise the investments would be even greater, analysts say.Nevertheless an estimated 864,000 barrels a day of new fuel processing capacity is being planned, according to company statements. And many analysts think the announcements do not approach the real number. \u201cThere are a lot of refiners who like to keep things close to the vest for competition reasons,\u201d said Leo Mariani, a senior oil analyst at RBC Capital Markets.A few entirely new refineries are being built or planned in North Dakota, Texas and Utah. They are small but remarkable nonetheless, since a major new refinery has not been built in the United States in over three decades. All told, the planned refineries, expansions and new distillation towers that will be built over the next few years represent roughly $5 billion in investments.Kinder Morgan, Martin Midstream and several other companies are planning to build simple stand-alone distillation towers to partly refine another growing product \u2014 condensates, the hydrocarbon liquids used for petrochemical production that bubble out of the ground with sweet crude. As many as a dozen of these projects are being planned for Ohio, Texas and Kentucky.All the projects represent a sharp pivot for the refiners. Long geared to process heavy crudes imported from Venezuela, Mexico and Canada, the refiners in the nation\u2019s midsection are suddenly faced with excesses of light domestic crudes and natural gas liquids from the shale fields. Few analysts saw the domestic oil flood coming a mere decade ago; now, refiners need to refit their plants for light sweet crudes.\u201cAll these refiners have a bad taste in their mouth from spending all this capital building out to process all of this heavy crude and suddenly we have this light crude boom,\u201d said Anthony Starkey, an analyst at Bentek Energy, a consulting firm.A reversal of the export ban could force yet another shift, analysts warn.Most analysts think it is unlikely that the Obama administration or Congress will do more than tinker with the export ban over the next two years, but some predict it will eventually become a pressing political issue if domestic oil production continues to expand.Refinery executives express concern that an end to the ban would narrow the price spread between domestic grades and international grades of crude, diminishing one big advantage they have over refiners abroad that have cheaper labor and less onerous environmental regulations.Michael C. Jennings, chief executive of HollyFrontier, said that authorization of unlimited exports of domestic crude \u201cwould take away what has effectively reversed a trend of refinery closures in the United States that had been pretty steady from about 1975 to 2009,\u201d unless the government also modified other policies costly to refiners, including biofuel mandates and a variety of fuel and emissions standards.Leading the way in the expansions is Valero, which is making $800 million of investments to expand and upgrade three Texas refineries to process increased volumes of light-grade crude from the Eagle Ford in South Texas and the Permian Basin in West Texas by early 2016. Much of the new processing capacity will enable Valero to replace partly refined foreign oil with Texas crude, saving shipping costs.Included in the expansions is the building of docks at Valero\u2019s refinery in Corpus Christi, Tex., to ship Eagle Ford crude to other domestic refineries and to Canada, which is permitted under current regulations. Theoretically, Valero executives say, the docks could eventually be used to export sweet crude abroad, though the company opposes a reversal of current export policies.\u201cWe can get a really good return on our investment from expanding these units to process the ample supplies of new domestic crude,\u201d said Bill Day, a Valero vice president. But he added that if the ban on exports were lifted, \u201cWe would have to take another look at the economics of these projects.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Call to Artists on Crimea Echoes Soviet Ways", "Date": "2014-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s Ministry of Culture recently called leading artists and intellectuals to suggest that they endorse a petition hailing President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea, setting off impassioned accusations from the literati that the Kremlin was resurrecting repugnant Soviet methods.Boldface names immediately signed: Valery Gergiev, the director of the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg and the principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra; the pianist Denis Matsuev; and Vladimir Urin, the director general of the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow.But even as Russia\u2019s leaders employed a tactic that harked back to Stalin, pressuring its cultural elite to kowtow, the effort was not without problems. At least one artist whose name appeared was dead. Several more protested that their signatures had been added without their knowledge. And opponents of the Crimea venture responded with a mixture of derision and outrage, issuing their own diatribe against the Kremlin\u2019s Ukraine policy titled \u201cDon\u2019t Bend, Don\u2019t Yield to Lies.\u201d\u201cAn old, old Soviet story repeating itself,\u201d Boris Akunin, a novelist who signed the opposition petition, wrote in an email when asked about the war of words.\u201cIt\u2019s just that under Stalin, if a prominent cultural figure dared to protest he\u2019d be shot; under Brezhnev he\u2019d be imprisoned; now he just risks losing state donations and having to travel economy class \u2014 but this often proves enough,\u201d Mr. Akunin wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating sight to watch people make this moral choice.\u201dSome opponents raised what they considered a larger and more troubling concern signaled by the Culture Ministry\u2019s effort: that the annexation of Crimea seemed to crystallize the renewed use of ideology and loyalty as the measuring stick for good citizenship, a tool for control that faded with the 1991 demise of the Soviet Union. Mr. Putin himself inveighed against \u201cnational traitors\u201d in his speech reclaiming Crimea for Russia.\u201cThis awful notion of \u2018national traitors\u2019 appearing suddenly as if it is a kind of call from the old and gloomy past, from the Stalinist era when this was a crime against the state,\u201d said Irina D. Prokhorova, the editor and publisher of The New Literary Observer. Last December, Ms. Prokhorova replaced her brother, Mikhail D. Prokhorov, the tycoon who owns the Brooklyn Nets, as the head of a fledgling political party, Civic Platform.The Ministry of Culture petition endorsing the annexation of Crimea, issued on March 11, was just four sentences. \u201cOur mutual history and mutual roots, our culture and its spiritual origins, our fundamental values and language have united us forever,\u201d it read, going on to say that those who signed \u201cfirmly declare our support for the position of Russia\u2019s president on Ukraine and Crimea.\u201dInitially published on the ministry\u2019s website with 85 signatures, it stopped at 511 names after the ministry announced that it was overwhelmed by the flood of letters, which led to \u201ctechnical errors.\u201d The ministry apologized to three artists whose names were added without their permission. The dead artist went unmentioned, but the name V. E. Tsigal quietly disappeared from the list. (It could have been one of two brothers: Vladimir, a sculptor, died last year; his brother Victor, a painter, in 2005.)Karen G. Shakhnazarov, 61, the head of Mosfilm, Russia\u2019s major movie studio, said he signed first in memory of his father, who fought in the Red Army to liberate Crimea from the Nazis. More important, Mr. Shakhnazarov signed because, he said, Ukraine lacks a legitimate government, and the people in Crimea \u201chave the right to choose their fate themselves.\u201dPolls indicate that at least 75 to 80 percent of Russians support the annexation of Crimea, a piece of Russia until it was granted to Ukraine as a gift in 1954. Like many, Mr. Shakhnazarov mentioned the potential rise of fascism in Ukraine \u2014 part of the daily news diet on Russian television \u2014 as well as similar liberation struggles in Scotland and Kosovo. He rejected differences \u2014 that all sides approved holding the referendum in Scotland, that the Kosovars were being killed by their own government, and that none of the others have been asked to vote under what amounts to military occupation, as occurred in Crimea. \u201cThe Crimea would vote like this in any case, under any conditions,\u201d he said.Mr. Shakhnazarov, who has been the head of Mosfilm for 15 years, said, \u201cIf I had not signed the letter, there would have been no problems, no consequences.\u201dMr. Gergiev, the conductor, who attracted protests at the Metropolitan Opera in New York last fall for what demonstrators considered his anemic response to Russia\u2019s antigay laws, did not return a phone call requesting comment.But he was quoted by the official newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta as saying, \u201cUkraine for us is an essential part of our cultural space, in which we were brought up and in which we have lived until now.\u201dThe bulk of those who signed the government petition were directors of state-financed cultural institutions \u2014 theaters, museums and libraries. Sergei Shub, the director of the Baltic House Theater in St. Petersburg, said in an interview with Novaya Gazeta that he signed without pressure when the Ministry of Culture called. \u201cOf course, I had a feeling that there was this theater behind me, the theater for which I am responsible,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is always this feeling that you have your work behind you and people working together with you.\u201dMore than 200 people signed the opposition petition published on March 13 in Novaya Gazeta, including musicians, writers, human rights advocates, architects, scientists and one self-described \u201cjeweler.\u201d\u201cOur country has been drawn into a dangerous gamble,\u201d it said in part, warning that Russia faced a potential economic, political and military \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d\u201cRussian civil society is still very vulnerable,\u201d Ms. Prokhorova said. \u201cThere are not enough institutions to support it, to defend it from the state.\u201dAlexey K. Simonov, 74, the head of the Glasnost Defense Foundation, said the dueling petitions reminded him of public attacks from earlier eras against writers or dissidents like Boris Pasternak, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov. Open letters would appear, he recalled, saying, \u201c \u2018To hell with Pasternak!\u2019 or \u2018To hell with Solzhenitsyn!\u2019 To hell with them, they are rascals, they are enemies.\u201dMr. Simonov said he signed the opposition letter not out of any support for a Western position \u2014 \u201cI hate the politics of the U.S. as much as I hate the politics of my own country,\u201d he said \u2014 but because he did not want to see Russia take on the world again.The denunciations of critics of the Ukraine policy have further unnerved opposition figures. Their unease was compounded amid a rush of recent moves to silence dissenting voices \u2014 virtually shuttering the main independent television station, removing a news editor deemed insufficiently loyal, shutting opposition websites and continuing to brand nongovernmental organizations receiving money from abroad as \u201cforeign agents.\u201dOne or two outspoken critics, including Andrei Zubov, a history professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, were fired after speaking out against Russia\u2019s Ukraine policy.\u201cHow fast we\u2019ve returned to the Soviet Empire,\u201d he wrote.Alexandra Odynova contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mines Have Shut Down. The Miners Haven\u2019t.", "Date": "2014-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDown a homemade mine shaft in southwestern Poland, a would-be comedian sang in the faint glowing light. The strains of \u201cOb-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,\u201d in rhythm with a pick ax, rose up from eight yards underground.The song stopped. \u201cA huge chunk of coal has fallen on my finger!\u201d the miner yelled up the shaft. \u201cNow I can\u2019t pick my nose!\u201d The sky was black and the stars blazed, especially the constellation Orion. In the nearby city of Walbrzych, the bells had just tolled. It was\u00a09 p.m., the temperature was below freezing, the wind bitter. But for many miners here, in a region known as Lower Silesia, work was just beginning. But while Germany, Europe\u2019s largest overall coal producer, is aggressively trying to encourage renewable energy sources, Poland has shown far less interest in finding alternatives. More than 88 percent of its electricity is powered by coal, and many people still use it to heat homes. That dependence means that mining never stopped in Lower Silesia, despite the shuttering of industrial mines in the late 1990s. The mines were deemed to be unprofitable, as well as dangerous. Coal seams are found at steep angles in the region, making machinery hard to use. And hundreds of years of mining tapped out reserves.\u201cWe started to make the switch from a communist economy to a market economy, and these places were not efficient enough for businesses to be interested in them on an industrial scale,\u201d said Pawel Mikusek, a spokesman for the state environmental ministry. Those kinds of efficiencies helped make Poland an economic model of sorts among its post-Soviet neighbors, and countries like Bulgaria and Ukraine look at its growth rate over the last two decades with envy. But they also cost jobs in places like Walbrzych, where the mayor estimated the unemployment rate at about 15 percent. So unemployed miners continue to dig for black coal on their own. And for younger men here, rathole mining is the only kind of mining they have ever known. Activists estimate that as many as 3,000 men are engaged in illegal mining in Lower Silesia, though local officials say they believe that the number is much lower. And while coal in Poland is relatively cheap, buying it on the black market here can be 30 or 40 percent cheaper than buying it legally.A walk in a hilly area outside of town on a recent February night was treacherous. Makeshift mine shafts were all around, waiting to swallow up those unfamiliar with the terrain. At least four groups of miners were working, one group of five just getting started around 11 p.m. Cars and trucks drove in, often with their lights off, to collect 30 sacks of coal at a time. The men cracked jokes and told tales, like the one about a woman\u00a0who for two sacks of coal will keep a miner warm at night.\u00a0\u201cIs it worth the coal?\u201d\u00a0one miner asked another.At the same time, it was clear that this was tough work for often desperate men, and boys. Because it is illegal, and because many of the miners have been caught by the police and fined, they generally gave only their first names, if any at all. \u201cThe whole of Walbrzych is being dug up,\u201d said Konrad, 22, who mined a hole that was remote enough that he could work it during the day. It was a little more than four yards deep, the walls about a yard apart, braced by about 20 birch logs. At the bottom, a light was powered by a car battery. All of Konrad was covered in a soft brown dirt and black soot \u2014 from his close-cropped blond hair to his once-white Asics sneakers. Konrad, who grew up in an orphanage and did not get very far in school, worked with Tomasz, who was 17. Tomasz was down in the hole, hacking coal from the side of shaft. Then he loaded the coal into a plastic bucket tied to a rope, which Konrad pulled to the surface. Tomasz was asked if he feared that the hole might collapse. \u201cYou should just pray,\u201d he said. \u201cI do it every day.\u201dNo Uniforms, No ParadesFor about 15 years, Roman Janiszek, 51, worked in the coal mines of Walbrzych. He started mining when he was 20 or 21, in the early 1980s. \u201cEverybody had jobs and the town was full of coal mines and coking plants, and the industry was big,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat was nice about the good old days is that we were all respected.\u201dThere were festivities on Dec. 4 to celebrate St. Barbara, the patron saint of miners. The miners wore fancy uniforms with plumed hats. During an interview at his small apartment, Mr. Janiszek insisted on putting on his old black uniform with a white-feathered cap. \u201cLots of orders were pinned to our chests,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe all wore them with pride.\u201dThen the mines closed. \u201cWe all lost our jobs, thousands of people, just like that, onto the street,\u201d Mr. Janiszek recalled. \u201cThere was this idea that the coal mines were not profitable. The decision came from Warsaw; they all did it in haste.\u201d He hit the road. He picked grapes in Austria, harvested nuts and watermelons in Greece, worked on a pig farm in Switzerland. Eventually, he was deported back to Poland, penniless. He ran into an old apprentice who was working in the illegal rathole mines. \u201cHe says, \u2018Well, Roman, come with us and see what it looks like, see how it\u2019s done,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Janiszek recalled. \u201cAnd I said to him, \u2018O.K., I\u2019ll do it.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSo began a second life as a miner. There were no uniforms this time, and no parades. After a few years, he became an activist who organized protests on behalf of the miners.\u00a0He wants the local police to stop harassing the miners and has hopes to make the work legitimate again. He was co-founder of an activist group with Grzegorz Walowski, 34, a former rathole miner who is now a doctoral student. Mr. Walowski studies advanced technologies like coal gasification, which can turn coal into gas without even taking it out of the ground. \u201cI can see a special role for the miners working now,\u201d Mr. Walowski said. \u201cThey have an expert knowledge of where the coal is, and this is not so easy.\u201dIt is unclear if such technologies will be cost-effective, but with Poland\u2019s hunger for coal exceeding its production, the central government recently licensed an Australian company, Balamara Resources, to conduct research in Lower Silesia to determine whether mines could be reopened. The project is expected to take another couple of years to complete. During a tour of the city, Mr. Janiszek stopped at an old slag pile. He has tried his hand at acting, and he has a theatrical flair. Standing atop the pile, the city stretching out in the distance, he held up a piece of coal. \u201cThis piece of coal testifies to the fact that there used to be coal in Walbrzych, there is coal in Walbrzych and there will be coal in Walbrzych,\u201d he said. \u201cLife goes on and we basically do the same thing we\u2019ve always done. We just do it differently.\u201d\u201cThere will just be memories. There will be pictures. There will be photos and uniforms. Life goes on,\u201d he said. \u201cAmen.\u201dChasing the DiggersThere is another man named Roman in Walbrzych. He is Roman Szelemej, the city\u2019s mayor. And he, too, has experience in the mines, but as a doctor. Dr. Szelemej is a cardiologist who started his medical career in a clinic in one of the mine complexes. He is a former hospital executive with a view of the wider world. A sister lives in New Jersey, and he has two daughters in London. Since taking office in 2011, he has been trying to address a fundamental question: What do you do with a coal town where coal mining is no longer legal?Walbrzych, a city of about 120,000, sits in a part of Lower Silesia that belonged to Germany before World War II. Coal mining has been going on for hundreds of years here. It\u2019s a town that looks better from afar, nestled among woodlands, than up close. Downtown, you can find old men carrying buckets of coal up flights of stairs to heat their flats. Dr. Szelemej is adamant that the city needs to look beyond coal. And he lamented the \u201cP.R. problems\u201d brought by \u201cthe diggers,\u201d as he called them.\u201cThis is why you are coming here,\u201d he told me. \u201cI am happy to have you here, but you are here because of diggers, not because you are interested in the personal career of the mayor of Walbrzych being a cardiologist, no way, so it\u2019s a price we still pay because of the history of this city. We are trying not to forget these problems. We know it exists. We try to solve it, but it\u2019s part of the image we would like to change.\u201dThe mayor is focused on bringing new business to an economic development zone where Toyota and a number of auto suppliers have plants. He sat in his office at City Hall, a three-story stone building with decorative turrets in a small town square; the noise of a jackhammer outside his window testified to the kind of development he is trying to bring to the town. There was a grandfather clock, a crucifix on one wall and his well-worn medical bag in a nearby chair. After he took office, he visited some of the illegal mines and even talked to one of the miners. He described them as uneducated with an attitude \u201ctypical for those people who simply prefer to be, let\u2019s say, free.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s much easier than to go to the Toyota factory and work from 7:30 up to 5:30 or 6:30, regularly, day after day,\u201d he said. Mining was hard work, he said, but also easier in a way than staying with a steady job. Wojciech Suwala, a professor at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow, said that \u201cthe income from this mining is very high,\u201d relatively speaking. He said he had heard that middlemen who take coal from these miners could make 10,000 zlotys a month, or about $3,300, though the miners themselves make much less than that. \u201cThis is a good opportunity for the men to earn money, and there is no burden of social security, health care, etc., and it\u2019s quite well organized,\u201d Mr. Suwala said. \u201cAnd the punishment is low, and it\u2019s not preventing them from doing it.\u201dDr. Szelemej, however, is committed to putting a stop to it. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s criminal. It\u2019s illegal. It\u2019s destroying forests, destroying nature,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThere is no future for the coal industry here. It is closed. No more.\u201dBut Dr. Szelemej acknowledges that there are limits in his administration\u2019s efforts to chase off the diggers. His predecessors all tried to stop it, and he said he had redoubled efforts. Still, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t use the whole police force.\u201d There are other problems to address in the city: car accidents, drugs, domestic violence. And so the digging goes on. \u2018I Have to Work Here\u2019Back out at the mines, Konrad and Tomasz are still at work as the sun fades in the sky. \u201cI work here, I kind of like working here, but I have to work here,\u201d Konrad said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely better working here than going and stealing something.\u201dThey have been digging this hole for three or four months. Sometimes it caves in, and so they dig again. \u201cAfter a heavy rain, the whole thing may collapse,\u201d Konrad said, \u201cand then we spend up to two weeks just excavating it back.\u201d There are other setbacks. Two months ago, Konrad was caught by the police and fined 550 zlotys, or about $180, which amounted to a week\u2019s work. But if you do not pay, you are jailed.They can dig out two metric tons of coal per day, surrounding the hole itself with a wall of sacks. Who buys it? \u201cEverybody,\u201d Konrad says. The miners sell either to middlemen, or directly to townspeople. Between hauling bags, Konrad fielded a call from an elderly customer on his cellphone. Down in the hole, meanwhile, Tomasz said there was a certain peace to the work, despite the risks and the narrow escapes from cave-ins. \u201cIt\u2019s like a retreat. It\u2019s so quiet, calm,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re here, on your own.\u201dMaciek Nabrdalik and Jacek Rutkowski contributed reporting. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Degree in Hand, but a Slow Start Up the Career Ladder", "Date": "2014-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyTHERE were so many low points, it\u2019s hard for Kyle Whittaker to say which was the lowest. Ditching his girlfriend\u2019s broken-down Lincoln at a gas station, because they couldn\u2019t afford the tow? Month No. 3 of living on nothing but angel hair pasta? Or maybe it was the day he realized he might have to move back in with one of his parents. It was 2009, and \u201cI wasn\u2019t confident that it was going to work out where I was,\u201d he said. \u201cYou acquiesce to the fact that there\u2019s just nothing coming for you.\u201dBy all measures, he had done everything right. He just did it at the wrong time. Mr. Whittaker graduated in May 2008 and walked into the worst recession since the 1930s. After six months scouring job sites, he took the only position he could get \u2014 working part time at Lord & Taylor in Northern Virginia. The pay barely covered his rent. \u201cIt definitely hits your self-esteem pretty hard,\u201d he said recently from his home in Severn, Md. Mr. Whittaker is part of a generation of college graduates who had the bad luck of beginning careers during the Great Recession and its aftermath. About 10 million students have earned bachelor\u2019s degrees since 2008. In 2012, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, almost half of recent college graduates were considered underemployed, working in jobs that typically do not require a bachelor\u2019s degree. That compares with about a third of college graduates over all. \u201cThey were successful in the task that we put before them,\u201d said Carl E. Van Horn, director of the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University. \u201cThen they can\u2019t get a good job.\u201dAnd now many recent graduates wonder if a college degree was worth all the effort and expense. Brittany Himes is pretty sure it wasn\u2019t. Growing up in Mount Vernon, Ky., she had wanted to go to beauty school. But by the time she became a high school senior, the message had sunk in: A four-year college degree was a must. It was \u201csomething that you definitely had to do if you wanted to be successful in the job market,\u201d she said. She would be the first in her family to go to college. In December 2009 she finished a business degree at Eastern Kentucky University. After more than a year searching fruitlessly for an entry-level administrative job, she went back to Plan A. She finished a cosmetology program last September. Now, at 28, Ms. Himes is making $7.20 an hour, with $27,000 in student loans to pay off. \u201cI\u2019m starting at the bottom,\u201d she said between appointments at Kolor Kreations salon in Richmond, Ky., her blond hair now dyed black with purple highlights. \u201cI enjoyed college. I enjoyed learning, but in the end it didn\u2019t really amount to much for me.\u201dBut what they end up settling for has changed. They are more likely to work part time or in low-wage jobs like retail or restaurant work. \u201cThings have gotten tougher for recent college graduates,\u201d Mr. Deitz said. The plan got off to a rough start. \u201cTo go from doing really well and being respected by professors and by my peers in class to, \u2018We\u2019re just not hiring at Target right now, sorry, thanks,\u2019 was really disappointing,\u201d she said.After months of looking, Ms. Bend, 31, finally found a job at a domestic violence crisis center \u2014 just as her first loan payment came due. But her pay was so low she deferred her loans and the balance grew to $32,000.She\u2019s now an administrative assistant with a financial services firm, a job that requires a degree. She is also married with a baby on the way. But, as with many recession graduates, her slow job start means putting off buying a house. And her plans for law school? They have been delayed for a decade, she said. Then there\u2019s the impact on retirement savings for someone who graduates from college with student loan debt and can\u2019t afford to save for a decade. Take a 22-year-old who earns $30,000 annually, gets a 3 percent raise each year, saves 4 percent of salary that first year in a 401(k) and raises that by 2 percentage points each year until reaching the maximum legal contribution.\u201cThey\u2019re not doing as well as they might have done when the economy was in full growth mode, but they do a lot better than anybody else,\u201d Mr. Carnevale of Georgetown said. Six years after he graduated, Kyle Whittaker, the math major who worked at Lord & Taylor, has pretty much caught up to where he wanted to be. Eventually, he landed a job as an analyst with a defense contractor in Maryland. Gradually, he paid off his credit card debt and started chipping away at his student loans. He began contributing to his workplace 401(k), steadily increasing his contribution. Three and a half years and several promotions later, he and his fianc\u00e9e had saved enough to make a small down payment on a house. Mr. Whittaker can even find some good in his retail job. When he showed up for the analyst interview, he was wearing a designer suit with a stylish pocket square. He bought it with his employee discount. \u201cI would like to think that things are working out relatively well now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just took a little bit of time.\u201dAmy Scott is the education correspondent for the public radio program \"Marketplace.\" Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Disguise, a Budget That Britain Needs", "Date": "2014-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconoclastLONDON \u2014 The British budget released this week was not really a statement of economic policy but a program for winning next year\u2019s general election. In that sense, the budget speech by George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, was a natural development from the 2013 budget, which began Britain\u2019s present economic recovery. Almost nobody predicted that remarkable transformation because what Mr. Osborne did was deliberately obfuscated by what he said.Mr. Osborne\u2019s mantra last year was \u201cYou can\u2019t cure debt with more debt,\u201d but he did precisely that with his audacious plan to provide government guarantees for 120 billion pounds, about $200 billion, of additional mortgage borrowing.In this year\u2019s budget, Mr. Osborne continued with this Machiavellian technique, proclaiming a virtuous-sounding principle and then doing exactly the opposite. After he characterized his speech as a \u201cbudget for savers\u201d and declared that \u201cBritain has for decades borrowed too much and saved too little,\u201d the most powerful fiscal measures he announced were designed to reduce savings, mainly by encouraging retired people to dip into their pension funds to finance consumption.As a result, the budget forecasts, which Mr. Osborne did not mention, predicted that Britain\u2019s savings rate would fall from 7.2 percent in 2012 to 3.3 percent by 2018. Does this duplicity matter? Whatever one may think about Mr. Osborne\u2019s moral principles, his policies are likely to strengthen the British economy.This is most obviously true for Keynesian cyclical reasons. What Keynes showed theoretically in the 1930s has been demonstrated in practice all over the world since 2008: The only way for a country\u2019s economy to clamber out of a deep recession is for either the government or the private sector to save less and borrow more.If the government is unable to increase its borrowing or unwilling to do that for political reasons, then the private sector must reduce savings or increase debt.The approach has been described as Keynesian Thatcherism by some enlightened conservative politicians, such as Sweden\u2019s finance minister, Anders Borg, and Mr. Osborne has secretly become a zealous convert. Last year, he delivered the additional borrowing, and now he is offering retirees tax incentives to run down their savings.With this Keynesian Thatcherism combined with a commitment from the central bank to hold interest rates near zero until after the election and a highly efficient system of adjustable-rate mortgages that provide borrowers with the full benefit of near-zero rates, it is hardly surprising that Britain is now enjoying the strongest economic growth among the Group of 7 industrialized countries and will probably continue to do so at least until the election in May next year.But what about the long-term consequences? Conventional wisdom says that borrowing binges and property booms always end in tears, especially in Britain. And this one could be even worse than usual because the so-called economic rebalancing that was expected and desired in Britain after the 2008 crisis \u2014 away from overdependence on finance, entertainment and other frothy service industries and toward solidly productive manufacturing and export activities \u2014 has failed to happen.In fact, Britain now has the biggest trade deficit, relative to gross domestic product, among the major advanced economies, as well as the largest government deficit. To pile new consumer borrowing on top of a mountain of government debt is widely considered irresponsible, which was one reason for Mr. Osborne to cover up his conversion to Keynesian Thatcherism last year.But there are several reasons conventional wisdom is probably wrong about the dangers of Britain\u2019s returning to its old bad habits.First, it is far from clear that Britain\u2019s economic structure is really unhealthy. Although Britain has done worse since the 2007-8 crisis than any G-7 economy apart from Italy, at least in terms of G.D.P. growth, the main reason for this poor performance might not have been structural overdependence on services and finance.Straightforward economic modeling suggests that a more likely explanation was the government\u2019s overzealous effort to reduce budget deficits quickly. Now that the worst of this fiscal retrenchment is over, finance, business services and creative industries are again driving strong growth in employment, incomes and G.D.P. That is exactly what happened before the crisis. Looking back over the whole of the past two decades, Britain has enjoyed by far the strongest growth in the G-7, even after the weakness since 2008. G.D.P. per capita grew 52 percent from 1991 to 2013, compared with 43 percent in the United States (the next strongest G-7 economy) and 27 percent in Germany. This suggests that Britain\u2019s specialization in finance and business services has probably been a benefit, not a handicap, in the long term.Second, a restructuring of the economy in favor of manufacturing and exports may be impossible because of the logic of global free trade and the European single market, which encourage countries to specialize in sectors where they enjoy comparative advantage. Britain\u2019s advantage in finance and creative industries is as obvious as Germany\u2019s is in cars and machine tools.Finally, the economic rebalancing that Britain really needs is not between sectors but between regions. The economy\u2019s main structural problem is not overdependence on finance but over-heating in London, combined with underdevelopment in the north of the country. Strengthening manufacturing might marginally help to redress this imbalance, but Britain\u2019s biggest regional divergences are not in industrial structure. They are in consumer purchasing power. In this respect, Mr. Osborne\u2019s housing subsidies will be especially helpful to the poorer regions. In London, where the average house price is about \u00a3350,000, the government\u2019s support for mortgages where 95 percent of the purchase price is borrowed is having limited impact because middle-income families cannot qualify for mortgages anywhere near that sum. But in poorer regions, the average house price is only \u00a3150,000, and Mr. Osborne\u2019s program is transforming affordability. A family with two earners, each on the national average of about \u00a325,000, can easily qualify for a mortgage of \u00a3150,000, but they have little chance of saving the 20 percent deposit normally required. For such families, Mr. Osborne\u2019s 95 percent mortgages are a godsend. And Mr. Osborne is probably right to calculate that such voters will show their gratitude in 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Currency of China Continues to Decline", "Date": "2014-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The value of China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, continued to slide against the United States dollar on Friday, rattling investors by falling to its lowest level in nearly a year before closing higher.The weakness in the renminbi, which has been dropping steadily in 2014, reverses a trend of gradual incremental appreciation against the dollar and other major currencies during the last eight years.Analysts say China\u2019s central bank is intervening heavily in the currency markets, intentionally engineering a slide in the value of the Chinese currency to punish speculators and prevent huge capital flows, or so-called hot money, from entering the country. The huge inflows of capital are showing up in China\u2019s economic figures, with some analysts estimating hot money inflows last year at $150 billion. The authorities worry that the large inflows could generate inflationary pressure and complicate the central government\u2019s effort to revamp China\u2019s economy, improve the banking system and eventually free up interest rates. The move comes just before the start of high-level government planning meetings, which could prompt further economic reforms. Some analysts say they think the government could soon move to widen the renminbi\u2019s daily trading band, increasing the amount by which the currency\u2019s value can fluctuate in either direction. The idea would be to make the currency more flexible, allowing for greater use in global commerce and trade. To some, the recent volatility is the government\u2019s way of showing that the value can go down as well as up. Lawmakers in the United States, for one, want China to loosen its hold on the currency, long a source of tension. The latest drop in the renminbi caps off a volatile period for the currency. Since the beginning of January, it has lost around 1.5 percent of its value against the dollar. On Friday, the renminbi lost 0.3 percent of its value, hitting 6.145 to the dollar; the intraday drop of almost 1 percent was the biggest in years.The sudden drop has surprised investors, who have become accustomed to a slow and steady rise in the currency. Last year, the renminbi was one of the world\u2019s strongest-performing currencies, rising 3 percent against the dollar.The recent currency weakness has weighed on the markets, which have been rattled lately by a slowdown in the vast real estate market and other economic concerns. This week, the CSI 300 index of big companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets dropped more than 3.5 percent. While the Chinese authorities maintain tight control over the flow of money into the country, global investors have found ways to funnel hot money into China, often through trade financing deals. Speculators do so hoping to capitalize on something not so easy to find outside China: an economy wedded to fast growth, high interest rates and a steadily appreciating currency.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to completely stop\u201d hot money from flowing into China, Wang Tao, the chief China economist at UBS, said. \u201cOffshore, the interest rates are low; Chinese interest rates are really high. And if the exchange rate is appreciating, investors view it as a win-win.\u201d By weakening the value of the renminbi, the authorities here apparently hope to make it harder for speculators to engage in a one-way bet on a rising renminbi, in what is essentially an arbitrage game between interest rates in the advanced economies outside and higher rates in the more tightly controlled Chinese system. For speculators, currency appreciation is seen as an added benefit.But low interest rates in the United States and Europe mean there are few places to invest. At the same time, Chinese companies are desperate for cash because of rising interest rates at home and tighter bank liquidity. Analysts say the government wants speculators to know that making such a bet on appreciation could backfire, if appreciation slows or even reverses course, and that is why the last few days have been so volatile.In a statement this week, China\u2019s State Administration of Foreign Exchange, a division under the central bank, suggested the market volatility had been normal. \u201cThe recent movement of the renminbi exchange rate is the result of market players adjusting their near-term renminbi trading strategies,\u201d it said. \u201cThe degree of exchange rate volatility is normal by the standards of developed and emerging markets. There is no need to overinterpret it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the drop of the renminbi against the dollar on Friday. It was a drop of 0.3 percent, or 6.145 to the dollar, not \u201cnearly 1 percent,\u201d or 6.18 to the dollar. (An earlier version of the headline repeated the error.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Democrats Can Compete for the White Working Class", "Date": "2014-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBetween 2008 and 2012, President Obama\u2019s already weak support among these voters dropped from 40 percent to just 36 percent.Looked at from a different perspective, though, Democratic prospects do not seem so gloomy. There was a wide disparity in Obama\u2019s performance among white working-class voters in different sections of the country: awful in the South and significantly better in much of the rest of the country. This suggests that a targeted regional strategy could strengthen the Democratic Party\u2019s chances with what was once its core constituency.Before we get into regional subtleties, let\u2019s examine the question from the national vantage point.Democracy Corps found that less well-educated whites agree, by a huge 46.2 percentage point margin, with the statement \u201cWhen something is run by the government, it is usually inefficient and wasteful.\u201d This is 11.6 points more than all voters.Similarly, the general public agrees that \u201cIt is the responsibility of the government to take care of people who can\u2019t take care of themselves\u201d by a 19.5 percentage point margin, while whites who did not go to college agree by half that.Asked to choose between two statements \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m more concerned we will go too far in cutting spending and will cut off programs that middle- and working-class people rely on\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m more concerned we won\u2019t go far enough in cutting spending and our deficits will continue to grow\u201d \u2014 all voters came down firmly on the side of worrying about cutting too much, 58-42. The white, noncollege voter was evenly split.According to Democracy Corps, working-class whites fall on the more conservative side of the spectrum on a broad range of issues, including military spending, gay rights, immigration, public works spending and the potential expansion of pre-K classes.There are a few \u2014 but very few \u2014 issues on which the white working class is more liberal than the general public, all of which capture the group\u2019s bread-and-butter concerns: expansion of family, maternity and sick leave; a belief that \u201cWall Street hurts the American economy more than it helps\u201d; and support for the protection of Medicare benefits.Let me stress here that the Democracy Corps findings are from national surveys.The key finding in the P.R.R.I. study is that working-class whites in the South are \u2013 no surprise \u2014 far more conservative than their counterparts in the rest of the country. Lumping all of these voters together exaggerates this constituency\u2019s overall rightward tilt.The regional differences are striking in the cases of both partisan voting patterns and how voters feel about particular issues.The pre-election P.R.R.I. study found that white working-class voters in the South backed Romney over Obama 62-22, compared to a 46-41 Romney advantage in the West, a 42-38 edge in the Northeast and an Obama lead of 44-36 in the Midwest.Similarly, while working-class whites in the South opposed same-sex marriage by 61-32 in the P.R.R.I. survey, in the Northeast they favored it 57-37; in the West they were split 47-45; and in the Midwest they were modestly opposed, 44-49. In the case of abortion, majorities of non-college whites outside of the South believe the practice should be legal, while those in the South were opposed 54-42.The P.R.R.I. study did point to one Democratic stumbling block: affirmative action and \u201creverse discrimination.\u201dThree out of five working-class whites believe \u201cthat discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities.\u201d This view is strongest in the South, at 69 percent, but it is the majority conviction of working-class whites in all regions of the country, where it is never lower than 55 percent.In another key measure of white working-class racial resentment, the P.R.R.I. survey found that by a margin of three percentage points, the white working class agreed \u201cthat the government has paid too much attention to the problems of minorities.\u201d White noncollege voters were split down the middle on this issue in the Northeast and Midwest. In the South, 58 percent agreed.Stan Greenberg, the Democratic pollster, conducted focus groups in 1985 in the white working-class suburbs of Detroit and found that \u201cthese white Democratic defectors express a profound distaste for blacks, a sentiment that pervades almost everything they think about government and politics.\u201dThe perception of reverse discrimination was an even more acute source of anger: \u201cThe special status of blacks is perceived by almost all these individuals as a serious obstacle to their personal advancement. Indeed, discrimination against whites has become a well-assimilated and ready explanation for their status, vulnerability and failures.\u201dA separate study that year, financed by the Democratic National Committee, found that white working-class voters were convinced that \u201cthe Democratic Party has not stood with them as they moved from the working to the middle class. They have a whole set of middle-class economic problems today, and their party is not helping them. Instead, it is helping the blacks, Hispanics and the poor. They feel betrayed.\u201dOhio provides a valuable test case for the viability of Democratic Party efforts to make gains among white noncollege voters in the North.For decades, the cultural conflicts that emerged from the 1960s gave the Republican Party highly effective wedge issues to build support among white working-class Americans.The declining commitment of white noncollege voters outside the South to conservative values has been masked, politically and culturally, by the continued ferocity of sociocultural and racial conservatism among working class whites in the South. But insofar as the second demographic transition is taking hold among these voters in the North, the Midwest and the West, Democratic prospects may well be better than national polling data suggests.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Governor Wants to Keep Tax Increase, Setting Terms for Re-Election in Illinois", "Date": "2014-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySPRINGFIELD, Ill. \u2014 Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois on Wednesday announced his plan to make permanent an unpopular temporary tax increase, stoking a debate that is becoming central to his bid for re-election. \u201cThe truth is, those that are telling you Illinois can tax less and spend less and still expect to fund education are simply not telling you the truth,\u201d Mr. Quinn said, proposing a five-year financial plan in his budget message to the legislature. In a state with an estimated $5.4 billion backlog of unpaid bills, his election-year budget, which favored revenue to spending cuts, is perhaps the clearest sign yet of the mounting tension between political and fiscal challenges that lay ahead for Mr. Quinn, a Democrat who is seen by Republicans as one of the most vulnerable governors in the nation. Mr. Quinn, no stranger to populist messages, has grappled with low approval rates amid a struggle to deal with Illinois\u2019s deep financial problems, including a series of credit downgrades and a pension system that was considered one of the most underfunded in the country.In November, he will face Bruce Rauner, a multimillionaire businessman, who won the Republican nomination last week after pouring $6 million of his own money into the primary. Mr. Rauner, in his first run for political office, has emphasized the need for spending cuts and lower taxes. \u201cIt\u2019s now or never to save Illinois,\u201d he said in a statement, criticizing the governor for extending the tax rate. \u201cWe can balance the budget without more tax increases, if we create a growth economy, and restructure and reform our broken government.\u201dIllinois lawmakers raised the income tax rate by 67 percent in 2011 as a temporary way to pay the bills. That increase was scheduled to be rolled back, in part, in 2015. Democrats have warned that the state would face an estimated $3 billion budget hole without that extra revenue, forcing painful cuts. Republicans have accused the governor and his party of exaggerating the sacrifice that schools and public services would endure if legislators let the tax rate expire. \u201cDemocrats that run this building do not tell the truth about taxes and spending,\u201d said Representative Jim Durkin, the Republican leader of the Illinois House.The legislature here in President Obama\u2019s home state is expected to remain in the hands of Democrats after the election, though it is still unclear how palatable lawmakers will find passing a tax bill before November. On Wednesday, Mr. Quinn said Illinois was on better financial footing than when he took office in 2009, in part because of spending cuts he had made. Cushioning the income tax blow, he also proposed annual $500 property tax refunds, more funding for education and doubling the tax credit for low-income workers. Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a government watchdog group, said the state had been \u201clurching from one crisis to the next\u201d for too long, and he expressed initial concern with Mr. Quinn\u2019s heavy focus on taxes to fix the problem. \u201cThere\u2019s very little room for the state to absorb another downgrade,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stop shocking the system, and we have to stop sending a signal that we don\u2019t know what to do next.\u201d Others said the state\u2019s finances left Mr. Quinn with few political choices that the public would find easy to swallow, especially after he upset unions last year by pushing through an overhaul of the state\u2019s pension system. \u201cThe alternative is for him to cut a whole lot of programs that are key to Democrats,\u201d said David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University.A February poll by the institute found that 60 percent of Illinois voters opposed making the 2011 income tax increase permanent. Most maintained that position even after they were told that letting it expire would increase the state deficit. And yet, majorities of respondents also disliked the idea of slashing spending on a number of major governmental programs and services. The statewide telephone poll of 1,001 registered voters had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.\u201cIt\u2019s just an impossible political situation for someone to be in,\u201d said Mr. Yepsen, later adding: \u201cBut he\u2019s taken a side. He\u2019s taken a stand.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sri Lanka, Admired From Above", "Date": "2014-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 Jeff Powell, decked out in shorts and open-toe sandals, doesn\u2019t want anything to do with the big airlines. The 34-year-old Canadian says he is more than happy flying for Cinnamon Air, Sri Lanka\u2019s only scheduled seaplane service.Mr. Powell, who was a pilot in the Maldives last year when he was hired by the four-plane Sri Lankan start-up, says that the 440-kilometer, or 275-mile, long island off India\u2019s southern coast is the perfect spot for the kind of short flights that seaplanes can provide.\u201cThis is the fun part. Nobody does this anymore,\u201d Mr. Powell said before asking one of the central questions of the seaplane experience: \u201cDo you want to go inland \u2014 over the mountains \u2014 at about 5,000 feet, or follow the coast at 500?\u201dFive hundred feet it was, and the small Cessna 208 Caravan taxied along the runway at Bandaranaike International Airport near Colombo, dwarfed by the Emirates A330-200 in the slot ahead.In 2013, almost four years after the end of that war, 1.27 million foreign tourists visited the country, the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority has said. Indian travelers, who numbered 209,000, represented the largest group last year, but there are also increasing numbers of West Europeans and Chinese.Once foreign visitors have arrived in the country, getting around is far from easy.The island of 21.7 million residents has a few expressways, mostly financed by Chinese state-owned banks in exchange for infrastructure and resource extraction deals. But for the most part travel involves one-lane roads, often in poor repair and sometimes downright dangerous.That is where Cinnamon Air and a few other fixed-wing, helicopter and seaplane operators come in. Cinnamon, which began flying last May and describes itself as an air taxi service, offers service from Colombo to the colonial city of Kandy; the temperate hill station of Nuwara Eliya; the beach towns of the south; and a battle-scarred Jaffna, in the north.\u201cDemand is strong,\u201d said Ieshan Munaweera of Millennium Airlines, a charter service based in Colombo that operates helicopters, planes and seaplanes. \u201cWe have a number of new entries into the market and everybody thinks there\u2019s enough pie to go around.\u201dHowever, he added: \u201cThis isn\u2019t the Maldives where you need seaplanes scheduled all day to ferry people to the villas. Remember that air travel is still a luxury here.\u201dBack on the runway, the 38-foot turboprop took just a few seconds to get airborne, rising quickly over Colombo\u2019s low skyline, dotted with cranes.On board, there is no partition between the pilot and the plush passenger cabin, whose eight seats are covered in beige leather and maple-walnut trim. Part of the entertainment comes from watching how the plane is flown, and seeing the pilot use pedals to change the flaps or check the dial that indicates the plane\u2019s pitch.A few miles out, over the Laccadive Sea, the plane hovered over fishing boats and outrigger canoes. Mr. Powell pointed out the half-submerged wreck of the Thermopylae Sierra, a Cypriot-owned vessel that sank in 2012 off Mount Lavinia, a beach town with villas owned by wealthy expatriates.Flying for a while at 1,500 feet, the melon slice beaches, lagoons, verdant jungle and bright yellow Buddhist stupas come into broad focus. There are the modernist pool-studded homes of the country\u2019s glitterati, and centuries-old Catholic churches in faded blue and pink.Then the captain turned and winked before pushing the plane down to what felt like a few hundred feet, skipping over the ranks of surfers that waved from the breaks below.Galle\u2019s narrow cobblestone streets, bell towers and ocher-washed buildings are home to chic shops, cafes and upscale hotels like Tamarind Hill, a 250-year-old former trade and signal house a few miles east of the fort that has been converted into a 12-room boutique hotel. The building\u2019s long terraces and roofs make it easy for monkeys to feast from the mango and banana trees.At cocktail hour in the bar, visitors like Richard Dobbs, 54, from Britain, can be found enjoying gin martinis or a mix of aged coconut arrack, a local alcohol, with pineapple and lime.\u201cThis is like Thailand in the \u201970s,\u201d Mr. Dobbs said. \u201cLots of friendly locals, who are open and welcoming. God knows how long it will last, but it\u2019s worth seeing while it does.\u201dBack on board the Cessna, Mr. Powell made for Koggala Lake, an air force base southeast of Galle where Allied forces flew seaplane sorties during World War II. The plane floated over mangrove islets, coconut farms and golden rice paddies gone to seed. The pilot then pushed the nose down hard, leveling it off before the pontoons skidded over the water\u2019s surface.Mr. Powell, who has flown amphibious aircraft for about nine years, says that seaplanes are among the most romantic ways to fly, but that they do have limitations.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful here on amazing days like this, but during monsoons it can be a nightmare,\u201d he said, noting that landing at the inland city of Kandy can be particularly difficult at that time of year. \u201cYou have 3,800 feet of water to land and take off on \u2014 trees on one side, a dam on the other, and who knows what\u2019s in the water. It takes a certain feel to fly this way.\u201dEven though the island\u2019s northern and eastern coasts were once hubs for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, these areas are now drawing a great deal of attention from hotel developers. Even the country\u2019s military, which has played an active role in trying to jump-start the economies of the former war-torn regions, is opening businesses like resorts and travel agencies.Local residents still quietly complain about harassment in what remains a heavily militarized zone, and several psychological trauma centers line the streets, even as farmers and schoolchildren along these same routes can be seen waving to foreign tourists.\u201cPeople were traumatized so it\u2019s going to take time,\u201d said Trevor Burton, chief executive of Anilana Hotels & Properties, which is building luxury hotels in the area. \u201cThis place was a war zone a few years ago.\u201dThe executive, who is from the English county of Derbyshire, said his company was bullish about the east coast, noting that Passikudah Beach was renowned in the \u201970s but that the seven-hour drive from Colombo is \u201cbrutal.\u201d Taking a helicopter service is better, he said. \u201cNowhere has wildlife like Sri Lanka,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can see herds of wild elephants sometimes on the way over.\u201dIF YOU GOAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Connecticut Governor Signs Wage Bill", "Date": "2014-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust weeks after an appearance in which he, President Obama and three other governors promoted a minimum wage of at least $10, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy returned to the Cafe Beauregard in New Britain, Conn., and signed a bill that will raise the state\u2019s to $10.10 starting in 2017.Though other states are also looking at lifting their minimum wages and Mr. Obama is urging Congress to increase the federal minimum wage to $10 or more an hour, Connecticut\u2019s future rate would be the highest of all state rates that are now on the books. \u201cThis legislation is about making sure that people working full time and supporting families aren\u2019t living in poverty,\u201d Mr. Malloy said. \u201cThe extra money that these folks earn will be put back into our economy and help our communities.\u201dTwenty-one states and the District of Columbia currently set rates that are higher than the $7.25 imposed by federal law, with Washington State topping the list at $9.32, Oregon second at $9.10, Vermont third at $8.73 and Connecticut fourth at $8.70.Connecticut\u2019s bill also added 15 cents an hour to next year\u2019s rate, so that workers can count on $9.15 an hour as of Jan. 1, 2015, and it awarded workers another raise the following year to $9.60. State officials estimate that 70,000 to 90,000 people there now earn the minimum wage.Republicans cautioned that the bill will make Connecticut, a state that also has some of the most expensive energy costs in the nation, even less appealing to business than it already is. They expressed fear that companies would simply pare their head count at a time when Connecticut\u2019s unemployment rate is already higher than average: 7.2 percent in January, versus a national rate of 6.6 percent. L. Scott Frantz, a Greenwich businessman whose firm owns an interest in Chop\u2019t and who is also a state senator, said the state should not be seeking bragging rights when it comes to higher wages. \u201cIt\u2019s like so many of the other anti-business characteristics of the state,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe should not be touting that we have a high cost of energy and that we\u2019re number one or two in terms of our gasoline tax.\u201d A higher minimum wage, he argued, \u201cputs a damper on job growth, and I always thought it was better to have a job paying nine dollars and 15 cents an hour than no job.\u201dNonetheless, with an election year ahead, the governor did not seem eager to risk losing the distinction of being the first state to heed the president\u2019s call, and signed the bill within a day of receiving it from the Democrat-controlled Legislature.Though public opinion polls tend to show that a majority of Americans favor a higher minimum wage, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the effect on employment from a national increase to $10.10 would be anywhere from a \u201cvery slight reduction\u201d to as many as one million lost jobs.Debate was spirited in Hartford, too, even if the tallies hewed closely to party lines. In the end, the bill passed, 21-14, in the Senate and, 87-54, in the House.Taking note, the White House issued a statement from Mr. Obama on Thursday congratulating the state for setting an example and expressing hope that \u201cCongress, governors, state legislators and business leaders across our country will follow Connecticut\u2019s lead to help ensure that no American who works full time has to raise a family in poverty.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Airways Parent Returns to Profitability", "Date": "2014-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 International Airlines Group, the parent company of British Airways, said Friday that it swung to a net profit last year, reaping the gains of deep cost-cutting and heavy job reductions at its money-losing Spanish unit, Iberia.The gains come as International Airlines, a holding company formed in 2011 from the merger of British Airways and Iberia, is seeking to leverage British Airways\u2019 dominant position in the London-area Heathrow Airport \u2014 Europe\u2019s largest by number of passengers \u2014 and the strength of its trans-Atlantic operations to help finance a long-awaited revival at Iberia.With Iberia now edging closer toward profitability, those efforts may soon include investments in more fuel-efficient wide-body jets to ply promising new routes from its Madrid hub to Latin American and Africa, as well as upgrades to its onboard service.\u201cNow they have the ability to put some of their resources into Iberia in order to grow,\u201d said John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting in London.International Airlines, which is based in London, reported net profit from continuing operations of 151 million euros, or $207 million, on revenue of \u20ac18.7 billion. The result compared with a loss of \u20ac658 million in 2012.Iberia has racked up a total of \u20ac1 billion in losses since 2008, struggling in the face of Spain\u2019s deep economic contraction and high unemployment triggered by Europe\u2019s recent sovereign debt crisis.Intense competition for tourist travelers from low-cost carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet, on European routes, as well as from high-speed rail in the Spanish market, prompted an aggressive cost-cutting campaign last year that triggered extensive protests by Iberia staff.In the end, labor unions agreed last year to a management plan that cut Iberia\u2019s work force by 3,100 people and reduced salaries by 11 to 18 percent. This month, Iberia\u2019s pilots and cabin crew accepted additional measures that will increase their working hours and link their compensation to the airline\u2019s profitability.Speaking in a conference call with analysts, Willie Walsh, the chief executive of International Airlines, emphasized that while there was \u201cstill a lot of work to do\u201d to restore Iberia to profitability, he was confident that the worst of the airline\u2019s troubles were behind it.\u201cWhen I look at where we are today compared with 24 months ago, the landscape has totally changed,\u201d he said, citing the gradual stabilizing of the Spanish economy as well as Iberia\u2019s improving competitiveness both domestically and internationally.Iberia\u2019s operating loss narrowed significantly last year, to \u20ac166 million from \u20ac351 million in 2012, as its employee costs were cut by more than 14 percent and its fleet was reduced by 23 aircraft. The group\u2019s Spanish operations were bolstered significantly by the acquisition in April of Vueling, a low-cost carrier based near Barcelona. The company said Vueling\u2019s operating profit increased to \u20ac137 million from \u20ac101 million in 2012, on revenue of \u20ac1.1 billion.Analysts said they were encouraged that after months of acrimony, relations with Iberia\u2019s unions appeared to have entered a more constructive phase that should restore the airline to profitability within the coming years.\u201cI think the realization has sunk in that this is a new era,\u201d said Daniel Solon, an independent airline consultant in Barcelona, noting the extensive downsizing that had taken place at European rivals like Lufthansa of Germany and Air France-KLM over the past two years. \u201cThere is a recognition that there has been a long-term tectonic shift, not just within the industry, but in the overall economics of Europe and its competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the world.\u201dMeanwhile, steadily increasing traffic on its flights out of London\u2019s Heathrow Airport more than doubled profit at British Airways, to 651 million pounds, or $1.09 billion, from \u00a3274 million in 2012.British Airways has been steadily adding capacity on its network through the introduction to its fleet of several Airbus A380 superjumbo jets as well as Boeing\u2019s new 787 Dreamliner. It also added dozens of new takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow last year, the result of the acquisition of the unprofitable regional carrier British Midland International from Lufthansa in 2012.Late last year, International Airlines raised its target for 2015 operating profit by 12.5 percent, to \u20ac1.8 billion, citing expectations of cost savings from the integration of Vueling with Iberia, as well as improved margins at British Airways. Mr. Walsh reaffirmed that goal Friday, citing expectations of steady revenue growth this year as well as continued progress toward reducing operating costs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Cuban Evolution", "Date": "2014-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDispatch13 PhotosHAVANA \u2014 MAYBE it was the Robin Thicke music video playing on a half-dozen flat-screen TVs, or the black-and-white image of the Brooklyn Bridge splashed above the V.I.P. area, or perhaps it was just the nightclub\u2019s name: Sangri-LA. All I knew, as I sipped my $4 rum, was that this was not the Cuba of Fidel Castro\u2019s 1959 revolution.Nor was it the Cuba I first visited in the late 1990s with my wife, who is Cuban-American. That was a nation of grinding scarcity; nearly everyone we met asked us for something they needed \u2014 soap, pens, money, even the sneakers on our feet.This Cuba, which I encountered on a recent weeklong visit, felt like a country struggling with its wants and jumpy in its eagerness to catch up with the world \u2014 as epitomized by this small but flashy nightclub, privately run, in the basement of a mansion in the capital\u2019s leafy neighborhood of Miramar.Sangri-LA was in some ways a step back to an even more distant time; the bartender confirmed it had been a club in the \u201850s, too. But it also looked like a strange step forward into Cuba\u2019s more unequal future. The stratification that emerged after the Soviet collapse, when Cubans with tourism jobs or relatives abroad surpassed their peers, seemed to be accelerating, and while the inequality was nowhere near what could be found in pre-Castro Cuba or the United States, I wondered what Cubans thought of the new have/have-not dynamic rising through the cracks of Communism.Sangri-LA was no greenhouse of introspection. When I asked a guy beside me \u2014 a young Cuban in a Polo shirt and hipster \u201880s sunglasses \u2014 for his take on Cuba\u2019s changes, he leaned in close to be heard over the music and said, \u201cI\u2019m not saying a word.\u201dSo I went elsewhere, into many of Havana\u2019s neighborhoods, looking for discussion \u2014 and indicators. Every country has them, the little details that hint at a culture\u2019s priorities and direction, but in secretive Cuba, \u201cthe land of topsy-turvy,\u201d as one American historian called it back in 1910, little things like a phrase or a fad often carry special weight.Cuba\u2019s love affair with American gangster movies in the 1930s presaged the \u201cpistolero\u201d violence that became synonymous with Havana in the 1950s. After the triumph of Fidel Castro and his bearded guerrillas, green fatigues became cool, just as the arrival of Russian support in the \u201860s led to Russian status symbols \u2014 especially dark blue Lada sedans with big antennas on the back. \u201cThat was the car of government,\u201d said Mario Coyula, Havana\u2019s pre-eminent urban historian. \u201cIt was a sign of power.\u201dThese days, with Fidel Castro on the sidelines as Ra\u00fal Castro gradually tries to modernize the economy with a dash of private enterprise, the tide of taste has turned. All across Havana, government symbols are out. New desires are rushing in.Central HavanaThe teenagers on Rollerblades racing down Paseo del Prado, the wide boulevard that divides touristy Old Havana from Central Havana, the city\u2019s urban core, paid no attention to the pasty foreigners walking by. The scene suggested two things. One, the lag time between global and Cuban trends is shrinking: While it took more than a decade for the tight Lycra craze to reach Cuba \u2014 with crazy abandon \u2014 it seemed to take half that time for in-line skating to go from out of style in Miami to in style here.Two, hustling seems to be in decline. A decade or so ago, I couldn\u2019t have walked more than a few feet without being accosted by young men trying to sell me cigars, a prostitute or a meal at a private restaurant. The jineteros (or jockeys), as the hustlers were called, always struck me as a byproduct of economic desperation and the relative newness of tourism. Most tourists back then were first-timers. And many hustlers were proto-capitalists who had taught themselves English, German or Italian just to earn a few dollars in tips.But now, except for a lazy solicitation or two, no one seemed to bother. The energy of the young was focused elsewhere. Maybe the police had really cracked down, always a possibility in Cuba, but other factors seemed to be in play. On the Malec\u00f3n, Havana\u2019s seaside esplanade, cellphones had suddenly become common and magnetic.Ra\u00fal Castro granted ordinary Cubans the right to have them in 2008, and use has exploded. Sort of. When I ran across Jenifer Garc\u00eda, 15, and \u00c1ngel Luis, 21, lying on the sea wall, they were using a cellphone for music. Mr. Luis said he had paid $80 for the old BlackBerry Torch with a cracked screen, carried into Cuba by a friend who visited New York. He mostly uses it to listen to Marc Anthony; Ms. Garc\u00eda said she was partial to Pink Floyd.Farther down the Malec\u00f3n, Jos\u00e9 Rivera, 29, and Pedro Fr\u00f3meta, 24, were using an iPhone 3S (cost: $120), to take selfies. \u201cBefore, we were in this technological bubble,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. \u201cBut it\u2019s getting better.\u201dIndeed, the easing of travel laws by both Cuba and the United States in recent years has created a heartier commercial exchange and a new relationship to technology.While Americans fret about the isolation our screens encourage, Cuban families (those who can afford Internet fees of $4.50 an hour) often gather around a single laptop at a hotel. DVDs and television programming from Miami \u2014 news and entertainment, on thumb drives \u2014 have become part of many families\u2019 weekly routine.But not everyone is connected. I didn\u2019t see many cellphones in the poorer sections of Central Havana. What I did see were men pulling majestic colonial wooden doors out of an old building, and putting them on the back of a truck. They were hauling off the neighborhood\u2019s last markers of past beauty and grace for a new restaurant in another area.VedadoA short drive west in the nicer residential neighborhood of Vedado, at the corner of a park named after John Lennon, lies one of Havana\u2019s most distinctive old homes. Reddish and run-down on the outside, with a glass cupola that looks like a rocks glass turned upside down, it used to be owned by a wealthy family with eccentric taste.Now 14 families live there, about 50 people crammed together in what amounts to a tenement. Two doors down, behind a high black fence, is a high-ceilinged, expansive colonial home with chandeliers inside, and outside a kiss of fresh yellow paint. The owners, who inherited the property, said they rented out its rooms to tourists.Welcome to Cuba\u2019s widening real estate divide.I asked Aida Pupo, 45, squeezed into a back corner of the reddish mansion, if her neighbors\u2019 wealth bothered her. She said she lived with three generations of her family. The ceiling of her kitchen forced anyone over 6 feet tall to duck. But she didn\u2019t care.\u201cThere are people with a lot, and there are people with nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a sign of the times.\u201dShe doubted that the wealth divide would ever get as bad as it was before the revolution because the government would not allow it. \u201cThey\u2019re giving loans now for home improvement,\u201d she said. \u201cI would love to make the facade of this building beautiful again.\u201dA little frustrated but mostly acquiescent, Ms. Pupo belongs to what the journalist Marc Frank describes as Cuba\u2019s \u201cgrey zone.\u201d In his new book, \u201cCuban Revelations: Behind the Scenes in Havana,\u201d he argues that these are the Cubans whom Ra\u00fal Castro has sought to win over with his efforts to modernize the economy.There are no public opinion polls to test whether it\u2019s working. Members of the revolutionary elite (high-level government officials, artists who make money abroad) are clearly benefiting, with investments in restaurants and homes. The nouveaux riches (running successful small businesses) are also at least somewhat satisfied.It is more surprising to discover that even those near the bottom, like Ms. Pupo, seem to be focusing on the positives. Eyeing the success of others, many seem relieved to know it\u2019s possible. As one Cuba scholar told me, \u201cThey have aspirations they never used to have.\u201dThose a little closer to the top, though, don\u2019t like to talk about how they got there. Ms. Pupo\u2019s neighbor in the yellow house provided me with coffee but refused to be formally interviewed, or named. \u201cEs complicado,\u201d he said. (If there is a catchphrase in Havana these days, that would be it.)In another building up the block, a young activist who said he had been kept at home by the police at times to prevent him from organizing cultural events, said those with advantages were just trying to protect what they had. \u201cIt\u2019s a transition that we\u2019re in, but not to democracy,\u201d the activist said, noting that the government has become just slightly less restrictive. \u201cIt\u2019s a transition from totalitarianism to authoritarianism.\u201dThe indicator he longed to see: large music festivals separate from the state. \u201cYoung people want to know what\u2019s really happening in Cuba but they\u2019re not radicals,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just want a different strategy because, look, the strategy we\u2019ve had up until now hasn\u2019t worked.\u201dMiramarIn Miramar, the wealthyish seaside suburb where most foreign embassies can be found, I stopped at a used-car lot where the price list on a bulletin board might as well have been shooting nails at customers: A 2010 Volkswagen Passat for $67,500? A 2006 Toyota Corolla for $39,724.80?A new law allowing Cubans to buy cars from the government had gone into effect just a few weeks earlier. Cubans were thrilled when it was announced, only to be crestfallen when they saw the cost. The government said the cars were heavily taxed to redistribute money from the rich. Many Cubans, though, saw it as an insult, or a scheme. \u201cIt\u2019s a trap,\u201d one taxi driver said. \u201cIf you buy a car, the next day the police show up and ask where you got the money.\u201dThose Cubans working for reform from within insist that government officials are still learning how to be responsive to the public instead of just the party. But Cuba\u2019s response to inequality is disjointed partly because the country is struggling with what kind of equality it really wants.\u201cIn the United States, we talk about equality of opportunity,\u201d said Richard Feinberg, an international affairs professor at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cThe equality of opportunity is actually expanding in Cuba today, but the Cubans, in the revolution, didn\u2019t talk about equality of opportunity. They talked about equality of outcomes, that people should more or less have the same incomes and living standards. That equality of outcomes is being eroded.\u201dAnd therein lies the challenge: are those young people with Rollerblades and cellphones, or those with new cars, a sign of the equality Cuba wants, or not?The island\u2019s leaders have not provided much clarity. No one seems to know how much money is too much to have, or even how to talk about it. Many older Cubans seem dismayed. A well-known 90-year-old artist in Miramar (who asked that I not use her name) told me her entire block had changed in the past year or two. One neighbor\u2019s house was empty because the family had moved abroad. Another was being renovated, while across the street new people were moving in. \u201cIt\u2019s all so\u201d \u2014 she crinkled her nose \u2014 \u201cunstable.\u201dHer attitude reminded me of a line from Graham Greene\u2019s 1958 novel \u201cOur Man in Havana\u201d: \u201cIt is a great danger for everyone when what is shocking changes.\" That seemed to capture how many Cubans feel these days. It certainly helped explain why no one at Sangri-LA would talk to me.And yet Cuba is still Cuba. At Sangri-LA, along with the signs of rising demand for the shiny and new, there was as much shouting and hugging and gossiping as I had seen at countless state-owned venues, and in neighborhoods at every economic level.The partyers were not trying to replace the Cuba they knew with something else: The Brooklyn Bridge mural did not mean they wanted Havana to become New York, and the Christina Aguilera videos were just a distraction. It was only when the D.J. switched the music to modern salsa \u2014 after 1 a.m. \u2014 that everyone started dancing. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 of course to see Cuba only through song, but it was more than that. As Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, Cuba\u2019s most famous writer, once put it: \u201cI have two homelands: Cuba and the night. Or are the two one?\u201dAn earlier version of the slideshow that accompanies this article misidentified the building to which a statue of the writer Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed points in Havana. It is the United States Interests Section of the Swiss Embassy, which handles American diplomatic and consular services in Cuba, not the United States Embassy.

{"Headline": "Russia and the Group of 8", "Date": "2014-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialExpelling Russia from the Group of 8 \u2014 as demanded by hawks on the Hill and mooted in conflicting signals from Europe \u2014 is the wrong way to punish President Vladimir Putin for annexing Crimea from Ukraine. Certainly when the French foreign minister says Russia has been suspended from the G-8, and the German chancellor says it has not been, and the British prime minister says it should be if it takes further steps against Ukraine, they demonstrate the disunity and lack of coordination Mr. Putin hoped to see. But the question is whether expelling Mr. Putin from the G-8 at this stage is a productive way to either penalize Mr. Putin or change his conduct. The Group of 8 leading industrialized countries is not an institution and not even a bureaucracy. It is a forum for leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States to come together once a year to discuss matters of global importance. The G-8 may not be as relevant as it once was \u2014 the more inclusive G-20 may be the more important grouping \u2014 but within the eight, Mr. Putin comes face to face with the leaders of top democracies; expelled by them, he would retreat into his trademark claim that the West has always held Russia in disdain. Maintaining an engagement with the Soviet Union during the Cold War was the logic behind keeping Moscow in the United Nations Security Council and other international institutions. When Communist rule collapsed, including Russia in what was then the G-7 was seen as a way to foster Russia\u2019s turn to democracy and market economy. Certainly the leaders of the G-8, who are scheduled to meet without Russia next week, should consider how to make clear that they deem the manner of Russia\u2019s seizure of Crimea utterly unacceptable. Their response should, of course, include a firm decision not to attend the G-8 meeting in Sochi, Russia, that Mr. Putin is supposed to host in June as the holder of this year\u2019s rotating chairmanship of the group. Beyond that, the United States, its European and other allies must also continue searching for effective economic ways to punish Mr. Putin and his inner circle, and for ways to deter him from further aggression against Ukraine. These deliberations, as Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain has said, should include the possibility of expelling Russia from the G-8 altogether should it further violate Ukrainian sovereignty and thus close the door to any fruitful dialogue. But continuing to engage Russia in international forums must be regarded as the preferable route as long as it is possible. And, in any case, there is nothing to gain in the sort of partisan saber-rattling that the House majority leader, Representative Eric Cantor, indulged in, or in the confused signals from Europe. An international crisis is a time for America\u2019s leaders to come together, and not to try to score political points \u2014 and certainly not to descend into the sort of partisan squabbling in the House and Senate that has blocked a bill to provide loan guarantees to Ukraine. It is a time for the West to demonstrate common purpose and discipline. Let\u2019s hope that the G-8-minus-1 meeting scheduled for next week can do a better job of projecting a unified front against Mr. Putin\u2019s arrogance and contempt for international law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Try Wooing Ones Who Got Away: White Men", "Date": "2014-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROYAL OAK, Mich. \u2014 Frank Houston knows something about the longtime estrangement of white men from the Democratic Party. His family roots are in nearby Macomb County, the symbolic home of working-class Reagan Democrats who, distressed by economic and social tumult, decided a liberal Democratic Party had left them, not the other way around.Mr. Houston grew up in the 1980s liking Ronald Reagan but idolizing Alex P. Keaton, the fictional Republican teenage son of former hippies who, played by Michael J. Fox on the television series \u201cFamily Ties,\u201d comically captured the nation\u2019s conservative shift. But over time, Mr. Houston left the Republican Party because \u201cI started to realize that the party doesn\u2019t represent the people I grew up with.\u201dNow, as chairman of the Democratic Party in Oakland County, Michigan\u2019s second largest, Mr. Houston is finding out how difficult it can be to persuade other white men here to support Democrats, even among the 20 or so, mostly construction workers, who join him in a rotating poker game.Mr. Houston is part of an internal debate at all levels of his party over how hard it should work to win over white men, especially working-class men without college degrees, at a time when Democrats are gaining support from growing numbers of female and minority voters.It is a challenge that runs throughout the nation\u2019s industrial heartland, in farm states and across the South, after a half-century of economic, demographic and cultural shifts that have reshaped the electorate. Even in places like Michigan, where it has been decades since union membership lists readily predicted Democratic votes, many in the party pay so little attention to white working-class men that it suggests they have effectively given up on converting them.Not Mr. Houston. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole cadre of us \u2014 of young, white men political leaders in Oakland County \u2014 who are saying, \u2018We can\u2019t just write off 30-year-old to 40-year-old guys, let alone anyone who\u2019s older.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSo Mr. Houston and like-minded Democrats are working to deploy new, data-driven targeting tools to get the message to white men that the party is more in sync with them than they might think. \u201cWe can tell you to the number how many we need and where they live,\u201d said Matt Canter, the deputy executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.No Democratic presidential candidate has won a majority of white men since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama all prevailed with support of the so-called rising electorate of women, especially single women, and minorities. But fewer of those voters typically participate in midterm elections, making the votes of white men more potent and the struggle of Democrats for 2014 clear.\u201cRealistically, winning votes from working-class white men has just been a very tough political challenge for Democrats,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. With demographic trends favoring Democrats nationally and in many states, strategists say it makes sense to concentrate resources on mobilizing women, young people, Hispanics, blacks and other minority voters.White male voters have been crucial in some past midterms, most clearly in 1994, when they helped Republicans take control of the House for the first time in 40 years, and again in 2010.And this year, Democrats, hobbled by Mr. Obama\u2019s sagging popularity, are defending many red-state Senate seats, including some in places with few members of minorities, like West Virginia. A big reason for Democrats\u2019 emphasis on raising the minimum wage is the polling proof that the issue resonates with all groups, including white men. In Michigan, Mr. Houston is leading an effort to place a minimum-wage increase on the November ballot and said it \u201creally polls well with white men.\u201d\u201cI just think Democrats are having a hard time figuring out how to effectively pursue it,\u201d he added. What discourages Democrats is that men\u2019s attitudes shaped over generations \u2014 through debates over civil rights, anti-Communism, Vietnam, feminism, gun control and dislocations from lost manufacturing jobs and stagnant wages in a global economy \u2014 are not easily altered. \u201cDemocrats are for a bunch of freeloaders in this world as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d said Gari Day, 63, an Avis bus driver from suburban Detroit. \u201cRepublicans make you work for your money, and try to let you keep it.\u201dMichael Bunce, 48, buying parts at a Lowe\u2019s in Southfield, Mich., first ascribed his Republican bias to fiscal matters, but quickly turned to social issues like gay rights. \u201cI don\u2019t see why that\u2019s at the top of our priority list,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you say that out in the open, and people are all over your back.\u201dRepublicans say Democrats\u2019 appeals to women, minorities and gays have been counterproductive with white men. \u201cWhen you\u2019re spending 60 percent of your time talking about birth control and Obamacare, not a lot of men are paying attention to you,\u201d said Brad Dayspring, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.Among the Senate races where white men could be decisive are those in Georgia, where a Democrat, Michelle Nunn, is wooing them in hopes that many will favorably remember her father, Sam Nunn, a popular former senator, and in Arkansas, where Senator Mark Pryor, whose father, David Pryor, was also a longtime senator, is fighting to keep his job with frequent talk of his Christian faith.Senator Mark Warner of Virginia has stood out among Democrats for years with his efforts to court white working-class men, stumping rural areas and small towns in Senate and governor\u2019s races. Currently, he is favored to beat Ed Gillespie, the former Republican Party chairman.Generally, however, the Democrats\u2019 Senate majority is at risk, which helps explain why the party has not tried to revive gun-safety legislation proposed after the Newtown, Conn., school massacre. Few issues have hurt Democrats more among working-class white men over time.\u201cIt\u2019s a bad stigma: If you\u2019re a Democrat, you\u2019re against guns,\u201d said State Representative Scott Dianda, a Democrat in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. He is quick to say he is a hunter.Democrats\u2019 disadvantage in Michigan with white men was plain in a poll of likely voters last month by the nonpartisan EPIC-MRA. Representative Gary Peters, the Democratic candidate for Senate, trailed Terri Lynn Land, the Republican secretary of state, by three percentage points. But among white men, she led by 21 points.Mr. Peters, like Mr. Houston, is from populous Oakland County, but for six days recently, Mr. Peters traversed Michigan\u2019s northernmost reaches, prospecting in the subzero cold of the vast Upper Peninsula \u2014 home to 3 percent of the state\u2019s population \u2014 for votes among the mostly white residents, known as \u201cYoopers.\u201d He did what he could to get their attention. At one point, Mr. Peters spied some fathers with their sons atop a snow pile for WOLV-FM\u2019s \u201cYooper Luge.\u201d He got the broadcaster to introduce him, then borrowed a boy\u2019s plastic disc and skidded downhill.In another town, he stopped to see a single voter: a Republican small-business man.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India\u2019s Muslims Wary of Rising Political Star", "Date": "2014-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLUCKNOW, India \u2014 Salim Shah was cooking egg and chicken rolls on a dusty side street here when India\u2019s most controversial national politician flew to a nearby park in a red helicopter and addressed hundreds of thousands of screaming supporters.Mr. Shah said that he and his 12-year-old son, who sliced boiled eggs by Mr. Shah\u2019s side, were too busy to attend the rally. But when asked how he intended to vote in what many observers believe is the most consequential Indian election since 1977, Mr. Shah gave a brief shrug.Mr. Shah is a Muslim; the nearby candidate was Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist whose relationship with Muslims has been fraught; and India is a country long riven by religious divisions.\u201cI\u2019m inclined to support Mr. Modi,\u201d Mr. Shah said quietly. \u201cIt looks like he\u2019s going to win, and why waste your vote by voting for someone who is not going to win?\u201dMr. Shah\u2019s simple question could help determine whether India has a government divided among myriad regional power brokers or one dominated by Mr. Modi and his right-of-center Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P.Mr. Modi\u2019s trip to Lucknow on Sunday was the final major event of the pre-election season. India\u2019s Election Commission is expected to announce this week the date for national elections, which will be held in April and May.If Mr. Modi\u2019s party can win here in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state, he will be likely to have the mandate he needs to become prime minister and undertake the wrenching economic overhauls he has said India must undergo to return to the fast economic growth that at one point poised the country as a democratic rival to China. He has already visited the state eight times, and he installed his closest aide to oversee his operation here.There is an old political saying in India that the way to Delhi goes through Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh. From an American point of view, Uttar Pradesh has it all: the electoral heft of a California-Ohio-Michigan combination, the uncertainty of a Florida recount, the political tricks of a South Carolina primary and the stark community divisions of Mississippi.Disgust with the present government and disappointment with the Gandhi political dynasty are so widespread that Mr. Modi comes to the election with a huge advantage. But the scale of his success depends in part on whether he can persuade Muslims like Mr. Shah to support his candidacy, a difficult challenge. Muslims make up about 14 percent of the country\u2019s population, and they have been a crucial part of the support base of the governing party, Indian National Congress, for years.Mr. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat State in 2002 when a fire killed 58 Hindu pilgrims on a train that had been attacked by a Muslim mob. Hindu mobs then attacked Muslim neighborhoods over several days.More than 1,000 people died, mostly Muslims, and women were raped and children burned alive as the police stood by. Mr. Modi was never charged in connection with the riots, but some of his close associates were convicted of inciting violence.He has been linked with a police assassination squad that mostly targeted Muslims. And he spent much of his career rising through the ranks of a right-wing Hindu social organization tied to deadly attacks on Muslims.Given this history, many Muslim leaders in India say they will neither forgive nor forget Mr. Modi\u2019s role in the 2002 Gujarat riots. Shakeel Ahmad, chairman of the Islamic Relief Committee of Gujarat, said that Mr. Modi\u2019s political success resulted from demonizing Muslims.\u201cModi survives on hatred,\u201d Mr. Ahmad said in an interview last year.\u201cThis is an election tactic,\u201d Mr. Afsar said. \u201cEveryone knows he\u2019s not secular.\u201dBut Mr. Modi has presided over an economy in Gujarat that is among the strongest in India, and he has promised to bring to the rest of the country his economic expertise. Few political observers believe he will win over many Muslims, but his outreach could persuade vital regional leaders, who themselves have large Muslim constituencies, that he is an acceptable partner.\u201cModi\u2019s campaign has been strikingly devoid of anti-Muslim rhetoric,\u201d Ashutosh Varshney, a professor of international studies at Brown University, wrote in an emailed response to questions. \u201cWhether that is a sign of ideological evolution remains unclear, but at the very least it is part of a considered strategic decision.\u201dTop Bharatiya Janata Party officials have even suggested that the party could apologize to Muslims for past actions. In his speech Sunday, Mr. Modi pointed out that Gujarati Muslims are so much more prosperous than those in Uttar Pradesh that a far greater share in Gujarat apply to undertake the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, an important tenet of the Islamic faith.\u201cFor the B.J.P.,\u201d Mr. Modi said of his party, \u201csecularism is an article of faith. It is to unite people and bring development.\u201dMr. Modi has become so confident about his overall prospects that he all but ignored his chief national rival, Rahul Gandhi. Instead, he looked out upon a sea of mostly male party enthusiasts clad in orange, a color associated with Hinduism, at a park here. He slyly mocked Mulayam Singh Yadav, a local political leader who has long been a favorite of Muslims. \u201cNeta Ji,\u201d he said in a teasing, singsong voice, using a widely used nickname for Mr. Yadav. Where is your state\u2019s electricity, Mr. Modi asked, or its desperately needed jobs?Mohammad Jaffar Ali, a 27-year-old stockbroker who lives in a Muslim enclave in Lucknow, acknowledged hours after the rally that Mr. Modi seemed to be a good leader.\u201cBut I think being a good human being is far more important than being a good leader,\u201d Mr. Ali said. \u201cI\u2019m not voting for him.\u201dA crowd soon gathered around Mr. Ali, a common occurrence when politics are discussed here. Among the young men was Karim Jafar, a 25-year-old medical product wholesaler and Muslim, who made a point of saying that he was a \u201can Indian first and a Muslim second.\u201dMr. Jafar said: \u201cI\u2019m young. I don\u2019t know much about the past, but I\u2019m hopeful for a good future and I think Mr. Modi could help bring that. No leader is perfect. I\u2019m going to vote for Modi and see.\u201dTwo-thirds of India\u2019s population is under 35, and half is younger than 25. Mr. Modi\u2019s efforts to remake his party into one friendlier toward Muslims could pay dividends with young voters, many of whom were children when the Bharatiya Janata Party undertook some of its most religiously divisive actions.Mr. Modi\u2019s call for a more business-friendly government could also lure younger voters, many of whom are leaving school with few job prospects. India\u2019s economy must create more than 115 million additional jobs over the next 10 years to accommodate the country\u2019s youthful flood, a rate of growth its economy is far from achieving.Mohammad Shakeel, 44, said he remembered the past too well to support Mr. Modi. Standing in front of about 70 caged chickens with fresh chicken blood brightening his shop floor, Mr. Shakeel said that he voted in the past for Congress, but this time would vote for a regional party.\u201cThere\u2019s some concern, even some fear, about what Mr. Modi will do to Muslims if he becomes prime minister,\u201d Mr. Shakeel said. \u201cWe don\u2019t forget.\u201dAn article on March 4 about the concerns of India\u2019s Muslims over the rise of Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist whose relations with Muslims have been charged, overstated what is known about a 2002 train fire in Gujarat State that killed 58 Hindu pilgrims. While the Gujarat government, headed by Mr. Modi, concluded that the fire was a Muslim attack, that finding has been disputed by a central government investigation, which concluded that the fire was an accident.Hari Kumar and Sonia Paul contributed reporting from Lucknow, and Ellen Barry from New Delhi.slide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine\u2019s New Premier, the \u2018Rabbit,\u2019 Seems to Be in His Element", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 For three months, throughout the uprising and upheaval in Kiev, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk was one of three political leaders who appeared regularly on stage in Independence Square, but he often seemed out of his element. A former foreign minister, economics minister, speaker of Parliament and acting central bank chief, he is more at home in boardrooms and in the corridors of power than on the barricades.Now, two weeks after his colleagues in Parliament named him acting prime minister \u2014 a job he called \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d even before Russia invaded Crimea \u2014 Mr. Yatsenyuk, 39, is in a role that suits him better than that of street revolutionary, but that has thrust him to the center of the crisis. On Wednesday, he met in Washington with President Obama and other top officials to plead for economic and political assistance.Among Ukrainians who like to talk politics, Mr. Yatsenyuk is often known as \u201cRabbit\u201d because of an uncanny resemblance to the character in the Soviet cartoon version of \u201cWinnie the Pooh\u201d \u2014 lanky, bald and wearing a distinctive pair of eyeglasses. Derided as an uninspiring technician during a failed presidential campaign in 2010, Mr. Yatsenyuk is now said by some Ukrainians to be the right man at the right moment.\u201cYesterday I was watching Yatsenyuk at his meeting with entrepreneurs,\u201d Valeriy Pekar, a vice president of the Ukrainian League of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, wrote on Facebook last week. \u201cAs much as the man was not in his place on Maidan,\u201d he said, using the nickname for Independence Square, \u201cso he looked in his place as a prime minister.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re used to the Maidan Yatsenyuk, confused, indecisive,\u201d continued Mr. Pekar, who runs Euroindex, Ukraine\u2019s largest organizer of trade shows. \u201cYesterday I saw Premier Yatsenyuk, even with a high fever, he demonstrated a sharp mind, deep knowledge of economic processes, awareness of realities, switched easily between Ukrainian-Russian-English, immediate responses to questions and suggestions, sustainable economic liberalism and reformist determination.\u201d\u201cThis,\u201d Mr. Pekar summed up, \u201cis what a person in the right place means.\u201dOf course, that remains to be seen.Mr. Yatsenyuk confronts tremendous challenges as acting prime minister, not just because of the Russian military threat and the secessionist push by regional leaders in Crimea, but because of Ukraine\u2019s deep financial problems and need for a large international bailout package. He also faces suspicion from a public that is deeply wary of his past service in the Ukrainian government, long dismissed as a cesspool of corruption and mismanagement.The military confrontation with Russia, however, has raised the stakes, swiftly propelling Mr. Yatsenyuk beyond the tense negotiations he had expected with the International Monetary Fund and into the middle of a geopolitical firestorm that is perhaps the most ominous confrontation between Russia and the West since the end of the Cold War.His meeting with President Obama at the White House \u2014 a rare invitation for a new leader \u2014 was meant to demonstrate Washington\u2019s unwavering support for the fledgling government in Kiev. On Thursday, he is scheduled to visit the United Nations, where he will appeal for international support in advance of a referendum in Crimea on Sunday that regional leaders hope will ratify their intention to secede from Ukraine.Mr. Yatsenyuk\u2019s appeal in the West, where he is viewed as an able steward fluent in the language of diplomacy and international finance, is already well known because of a recording of a telephone conversation between Victoria J. Nuland, a United States assistant secretary of state, and the American ambassador in Ukraine, Geoffrey R. Pyatt, in which they discussed the possibility of opposition leaders entering the government in late January. \u201cYats is the guy who\u2019s got the economic experience, the governing experience,\u201d Ms. Nuland said, referring to Mr. Yatsenyuk, in a call during which she also famously directed an expletive at the European Union. In the end, Mr. Yatsenyuk rejected the offer to join the government because it would have left President Viktor F. Yanukoyvch in charge. Even now, it is not clear that Mr. Yatsenyuk will have a future in government beyond the presidential elections on May 25. The top contenders are expected to be the former boxer, Vitali Klitschko, a leader in Parliament who was also leader of the street protests, and Petro Poroshenko, a veteran lawmaker and one of Ukraine\u2019s wealthiest businessman. Mr. Yatsenyuk had been the leader in Parliament of Fatherland, the political party of Yulia Tymoshenko, the former prime minister who was recently released from prison.However the next few months play out, it seems certain that Mr. Yatsenyuk (pronounced YA-tsen-yuk) will celebrate his 40th birthday on May 22 as prime minister. It is a role he seems to have been preparing for since childhood. Mr. Yatsenyuk was born in 1974 in Chernivtsi, not far from the border of Romania. His parents were professors at Chernivtsi National University. Mr. Yatsenyuk received a law degree from that university, and he later earned a master\u2019s degree in accounting and auditing and a Ph.D. in economics from the Ukrainian Academy of Banking.He founded a law firm and then worked for three years as a bank executive before entering public service. His first post was as minister of economics of Crimea, giving him a firsthand understanding of the region that is now trying to break away from Ukraine.Leonid Grach, a former speaker of the Crimean Parliament, said that Mr. Yatsenyuk was not well liked. He changed the sign on his office door from Russian to Ukrainian, and was called \u201cLittle Gulliver\u201d by some colleagues who viewed him as an outsider, Mr. Grach said. \u201cCrimea was an accident for him, and he was an accident for Crimea,\u201d he said. Back in Kiev, he became deputy chairman and later acting chairman of Ukraine\u2019s central bank, before serving as minister of economy and deputy head of the presidential administration under President Viktor A. Yushchenko, who later named him minister of foreign affairs. In 2008, he was elected speaker of Parliament, a post he held for just under a year. Even with a long r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in public service, Mr. Yatsenyuk faces many formidable and politically perilous tasks in addition to the crisis in Crimea. There is unrest in the heavily pro-Russian east of the country and the prospect of devastating trade sanctions by Russia should the conflict deepen.An article last year examining his swift rise in the Fatherland Party, published on a local news site, News24UA, noted that his success in the rough political arena was belied by his gentle reputation: \u201cEveryone calls him a rabbit, a bunny or \u2018our white and fluffy Senya.\u2019 How did it happen that people associate a leader of today\u2019s opposition forces with a meek, innocent animal?\u201dOksana Lyachynska contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Confronting Putin\u2019s Russia", "Date": "2014-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe decision by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to annex Crimea ended the post-Cold War era in Europe. Since the late Gorbachev-Reagan years, the era was defined by zigzags of cooperation and disputes between Russia and the West, but always with an underlying sense that Russia was gradually joining the international order. No more.Our new era is one defined by ideological clashes, nationalistic resurgence and territorial occupation \u2014 an era in some ways similar to the tragic periods of confrontation in 20th-century Europe. And yet there are important differences, and understanding the distinction will be critical to a successful American foreign policy in the coming decades.We did not seek this confrontation. This new era crept up on us, because we did not fully win the Cold War. Communism faded, the Soviet Union disappeared and Russian power diminished. But the collapse of the Soviet order did not lead smoothly to a transition to democracy and markets inside Russia, or Russia\u2019s integration into the West.Some Russians pushed forward on this enormous agenda of revolutionary change. And they produced results: the relatively peaceful (so far) collapse of the Soviet empire, a Russian society richer than ever before, greater protection of individual rights and episodically functioning democratic institutions.But the simultaneity of democracy\u2019s introduction, economic depression and imperial loss generated a counterrevolutionary backlash \u2014 a yearning for the old order and a resentment of the terms of the Cold War\u2019s end.Proponents of this perspective were not always in the majority. And the coming to power of an advocate of this ideology \u2014 Mr. Putin \u2014 was not inevitable. Even Mr. Putin\u2019s own thinking changed over time, waffling between nostalgia for the old rule and realistic acceptance of Russia\u2019s need to move forward.And when he selected the liberal, Western-leaning Dmitri A. Medvedev as his successor in 2008, Russia\u2019s internal transformation picked up the pace. Though Russia\u2019s invasion of Georgia in 2008 isolated Russia for a time, its integration into the existing international order eventually regained momentum.In my first years in government, I witnessed President Medvedev cooperating with President Obama on issues of mutual benefit \u2014 a new Start treaty, new sanctions against Iran, new supply routes through Russia to our soldiers in Afghanistan and Russian membership in the World Trade Organization. These results of the \u201creset\u201d advanced several American vital national interests. The American post-Cold War policy of engagement and integration, practiced by Democratic and Republican administrations alike, appeared to be working again.When Mr. Putin became president again in 2012, this momentum slowed, and then stopped. He returned at a time when tens of thousands of Russians were protesting against falsified elections and more generally against unaccountable government. If most Russians praised Mr. Putin in his first two terms, from 2000 to 2008, for restoring the state and growing the economy, some (not all) wanted more from him in his third term, and he did not have a clear response.Mr. Putin was especially angry at the young, educated and wealthy protesters in Moscow who did not appreciate that he (in his view) had made them rich. So he pivoted backward, instituting restrictions on independent behavior reminiscent of Soviet days. He attacked independent media, arrested demonstrators and demanded that the wealthy bring their riches home.In addition to more autocracy, Mr. Putin needed an enemy \u2014 the United States \u2014 to strengthen his legitimacy. His propagandists rolled out clips on American imperialism, immoral practices and alleged plans to overthrow the Putin government. As the ambassador in Moscow, I was often featured in the leading role in these works of fiction.The shrill anti-Americanism uttered by Russian leaders and echoed on state-controlled television has reached a fanatical pitch with Mr. Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea. He has made clear that he embraces confrontation with the West, no longer feels constrained by international laws and norms, and is unafraid to wield Russian power to revise the international order.Mr. Putin has made a strategic pivot. Guided by the right lessons from our past conflict with Moscow, the United States must, too, through a policy of selective containment and engagement.The parallels with the ideologically rooted conflicts of the last century are striking. A revisionist autocratic leader instigated this new confrontation. We did not. Nor did \u201cRussia\u201d start this new era. Mr. Putin did. It is no coincidence that he vastly weakened Russia\u2019s democratic institutions over the last two years before invading Crimea, and has subsequently moved to close down independent media outlets during his Ukrainian land grab.Also, similar to the last century, the ideological struggle between autocracy and democracy has returned to Europe. Because democratic institutions never fully took root in Russia, this battle never fully disappeared. But now, democratic societies need to recognize Mr. Putin\u2019s rule for what it is \u2014 autocracy \u2014 and embrace the intellectual and normative struggle against this system with the same vigor we summoned during previous struggles in Europe against anti-democratic governments.And, as before, the Kremlin has both the intention and capacity to undermine governments and states, using instruments like the military, money, media, the secret police and energy.These similarities recommend certain policy steps. Most important, Ukraine must succeed as a democracy, a market economy and a state. High on its reform list must be energy efficiency and diversification, as well as military and corruption reforms. Other exposed states in the region, like Moldova and Georgia, also need urgent bolstering.Also, as during the 20th century, those states firmly on our side must be assured and protected. NATO has moved quickly already, but these efforts must be sustained through greater placement of military hardware in the front-line states, more training and integration of forces, and new efforts to reduce NATO countries\u2019 dependence on Russian energy.And, as before, the current regime must be isolated. The strategy of seeking to change Kremlin behavior through engagement, integration and rhetoric is over for now. No more membership in the Group of 8, accession to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development or missile defense talks. Instead there must be sanctions, including against those people and entities \u2014 propagandists, state-owned enterprises, Kremlin-tied bankers \u2014 that act as instruments of Mr. Putin\u2019s coercive power. Conversely, individuals and companies not connected to the government must be supported, including those seeking to take assets out of Russia or emigrate.Finally, as during World War II and the Cold War, the United States and our allies can cooperate with Mr. Putin when our vital interests overlap. But this engagement must be understood as strictly transactional, and not as a means to pull Russia back into accepting international norms and values. That\u2019s how he will see this engagement. So should we.At the same time, many important differences distinguish this new confrontation in Europe from the Cold War or interwar eras. Most help us. A few do not.For one thing, unlike Communism or even fascism, Putinism has little appeal beyond Russia. Even inside Russia, brave civil society leaders still defy autocracy, war and nationalist fervor, and have managed to mobilize tens of thousands against Mr. Putin\u2019s intervention, while a larger but quiet section of society will lament the advent of this new era.I met these silent skeptics \u2014 in government, business and society \u2014 every day in my last job. Citizens rally round the flag during crises, and propaganda works. But Mr. Putin\u2019s nationalism is fueled primarily by a crude, neo-Soviet anti-Americanism. To continue to spook Russians about American encirclement and internal meddling will be hard to sustain. They are too smart.Second, Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia has no real allies. We must keep it that way. Nurturing Chinese distance from a revisionist Russia is especially important, as is fostering the independence of states in Central Asia and the Caucasus.Another difference is that Russian military power is a shadow of Soviet might. A new global conflict is unlikely. But Russia\u2019s military can still threaten Russian border states, so Europeans must bolster their defenses, and Western governments and companies must stop assisting Russia\u2019s military modernization.One obvious difference is that the Internet did not exist during the last standoff. Recent Kremlin moves to cut off citizens from independent information are disturbing, but the communications revolution ensures that Russians today will not be as isolated as their grandparents.Greater exposure to the world gives Russians a comparative analysis to judge their situation at home. This is a powerful tool, which needs to be nurtured through educational exchanges, peer-to-peer dialogues and increased connectivity between the real Russian private sector and its international partners.But there are two important differences that weaken our hand. First, the United States does not have the same moral authority as it did in the last century. As ambassador, I found it difficult to defend our commitment to sovereignty and international law when asked by Russians, \u201cWhat about Iraq?\u201d Some current practices of American democracy also do not inspire observers abroad. To win this new conflict, we must restore the United States as a model.Second, we are enduring a drift of disengagement in world affairs. After two wars, this was inevitable, but we cannot swing too far. As we pull back, Russia is pushing forward. Leaders in Congress and the White House must work together to signal that we are ready to lead the free world in this new struggle.The United States \u2014 together with Russians who want to live in a prosperous and democratic Russia \u2014 will win this new conflict in Europe. Over the last century, democracies have consolidated at a remarkable pace, while autocracies continue to fall. Especially in educated, rich, urban societies like Russia, democracy eventually takes hold. A democratic Russia will not always define its interests as we do, but will become a more stable partner with other democracies.We cannot say how long the current autocratic government in Russia will endure. But a sober, realistic strategy to confront this new threat will help to shorten the tragic era we just entered.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuelan Mayors Are Jailed Amid Protests", "Date": "2014-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 The authorities have jailed the mayors of two cities that have experienced some of the most intense unrest in a wave of protests that has shaken the country in recent weeks. The arrests came as the National Assembly called for a criminal investigation of a prominent opposition lawmaker on charges related to the demonstrations.The intelligence police on Wednesday arrested Daniel Ceballos, the mayor of San Crist\u00f3bal, a city near the western border with Colombia where the protests began in early February. Many parts of San Crist\u00f3bal have been virtually shut down for weeks by demonstrators manning barricades, and clashes between residents and security forces are common.Mr. Ceballos was arrested during a trip to Caracas, the capital. The justice minister, Miguel Rodr\u00edguez, said that the mayor had been taken into custody on a judicial order after citizens filed court papers accusing him of failing to take appropriate measures, like picking up garbage, to keep the city functioning during the protests.Mr. Ceballos belongs to the Popular Will party, headed by Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, a former mayor of a wealthy section of Caracas. Mr. L\u00f3pez was jailed on President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s orders over a month ago on charges of instigating violence.The other mayor, Enzo Scarano, who leads a municipality within the nation\u2019s third-largest city, Valencia, was also jailed on Wednesday after the Supreme Court ruled that he had not carried out an order to remove barricades set up by protesters. The court sentenced him to more than 10 months in jail and ordered him removed from office.In a televised speech, Mr. Maduro vowed, \u201cThere will be justice here, and no one and nothing is going to undermine the will for justice of the Venezuelan state and society.\u201d Mr. Maduro calls the protesters fascists and has taken to mocking them and opposition politicians with references to the horror movie character Chucky, a murderous doll. On Thursday he referred to a group of opposition leaders, including Mr. L\u00f3pez, in this way: \u201cThis man who is in prison, Chucky-crazy, Chucky-prisoner, the other Chucky, Chucky-chucky, Chucky-chucka, this Chucky, Chucky-lookie.\u201dHe called Mr. Ceballos \u201cthis murderer we now have in prison\u201d and accused Mr. Scarano of openly supporting a coup. Also this week, the National Assembly, which is controlled by Mr. Maduro\u2019s Socialist Party, asked the national prosecutor to investigate the opposition lawmaker Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, a close ally of Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s.The protests began with student demonstrations over violent crime and soon expanded to express complaints about a crippled economy and frustration over the Socialist Party\u2019s monopoly control of all branches of government.Students held a rally in Caracas on Thursday to protest the arrests of the mayors. When they tried to march to a nearby university, they were blocked by the police and soldiers.\u201cBy arresting the mayors, the government is throwing more fuel on the fire,\u201d said Gabriela Sariegui, 22, an engineering student.Mar\u00eda Eugenia D\u00edaz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Out of the Shadows, a Tech Hub in Luxembourg", "Date": "2014-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: TechnologyLUXEMBOURG \u2014 The towering, rusty blast furnaces of the industrial wasteland in Belval stand in stark contrast with Luxembourg\u2019s fairy-tale image of wealth and stability. But the former industrial area about 20 kilometers south of Luxembourg City is undergoing a radical metamorphosis. Where the country\u2019s largest steel works once spewed smoke into the sky above the French border, the government has been erecting an entire new neighborhood, aiming to position Luxembourg as Europe\u2019s next hub for technological innovation.Behind one of Belval\u2019s blast furnaces, at the heart of the ambitiously named City of Science, sits Technoport, the national tech-oriented incubator. Anyone with a business idea can apply to have it evaluated there, and \u2014 if the idea is deemed viable \u2014 Technoport offers access to its sleek collaborative spaces and guidance in setting up a business plan.Ideas take shape with a rented laser cutter or 3D printers in the Fab Lab, a digital laboratory that is part of a growing global network introduced by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Center for Bits and Atoms.Power hubs, suspended from high ceilings in the communal spaces, guarantee that the juice never runs low.One of the incubator\u2019s hopefuls is All Square, a social network for golfers founded in December 2012 by Patrick Rahme, 26, of Luxembourg City, and Arthur de Rivoire, 25, of Geneva. The two entrepreneurs have received free coaching at Technoport and will move into an office there this year.In December, a partnership between the Luxembourg government and the Plug and Play Tech Center, a \u201cbusiness accelerator\u201d in Sunnyvale, California, sent the entrepreneurs on a three-month mentoring stint through Silicon Valley. The road to the most hyped of all tech hubs might have been rockier had they started out in a different European country, Mr. Rahme said.\u201cEverything is very easy in Luxembourg,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very linked environment of people who know each other and who are willing to help.\u201dEurope has other technology hubs, many of which are at more advanced stages of development. Helsinki, Stockholm and Berlin all play host to a booming tech scene, while France has created several small incubators and Britain is talking about offering incentives to create a Silicon Alley similar to New York\u2019s.But Christophe Folschette, a co-founder of Talkwalker, a social media monitoring tool here, said Luxembourg\u2019s tech scene reflects the particularity of the tiny Grand Duchy, and can\u2019t be compared with its competitors.\u201cLuxembourg is in a niche and needs to develop its strength as a niche,\u201d he said. \u201cIt must position itself in a certain domain and become the world leader in this domain.\u201dWith a population of a little more than a half million, smaller than most European capitals, Luxembourg offers less waiting time for prospective businesses.Laurent Kratz, a co-founder of Jamendo, a platform for free music that has more than one million members, said Technoport helped connect his start-up with the Ministry of Culture, which then invited Jamendo to the Luxembourg Pavilion at Midem, the annual music industry conference in Cannes, France.\u201cHere in Luxembourg, you make two phone calls and two weeks later you have an appointment,\u201d Mr. Kratz said, adding that in France, his home country, easy and quick access to government departments was unimaginable.While Rovio and Soundcloud generated the buzz necessary to turn Helsinki and Berlin into booming tech hubs, Luxembourg has become the place where successful start-ups move after they have hit the big time. Young entrepreneurs with big ideas and empty pockets, however, must raise around 12,500 euros, about $17,000, to create a limited liability company in Luxembourg, a detail that prevents the kind of garage entrepreneurship made famous by Steven P. Jobs and Steve Wozniak, say, at Apple.\u201cIf a student wants to create an app, he can do it from home,\u201d said Pedro Castilho, vice chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Luxembourg\u2019s New Business & Entrepreneurship Committee, which promotes business relations between the United States and Luxembourg. \u201cHe will only have to rent some cloud storage maybe, which might only be \u20ac5 a month. But at that stage, he won\u2019t need a starting capital of \u20ac12,500.\u201dMr. Castilho is campaigning for the introduction of the 1-1-1 company, a low-cost structure that could be created by one individual in a day, with only \u20ac1. The capital of \u20ac12,500 would have to be generated within five years. Similar structures are already in place in Belgium, France and Germany.Another hindrance is that college graduates often seek out highly paid state jobs, with entrepreneurship remaining a rare choice. Around 42 percent of Luxembourg nationals work in the public sector. As a result, the multilingual country\u2019s expatriates and frontier commuters are the driving force in the start-up community.Mr. Kratz, of Jamendo, says recruiting in more specialized industries is difficult, and that for some, Luxembourg is not cool enough. \u201cYou always have to bring people here,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they don\u2019t want to come to Luxembourg. Maybe Paris or London, but not Luxembourg.\u201d\u201cWe have now managed to build a unique selling proposal for people who want fast and secure lines and data centers,\u201d says Jean-Paul Zens, director of media and communications at the Ministry of State.Low taxes are also an incentive: Up to 80 percent of net income generated from intellectual property \u2014 which can include copyrights, designs and domain names \u2014 is tax free.Government grants target young innovative start-ups, which could receive matching funds of up to \u20ac1 million. Even private initiatives, like Luxembourg Business Angel Network and the Impactory, a communal space that organizes workshops and classes, have close links with the government, creating a small but close-knit network of institutions promoting and supporting entrepreneurship in Luxembourg.Europe4Startups, KPMG\u2019s K-Start and PwC\u2019s Accelerator have sprung up, aiming to attract international startups.From 2015, however, those sales will be taxed where the customer is based, not the supplying company. This reform of the European Union\u2019s Value Added Tax regime on digital services could cost the country an estimated \u20ac700 million in tax revenue, or 1.4 percent of Luxembourg\u2019s gross domestic product.Another challenge in 2015 will be the easing of Luxembourg\u2019s bank secrecy laws, which could result in \u20ac5 billion to \u20ac15 billion in private banking funds leaving the country, according to Statec, the national statistical institute.For now, however, many parts of Belval are still under construction. A growing number of networking opportunities like start-up weekends, app contests and workshops have attracted an active start-up community.Technoport, which hosts 27 companies, has seen a record number of applications in 2013. Recent trends are mobile payment apps, with several start-ups like FLASHiz, Digicash and PayCash launched recently. Research is also starting to take off, with the Luxembourg Center for Systems Biomedicine generating its first spinoffs last year.Far from their home turf, the entrepreneurs of All Square are immersing themselves in the bustling environment of Silicon Valley.The start-up has introduced its iPhone app and signed a partnership with Troon, a golf course management company. All Square\u2019s temporary location in the world\u2019s leading technology hub has its advantages.\u201cTo say that we, as a start-up from Luxembourg, are in Silicon Valley, changes everything for us in terms of marketing and how we are perceived,\u201d Mr. Rahme said.Luxembourg will remain All Square\u2019s official home, but, like many other up-and-coming European start-ups, they hope to gain a foothold in the States.\u201cWe want the management to be in Silicon Valley as soon as possible,\u201d Mr. Rahme said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deportation Policy Shift Is Signaled by Obama", "Date": "2014-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama and his top aides have for months rejected demands from Hispanic activists that Mr. Obama wave a magic wand to end deportations, an action the White House saw as so antagonistic to Republicans that it would destroy any hope for a bipartisan immigration overhaul and even open the door to impeachment. But the growing sense of desperation among Latinos about the deportation of nearly two million illegal immigrants has engulfed top Democrats on Capitol Hill, who fear that Hispanic voters\u2019 anger at the president could disastrously sink turnout in the coming midterm elections. The result is a shift in direction for the president, who signaled on Thursday night that he wants to find a legal way to reduce the number of otherwise law-abiding families who are torn apart by deportation. In a two-hour meeting with immigration activists on Friday, the president again pledged to refine enforcement of immigration laws.In the meeting, the president pressed the activists to remain focused on his push for legislation to overhaul immigration laws and said that a new system remains the best way to permanently fix the problem of deportations, according to participants. Mr. Obama reminded the activists, the participants said, that any action he took on his own would be fleeting and not comprehensive.But Mr. Obama promised that Jeh C. Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, would review his department\u2019s actions to address what he called a moral crisis among immigrants. Several of the activists pledged to help Mr. Obama keep the pressure on Republicans, but at the meeting said that Mr. Obama needs to do more than that. But it remains unclear whether Mr. Obama can do anything that would satisfy Latino activists without providing fuel for Republican accusations that he is baldly sidestepping the nation\u2019s laws. \u201cWhat are we to do when a president, regardless of motivation, nullifies our vote by failing to faithfully execute the law?\u201d Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, said in a fiery floor speech this week. \u201cWhy pursue immigration reform if presidents can turn off the very provisions that we pass?\u201d\u201cIt looks to me like he\u2019s preparing another trial balloon to go forth with more likely unconstitutional executive actions,\u201d said Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, who has long been a vocal opponent of the president on immigration. \u201cI don\u2019t know how trust can be restored.\u201dEven the Republican leadership in the House, which has expressed an interest in passing some form of an immigration overhaul, said that Mr. Obama\u2019s latest announcement could further hamper any immigration progress in Congress.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt we have an immigration system that is failing families and our economy, but until it is reformed through the democratic process, the president is obligated to enforce the laws we have,\u201d said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner. \u201cFailing to do so would damage \u2014 perhaps beyond repair \u2014 our ability to build the trust necessary to enact real immigration reform.\u201dJay Carney, the White House press secretary, said Friday that Mr. Obama \u201cdoes not have the authority to achieve comprehensive immigration reform\u201d through executive action. \u201cThere is no fix here that does not include legislation,\u201d he added. Mr. Carney\u2019s answer does not satisfy some activists and Hispanic lawmakers, who are tired of waiting. In a meeting on Tuesday with Kathryn Ruemmler, the White House counsel, aides to three senior Democratic senators argued that the president has the authority to choose how to enforce current laws with finite resources.The White House and Senate Democrats are hoping that the threat of unilateral action by Mr. Obama will prompt some Republicans to accept the Senate bill, which passed with bipartisan support.\u201cOr they can sit idly by and watch the president greatly curtail deportations while 11 million continue to live in limbo here in America,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. \u201cThe choice is clear: A reform bill has the support of liberals, moderates and conservatives, and all we need is the courage of the Republican leadership to make the right and obvious choice.\u201dSeveral legal scholars said Friday that the president has only some leeway to give protection from deportation to larger numbers of immigrants here illegally. Hiroshi Motomura, an immigration law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the president might offer reprieves to otherwise law-abiding immigrants who had been here without documentation for a decade or more. \u201cAs long as he is not trying to change the law unilaterally but he is trying to impose order on the system, he is well within his discretion,\u201d Mr. Motomura said.Ashley Parker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Budget Outlines Higher Growth and Help for Savers and Retirees", "Date": "2014-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Arguing that austerity budgets had delivered a recovery sooner than expected, Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, laid out new financial plans Wednesday that included help for savers and retirees, as well as measures meant to spur business investment.Fourteen months away from the next general election, Mr. Osborne stressed that while growth forecasts were being revised up to 2.7 percent this year, more spending curbs were needed to bring the country\u2019s shaky public finances back into line.\u201cThe job is far from done,\u201d said Mr. Osborne, whose Conservative Party, which leads Britain\u2019s coalition government, is appealing to voters not to put the recovery at risk in next year\u2019s election by voting the opposition Labour Party into power.After the financial crash of 2008 and a massive bank bailout, Britain has been seen by some economists as a laboratory for the policies of austerity and retrenchment that took hold across Europe. Even last year, there were fears here that the economy could return to recession.Because of the brightening economic climate, the budget presented Wednesday was the least controversial in recent years, a sign in itself of Mr. Osborne\u2019s improved fortunes.\u201cThere is no major advanced economy in the world growing faster than Britain today,\u201d Mr. Osborne said in Parliament, where he announced an increase in the amount employees can earn before paying income tax, to 10,500 pounds, or about $17,450. But Mr. Osborne\u2019s room for maneuver remains limited. With the budget deficit \u201cone of the highest in the world\u201d at around 6.6 percent in 2014, Mr. Osborne conceded that \u201cfaster growth alone will not balance the books.\u201dBut he sought to turn his continued commitment to austerity to political advantage by announcing a cap on welfare spending of \u00a3119 billion in 2015-16. That move is designed both to help restrain expenditures and to present himself as tougher on cutting social security payments than the Labour Party would be.Meanwhile Mr. Osborne offered a new bond for retirees that offers a good rate of return and proposed a significant change in the way that retirement savings in pension schemes can be used or spent. That could have a big long-term impact on the financial services industry and may also allow some people to spend their savings in the short term, as a spur to the economy. With an election looming, retirees are a crucial demographic group because a high proportion of them tend to vote.John Fox, director of Liberty SIPP, a provider of pension products, said it was \u201cno coincidence\u201d that the pension measures would give the economy an influx of cash ahead of the election, creating a \u201cfeel-good factor.\u201dThe budget also expanded a program that exempts some individual savings accounts from a tax on interest. And in a move welcomed by drinkers but not the health lobby, Mr. Osborne froze the tax on whiskey and cut the tax on a pint of beer by one penny.The Labour Party argued that voters were still suffering a cost-of-living squeeze. Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, told lawmakers that, since the last election, working people\u2019s living standards had effectively declined by \u00a31,600 a year. They are \u201cfalling sharply and steeply,\u201d he said.There was a more positive reaction from the Confederation of British Industry, the main business lobby group, which said the statement would \u201cput wind in the sails of business investment, especially for manufacturers.\u201dThe group welcomed moves to increase lending for exporters, cut energy bills for industry and provide a big expansion of tax breaks for companies that invest. \u201cThe economy needs to rebalance, and this budget will help businesses hungry to invest and export,\u201d the organization said.Mr. Osborne also outlined moves to replace the current one-pound coin, which is deemed too easy to forge, with a coin whose edge has 12 sides. The new design has some resemblance to the \u201cthrupenny bit,\u201d which was worth three pennies and taken out of circulation in 1971. The coin may appeal to older Britons, for nostalgia\u2019s sake, but is unlikely to be popular with the vending industry, which would face millions of pounds in conversion costs.Before the budget presentation, the government announced plans to offer up to \u00a32,000 in child care subsidies to working parents, although that would not take effect until after the election. It has also proposed a small increase in the minimum wage, to \u00a36.50.Although seen as a key strategist for his party, Mr. Osborne\u2019s budgets have not always been well received. After one previous statement, which became known as the \u201comnishambles\u201d budget, he was criticized for being out of touch when he increased taxes on pasties, a savory snack that is popular with working people. He appeared on Wednesday to try to atone for that misjudgment by cutting a tax on bingo.Despite the encouraging news on growth, Britain\u2019s public finances remain weak, said Rob Wood, chief United Kingdom economist for Berenberg Bank in London. He said that because \u201cthe underlying structural budget deficit is not improving faster than expected,\u201d there was little room for tax cuts.Mr. Osborne\u2019s measures were, from an economic perspective, sensible but \u201camount to shuffling the cards rather than fundamental changes,\u201d Mr. Wood said, adding that the pace of the economic rebound did not prove that Mr. Osborne had won the austerity argument.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Listener and Saleswoman, E.P.A. Chief Takes to the Road for Climate Rules", "Date": "2014-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere on this wind-whipped prairie pocked with strip mines, Ms. McCarthy, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, faced 20 coal miners, union workers and local politicians deeply suspicious of the new climate change regulations she had come to pitch. The Obama administration hopes the regulations will help save the planet, but the North Dakotans say the rules will put coal and their livelihoods at risk.\u201cFolks in this room think that E.P.A. says \u2018hell no\u2019 to coal,\u201d said Senator Heidi Heitkamp, the North Dakota Democrat who had invited Ms. McCarthy to the state.Michael Ness, the local school superintendent, warned of consequences. \u201cAbout 60 percent of kids in our school have parents who work in coal,\u201d he said. Julie Fedorchak, the head of the state\u2019s Public Service Commission, weighed in too. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge chilling effect just with the discussion of these rules,\u201d she said.Ms. McCarthy took off her glasses, looking weary, but responded gamely in a thick Boston accent. \u201cYou guys are great!\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re hitting all the issues, and I appreciate your frankness.\u201d The group laughed \u2014 and then the complaints kept coming.Ms. McCarthy is the chief architect and emissary of President Obama\u2019s plan to fight climate change. At its heart are a pair of divisive E.P.A. regulations that are to set new limits on carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants \u2014 the chief source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States \u2014 and potentially establish Mr. Obama as the first American president to take aggressive action to stop global warming.But the rules could also be so stringent that they shut down large numbers of plants and imperil mining jobs. Republicans and the coal industry say the actions amount to a war on coal, and they are mounting a legal and legislative battle to fight them.It is the job of Ms. McCarthy, a veteran state environmental regulator with a salty sense of humor and a history of negotiating with polluting industries, to tamp down that wildfire, even while she oversees the writing of the regulations. So she has been on regular cross-country road trips that are both listening tour and sales pitch.\u201cWhat she\u2019s doing now is one part reassurance, one part data gathering, one part building a community,\u201d said John D. Podesta, a counselor to Mr. Obama, who meets weekly with Ms. McCarthy to discuss the progress of the climate plan.The trips are a new tactic for the E.P.A. and Ms. McCarthy, who acknowledges that she is campaigning for a cutting-edge set of rules that are a tough sell in large parts of the country. \u201cIt\u2019s not like anything we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d she said over a beer at a wood-paneled steakhouse in downtown Bismarck. \u201cWe will be under intense political scrutiny.\u201dShe is also under intense pressure from the White House, where Mr. Obama has made the climate change rules a top priority \u2014 and where senior officials remind Ms. McCarthy that they are eager to avoid a repeat of the disastrous rollout of Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law. Ms. McCarthy said she thought \u201call the time\u201d about the health care rollout.In June, Ms. McCarthy will unveil the draft of the second rule, which is to be an even more aggressive regulation requiring cuts in emissions at existing coal-fired power plants. Depending on how it is written, the rule could close hundreds of the most polluting plants.Mr. Obama has directed Ms. McCarthy to issue a final version of both rules by June 2015, and to give states until mid-2016 to submit compliance plans.As with the health care law, the success or failure of the regulations will largely depend on how states respond to them. While the E.P.A. will issue a broad federal standard aimed at cutting carbon pollution, each state will be directed to come up with its own plan to carry out the rules. The goal is to give each state the flexibility to devise its own plan \u2014 which also creates the risk that coal-heavy states, and those governed by Republicans who object to the climate rules, could simply refuse to put the rules in place. States might also sue the E.P.A. or find other ways to block or delay the rules.Already, Nebraska has filed suit against the rules, and the E.P.A. anticipates that more lawsuits are on the way.\u201cNo matter what I do, I will get sued,\u201d Ms. McCarthy likes to say.But she hopes that her visits will at least smooth the way in some states.So far, she and other E.P.A. officials have held listening sessions in 11 cities aimed at gathering information to help shape the regulations. In Iowa, she went with Gov. Terry E. Branstad, a Republican, to the state fair, where they talked about how the rules might affect farmers. In Houston, the heart of the fossil fuel industry, she spoke at an energy conference and met with top officials from many of the nation\u2019s biggest oil, gas and coal companies.\u201cPersonality matters a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m everywhere? People have to have a relationship with me.\u201dBut she has been sharply criticized for avoiding states where coal is central to the economy. Ms. McCarthy went to North Dakota only at the invitation of Ms. Heitkamp, and she has no plans to travel to the nation\u2019s top three coal-producing states: Wyoming, Kentucky and West Virginia.\u201cAfter watching her so-called listening tour, I think she only listened to what she wanted to hear,\u201d said Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming. \u201cShe seems to intentionally steer clear of areas where coal is produced.\u201dPart of the strategy behind Ms. McCarthy\u2019s itinerary is an effort to warm up voters before anticipated political attacks on the climate rules. In this fall\u2019s midterm elections, Republican campaigns plan to sharply criticize the rules, and the lawmakers who support them, in ads against what they call the president\u2019s war on coal.Coordinating the E.P.A.\u2019s defense is Thomas Reynolds, a communications operative who was the director of local and regional media for Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign, and who has his sights set on coverage of Ms. McCarthy\u2019s visits in newspapers in politically important states like Ohio, Iowa and Colorado. Ms. McCarthy\u2019s visit to North Dakota was on the front page of The Bismarck Tribune.So is the campaign working? After meeting with Ms. McCarthy in Beulah, Carroll Dewing, the president of Coteau Properties, a North Dakota mine, who wore a gold lapel pin reading \u201ccoal,\u201d pronounced himself impressed.\u201cIt\u2019s not what I expected,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president has said he will bankrupt the coal industry, and she represents the president, but she said she doesn\u2019t want to kill coal. If what she said is what we actually see in the regulations, it might be something we can work with.\u201dGov. Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota, a Republican, was also impressed after he met with her on her trip. \u201cHer accent is one of the most authentic I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I personally always appreciate anyone who\u2019s easy to talk to.\u201dBut will her efforts keep North Dakota from suing the E.P.A. over its climate rules?Mr. Dalrymple noted that his state already had about 20 active lawsuits against the E.P.A. \u201cWe have to keep in mind, in this world of environment and energy issues, unfortunately, quite often, attorneys get involved,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jobs at a Turning Point", "Date": "2014-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIt is also a safe bet, however, that any such lift will be unsustainable. Whatever catch-up businesses play this spring will be against a backdrop of continued high joblessness, poor quality of jobs available and low pay. The February unemployment rate of 6.7 percent, for example, would have been 10 percent if the 5.7 million workers who are waiting on the sidelines for job openings were included in the jobless rate. The share of jobless workers out of work for more than six months actually increased, from 35.8 percent in January to 37 percent, or 203,000 people, a situation made all the worse by Republican refusal to reinstate expired federal unemployment benefits this year. Nearly half of the new positions added last month were in temporary jobs and low-paying fields, including bars, restaurants and janitorial services. Recent experience has shown that it is possible to have a growing economy without strong job growth and decent wages. All that is needed is an asset bubble, amplified by financial speculation and accompanied by excessive tax cuts and unfettered lending. Recent experience has also shown the folly of that type of growth. And yet, in an economy that still badly needs more good jobs, true economic stimulus is not even on policy makers\u2019 wish lists, let alone their agendas. Republicans have not only resisted extra spending to combat unemployment but have supported cuts in food stamps and blocked the extension of jobless benefits, while coercing or co-opting Democrats to put nondefense discretionary spending on a relentlessly downward path. Even President Obama\u2019s recent and welcome call to spend $56 billion through 2024 on new and improved infrastructure and other far-reaching projects could be more aggressive. Mr. Obama has proposed to pay for his initiative by reducing inefficient government subsidies and curbing high-end tax breaks. That is sensible, but it would be more stimulative to the economy to borrow at today\u2019s low rates for a ramped-up program of long-run investments, which would return more over time than the cost of the loans to make them. If it\u2019s politically impossible to do what\u2019s needed, Democrats should at least make the case for stimulus and indulge no illusions that there is some other way to turn conditions around.

{"Headline": "Strengthen the I.M.F.", "Date": "2014-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAs Congress moves forward with providing financial assistance to Ukraine in the form of loan guarantees, lawmakers should also ratify much-delayed reforms that would strengthen the International Monetary Fund and give it more resources to lend to troubled nations like Ukraine.In 2010, the United States led a global effort to double the fund\u2019s capital to about $755 billion and to give developing countries a bigger say in the organization\u2019s management. Most of the I.M.F.\u2019s 188 member countries have ratified these changes, but they cannot be carried out until Congress approves those changes as well. Some Republicans in the House have steadfastly refused to let the reforms come to a vote, arguing unconvincingly that the fund doesn\u2019t need the money.Ukraine\u2019s troubles serve as evidence that it\u2019s important to increase the fund\u2019s resources. The country is seeking a $15 billion loan from the I.M.F. to revive its devastated economy. It is in America\u2019s interest that Ukraine and other countries receive financing from international organizations like the fund rather than from countries like Russia, which had previously promised a $15 billion loan to the country\u2019s former president, Viktor Yanukovych. Russia has used such financial assistance to exert influence over the policies of neighboring foreign governments.There is another benefit to the reform package before Congress. Strengthening the I.M.F. will not cost the American taxpayers more money. Congress appropriated $100 billion in emergency loans to the fund in 2009; a portion of that money will be used to increase the fund\u2019s capital. The reforms would also preserve Washington\u2019s power to veto big changes to how the fund operates.Providing Ukraine with $1 billion in loan guarantees from the American government is a good start, but that will not be enough to get the country back on its feet. Congress needs to go one step further and give the I.M.F. the resources it needs to help troubled nations like Ukraine. Advertisement"}

An hour later she apologized again. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to call you back.\u201dFor Ms. Stent and other professional Russia watchers, the phone has been ringing off the hook since Ukraine became a geopolitical focal point. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a reunion,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone comes out of the woodwork.\u201dBut while the control of Crimea by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has brought America\u2019s Russia experts in from the cold, the news media spotlight has also showed important shifts in how American academics and policy makers think about Russia, not to mention the quality and quantity of the people doing the thinking. Among those experts, there is a belief that a dearth of talent in the field and ineffectual management from the White House have combined to create an unsophisticated and cartoonish view of a former superpower, and potential threat, that refuses to be relegated to the ash heap of history.\u201cIt\u2019s a shorter bench,\u201d said Michael A. McFaul, who returned from his post as the American ambassador in Moscow on Feb. 26, as the crisis unfolded. He said the present and future stars in the government did not make their careers in the Russia field, which long ago was eclipsed by the Middle East and Asia as the major draws of government and intelligence agency talent.\u201cThe expertise with the government is not as robust as it was 20 or 30 years ago, and the same in the academy,\u201d Mr. McFaul said.Compounding the effects has been a lack of demand for Russian expertise at the very top of the foreign policy pyramid. Successive White Houses have sought to fit Russia into a new framework, both diplomatically and bureaucratically, as one of many priorities rather than the singular focus of American foreign policy. Since Mr. Clinton empowered Mr. Talbott, the portfolio has shrunk, and with it the number of aides with deep Russian experience, and real sway, in the White House.As a result, Russia experts say, there has been less internal resistance to American presidents seeking to superimpose their notions on a large and complex nation of 140 million people led by a former K.G.B. operative with a zero-sum view of the world.While President George W. Bush looked into Mr. Putin\u2019s soul, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke his language and President Obama sought a so-called reset of relations, they all found themselves discouraged that Mr. Putin, and Russia, did not behave the way they thought they should.That deficiency is not an accident of history.In the midst of the Cold War, leading universities had whole departments dedicated to understanding the Soviet Union. The top national security question of the day drew the top minds, many of whom became fluent in Russian language and culture and graduated into the government or the spy agencies. But the breakup of the Soviet Union broke up those departments, and the national security enthusiasts melted away with the thawing of relations. Professors found themselves out of funding and eventually jobs.Last year, the State Department ended a grant that Mr. McFaul benefited from as a young Russia scholar and that was specifically intended for Russian and Eurasian research. \u201cThat looks shortsighted, considering what we are looking at lately,\u201d Mr. McFaul said.\u201cThis is what I tell bookers,\u201d Mr. Cohen said, referring to those who book him for television appearances. \u201cI will go on with somebody who disagrees with me 100 percent, but the moment he calls me a Putin apologist, I\u2019m going to say\u201d something that cannot be said on the air.He does agree with his colleagues that the field is not what it once was. It is something the Russians have noticed, too.During his time in Russia, Mr. McFaul said, American indifference bothered the Russians. \u201cThat asymmetry, that we still loomed large for them but for us they didn\u2019t loom large,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt that a lot as ambassador.\u201dIf not, the United States may be increasingly caught off guard.For now, she and her remaining colleagues continue to be on call.Mr. Cohen, speaking on his home phone, excused himself to respond to one of the 30 requests a day he has received, this one a CNN booker for Anderson Cooper. \u201cUtterly fantastic, thank you so much,\u201d Mr. Cohen told her. \u201cDo you have it written down there when the car is coming to get me?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mexico? American jobs went to China instead.More important, two decades worth of trade deals, including Nafta and China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization, did not live up to Mr. Gore\u2019s implicit promise that globalization would improve the living standards of most American workers. Instead, globalization is now often perceived as a leading driver of rampant inequality and wage stagnation.But what globalization did achieve was to greatly improve the lot of hundreds of millions of people in China and other corners of Asia. The lopsided results have opened a rift between the experience of global capitalism between the developed world and many poor countries. Branko Milanovic, an expert on global development who was formerly at the World Bank and who is now at the City University of New York\u2019s Graduate Center, puts it succinctly. From a global perspective, two decades of globalization have produced what \u201cseems like a fairly benign outcome.\u201d If you look at the world as a single nation, income inequality has, in fact, declined. Income in the middle has grown faster than at the top.What\u2019s happened is that while income growth stalled for middle-class workers in developed countries and surged for people in the 1 percent, it also grew sharply for hundreds of millions of workers in China, India and other Asian countries. In the late 1980s, for instance, workers in the middle of China\u2019s urban income distribution made 56 percent of the median American income, according to Mr. Milanovic\u2019s calculations. By 2008, that figure rose to 71 percent.This is astonishing progress. And although incomes of workers in the developed world didn\u2019t rise much as the Asian poor moved up the ladder, they didn\u2019t fall either: Globalization lifted all boats.But as Dani Rodrik of the Institute for Advanced Study put it to me: \u201cIf you were an ethical cosmopolitan you\u2019d say \u2018To hell, what do I care?\u2019 The world has become less unequal and has experienced a lot of poverty reduction.\u201dThere are, however, powerful reasons to worry about this pattern of global development. \u201cIf there are hundreds of millions of people that were in abject poverty one generation ago and are not anymore, that is an important and positive thing,\u201d said Damon Silvers, policy director at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we should accept radical inequality as a necessary corollary of equal development.\u201dChina may have lifted hundreds of millions of workers out of poverty. But workers\u2019 share of China\u2019s income fell from nearly two-thirds in the early 1990s to less than one-half in 2008, according to the International Labor Organization.\u201cOn the one hand you have people moving from extreme poverty to a little better than poverty,\u201d said Ben Davis, director of International Affairs for the United Steelworkers union. \u201cBut at the same time you have the world\u2019s income distribution becoming more skewed from workers to billionaires.\u201d This pattern of global development is unlikely to be stable.The economic catch-up by Asia\u2019s developing countries over the last 20 years relied on a wave of global prosperity that is unlikely to be repeated.Exporting powerhouses were allowed to build up vast trade surpluses, while consumers in the United States used cheap foreign capital to maintain their standard of living on easy credit. Commodity exporters relied on a commodity boom. Poorer European countries relied on capital inflows set off by the euro.\u201cThere was a lot of unsustainability building into the system, but for two decades everybody was doing relatively well,\u201d Mr. Rodrik said.Many developing countries probably hope the pattern will continue. \u201cIf you see China as the first wave of very cheap labor, after China you have other countries like India, and after that Bangladesh and countries in Africa,\u201d Mr. Milanovic said. \u201cYou could have, say, 20 to 50 years of stagnation of the lower middle class in the West.\u201dBut in the new world of lower growth and higher unemployment, the United States and other rich nations are unlikely to tolerate similar imbalances. The question is what will happen as countries push back against export-led growth strategies, as commodity prices fall and capital flows fail to recover to their former scale.Mr. Rodrik says he believes a relatively benign though less globalized future is attainable, one in which progressive taxes finance more robust safety nets and macroeconomic policies are geared to maximize employment. Trade may not grow as much as it has and capital flows may moderate, but economies will remain relatively open.History, however, offers other options.Politics, we know, are mostly local. Whatever happens on the global scale, the concentration of income within nations \u2014 and stagnating wages in the developed world \u2014 complicates the national politics of maintaining an open, rule-bound global economy. \u201cInequality in developed and developing countries is politically dangerous,\u201d Mr. Silvers told me. \u201cOver time it is likely to produce political instability and authoritarianism.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "World\u2019s Biggest Arms Importer, India Wants to Buy Local", "Date": "2014-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Of the 30 countries that attended a defense exposition last month to sell weapons to India, the world\u2019s largest arms importer, only the Russians had the chutzpah to dress up their tanks and guns with women in tightfitting camouflage.The confident and sexy display reflected Russia\u2019s longtime position as India\u2019s dominant military provider, but decades of effort by India to make its own hardware may finally be bearing fruit. India recently rolled out its own fighter jet, a tank, a mobile howitzer and a host of locally made ships.If India succeeds, the Russians could be in trouble. Russia has nearly $39 billion worth of military equipment on order by India, representing nearly a third of Russia\u2019s total arms exports.India\u2019s defense minister, A.\u00a0K. Antony, said at a news conference during the exposition that the country\u2019s reliance on foreign arms makers must end. \u201cA growing India still depending on foreign companies for a substantial part of our defense needs is not a happy situation,\u201d he said. Whether India can break its import addiction is anyone\u2019s guess, but many arms analysts are skeptical. India is expected to spend about $11 billion this year buying weapons from abroad, despite decades of effort by the government to create a domestic military manufacturing sector.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s another country in the world that has tried as hard as India to make weapons and failed as thoroughly,\u201d said Pieter D. Wezeman, a senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which studies global security.Mr. Wezeman said he was skeptical that India\u2019s new products would change that history, saying that its fighters, tanks and guns were \u201cof questionable quality.\u201dIndia\u2019s main problem as an arms manufacturer is a corrupt and inefficient government sector that has neither the expertise to develop top-notch weapons nor the wherewithal to make them in abundance, said Manoj Joshi, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a policy group based in New Delhi. In one telling example, India could buy fully assembled Russian Sukhoi fighters for about $55 million each, but instead mostly relies on kits that are sent to the government-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, which assembles them at a cost of about $68 million each \u2014 nearly a quarter more. In another example, government labs spent billions trying to develop an aircraft engine, only to abandon the effort and buy engines from General Electric for the recently introduced fighter, the Tejas.\u201cWhile it\u2019s more complicated assembling Sukhois than putting together an Ikea flat-pack, it\u2019s not that hard,\u201d said Samuel Perlo-Freeman, a program director at the Stockholm institute. \u201cAnd it\u2019s far from an independent and autonomous development of a new weapons system.\u201dIndia has tried to encourage private companies to make arms in India, both in partnerships to the government and independently, but few of these efforts have succeeded. Most of India\u2019s homegrown arms are developed in 50 government labs and built at eight large government manufacturing facilities and 40 government ordnance factories. Companies have mostly been unwilling to work with the government, and the government has not allowed foreign makers to own more than 26 percent of any Indian factory. It has agreed to raise that limit to 49 percent, but no company has applied for the exception.Mr. Antony dismissed criticisms of the government\u2019s chokehold on arms production. \u201cIndian scientists and Indian industry are more efficient, and the government will have to support them,\u201d he said.But Mr. Joshi said India\u2019s government needed to get out of manufacturing. \u201cOur defense industrial base is hopelessly out of date,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs to be dismantled and handed over to the private sector.\u201dThat has left the door open for countries like Russia, whose arms deliveries to India reached a record level in 2012, the most recent year for which figures are available, rising 50 percent from 2011. In the previous five years, India bought 12 percent of the world\u2019s arms imports, and Russia accounted for 79 percent of India\u2019s deliveries, according to the Stockholm institute. American manufacturers have recently won several orders for transport and maritime patrol aircraft, displacing some Russian equipment, but the Russians are still by far India\u2019s dominant arms supplier. In 2012, Russia delivered to India the second nuclear-powered submarine ever exported by any country.Alexander Kadakin, Russia\u2019s ambassador to India, dismissed any notion of a slowdown in sales to India. \u201cIt is inappropriate in my view and even incorrect to speak about Russia allegedly losing its leading positions in the Indian market,\u201d he told an exposition publication.Because of poor infrastructure, stultifying labor rules and difficulties acquiring real estate, making anything in India is hard. The country\u2019s manufacturing sector is declining and now represents 13 percent of the total economy \u2014 about the same share as in the United States.But its military and civil aviation markets are so enticing that major manufacturers are opening facilities in the country anyway. In 2010, Sikorsky Aircraft, part of the American conglomerate United Technologies, opened a plant in Hyderabad that it operates jointly with Tata Advanced Systems. The facility assembles the cabin for its midsize helicopter, the S-92. The helicopter\u2019s cabin was previously made at a Mitsubishi facility in Japan. Production was transferred to India not because costs were lower (surprisingly, they were not), but because having a local facility might encourage sales in India, said Ashish Saraf, program manager for the Tata-Sikorsky joint venture, of which Sikorsky owns 26 percent.But the challenges have been immense. New roads had to be built to the venture\u2019s 11-acre site, and they came slowly. The company had to build its own facilities to treat water, handle sewage and harvest rainwater. It eventually got power from the state but operated initially from six backup generators, which must be kept operational for occasional power cuts.Employees needed considerable training in aerospace manufacturing and in the early days often left for higher-paying jobs as soon as their training was complete. \u201cOur talent got poached all the time,\u201d Mr. Saraf said. So in addition to expensive training, the company had to undertake an employee retention program.Shipping has been a challenge. Some of the Tata-Sikorsky plant\u2019s most important equipment was damaged on the trip from the port in Mumbai by India\u2019s terrible roads, delaying production. The plant sends its helicopter cabins back to the port; from there, they are shipped to Pennsylvania, where the aircraft are fully assembled. To safeguard against damage to the cabins, the company has hired the operator of a fleet of specially made suspension trucks that travel more slowly, at less than 30 miles an hour, and never at night. As a result, the 450-mile journey takes five days. At least two people are needed for each journey, since one must repeatedly get out with a long stick to push low-slung electrical wires up and out of the way of the truck.\u201cOur early expenses were very high, as we were breaking ground in almost every area we wanted services \u2014 Internet, phone, water, sewage, electricity. Everything,\u201d Mr. Saraf said. \u201cThe challenges continue in terms of logistics and transportation.\u201dTo encourage local manufacturing, India now requires private foreign arms companies to undertake at least a third of their manufacturing in India, as measured by the value of the weapons. But because of the difficulties in making high-technology equipment in India, billions of dollars\u2019 worth of products from these so-called offsets have been piling up unused.\u201cWe are at a watershed moment, because we cannot afford to keep importing every piece of equipment we need,\u201d Mr. Shukla said. \u201cWe have just produced a fighter, a tank and a range of warships. For the first time, India can realistically indigenize.\u201d\u201cYou cannot blame the Russians for taking advantage of the situation,\u201d Mr. Shukla said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lawyers Prepare for G.M. Suits With Novel Strategies", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEver since General Motors announced the recall of 1.6 million vehicles because of a faulty ignition switch, lawyers across the country have been preparing to sue the automaker.One law firm in San Francisco says it received phone calls from more than 200 potential litigants \u2014 mostly victims of crashes involving the recalled cars, or the victims\u2019 relatives \u2014 in just the last week.But some of the cases against General Motors might not be typical product liability litigation. Lawyers say the cases could hinge on extraordinary accusations of fraud \u2014 and novel legal strategies that question the very existence of the formerly bankrupt company. The restructuring agreement helped the ailing automaker regain its financial footing in part by protecting the company from legal claims stemming from incidents before the bankruptcy filing in 2009. Since some of the crashes in question occurred before General Motors declared bankruptcy in June 2009 and was rescued by the federal government, legal arguments being explored would challenge the validity of the restructuring agreement credited with saving the automaker from dissolution, according to bankruptcy and plaintiff lawyers exploring possible litigation.If mounted and successful, the challenges could send G.M. back into federal bankruptcy court. The lawyers suggest that the company fraudulently negotiated the restructuring agreement because, they contend, it knew about the dangerous ignition defect and did not disclose the potential for extensive, and expensive, litigation over it.Experts say the arguments would be difficult to prove, but if they were to prevail, \u201cYou open up the bankruptcy and start all over again,\u201d said John Pottow, a lawyer specializing in bankruptcy and business law at the University of Michigan Law School.A G.M. spokesman said the company would not discuss how many lawsuits had been filed over the ignition issue and he declined to comment on the legal strategy of challenging the bankruptcy agreement.G.M. is already facing growing questions \u2014 including a preliminary criminal investigation by the Justice Department \u2014 about its failure to address a problem it now acknowledges it knew about a decade ago.In announcing the recall last month, G.M. officials said the company had been aware since 2004 of the defective switches \u2014 which could, if jostled by a knee, keys or a bump in the road, suddenly shut down the car\u2019s power and disable the air bags. It sent a notice to dealers in 2005 advising them to warn customers not to use cluttered and heavy key chains, but it did not move to fix the problem until now.Part of the legal strategy being explored in the product liability cases revolves around the unusual structure of the bankruptcy agreement. The Chapter 11 case split the company into \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d corporate entities.The \u201cold\u201d G.M. was saddled with bad assets like closed assembly plants and made responsible for legal claims from accidents that happened before the bankruptcy filing. The \u201cold\u201d company, which has since been dissolved into four separate trusts, settled 85 percent of the $275 billion in claims pending against it in 2011, most of which were product liability cases, an official said, though how many of those were related to the ignition problem is unknown. To date only two ignition cases are publicly known to have been settled, and under the terms of those agreements, the details cannot be disclosed.The \u201cnew\u201d G.M. purchased, with the help of the federal government, all the \u201cgood\u201d assets, including operating plants and office buildings, and was granted protection from previous claims though not future ones. It is the revitalized company that stands today with growing sales and profits. Its recovery has been so complete that the government recently sold its last stake in the company, and G.M. has posted 16 consecutive profitable quarters, with a net income of $3.77 billion in 2013.\u201cThe new G.M. knew all about it,\u201d said Shelby A. Jordan, a bankruptcy specialist at the Texas-based law firm Jordan, Hyden, Womble, Culbreth & Holzer, who has been consulted by plaintiff lawyers planning such cases. \u201cG.M. didn\u2019t change officers or personnel. All it did was sell to a newly funded entity.\u201d He added: \u201cThe ability to impose successor liability on the new G.M. is the avenue that this litigation is going to go through.\u201dTo succeed, lawyers will have to prove that G.M. not only was aware of the defect but also realized it was so serious that it anticipated a cascade of liability claims and willfully covered up that fact in negotiating the specifics of bankruptcy protection.That would be far more difficult, Mr. Pottow said. \u201cIt would be surprising to me if something that was so carefully litigated and lawyered would really do a deliberate cover-up.\u201dThe very idea that the landmark bankruptcy case could potentially be reopened is an extraordinary one. The government-brokered case, along with that of Chrysler, is believed to have not only helped save G.M. but also prevented the economy from sinking even further into recession. It helped re-elect President Obama \u2014 whose campaign used the slogan \u201cOsama bin Laden is dead. General Motors is alive.\u201d \u2014 and is seen by many as a symbol of the country\u2019s fitful but continuing recovery.Meanwhile, as is typical in the aftermath of safety recalls, potential litigants continue to surface. \u201cWe\u2019ve been contacted by over 200 people complaining of this issue within the past week,\u201d said Todd A. Walburg, chairman of the auto and transportation group at Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein in San Francisco. He said the episodes included at least 15 people who had died. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this is widespread.\u201dMr. Walburg helped oversee litigation over cases of unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles, and he is coordinating the G.M. cases for his firm. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on cases where there was clearly an engine shutdown. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t help everyone but we intend to help as many people as we can.\u201d He would not discuss details of the firm\u2019s legal strategy.Robert Hilliard, a lawyer at Hilliard Mu\u00f1oz Gonzales in Corpus Christi, Tex., is representing two families whose teenage daughters were killed in Wisconsin in 2006 while riding in a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt, one of the recalled models, a crash that an accident report linked to a sudden power shutdown. After news media reports about the case, 30 more people have called to discuss potential litigation, he said. Several were relatives of people who died in accidents involving recalled cars, including a man whose brother hit a tree while driving a Cobalt four years ago and the air bag did not deploy.\u201cWe have a growing docket of cases where we are trying to go back and re-examine older evidence,\u201d he said.If lawyers can\u2019t successfully undo the bankruptcy agreement, or provisions covering consumer lawsuits, they will be left with the option of taking most of those claims to what is left of the old G.M. \u2014 an unattractive route since it has significantly smaller assets than the current G.M.\u201cThey would likely get pennies on the dollar,\u201d said Norman I. Silber, a professor of consumer law at Hofstra University.Or they could hope that G.M. decides, even without a court order, to treat the prebankruptcy cases like new ones. On Wednesday, consumer advocates sent a letter to Mary T. Barra, the G.M. chief, suggesting it would be \u201ccruel and unfair\u201d to do otherwise. Bill Vlasic contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Opposition Leader Cool to Quick Vote on E.U. Membership", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Ending months of speculation, Ed Miliband, the leader of Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party, said on Wednesday that he would almost certainly not hold a quick referendum on the country\u2019s membership in the European Union if his party wins power next year.Even with the outcome of next year\u2019s general election difficult to predict, Mr. Miliband\u2019s comments in a speech in London reduced the prospects of Britain quitting the 28-nation European Union in the next few years.Mr. Miliband had been under pressure from some sections of his party to match a pledge by Prime Minister David Cameron, who wants to loosen British ties to the European Union and hold a referendum in 2017 on whether to leave it.Instead, Mr. Miliband said he would hold a referendum only if there were a new agreement that transfers power from London to Brussels, adding that this was unlikely during the life span of the next government.He said a Labour government would promise a \u201clock,\u201d or guarantee, \u201cthat there will be no transfer of powers without an in/out referendum, without a clear choice about whether Britain stays in the European Union.\u201d\u201cI believe it is unlikely this lock will be used in the next Parliament,\u201d he added, referring to the duration of the government that will be set up after elections in 2015.While outlining criticism of the way the European Union operates, Mr. Miliband argued that there was \u201can overwhelming economic case\u201d for British membership in the union, as an exit would put at risk the advantages of being in a single market of around 500 million consumers. Britain would either end up outside that single market, or it would remain subject to terms and rules dictated by others, he told an audience at the London Business School.Labour currently has a lead in most opinion polls about voting intentions for the next general elections, but not a decisive one. Mr. Miliband\u2019s statement means, in effect, that the only scenario in which a referendum on European Union membership is likely is if Mr. Cameron and his party win an overall majority in the election. To do that, they would have to improve on their performance in 2010, when they had to form a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, traditionally the most pro-European of the main political parties.Mr. Cameron has been under pressure from the success of the populist United Kingdom Independence Party, which campaigns against immigration and wants Britain to leave the European Union. The party is expected to prosper in elections to the European Parliament this May, and many Conservative Party lawmakers worry that it will siphon voters from them in the general election in 2015.Britain\u2019s only referendum on its status in Europe was in 1975. When asked today, most respondents say that they would like another chance to vote on the matter. The issue of Britain\u2019s membership and role in the union does not feature at the top of voters\u2019 concerns, however, coming well below those of the economy, jobs and social matters such as health.While Mr. Miliband was pressed by some to neutralize critics of the European Union by offering a quick referendum on membership, others advised him that this could hurt a future Labour government.Trying to improve British membership terms in time for a referendum appears to be an uphill task, but winning a referendum without doing so looks even harder.In recent months, the business community in Britain has expressed growing concerns about the uncertainty that the prospect of a referendum might bring. Vince Cable, the British business secretary and a Liberal Democrat, warned last week of a \u201cblight\u201d on foreign investment in Britain and told The Independent that the referendum pledge had exerted a \u201cchilling effect.\u201dThere is currently legislation in Britain, which Labour had already said it would keep, which states that if a new treaty were to transfer power to Brussels, it would automatically lead to a referendum. Mr. Miliband\u2019s change to this position was to stipulate that, in such circumstances, voters would be offered the chance to quit the European Union rather than to simply reject a new treaty.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Midtown Landlord Sells a Lifestyle to Lure Creative Tenants", "Date": "2014-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA field of wheat doesn\u2019t usually stand inside the lobby of a Manhattan office building.Yet a 10-foot simulacrum, consisting of a few hundred stalks of wheat puncturing an enormous block of Styrofoam and covered with pebbles, is the first thing visitors see when entering the marketing center at 285 Madison Avenue.The wheat field is part of an effort by RFR, which also owns the Seagram Building and the Lever House, to woo creative companies to its office tower at East 40th Street.It could be a tall order, since the $350,000 marketing center \u2014 which also features an art installation of picnic chairs hung from the ceiling; a large wall decal promoting work-life balance; and a display of white bicycles and scooters leaning artfully against exposed concrete columns \u2014 is in the heart of Midtown\u2019s Grand Central office market. That neighborhood has long been the bastion of law firms and banks, more Goldman Sachs than Google.As Wall Street sheds jobs and consolidates its office locations, established centers of business in Midtown have experienced lagging rents and large vacancies. According to CBRE, some 14.7 percent of space will become vacant over the next year in the Grand Central area, compared with 12 percent in Midtown and an exceptionally competitive 9.3 percent in Midtown South.As the city\u2019s economy grows increasingly dependent on the creative sectors, like technology, advertising and media, neighborhoods like Midtown South, once dominated by garment workers and industrial spaces, have been transformed into market leaders, attracting fast-growing start-ups and, increasingly, blue-chip tenants.\u201cThe psychology of tenants is changing,\u201d said James Emden, a vice chairman in New York for the brokerage firm Colliers International. \u201cMany companies are going to West Chelsea, to Midtown South, even the Financial District \u2014 Revlon, for example, recently announced it was leaving 237 Park Avenue for 1 New York Plaza.\u201d\u201cPeople spend much more time these days at work, and so it is more important to them that their work environment reflects their lifestyle,\u201d said Mr. Werdiger of RFR. \u201cTenants used to want to know about the more technical things like ceiling heights, windows, the quality of the bathrooms, but now they care about amenities.\u201dA 5,000-square-foot restaurant on the ground floor will cater meals for office employees, and a room behind the restaurant will be exclusively reserved for private dining for the commercial tenants. Building workers will have a separate amenity space with a lounge, a stocked pantry and a recreation area with table tennis and foosball.\u201cIn the last few years, we have realized how important office space is, and that it should be treated the same way as residential or hotel,\u201d said Aby Rosen, who along with Michael Fuchs is the co-founder and co-principal at RFR. \u201cWe have a brand for our residential and our hotels, but now we are looking to establish a brand for our office space.\u201dBut setting aside areas for table tennis and lounges, rather than for office spaces that can be rented out, comes at a price. In a residential building, tenants pay monthly common charges, but in office spaces the costs are included in the rent. At 285 Madison, for example, RFR is asking in the high-$60 range for the base of the building and as much as $85 for the top several floors.\u201cThe rents are a 15 to 30 percent premium for the market, but we aren\u2019t seeing any pushback because tenants see the value,\u201d said Stephen Eynon, a senior vice president at CBRE, who is marketing 285 Madison.RFR is also betting that these amenities will draw tenants more quickly. \u201cIt may be costlier to create these sales centers or offer these amenities,\u201d Mr. Werdiger said, \u201cbut if we are able to lease up faster and for more rent because of it, then it makes all the difference.\u201dThe landlord does reach for humor in the sales center\u2019s bathroom, where it has hung a medicine cabinet stocked with various sundries including Band-Aids, tampons and a seemingly untouched supersize box of condoms. A roof deck and lobby artwork are the only building amenities.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to do much in the sales center because the location speaks for itself,\u201d Mr. Werdiger said.Back at 285 Madison, the marketing effort is in full swing. The building\u2019s entryway is being promoted as \u201ca hotel lobby and a tenant lounge, where people can sit down and have a meal or work on their laptops,\u201d Mr. Eynon said, while the restaurant, which has not concluded the lease and cannot be named, is \u201cworld-class.\u201dAs for tenants, a Park Avenue-based hedge fund is negotiating for a full 11,500-square-foot floor in the upper part of the building, Mr. Eynon said, but nothing has been signed. Several more leases are reportedly in the works.Despite the lack of a signed deal and the financial outlay, RFR is confident of its strategy. \u201cWe always spend more than we should, but we are at the forefront of design and architecture and when we do something it needs to be great,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. \u201cYou can\u2019t focus on the wrong thing. Nothing is cheap anymore and for the good stuff, you need to pay.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Private Employment Slowly Reclaims Pre-Downturn Peak", "Date": "2014-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsTWO presidential elections have taken place since employment by United States businesses hit a peak of almost 116 million workers. This seems likely to be the month when a new high is finally reached, ending a period that featured the largest drop in employment and the slowest recovery of any period since the Great Depression. At the bottom of the cycle, in February 2010, the number of employees was down 7.6 percent from the peak.There have been six cycles since 1950 in which the number of people employed by the private sector fell at least 3 percent from the peak before the downturn. Until the latest one, the largest decline was 5.6 percent, during a sharp downturn in jobs that began in 1957 and ended in 1959.Men suffered more than women in the recent downturn, with the number of jobs held by men falling 9.9 percent at the worst point, twice the decline in jobs held by women. Women now hold more private sector jobs than ever before, but it is likely to be sometime in 2015 when men surpass their previous high, assuming the recovery continues at its current pace.The accompanying charts show details of each of the six severe downturns since 1950. The first four showed recovery in less than two and a half years. The downturn that began in 2001 lasted more than four years, and this one has gone on more than six years. All but the first one were harder on men than women.While the cycle now ending has been the longest and the deepest, it has also been unusual in the nature of the unemployment that occurred. Since the spring of 2009, the long-term unemployment rate \u2014 the portion of the work force that has been out of work more than six months \u2014 has been higher than the short-term rate \u2014 the portion who have been out of work for less than a month. That had never happened before. In fact, the short-term unemployment rate reached a record low in December. Fewer people are losing jobs now, but many who became unemployed in 2008 and 2009 are still looking.The charts also show the trends in employment in several fields since January 2008. Management consulting stayed about level during the downturn, and then shot up in 2010. Health care employment rose steadily, and mining jobs began a rapid ascent in 2010, largely because of increased exploration and production in the oil and gas business. But there are still fewer jobs in retail sales than there were before the recession began, and neither manufacturing nor construction is close to recovering all the lost jobs, although they have been adding workers in recent months.And information services \u2014 a category that includes publishing, movies and broadcast, as well as telecommunications \u2014 now employs 2.65 million people, fewer than worked in the area in 1989.The charts deal with private sector employment.

That was down from an upwardly revised 374.2 the week before.The group\u2019s seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications fell 7.7 percent, and the gauge of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, rose 2.8 percent. The previous week\u2019s data was revised up for both of those indexes as well.Fixed 30-year mortgage rates averaged 4.56 percent in the week, the highest level since January, and up 6 basis points from 4.50 percent the week before.The survey covers over 75 percent of American retail residential mortgage applications, according to the group.Economists are looking for a sustained rebound in manufacturing as the economy improves this year.The big rise in demand for commercial aircraft followed a 22.1 percent plunge in the previous month in this traditionally volatile category.Demand rose for primary metals like steel by 1.6 percent, but orders for machinery fell 1.5 percent. Demand for computers was down 0.5 percent, and orders for communications equipment dropped 2.7 percent.Economists expect manufacturing output to strengthen in coming months, reflecting better weather after a series of winter storms that disrupted production at some factories.The Institute for Supply Management said that its gauge of manufacturing activity expanded more quickly in February as companies received more orders and bolstered their stockpiles.The institute\u2019s manufacturing index rose to 53.2 in February, up from 51.3 in January.

{"Headline": "A Tortured Policy Toward Russia", "Date": "2014-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTHE United States has once again twisted itself into a rhetorical pretzel. As when it threatened military action against Syria if a \u201cred line\u201d was crossed, the Obama administration\u2019s rhetoric about Russia and Ukraine goes far beyond what it will be willing and able to enforce. Earlier this month, President Obama warned that America would \u201cisolate Russia\u201d if it grabbed more land, and yesterday, he suggested that more sanctions were possible. Likewise, Secretary of State John Kerry said the Group of 7 nations were \u201cprepared to go to the hilt\u201d in order to isolate Russia.But Washington\u2019s rhetoric is dangerously excessive, for three main reasons: Ukraine is far more important to Vladimir V. Putin than it is to America; it will be hard for the United States and Europe to make good on their threats of crippling sanctions; and other countries could ultimately defang them.First, the United States needs to see the Ukraine crisis from Russia\u2019s viewpoint. Threats from America and Europe will never be the determining factor in Mr. Putin\u2019s decision making. Ukraine is Russia\u2019s single biggest national security issue beyond its borders, and Mr. Putin\u2019s policy, including whether to seize more of Ukraine, will be informed overwhelmingly by national security interests, not near-term economics. Furthermore, Russia has provided Ukraine with some $200-$300 billion in natural gas subsidies since 1991. With an anti-Russian government in Ukraine, Moscow is likely to stop these subsidies, lifting a major economic burden just as the West tries to squeeze it financially. Second, if Russia pushes farther into Ukraine, America\u2019s attempt at tougher Iran-style sanctions, coordinated with allies, will ultimately fail. Indeed, if Mr. Putin pursues a broader military campaign, a similarly robust response from both America and Europe is unlikely. And finally, even if America seeks stringent sanctions against Russia, other nations will ignore them and offset any damage they cause. India absolutely refuses to treat Russia like a rogue state. More important, China will not observe such sanctions. The fundamental problem is that the Obama administration doesn\u2019t want to bear the costs associated with an active foreign policy. That\u2019s understandable. A December Pew poll revealed the lowest level of public support for an active American foreign policy since 1964.This domestic pressure was on display in Syria. Mr. Obama\u2019s error was not that he backed away from military action and accepted Russia\u2019s proposal to rid Syria of chemical weapons. The mistake was that he drew a red line that would have been more costly to back up than the United States was willing to tolerate. America lost credibility internationally for failing to make good on its threat.Unfortunately, the Obama administration is repeating this mistake in Ukraine.When Russia proceeded with the annexation of Crimea, the United States and Europe responded with punitive measures that had some economic impact. But they did not by any means \u201cgo to the hilt.\u201d Instead, the Americans and Europeans drew an even deeper line in the sand, issuing empty threats of sweeping sanctions if Russia tried to grab more territory in Ukraine.Such sharp rhetoric from the West could push Mr. Putin to be even more aggressive. That\u2019s because he does not believe that the West would ever treat Russia like Iran and implement robust sanctions that would cut off vast areas of Russia\u2019s economy from the West. As Mr. Putin recently explained, in a globalized world \u201cit\u2019s possible to damage each other \u2014 but this would be mutual damage.\u201d\u201cIsolating Russia\u201d as if it were Iran or North Korea isn\u2019t a threat America can feasibly make good on. Just because Mr. Putin is acting like the leader of a rogue state, his country cannot be considered as such. Russia boasts the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy. Given the exposure of American corporations to Russia, there would be serious pushback from the private sector if Mr. Obama tried to relegate Russia to rogue-state status. The Obama administration needs to preach what it will ultimately practice. Otherwise Washington\u2019s credibility will erode further as it walks back its words.A more hard-line response is not the answer. Mr. Obama was right to rule out the military option; diplomacy is America\u2019s only viable path forward.But Washington needs to anticipate a Russian response from a Russian perspective. In a major speech on Wednesday, Mr. Obama hinted that further sanctions would be implemented if Russia maintained its present course. That is a mistake. Russia will not back down, and such talk will only ratchet up tensions. The Obama administration should focus on supporting Kiev rather than punishing Moscow. That means using its leverage with Europe to ensure that this support sticks, and that Ukraine\u2019s new government does nothing to provoke an extreme response. This will require an acknowledgment of Russia\u2019s core interests and America\u2019s limitations \u2014 and an end to empty threats.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Exploiting California\u2019s Drought", "Date": "2014-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe San Joaquin Valley in California can be stunningly beautiful: On a visit two weeks ago, I saw billions of pink almond blossoms peaking, with the Sierra Nevada towering over all. It can also be a hideous place, the air choked with microparticles of unpleasant origins (dried cow dung, sprayed chemicals, blowing over-fertilized soil), its cities like Fresno and Bakersfield sprawling incoherently and its small towns suffering from poverty, populated by immigrants from places as near as Baja, Mexico, and as far as Punjab, India. This year, much of its land is a dull, dusty brown rather than the bright green that\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d here, even if \u201cnormal\u201d is more desire than reality. With water, this is the best agricultural land in the world. Without it, not so much. If you have a good well you can pump groundwater at will; atypically, that\u2019s not managed by the state, so you pay only for drilling and electricity. Until, of course, you draw down the water table (or your neighbor does, by drilling a deeper well). This race to the bottom is not sustainable, and wells are going dry as a result. You may have a large or small water supply contract from one of hundreds of water districts, granted when population was small, water was plentiful and environmental concerns ignored. These contracts have boosted the economy at great cost to the environment, and they\u2019re ludicrously unfair: Some pay $7 per acre-foot (roughly 326,000 gallons), others $200; some have to buy on the open market, and cities generally pay over $1,000. Even then, supply may be inconsistent. But there is enough water to farm here while providing water for 40 million people (with more coming) to drink, bathe and wash. Some of that will be \u201cgray\u201d (recycled) water, especially for lawns, the single biggest use of residential water. And, according to Obegi, it could be that not every one of the current eight million irrigated acres will be planted. For a consistently reliable water supply, one of two things must happen: Crop selection must be modified or water delivery and use must be more rational. But trying to persuade politicians, farmers and even water conservation advocates to think about determining what\u2019s grown may be nearly impossible. But the state can\u2019t dictate what landowners grow. (We can help by eating fewer animal products.) It can, however, price water more fairly and make profligate water use unprofitable. Some argue that more dams would solve the problem, but as the Sierra\u2019s snowpack shrinks, this might be a recipe for expensive and dry reservoirs. Less expensive and more effective solutions would essentially overhaul the water delivery system to provide metered water on demand (now it\u2019s often \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d), which in turn would encourage more farmers to install drip irrigation, which quickly pays for itself. The state should not just monitor but also manage groundwater usage, and mandate treatment and recycling plants; these may be expensive, but they\u2019re far less so than building new dams and shipping water hundreds of miles. Furthermore, if farmers were encouraged to build soil health by rotating crops, planting cover crops and integrating more organic matter, the land itself would become more drought-resistant.

But that figure does not include state, local and federal government workers, unlike the coming Labor Department report. Most economists predict it will show that governments shed workers in February.And a survey of service companies by the Institute for Supply Management found that its measure for hiring plunged 8.9 percentage points to 47.5, evidence that many companies let go of employees in February.

Signed contracts to buy used homes stayed flat for January and February.In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that factory orders dipped 0.7 percent in January. That followed an even bigger 2 percent decline in December, which was a larger decrease than first reported.

{"Headline": "With Start-Ups, Greeks Make Recovery Their Own Business", "Date": "2014-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 For Natalie Kontou, 32, Greece\u2019s economic crisis may be a blessing in disguise.After losing her job at a magazine in 2011, at the peak of the crisis, and a fruitless spell seeking work in Australia the following year, she is now running her own fledgling company. It offers tailor-made tour packages for a growing influx of foreign visitors to Greece.\u201cI always wanted to work in tourism, but I never imagined I\u2019d set up my own business, let alone with my friends,\u201d she said, referring to her three partners at the company, Athens Insiders. After its start last spring, on a budget of only 5,000 euros, or roughly $6,900, the business has broken even after selling 20 tailor-made tours to individuals, couples or groups, and is now seeking financing to expand.The entrepreneurial dream is one that many in Greece are chasing. With scant opportunities in a demolished private sector, with unemployment at a record 28 percent \u2014 and above 60 percent for those under 24 \u2014 many Greeks have stopped waiting for those in power to put the country back on its feet.The government and Greece\u2019s troika of international lenders agreed last week on economic reforms designed to unlock an estimated \u20ac10 billion in rescue funds. But virtually all of it is to go toward paying down debt instead of investing in the growth the country desperately needs.No wonder some Greeks are taking matters into their own hands.Although thousands of enterprises have buckled under the pressure of a deepening recession now in its sixth year, thousands of others have opened, in defiance of that bleak narrative. According to government figures, more than 41,000 new companies were formed in Greece last year. Most of those were food or clothing retailers or other types of businesses that few experts would consider entrepreneurial innovators.But Endeavor Greece, a nonprofit organization that supports entrepreneurship, counted 144 of those companies as entrepreneurial start-ups \u2014 a ninefold increase from the number founded in 2010.Business incubators and shared work spaces have sprung up across Athens and other Greek cities in recent months to accommodate start-ups, while conferences and forums on entrepreneurship and innovation abound.About a dozen incubators are competing to foster the best business ideas, helping defray operating costs and offering mentorship. One, called Enter Grow Go, has taken Athens Insiders under its wing along with 20 other start-ups and is backed by Eurobank, the third-largest Greek lender.Another, Orange Grove, an initiative of the Dutch Embassy in Athens, supports nearly three-dozen new businesses including Clio Muse. Run by three Greeks in their 20s, Clio Muse last month rolled out a mobile application that gives visitors to museums and galleries background articles about selected exhibits.In Athens, the newest private incubator is Romantso, named after the defunct women\u2019s magazine in whose former headquarters it is based. There, dozens of designers, photographers and web artists pay around \u20ac300 a month to rent office space in an environment with an edgy aesthetic where they exchange ideas and expand their start-ups. Romantso supplements its income from the rent with proceeds from an on-site bar, sponsorships and paid seminars.Vassilis Haralambidis, a 37-year-old graphic designer who opened Romantso on a tiny street in a run-down central district last autumn, said his aim was to \u201cstop the misery.\u201d\u201cWe saw that people were numb, that the country was going in the wrong direction and we decided to do something,\u201d Mr. Haralambidis said. He had postponed paying taxes, he said, in order to plow that money into Romantso, although he declined to discuss the specifics of this deferment.The authorities are lending their support to the start-up movement, as they have in other European countries, like France and Spain, where youth unemployment is also high. The Greek government has reduced the bureaucracy and paperwork that has discouraged entrepreneurs in the past. New legislation, to come into force later this year, would allow a business to be officially set up in a single day.A program subsidized by the European Union to support small and medium-size businesses, worth \u20ac1 billion is to be divided among more than 16,000 Greek beneficiaries this year. An additional \u20ac130 million in European Union-backed loans and venture capital programs has already been dispensed.Many industry experts see venture capital and loans as a better option than European Union grants.\u201cFree money is not a solution,\u201d said Panos Zamanis, co-founder of the Hellenic Startup Association, who advises new businesses, mainly at Orange Grove. He cited reports that millions of euros in European subsidies were squandered in the past on holiday homes and other luxuries. \u201cThere needs to be the obligation to give the money back.\u201dSome aspiring entrepreneurs said they preferred to approach investors offering seed funding or venture capital firms that can offer expertise along with equity investments, rather than competing for European Union money.\u201cThe subsidies go to people with connections anyway,\u201d said Yiannis Papageorgiou, 24, who last year set up Truckbird, an online logistics service linking shippers and carriers, with five friends. To attract customers, Truckbird began offering a free-trial service last month. Mr. Papageorgiou said there were now more than 20 companies in the trial, and he was in talks with potential investors.The venture is a bold foray into the trucking industry, one of dozens of so-called closed professions that have been protected from competition by a mass of regulations that the country\u2019s international lenders have insisted must be reduced or eliminated to revitalize the economy.If Greece is to emerge from recession, analysts say it must stop being an insular economy where most people work for the state, or in copycat retailing jobs.\u201cAmong the crowd of Greeks setting up snack bars and take-aways, a handful are trying to do something better,\u201d said George Pagoulatos, a professor of European economics and politics at Athens University and a former government adviser.Several fledgling companies have clearly succeeded, some with the initial help of Greek venture capital funds, which have invested \u20ac20 million in about 20 domestic start-ups over the past two years, according to Yiannis Papadopoulos who heads the Hellenic Venture Capital Association.Several notables have expanded internationally.Taxibeat \u2014 a mobile application allowing travelers to choose among nearby taxis on the basis of preferences and ratings by previous passengers \u2014 has been rolled out in France, Mexico, Brazil and Peru since its creation in Athens in 2011.After securing \u20ac3.5 million in Greek venture capital, it secured an additional \u20ac3 million last year from Hummingbird Ventures, a firm in London. Taxibeat says it is now profitable in Greece and has a total of nearly a million users in its various markets.Bugsense, a Greek company that tracks software flaws in mobile phone applications, was acquired last year by Splunk, a Nasdaq-listed software company based in San Francisco. Cookisto, an online service whose subscribers buy meals from home cooks, has expanded beyond Greece to Britain after securing \u20ac200,000 in seed funding from a Greek entrepreneur, Leon Yohai.Workable, which designed a software application to aid the hiring process by small businesses that cannot afford a human resources department, has opened offices in London and Portland, Ore., since starting in Athens in 2012. It recently received $1.5 million in financing from Greylock IL, the British-Israel arm of the American venture capital firm Greylock Partners.Such trailblazers are inspiration to their fledgling compatriots, like Athens Insiders.\u201cI know it\u2019s a gamble but we\u2019re going to stick at it,\u201d said Ms. Kontou, whose company is planning tours in five different languages and exploring its finance options. \u201cIf we young Greeks don\u2019t try and create something new, who will?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Many Seek Spanish Citizenship Offered to Sephardic Jews", "Date": "2014-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Spanish government has been flooded with thousands of inquiries about legislation it approved last month that will grant dual citizenship to descendants of Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain more than 500 years ago, the country\u2019s justice minister said on Wednesday.The minister, Alberto Ruiz-Gallard\u00f3n, who considers the legislation his most important achievement, said in an interview at The New York Times that he anticipated that more than 150,000 people, scattered in the Sephardic Jewish diaspora, would seek Spanish citizenship under the measure, aimed at righting what the government has called a grievous error. The bill is expected to receive unanimous parliamentary approval.\u201cThis law is a real historic reparation of, I dare say, the biggest mistake in Spanish history,\u201d Mr. Gallard\u00f3n said. He was visiting New York at the invitation of Jewish groups to explain the legislation, which has generated intense interest.While there is no commonly accepted figure for the world\u2019s Sephardic Jewish population \u2014 Sephardic is derived from the Hebrew word for Spain \u2014 by some reckonings as many as one-third of the world\u2019s 13 million Jews may have Sephardic roots. Many live in Israel. But large Sephardic communities exist in countries including France, Mexico, Turkey and the United States.Mr. Gallard\u00f3n, a former mayor of Madrid and grandson of a Spanish ambassador to Romania who helped save Sephardic Jews from the Nazis, said he had been working on the legislation for years. It was first presented as a draft in November 2012.A main goal, he said, was not only to repair an injustice to Jews, but also to repair Spain, where Jewish contributions to art, science and literature flourished before the expulsion. Many Sephardic Jews, he said, retain strong identifying connections to Spain.\u201cInstead of detaching from Spain and having hard feelings toward the country that expelled them, they became more attached to their country, their language and their traditions,\u201d he said. During his travels, he said, he has found Spanish-speaking Sephardic Jews in Istanbul\u2019s Grand Bazaar who can trace their roots to Toledo. Some Sephardic Jews, he said, \u201ceven got as far as Crimea \u2014 they are scattered all over the world.\u201dThe dual-citizenship measure will require that applicants establish their heritage through surnames or other proof of ancestry, or a certificate from a recognized Sephardic Jewish federation or rabbinical authority, but the criteria will not be overly strict, and applicants need not be religiously observant. \u201cWe will look at any evidence,\u201d the minister said. \u201cWe want to ease the process.\u201dAsked whether the measure had generated any backlash in Spain, where the economy has left more than a quarter of the working-age population unemployed, Mr. Gallard\u00f3n said no. Part of the reason, he said, is that the measure does not require that applicants renounce their existing nationality. \u201cSo even if 150,000 Sephardic Jews apply for citizenship it doesn\u2019t mean they are coming,\u201d he said.Moreover, he said, \u201cthe certainty of knowing this is a huge historical mistake is a feeling shared not only by this government but the whole society.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ukraine\u2019s Hopes Riding on a Chocolatier", "Date": "2014-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 After a leading contender dropped out of Ukraine\u2019s presidential race on Saturday, the hopes of many Ukrainians and their Western supporters are now riding on a man known as the Willy Wonka of Ukraine, the billionaire owner of a chocolate candy company.Petro Olekseyevich Poroshenko, 48, was the highest-profile Ukrainian industrialist to support the street protests that ousted President Viktor F. Yanukovych last month, and has for several weeks led in polls for the May 25 presidential election. Known as a centrist who had previously worked for both pro-Western and pro-Russian governments, he became a strong advocate of integration with Europe after Russia banned imports of his chocolate.On Saturday, the candidate who had been running second in polls, the former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, withdrew from the race, throwing his support behind Mr. Poroshenko and solidifying his lead.The shuffle leaves Yulia V. Tymoshenko, a former prime minister and prisoner under the ousted government, as the remaining credible competitor to Mr. Poroshenko. She had been in third place according to a survey by four Ukrainian polling agencies last week.The former pro-government party, whose association with Mr. Yanukovych makes it a long shot, nominated Mikhail Dobkin, an oligarch with close ties to the former president, on Saturday. Mr. Poroshenko, also known as \u201cthe chocolate king\u201d for his ownership of Roshen, the Ukrainian chocolate manufacturer, won notice during the antigovernment protests last month for climbing onto a backhoe to prevent an angry demonstrator from driving it into police lines.Until then, the man with the beefy face and mop of salt and pepper hair was hardly known for drama.In a country where politicians tend to be flamboyant and boisterous, Mr. Poroshenko carefully weighs his words and speaks in measured, sometimes monotonous technicalities.In fact, political analysts say, his staid manner may be part of his appeal in a country leery of further dramatic change. Mr. Poroshenko might have remained merely a chocolatier with a modest political career if not for Russian actions that started last summer as part of an effort to apply economic pressure on pro-European businessmen to discourage the country from signing a trade deal with the European Union.Russia banned his chocolate, ostensibly on the grounds that it posed health risks beyond the usual ones associated with candy, costing him millions in lost sales. Mr. Poroshenko reacted angrily. Rather than buckle, he financially supported the pro-European Union opposition, and won wide support for it. In an interview in his office in Kiev, he highlighted the economic skills he said he brings from businesses that, aside from sweets, also include media, shipping, agriculture and automobiles, and explained the limits of possible compromise with Russia. \u201cI have experience in how to build up a new investment climate,\u201d he said. \u201cI know how to build zero tolerance to corruption. I know how to build a court system. I know how to create a positive, absolutely new page of Ukrainian history.\u201dFor him to win, he will need to persuade Ukrainians to overlook their wariness of someone who has made a career of combining business with government. A member of Parliament, he is also a former chairman of the national security council and a former minister of foreign affairs and of the economy. He began his political career in 1998 as a legislator loyal to the ruling pro-Russian government, before throwing his support in 2001 behind the opposition politician Viktor Yushchenko, who would rise to power and win the presidency three years later in the pro-democracy Orange Revolution. Though that government became mired in scandal, Mr. Poroshenko remained one of the most prominent and powerful opposition voices in the country. Like other tycoons throughout post-Soviet countries, Ukraine\u2019s capitalized on the flawed privatization of publicly held assets to amass enormous fortunes. Mr. Poroshenko parlayed early profits from consumer goods trading to buy Ukraine\u2019s rundown candy factories for a pittance in the 1990s, and later moved into government positions. \u201cHe bought his way in; that\u2019s the way it works in Ukraine,\u201d said Ivan Lozowy, the director of a policy research group in Kiev, adding that no real evidence of malfeasance had ever come out. Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s reputation as a moderate who has tried to straddle the political divide between the Ukrainian-speaking west and the Russian-speaking east and as an economic modernizer has clearly intrigued Western governments, who have wagered vast sums of money and much national prestige on the proposition that Ukraine\u2019s teetering domestic politics can be stabilized, with a goal of thwarting a threatened Russian invasion and a new war in Europe. Mr. Poroshenko, whose daughter-in-law is Russian, met last week with Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, and his leading position in the race reportedly gave the International Monetary Fund confidence to agree to release an $18 billion aid package.A leading position for a centrist could also elevate the chances of a negotiated resolution with Russia. Secretary of State John Kerry and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of Russia are to meet in Paris on Sunday to try to forge a diplomatic solution to the crisis.Yet even as Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s political ambitions became clear, Russian authorities stepped up their economic pressure against his businesses, just this month raiding and shutting two Roshen chocolate factories in the Russian city of Lipetsk worth $200 million. The problem in finding a resolution with Russia, Mr. Poroshenko said, is that while the Kremlin\u2019s military action in Crimea caused Russians to rally around the flag, it also did the same for Ukrainians, erasing any good will toward Russia. The chances of any candidate who openly endorses Russian proposals winning the election are vanishingly small. Mr. Poroshenko, for all his moderate leanings, flatly rejected Russia\u2019s proposal for the federalization of Ukraine as allowing \u201csomebody in the Russian government trying to tell us what type of governmental system we should have.\u201dHe cited polls showing Ukrainians who viewed Russia positively dropping to 20 percent from 92 percent after the Russian Army invaded Crimea this month. Rather than agreeing to rewrite its Constitution, Mr. Poroshenko said, the Ukrainian government\u2019s response to Russian troops massing on the eastern border should be \u201cif the aggression continues against the rest of the country, the Ukrainian Army will open fire.\u201dStill, he has held up his experience running chocolate factories in Russia, along with his job as foreign minister, as proof he can work with the Russians. In fact, before the Russian ban, his company had bet big on the Russian market, introducing a line of Russian Classic candy bars that revived Soviet brands like the Seagull bar, featuring a Social-Realist style beach scene on the wrapper.videoAdvertisement"}

We will try to go as far as possible.\u201dThe second leg was almost a formality. Zlatan Ibrahimovic and the other senior players hired over the past three years by the Paris club had crushed Leverkusen in Germany, 4-0, in the first leg, and, playing at a training ground tempo that sometimes had all the cut and thrust of a Trappist retreat, it won the second leg, 2-1, at Parc des Princes on Wednesday.Leverkusen is, in a sense, the old German model. Its backing by the pharmaceutical company whose name is in the club\u2019s title has sustained a relatively small town team that has competed with the giants for decades. But P.S.G. is something else.It has been fueled since May 2011 by another set of initials, Q.I.A. \u2014 the Qatar Investment Authority \u2014 whose money has persuaded players of the caliber of Ibrahimovic and the Brazil captain Thiago Silva, the Uruguyan striker Edinson Cavani, the young Italian Marco Verratti and a whole lot more to play in the French league.They don\u2019t just play in it, they dominate it. The two goals on Wednesday, from the head of Brazilian defender Marquinhos and the foot of the Argentine winger Ezequiel Lavezzi, took the Paris club\u2019s tally to 104 goals in 42 games thus far this season.Marquinhos looks a brilliant prospect. He rose head and shoulders above anyone else to head what is already his third Champions League goal. He is 19, and having moved in his short career from Corinthians S\u00e3o Paulo to Roma in Italy, he now stands tall at the side of his national team captain in the French capital.\u201cTonight,\u201d said Marquinhos, \u201cI had a really great night. It feels fantastic to be in the Champions League.\u201dFantastic, and, as gifted players often appear to do, this is a young man who simply seems to be growing into his potential.His header equalized an earlier one by Leverkusen\u2019s splendidly named Sidney Sam. The son of a Nigerian father and German mother, and very much an upcoming German player, Sam stands barely 5-foot-8\u00bd inches tall, or 1.76 meters. But, like Marquinhos, he timed his leap to perfection when he headed in a sweeping first-time cross from the adventurous right back Giulio Donati.There\u2019s the rub for Leverkusen. It already knows that Sam will not be a part of its future because Bayer sold the winger to Schalke during the January trading window, and he will make the switch at the end of the season.That is the normal economics of soccer. You nurture a player, and when the money is right and he wants to go, you sell him.P.S.G. doesn\u2019t operate by the norms of soccer finance. Like Chelsea, like Manchester City, it is the investment project of foreigners who have billions to lavish. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, the chairman of European champion Bayern Munich and also the leader of the European Clubs Association, is worried about the purchasing power of such clubs.\u201cA club like Paris Saint-Germain has a 300-million-euro payroll including taxes,\u201d Rummenigge told Kicker magazine in January, referring to the $418 million payroll. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to finance that. The Bundesliga financial model works very well, we do not spend more than we receive.\u201dRummenigge\u2019s club recorded a turn-over of \u20ac432.8 million in 2013. It is Germany\u2019s giant, able to cherry pick its commercial partners from companies in the most successful economy in Europe.But his complaint, and the implication in his remarks concerning P.S.G., is that the Qatar-French alliance pushes beyond the boundaries of self-sufficiency intended by the new Financial Fair Play rules coming into play. Those rules, set by UEFA, in essence stipulate that clubs must earn their way through soccer-related income.We will see how this pans out. P.S.G. and Manchester City are flooded with petro dollars from Gulf powers. They might contend that they are spending like there is no tomorrow because they are playing catch-up \u2014 their spending to recruit top players is being done over a relatively short time span compared to the Real Madrids, the Bayern Munichs, the Manchester Uniteds that have been established financial kings of the Continent for decades.P.S.G.\u2019s wage structure, as mentioned by Rummenigge, is not the half of it. The club has spent more than half a billion dollars in its three-year Arabian adventure on transfer fees to buy a place in the Champions League.The French league now seems almost a foregone conclusion. Paris is eight points clear at the top (though Bayern Munich is 20 points clear in the Bundesliga).Both can play within themselves in their domestic games.That is one reason why English clubs are finding the pace in the Champions League too demanding at the moment. Another is that as new forces rise, it becomes harder and more expensive for the established European elite to recruit as they would like.Marquinhos, for example, would make a fine pillar in any defense for years to come. He chose Paris \u2014 and from Bayern to Barcelona there is a shortage of genuine central defensive talent.P.S.G. may not win the Champions League this season. But if it keeps recruiting, it will be there in the future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe, Stuck in a Rut", "Date": "2014-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe European financial crisis may have disappeared from the front pages of American newspapers, but the Continent\u2019s economic challenges remain worrisome.Most fundamentally, Europe is mired in a slow-growth rut with little sign of either sensible policy initiatives or the energy to implement them.Ironically, countries like Spain and Ireland that precipitated the crisis have made the most progress, albeit painfully. Wrenching recession, some labor market reforms and widespread unemployment have pushed wages down, allowing these countries to regain a competitive position in world markets. But two of the largest countries that sit squarely at the heart of Europe \u2014 France and Italy \u2014 have dauntingly long economic \u201cto do\u201d lists.For all practical purposes, Italy\u2019s economic health hasn\u2019t improved a whit since the euro crisis hit. Unemployment rose to a record high of 12.9 percent in January. Its economy is smaller than before the 2008 recession and expands only fitfully. Instead of improving its labor productivity, it\u2019s creating an ever larger public sector debt burden. None of that should be surprising, as the country has continued to lurch from prime minister to prime minister, with a 39-year-old local politician, Matteo Renzi, now in charge. His 100-day plan is bold, but in Italy, change historically occurs, if ever, in years or decades.France\u2019s president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, succeeded in achieving change \u2014 but initially in utterly the wrong direction. Hefty tax increases terrified business and the wealthy French, a few of whom decamped to more hospitable tax climes. Foreign direct investment in France plunged 77 percent in 2012.Amid the furor, Mr. Hollande tried to tack toward the center, but the course correction has so far seemed more theoretical than real. For example, the French government recently skirted European Union regulations, injecting more capital into Peugeot only on the condition that the struggling automaker not close plants or eliminate jobs. That\u2019s exactly the opposite of how we brought the American auto industry back to health. In a global world, a manufacturer must be cost-competitive.Nor is Peugeot a unique example. On a recent swing through Europe, I heard a similar story from an investment manager trying to restructure a company, as Peugeot was trying to restructure its operations. The manager was also met with a demand from the government that jobs not be cut. Now Mr. Hollande is pledging to roll back oppressive tax increases, cut government spending and ease suffocating regulations. Little of that has yet happened, and Mr. Hollande suffers with a record-low approval rating.The contrast with France\u2019s archrival, Germany, which is expected to grow at nearly 2 percent in 2014, about double the rate in France, could not be more striking. Germany has done well at making itself competitive, although it\u2019s not perfect. I met with German businessmen who complained that Germany had strayed from rational policy making in the critical area of energy. Two misguided decisions \u2014 to try to make the renewable energy business grow faster than makes economic sense and to accelerate the closing of its nuclear facilities following the Fukushima disaster \u2014 have left Germany with unnecessarily high energy costs and more pollution from burning dirty coal. German businessmen gaze wistfully at the United States with its free-flowing and cheap natural gas.All told, to a visiting American investor trying to assess Europe\u2019s prospects, most of the Continent just doesn\u2019t feel as if it\u2019s on the economic move. What ails its economies is a lack of what keeps the United States \u2014 for all of our problems \u2014 so high on the world\u2019s leader board: flexible labor markets, the culture of innovation, immigration and a relatively light regulatory touch.Meanwhile, of the 34 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the 10 with the highest tax rates on earned income are in Europe. A promised Europe-wide banking supervision plan inches forward. More thorough fiscal integration remains a dream.Implementing the necessary structural reforms is a messy, slow, politically contentious step-by-step process, perversely made more difficult by unperturbed capital markets. Thanks to Mario Draghi\u2019s dramatic statement in July 2012 that the European Central Bank would \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d to prevent a collapse of the euro, bond yields in countries like Italy have been hitting post-crisis lows, thereby removing the most extreme source of pressure for reforms. Some see salvation in more aggressive moves by the E.C.B. Fine \u2014 avoiding deflation is a worthy goal. But recognize that the Federal Reserve\u2019s bond-buying program reduced unemployment by only a smidgen. Europe still must face the need for more fundamental change and not be distracted by those who see a central bank\u2019s printing press as a painless way out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jordan's Urban Refugees", "Date": "2014-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThis past weekend marked the third anniversary of the Syrian uprising against President Bashar al-Assad \u2014 and the outlook is increasingly grim. Peace talks last month in Geneva have left future negotiations uncertain. Syria has failed to meet benchmarks for eliminating chemical weapons and will likely miss a June 30 deadline to destroy its entire arsenal. Violence is intensifying between the regime and the rebels. Through all this, Washington has been intensely focused on Syria\u2019s internal fault lines. But with hundreds of thousands of refugees flooding into Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq, the crisis has swelled far beyond Syria\u2019s borders. It is imperative, then, to start tackling the Syrian spillover now before the situation becomes even worse \u2014 and Jordan is the best place to start.The movement of nearly 600,000 Syrians into Jordan is straining that country\u2019s economy, infrastructure and social services. While international press attention has focused mainly on Jordan\u2019s Zaatari refugee camp, home to approximately 100,000 Syrians, the vast majority of refugees have settled in Jordan\u2019s urban areas, particularly those close to its northern border, like the cities of Mafraq and Ramtha. The increased demand for housing and the influx of subsidies from international NGOs have nearly tripled the cost of rent in these cities, driving many Jordanians from their homes and pushing Syrians further into debt. Jordan\u2019s crowded public schools are being crippled as administrators try to accommodate at least 85,000 refugee students \u2014 still only half of the school-age Syrians now in the country. Local hospitals, sanitation and water systems are being similarly strained. As one young Syrian told me in January, \u201cWe\u2019re making a hard life harder for Jordanians.\u201dIn a country long considered one of the region\u2019s most stable, these socioeconomic problems are worrying enough. But perhaps more alarming, particularly for American interests, is that Jordanians are starting to believe that their government (and the international community) is helping Syrian refugees at their expense. While these tensions have not yet led to riots or widespread violence, local observers fear that this might not last. As one Jordanian security official told me, the refugees may bring Jordan \u201ca new Arab Spring.\u201d Such turmoil would not only be devastating for Jordan, but would deprive the United States of a crucial partner in efforts to resolve the Syrian crisis, repair Iraq and advance an Israeli-Palestinian agreement.To avoid further destabilizing Jordan, Washington and Amman must act now to contain the Syrian spillover. First, both countries must seek out medium- and long-term solutions, shifting their focus from a stopgap emphasis on humanitarian aid to a combination of aid and development assistance. This means, in part, supporting Jordan\u2019s recent request for $4.1 billion from the international community to improve health, education and other public services used by Syrian refugees in urban areas. But such aid should come with demands to better integrate Syrian refugees into the local economy. Jordan must harness the talents of its new, albeit temporary, residents: changing work permits to allow more Syrians to find legal employment, encouraging Syrian refugees to start businesses that hire locals, and allowing international agencies to put Syrians to work on refugee-related projects.These measures may provoke opposition from some Jordanians who are concerned that their country has frequently been a haven for the region\u2019s refugees, including large numbers of Palestinians since Israeli independence in 1948, and Iraqis during the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 American invasion. But Jordan derives significant benefits from the Syrians\u2019 presence, including billions in aid earmarked for solutions to domestic issues that predate the refugee crisis. Integrating Syrians into the local market could help energize the moribund economy, and help shore up the refugees\u2019 self-sufficiency and sense of purpose, preparing them for their return home when the conflict is over.When I visited Jordan earlier this year, every Syrian I spoke with stressed that they had no desire to remain in the country for the long term. Empowering, employing and educating Syrians in the interim ensures that endless Jordanian support won\u2019t be necessary. Of course, the refugee crisis is not Jordan\u2019s responsibility alone. Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq are also part of the equation, and their efforts to provide food, shelter and social services to millions of Syrian refugees remain vital. International support for the millions of displaced persons within Syria must likewise be a focus moving forward, including a redoubling of efforts to establish protected buffer zones, and allocating humanitarian aid to those in de facto refugee camps near the borders. Also critical is the expansion of Syrians\u2019 options for resettlement outside of the Middle East. The United States and its European allies must accept Syrian refugees in much greater numbers. Germany and Sweden have welcomed 18,000 and 14,000 Syrians, respectively; the United Nations has begun pushing to have an additional 30,000 of the country\u2019s most vulnerable refugees \u2014 women and children \u2014 resettled in America and Western Europe. Last month the Obama administration amended immigration rules that had prevented Syrian refugees from resettling in the United States, potentially opening the door to 1,300 Syrian asylum applicants. These steps are commendable but not enough. The United States must open its doors wider and push Canada, Britain and others to follow suit. Jordan\u2019s Syrian refugees are a potent symbol of the Syrian conflict\u2019s debilitating effects throughout the region. Ultimately, a long-term solution will require a negotiated settlement that paves the way for millions of displaced Syrians to return home and rebuild their country. In the meantime, Jordan, the United States and key partner nations must do what\u2019s right for the refugees. If they don\u2019t, it will be impossible to prevent the Syrian war from spilling over and destabilizing the entire Middle East.Advertisement"}

With a wry frankness typical of the book, she writes: \u201cThis is not a story of judgmental zealots thumping pulpits. . . . This is not a story about pious blowhards whose unbending conviction alienated their children \u00adforever.\u201dHustad\u2019s second book \u2014 her first was \u201cHow to Be Useful,\u201d an irreverent career guide for the new economy \u2014 is the story of her childhood as the daughter of itinerant evangelists. Hustad reconstructs the past through a bricolage of interviews, letters, newspaper articles, Bible verses, prayers and anecdotes; the sum effect is a humane portrait of her family and a nuanced exploration into the life of faith.In 1978, the Hustads \u2014 Stan, Karen, Megan and her older sister, Amy \u2014 leave their home in Minneapolis for Bonaire, a small Caribbean island in the Netherlands Antilles, where Stan has secured work at a Christian radio station. Missionary life proves difficult. Stan works the graveyard shift running the station\u2019s generators, while Karen\u2019s attempts to make a home are thwarted by sporadic electricity shortages, contaminated water and resentful locals. Megan and Amy endure skin rashes and struggle to learn Dutch. Their faith sustains them, or at least they think it should: \u201cWe had been led here,\u201d Hustad writes. \u201cThat is the missionary\u2019s position.\u201dAfter five years on Bonaire, Stan is offered another radio job in Europe. The occasion prompts one of the book\u2019s many memorable exchanges. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in a foreign country,\u201d Megan says, to which her mother replies, \u201cThat\u2019s too bad, because you live in one now.\u201d Megan, ever perspicacious, describes Bussum, their new home in the Netherlands, as located in an area that \u201cenjoyed a nationwide reputation as one of the best places to meet snobs.\u201dBut Stan\u2019s work situation soon deteriorates, and the family eventually returns to Minneapolis, where Megan has difficulty identifying with fellow Americans and develops a crisis of faith. By the time she finishes college and moves to New York, she thinks she\u2019s leaving her religious past behind. The New York chapters narrate a familiar tale \u2014 a sense of awe and not belonging, a low-paying publishing job, dating tribulations \u2014 but Hustad distinguishes her experience by hewing to her theme of faith as she wrestles with the city\u2019s secularity. \u201cCities have a bad rap with Christians,\u201d she writes, \u201cbecause they daily let us prove that the human heart\u2019s true desire is to look at one another, not up.\u201dAt times, the book digresses and loses momentum. Letters and conversations appear in full; footnotes, lists, and quotations from Scripture and other sources abound. A thread about her grandparents\u2019 generation feels extraneous, as do attempts to situate the family\u2019s experience within the larger contexts of radio and television evangelism and contemporary religious attitudes. The book\u2019s incisive portraits of its central characters and their environs suggest more about the realities of religious life than do its forays into biblical exegesis or family archives.But those are flaws of ambition, and \u201cMore Than Conquerors\u201d achieves far more than it fails to. Hustad has written a generous and arresting account of an upbringing that might have turned a lesser writer bitter. Late in her memoir, speaking of merciful people, Hustad writes: \u201cTheir effect on us is like the sound of music.

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Statement on New Sanctions Against Russia", "Date": "2014-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTextFollowing is a transcript of President Obama\u2019s announcement of new sanctions in response to Russian actions in Ukraine, as provided by the White House.MR. OBAMA: Good morning, everybody. In recent months, as the citizens of Ukraine have made their voices heard, we have been guided by a fundamental principle -- the future of Ukraine must be decided by the people of Ukraine. That means Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected, and international law must be upheld.And so, Russia\u2019s decision to send troops into Crimea has rightly drawn global condemnation. From the start, the United States has mobilized the international community in support of Ukraine to isolate Russia for its actions and to reassure our allies and partners. We saw this international unity again over the weekend, when Russia stood alone in the U.N. Security Council defending its actions in Crimea. And as I told President Putin yesterday, the referendum in Crimea was a clear violation of Ukrainian constitutions and international law, and it will not be recognized by the international community.Today, I\u2019m announcing a series of measures that will continue to increase the cost on Russia and on those responsible for what is happening in Ukraine. First, as authorized by the executive order I signed two weeks ago, we are imposing sanctions on specific individuals responsible for undermining the sovereignty, territorial integrity and government of Ukraine. We\u2019re making it clear that there are consequences for their actions.Second, I have signed a new executive order that expands the scope of our sanctions. As an initial step, I\u2019m authorizing sanctions on Russian officials -- entities operating in the arms sector in Russia and individuals who provide material support to senior officials of the Russian government. And if Russia continues to interfere in Ukraine, we stand ready to impose further sanctions.Third, we\u2019re continuing our close consultations with our European partners, who today in Brussels moved ahead with their own sanctions against Russia. Tonight, Vice President Biden departs for Europe, where he will meet with the leaders of our NATO allies -- Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. And I\u2019ll be traveling to Europe next week. Our message will be clear. As NATO allies, we have a solemn commitment to our collective defense, and we will uphold this commitment.Fourth, we\u2019ll continue to make clear to Russia that further provocations will achieve nothing except to further isolate Russia and diminish its place in the world. The international community will continue to stand together to oppose any violations of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, and continued Russian military intervention in Ukraine will only deepen Russia\u2019s diplomatic isolation and exact a greater toll on the Russian economy.Going forward, we can calibrate our response based on whether Russia chooses to escalate or to de-escalate the situation. Now, I believe there\u2019s still a path to resolve this situation diplomatically in a way that addresses the interest of both Russia and Ukraine. That includes Russia pulling its forces in Crimea back to their bases, supporting the deployment of additional international monitors in Ukraine, and engaging in dialogue with the Ukrainian government, which has indicated its openness to pursuing constitutional reform as they move forward towards elections this spring.But throughout this process, we\u2019re going to stand firm in our unwavering support for Ukraine. As I told Prime Minister Yatsenyuk last week, the United States stands with the people of Ukraine and their right to determine their own destiny. We\u2019re going to keep working with Congress and our international partners to offer Ukraine the economic support that it needs to weather this crisis and to improve the daily lives of the Ukrainian people.And as we go forward, we\u2019ll continue to look at the range of ways we can help our Ukrainian friends achieve their universal rights and the security, prosperity and dignity that they deserve. Thanks very much. And Jay, I think, will be available for questions. Thank you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nigerians Ask Why Oil Funds Are Missing", "Date": "2014-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAGOS, Nigeria \u2014 Even in a country where untold oil wealth disappears into the pockets of the elite, the oil corruption scheme he was investigating seemed outsize \u2014 and he threatened to lay it bare at a meeting with Nigeria\u2019s top bankers.The rabble-rouser was none other than the governor of the country\u2019s central bank. Weeks later, however, he was out, fired by Nigeria\u2019s president in an episode that has shaken the Nigerian economy, filled newspapers and airwaves here, and even inspired a rare street demonstration.The bankers were going to have to open their books, the governor, Lamido Sanusi, warned them at the recent meeting. He wanted to see where the money was going \u2014 $20 billion from oil sales that, mysteriously, was not making its way to the treasury, in a country that could soon be declared Africa\u2019s biggest economy and already attracts the most direct foreign investment on the continent, according to the United Nations.But his suspicions were cutting too close, Mr. Sanusi said \u2014 too close to an oil-politics nexus that both feeds the political establishment in Nigeria, in his view and that of analysts, and deprives the country of vital revenue.The charge of missing oil money is not new in Nigeria. In recent years, government commissions, parliamentary inquiries and civil society groups have all pointed to serious shortfalls in the disbursement of oil revenues. Their findings have been ignored.This time, the accusations appear not to be going away: Never before has an official at Mr. Sanusi\u2019s level made them.In interviews here, Mr. Sanusi gave a detailed account of the events that he said led to his ouster on Feb. 20, a dismissal that continues to depress the country\u2019s currency and frighten investors. He said his warning to the bankers had been reported straight back to the threatened seat of power in the country\u2019s capital, Abuja.It was too much, he said. With his accusations, which outside analysts consider credible, the soft-spoken, bow-tied central banker appeared to have penetrated to the heart of the country\u2019s entrenched corruption problem.In 2009, Mr. Sanusi took aim at Nigeria\u2019s failing banking sector, shutting down fraudulent banks, uncovering theft that led to an unprecedented conviction, and earning trust in international financial markets. He was named central bank governor of the year by The Banker magazine in 2011, and is a suited-up member of his country\u2019s establishment, as an heir to the position of emir in the ancient northern city of Kano, one of Nigeria\u2019s highest-status designations.Backed by calculations, he presented his findings to a Nigerian Senate committee early in February. \u201cA substantial amount of money has gone,\u201d Mr. Sanusi said in an interview at the mansion reserved for the country\u2019s central banker, which he will soon have to leave. \u201cI wasn\u2019t just talking about numbers. I showed it was a scam.\u201dAt a time when political energy in Africa\u2019s most populous country is focused on next year\u2019s elections \u2014 and staying in power is costly for a governing party that functions as a patronage machine \u2014 Mr. Sanusi knew exactly which interests he had menaced, he said. He had been warned to \u201ccool down.\u201d\u201cBy making N.N.P.C. an issue now, the source of money for financing elections is threatened,\u201d Mr. Sanusi said, referring to the petroleum corporation. \u201cIf this is stopped, there will be no money to finance the elections.\u201dOn the other hand, if it was not stopped, the risk to Nigeria\u2019s economy was grave, the central banker suggested. \u201cIt was critical that we stop this hemorrhage,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, we can\u2019t maintain stability. Reserves had gone way down. We would watch the naira collapse,\u201d he said of the nation\u2019s currency.Alarmed, Mr. Sanusi said, he went in front of Nigeria\u2019s top banking heads for a semimonthly meeting on Feb. 11 and \u201cthreatened to open the books of the bankers, to trace the money.\u201d He suspected some were laundering stolen oil money.\u201cSome of them were not giving information about their accounts,\u201d the central banker said. \u201cI told them I would order a special examination.\u201d One of the bankers at the meeting said, referring to the Central Bank of Nigeria, \u201cHe made it clear to them that the C.B.N. would need to unravel what was going on, and they should cooperate.\u201dMany of the bankers became angry. \u201cOne of us said, \u2018What next?\u2019\u00a0\u201c a second banker said. \u201cThere was a general heaviness. He spoke tough.\u201d Both bankers requested anonymity.Panicked, several of the bankers went straight to the government, Mr. Sanusi said. Two of the bankers \u2014 he would not identify them \u2014 \u201cwent and reported to the petroleum minister,\u201d he said. And at that moment, his days were numbered.\u201cThe strategy of the government was to discredit the messenger,\u201d he said. The Nigerian president \u201cdoesn\u2019t want me to bring out any more information that would get them into trouble.\u201dMr. Sanusi\u2019s account is \u201cuntrue,\u201d a spokesman for President Goodluck Jonathan said.\u201cMr. Sanusi has been making all kinds of claims to project himself as a victim,\u201d the spokesman, Reuben Abati, said in an email, accusing the former bank governor of \u201cfinancial recklessness, abuse of mandate, incompetence and criminal acts of negligence.\u201dMr. Sanusi has not been charged with any crimes, and the most Mr. Jonathan held him responsible for in a series of counteraccusations that emerged after the bank governor raised an alarm over the oil money was having perhaps \u201csidestepped civil-service rules.\u201dOutside analysts appear to be in large agreement that Mr. Sanusi\u2019s claim of vast missing oil revenues is plausible.One such \u201cshortcoming\u201d was laid bare by Mr. Sanusi last month to the parliamentary committee: a phony subsidy on kerosene that he determined to be a racket, costing the Nigerian treasury billions of dollars and greatly benefiting what he called a \u201csyndicate\u201d of marketers and unknown others. Mr. Sanusi showed that any official subsidy on kerosene had long since been abolished, that the petroleum corporation was nonetheless selling kerosene to marketers at less than a third of its purchase price on the international market and that the Nigerian marketers were then selling kerosene to the public at prices 300 to 500 percent above what they had paid for it.\u201cIt\u2019s just a big scam,\u201d Mr. Sanusi said in the interview. \u201cThe amount is shared by a cabal.\u201dThough his official term would have ended in June anyway, Mr. Sanusi said, he is challenging his removal in court. In a judiciary that is only lightly insulated from political pressure, the outcome is uncertain, though perhaps not with the wider public. One of the bankers at the Feb. 11 meeting said: \u201cFor me personally, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with the position he has taken. We are Nigerians. We owe it to this country that things are run properly.\u201dOne of Nigeria\u2019s leading activists, Tunde Bakare, a founder of the pro-democracy organization Save Nigeria Group, said: \u201cThis is going to be tried in the court of public opinion.

{"Headline": "Growth Hurt by Bad Weather, Fed Says", "Date": "2014-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Severe weather held back economic growth in much of the nation from January through early February, according to a Federal Reserve survey. Even so, conditions strengthened in most regions, thanks to slight gains in areas like employment and commercial real estate.Eight of the Fed\u2019s 12 regions reported improved activity, according to the Beige Book survey released Wednesday. The improvement was depicted as \u201dmodest to moderate.\u201dNew York and Philadelphia, two regions hard hit by winter storms and cold, reported a dip in activity attributed to the weather. Retail sales, including auto purchases, were depressed. So was manufacturing. Factories reported power failures and delayed deliveries of supplies.The Beige Book is based on anecdotal reports from businesses and will be considered with other data when the Fed holds its policy-making meeting on March 18 and 19.The report said retail sales had weakened in many districts because of winter storms. Nine of the Fed\u2019s districts \u2014 Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis and Dallas \u2014 reported that the severe weather had hurt factory production and manufacturing sales.When the Fed\u2019s policy makers meet later this month, it will be the first meeting under the new Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, who succeeded Ben S. Bernanke. The widespread expectation is that the Fed will continue to scale back its economic stimulus program.In an appearance before Congress last week, Ms. Yellen said recent data showed some weaker-than-expected gains in consumer spending and job growth. She said the Fed would be watching to see whether the slowdown proved only a temporary blip caused by severe weather. A crucial piece of data likely to influence the Fed\u2019s policy-making meeting will be the release of the February employment report on Friday. Two months of tepid job growth have raised concerns about whether the economy might be losing momentum. The data suggests that the government\u2019s employment report will show only modest gains. Economists forecast it will show that employers added 145,000 jobs last month. That is below the average gains of nearly 205,000 jobs a month in the first 11 months of last year.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, which helped compile the ADP report, said hiring should rebound once the weather improved.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Freelancers Piece Together a Living in the Temp Economy", "Date": "2014-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyLAS VEGAS \u2014 The photos spread out on a coffee table tell the story of a career. In one, a woman wears a fairy costume and rides a flying horse. In another, the woman lounges on a desert rock at sunrise, in a gold bikini draped with red silk. In a third, she wears an Uncle Sam outfit and poses on three-foot stilts.These are photos of Heather Burdette, a Las Vegas entertainer, at work.Not on the table are audition reels from Ms. Burdette\u2019s other career, one in which corporations pay her $500 to $1,000 a day to present their products, including tires and cybersecurity products, at trade shows. It is work for which she wears business attire instead of hot pants. These jobs are lucrative but infrequent.Ms. Burdette knows the trajectory of insecurity. She has worked in Las Vegas as an entertainer since 1996, sometimes in jobs that quickly disappeared. Right now, she is busy. A freelancer since 2008, she works with 30 agents. Some help her book conventions. Others set her up with entertainment jobs. In addition to her presenting, this year she has worked as an astrologer and stilt-walker, and she helped dress fashion models at a mall. She is fortunate to live in a city with huge entertainment and convention industries that rely on temporary workers. \u201cIt\u2019s the land of opportunity,\u201d she said.But as Ms. Burdette gets older, she has no choice but to consider new ways to earn a paycheck. In both of her careers, looks matter. At 43, she knows she cannot do these jobs indefinitely. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of the moments and the things these represent,\u201d she said, touching the photos on her coffee table. One is a profile of her, not in costume, with the words \u201cRemember who you are ... and always keep growing.\u201d This is to inspire her, to encourage her to work on the skills she will need for whatever work will come next. \u201cWhether that means getting a 9-to-5 job and putting on the big-girl pants,\u201d she said, \u201cor whether it just means going into something where people are not looking at me, and I\u2019m not covered in rhinestones every day.\u201dHow many people have temporary work is hard to say. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 14 million people were self-employed last month, including freelancers like Ms. Burdette.There are contingent office workers and factory workers. There are contingent computer programmers and corporate executives. \u201cWe know that temps are everywhere,\u201d Professor Hatton said. Starting with the recession, employers have slashed costs, and a major way to do that has been to lower labor costs. Temporary workers often are paid less than regular employees. Under the Affordable Care Act, companies can avoid health insurance costs by hiring part-time workers (who may qualify for subsidized insurance).\u201cWork has become much more insecure, much more precarious,\u201d he said. \u201cSo everybody is a temporary in one sense, because their levels of job security have really decreased in recent years.\u201d The trick with insecure work, for the worker, is that the next paycheck is unpredictable. For low-income factory temps, being chosen for work can mean the difference between making rent or not making rent, eating well or not eating well. For freelancers like Ms. Burdette, the lack of security can make it hard to buy a house or plan for the future. What if a job comes up? What if it doesn\u2019t? Ms. Burdette is familiar with financial insecurity. She declared bankruptcy in 2005. When she married in 2008, she brought to the marriage a few thousand dollars in credit card debt. She and her husband, Jozef Bobula, met in January and married in May. They were in love, she said, but he also needed a green card for immigration reasons. He\u2019s from Slovakia. Mr. Bobula, 37, is a bass guitarist. He, too, pieces together work in Las Vegas, and is playing a regular gig at the Stratosphere casino. He also has a jazz trio and a duo, plays solo and teaches music.Part of what attracted Ms. Burdette to Mr. Bobula was his ability to manage money. \u201cHe is accustomed to saving first and spending second,\u201d she said.Today, her credit card debt is paid off. Her 2000 Nissan Xterra is paid for. She says the last four years have been her first without debt since she was 18.Ms. Burdette calls her financial situation stable right now. She and her husband, combined, make $55,000 to $75,000 a year. Their apartment is cozy, but comfortable. Ms. Burdette calls the style \u201cCraigslist chic,\u201d because she bought most of her furniture on the resale website. The most valuable things in their apartment are her husband\u2019s guitars.The couple do not have retirement savings, but they do have an emergency fund and are considering investing a portion of it in the stock market. Her husband had the savings account when they married, and they only recently added her name to it. They waited, she said, because they wanted to see if the marriage would last.\u201cTo have my name on it,\u201d she said, \u201cit brought still another level of peace and comfort that I didn\u2019t think could even have existed.\u201d \u201cI can say no to gigs I don\u2019t want to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI can be more discerning. I don\u2019t have to stand around in a showgirl costume if I\u2019m not feeling physically up to it in terms of my appearance.\u201d Ms. Burdette wants to find a new set of gigs in which people are not looking at her quite as closely. She has explored voice-over work, recording audiobooks. She has considered doing more with her astrology experience. She would consider a full-time job, but as a last choice. She said her parents spent years planning and worrying and stressed about the future. \u201cIt didn\u2019t get them any more secure than me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m actually more secure right now, because I understand that the bottom can fall out at any time.\u201d One of her old business cards said, \u201cWhaddya need?\u201d Her current card says, \u201csingularly multitalented.\u201d Under the new health law, which includes a mandate to buy insurance or face a penalty, Ms. Burdette has coverage for the first time in years. \u201cIt does provide people with a cushion,\u201d Professor Kalleberg said, \u201cso that they can search, so that they can look for opportunities.\u201dNow, Ms. Burdette has to figure out what those opportunities will be. Reinvention is a word heard a lot in today\u2019s labor market. Jobs keep changing. People have to change to keep up, especially people without employers that provide training.But many temporary and self-employed workers do not have the money or time to reinvent themselves and their skills. Even if they do, it is not clear which jobs will be available. \u201cThe path ahead is not going to be laid out for you,\u201d Professor Kalleberg said. The advice to reinvent is \u201ceasy to say, sitting in a job that has a fairly clear career path like I do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a difficult situation and it\u2019s stressful.\u201d Figuring out what\u2019s next may be a little easier for Ms. Burdette. She has been doing just that for years.\u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like not to reinvent,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m just used to that.\u201d Adriene Hill is a senior reporter for the public radio program \"Marketplace.\" Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Speculating on Trophy Art", "Date": "2014-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArtLONDON \u2014 Works by contemporary artists born after 1945 generated $17.2 billion in worldwide auction sales last year, a 39 percent increase from 2012, according to figures just released by the French database Artprice. Last November, a triptych by Francis Bacon sold for $142.4 million, a record for any work of art at a public sale. And a handy new website, www.sellyoulater.com, now advises speculators on which hot young artists to buy, sell or \u201cliquidate.\u201dInevitably there\u2019s talk of a bubble. Art is a notoriously volatile investment that has suffered spectacular collapses, as seen in the great Impressionist boom and bust of 1990-91, and in 2008-9, when contemporary works by Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst and other fashionable names halved in value after the fall of Lehman Brothers.\u201cThings are different now,\u201d said Allan Schwartzman, the New York-based art adviser. \u201cThere\u2019s a momentum in the market that\u2019s dictated by the top players. It\u2019s trophy-driven. There are often six competitors for the major lots at auctions, which indicates to me there isn\u2019t a bubble. Contemporary art has never been supported like this before.\u201dOthers feel uneasy about the record prices being paid by billionaires for big-name trophies, as well as the six-figure sums for paintings by hip 20-somethings like Lucien Smith and Oscar Murillo. But how can a market crash when the people now driving its growth are seemingly rich enough to be impervious to the fluctuations of the wider economy? How do their decisions influence smaller buyers? The art market is rife with speculation at the moment, but does that necessarily mean it\u2019s a bubble about to burst? These are the questions on the minds of many in the art world in early 2014.\u201cIn 2007 we were definitely in a bubble,\u201d said Howard Rachofsky, a Dallas-based collector. \u201cThen after the break it got globalized. The market attracted the attention of international players who are interested in art as another asset and they\u2019ve got huge reserves.\u201dFor instance, last week, at the Art14 contemporary fair in London, Citi Private Bank hosted a gathering of private museums from 16 countries. The super rich have grown in number and wealth. The world had a record 2,170 billionaires with a combined net worth of $6.5 trillion in 2013, according to the inaugural Wealth-X and UBS Billionaire Census. In the United States, research from the University of California, Berkeley, has shown that the wealthiest 1 percent has captured 95 percent of the country\u2019s economic growth since 2009. Those with tens of millions in disposable cash are looking for alternatives to the stock markets, be it luxury apartments in London or Gerhard Richter abstracts.\u201cEnormous amounts of money have backstopped at the top of the system among a relatively small group of people,\u201d said Todd Levin, the New York-based art adviser. Still, art is a relatively small sector of the global economy \u2014 total dealer and auction sales were estimated at 43 billion euros, or $59 billion, in 2012, according to the European Fine Art Foundation (the 2013 figure will be announced next week). It therefore takes only a tiny minority of the world\u2019s richest 1 percent to spend a small proportion of its wealth to have a disproportionate effect on such a niche market.\u201cRight now, they\u2019ve decided that art is a good place to put their money,\u201d said Mr. Levin, who, on behalf of a client, was among at least five bidders competing for Bacon\u2019s \u201cThree Studies of Lucian Freud\u201d at over $100 million. Unprecedented auction prices have paid for trophies by blue-chip artists such as Bacon ($142.4 million), Richter ($37.1 million), Jean-Michel Basquiat ($48.8 million) and Andy Warhol ($105.4 million) within the last 12 months. Some are questioning the sustainability of this bull market. \u201cThe global art market is currently held hostage by the very top end of the market (works sold above $10 million) as well as the taste and wealth of a relatively small number of individuals,\u201d said ArtTactic, an art market research company based in London, in an \u201cOutlook\u201d report published earlier this month subtitled \u201cA 10-year-old bubble about to become even bigger.\u201d ArtTactic said the apex of the market was dominated by about 150 individuals with the resources to pay $20 million for a single work of art.\u201cThese prices are being driven by excess cash,\u201d said Anders Petterson, the founder of ArtTactic. \u201cThe wealthy get a lot of social prestige out of buying these works. But if prices rise too much, this clique could lose interest and move on to something else, and if they lose interest, a lot of other people would lose interest as well.\u201dFor the moment, high prices are acting as a stimulus program for wealthy sellers at the expense of auction-house profits. Last week, Sotheby\u2019s announced net annual income of $130 million, or 2.1 percent, on record total sales of $6.3 billion in 2013. (Equivalent profit figures are not available from Christie\u2019s and Phillips, which are privately owned.) Thanks to cutthroat competition for consignments, owners of high-value works like Jeff Koons\u2019s \u201cCracked Egg (Magenta)\u201d sculpture \u2014 sold by Damien Hirst for 12.5 million pounds, or $21 million, plus \u00a31.6 million in buyer\u2019s fees at Christie\u2019s in London on Feb. 13 \u2014 are not charged sellers\u2019 commissions and are usually given some of the extra paid by buyers. The auction houses instead have to make money out of lots in the $50,000 to $5 million range, for which they charge double-digit fees to both the seller and the buyer. This in turn squeezes the profitability of middle-range works that don\u2019t enjoy trophy status.At Sotheby\u2019s on Feb. 12, for example, the 1984 Basquiat painting \u201cWater-worshipper\u201d sold below estimate for a hammer price of \u00a32.15 million; it had been bought by its seller for \u20ac2.4 million at an auction in Paris in 2010.The bargaining power of today\u2019s richest investor-collectors makes it more difficult for the auction houses, and the bulk of their sellers, to turn a profit, thereby putting further pressure on the skin of what may or may not be a bubble. \u201cIt used to be said the air was thin at the top of the market,\u201d said Mr. Schwartzman. \u201cNow it\u2019s thin in the middle.\u201d Advertisement"}

RUSCETTA changed careers for the first time when she had children. A theater major who bounced between acting gigs in her 20s, Ms. Ruscetta took the kind of leap that overachieving city dwellers often fantasize about: She and her then husband moved to Montana and opened a horse farm and riding school.Fifteen years later, Ms. Ruscetta \u2014 who was an active volunteer in her children\u2019s classrooms and then helped home-school them \u2014 was going through a divorce. Time for another career switch.She figures this career will stick. \u201cI\u2019ll probably be working until I\u2019m 85,\u201d she said.Teaching, with the draw of doing good, the steady (if unspectacular) paychecks, summers off and solid pension benefits, has long been perceived as a durable second \u2014 or third \u2014 career.But in the last five years, the profession has taken a number of hits. The economic downturn led to layoffs across the country\u2019s school districts. The total number of jobs in public schools remains about 345,000 below its 2008 peak, according to Labor Department figures. What\u2019s more, a series of changes to academic standards, threats to tenure and an overhaul of the way teachers are evaluated have all contributed to turbulence in public education, with teachers, unions and some parents\u2019 groups pushing back. Some cities and states are debating whether they can guarantee the kinds of generous public pensions they have in the past. Still, the idea of shaping young minds remains attractive, and with the economy slowly improving, school districts are hiring again. And as many as a million teachers could retire in the next four to six years, the federal Department of Education says.For a late starter taking the first step toward a teaching certification, the candidate\u2019s college major may dictate options, since most states require that teachers demonstrate content knowledge in their subjects. Elementary teachers gain more general credentials, so there is more flexibility there. Poor districts are more likely to be hiring. \u201cThere tends to be higher turnover in those districts,\u201d said Segun Eubanks, director of teacher quality at the National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union. Even in more affluent and suburban school districts, said Mr. Eubanks, the highest areas of need are for teachers of special education, English as a second language, and math and science. In many states, some college-level work in the subject a candidate plans to teach is required for certification. Others require candidates to pass content knowledge exams.While more traditional teacher education programs offer more time to prepare, other routes pair brief training with a learn-on-the-job approach. More traditional programs charge tuition and generally require taking some time off from paid work to attend classes, although online options are also available. Fees range from a little less than $6,500 in California\u2019s state university system to as high as $54,000 for a master\u2019s degree from Teachers College, which generally takes two years, including student teaching assignments. Admission to the program, including mentoring and observation throughout the school year, is selective. About 13 percent of applicants were selected last year. \u201cWe think about training these folks like they are pro athletes,\u201d said Ana Menezes, a vice president who oversees the training programs. Teach for America also occasionally takes on a seasoned career switcher. As with the Teaching Fellows program, candidates spend five or six weeks training over the summer. The program covers room and board, but does not pay a salary during this period. In the fall, corps members are placed in paid positions in neighborhood schools or charter schools, most in poor areas. Scott Graham, 49, a retired Air Force chief master sergeant, first laughed when his daughter, then a Teach for America corps member in San Antonio, suggested he try the program, too. He applied and was sent to Houston three years ago for summer training. \u201cWhen I was living in a dorm with all these young kids, I was like, \u2018Oh my gosh, what have I gotten myself into?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Graham recalled. He now works in a middle school in San Antonio, where he helps students with discipline problems. Although two decades older than many of his peers, he shares their drive: He is training to be a school administrator.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Metro-North to Study Whether Surge in Riders Affected Railroad\u2019s Safety", "Date": "2014-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast year, the Metro-North Railroad\u2019s three main lines achieved their highest ridership ever, carrying nearly 82 million passengers as suburban growth and a stronger regional economy helped fuel unprecedented demand.The task now, officials said, is to determine whether the two trends are related.\u201cThat\u2019s a fantastic problem to have,\u201d he said of the mushrooming demand.He paused a beat and added, \u201cIf you\u2019re a well-run railroad.\u201d\u201cPeople who are incompetent need to be shown the door,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said.Detailing an entrenched culture in which a zealous push for punctuality often trumped safety, the report described a railroad fraying even as it increased the number of trains in operation to meet ridership demands.Employees said the operations control center pressured them \u201cto rush when responding to signal failures,\u201d according to the report, and with more trains running, \u201cthe time allotted to complete routine, federally mandated signal testing has been significantly reduced.\u201dOther workers said they struggled to secure track time to perform needed repairs.According to Metro-North, the average number of total weekday trains on its New Haven, Harlem and Hudson lines has increased by nearly 15 percent since 2004, rising to 690 last year. In 2012, the three lines ran an average of 652 trains on weekdays.\u201cAt some point, this culture turned into one of, \u2018How many trains can we get in there and how fast can those trains get in there?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Giulietti said.Joseph C. Szabo, the federal agency\u2019s administrator, wondered whether capacity constraints had compelled Metro-North to \u201csqueeze 11 pounds into a 10-pound gunny sack.\u201dAn inquiry into Metro-North, known as Operation Deep Dive, was prompted by the fatal derailment on Dec. 1 of a Hudson line train in the Bronx that killed four passengers and injured more than 70 others.The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates Metro-North, cautioned that the addition of trains to a schedule was not inherently unsafe. The more significant factor, the authority said, was how train runs were arranged to allow tracks to be shut down for maintenance.In recent months, officials said, the railroad has begun shifting some track work to overnight slots, when ridership is far lower.Some rail experts have argued that the most essential changes are technological, not cultural. According to federal law, the authority must by 2015 install a system known as positive train control, which can dictate speeds and slow trains around sharp curves like the one at the site of the December derailment.The transportation authority has said it intends to install the system but has called the technology \u201cuntested and unproven\u201d for commuter systems as large and complex as Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road, which it also oversees, suggesting the railroads might miss the deadline.In part because the federal agency had never before conducted such a sweeping review of a passenger railroad, it is unclear how many of the problems described in the report might be found on other transit systems.But Mr. Szabo expressed confidence that the Long Island Rail Road, for instance, did not appear to have the \u201cdepths of challenges found at Metro-North.\u201dRobert E. Paaswell, a former executive director of the Chicago Transit Authority, said he was particularly dismayed that workers had been told to hurry while addressing signal failures.\u201cYou never tell anybody to rush,\u201d Mr. Paaswell said.Some safety measures initiated by Metro-North since the December crash have already slowed commute times; others proposed by federal authorities could affect travel even more.Among other changes, Metro-North has already modified its signal system to enforce speed limits at certain locations and agreed to begin using a confidential \u201cclose call reporting system,\u201d which allows employees to report safety concerns anonymously.Owing largely to the number of service disruptions last year, its on-time performance was its worst since the 1990s.Though there are no plans for inquiries of this scale into other railroads, Mr. Szabo said that some \u201cminidives\u201d would be conducted. After the Metro-North report, he said, the lessons for other systems should be clear: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be next.\u201dMarc Santora contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Far-Right Party Stirs Municipal Elections in France", "Date": "2014-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The far right National Front party was poised to make a strong showing in the first round of French municipal elections held on Sunday, showing that the party is thriving on France\u2019s moribund economy and broad dissatisfaction with the two main parties.It remains unclear whether these results will translate into the National Front\u2019s control of more than a couple of cities, though that would still be a gain because it currently does not control any. Under France\u2019s election system, a second round will be held next Sunday in all races except those in which a candidate won more than 50 percent of the vote in Sunday\u2019s balloting.By late Sunday, preliminary results were available from the Interior Ministry for many departments in France, but not for its most populous cities where vote counting was still underway. Even in places where there was not yet an official result and only exit polling was available, the two main parties did not dispute that the National Front had generally done better than expected.Corinne Narassiguin, the national secretary of the governing Socialist Party, said on France 24, a news channel, that it \u201cwas not surprising\u201d that the leading party would lose seats \u201cin what is essentially a midterm election.\u201d President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is the Socialist Party\u2019s standard-bearer.In the Paris mayoral race, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, the more conservative candidate who represents the Union for a Popular Movement party, was leading narrowly, though neither she nor Anne Hidalgo, the Socialist Party candidate, were close to 50 percent and not all the votes had been counted.Both have promised to clean up Parisian pollution, improve the urban environment with parks and recreation centers and make the city more secure. Ms. Hidalgo is strongly supported by the Socialist Party and a network of unions, while Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet is something of a renegade within her party, trying to push it toward the center.Nationwide, the results of the first round were seen as a barometer of French voters\u2019 displeasure with the two main parties. Mr. Hollande, in particular, is the most unpopular of any French president in 30 years, while the U.M.P. was previously led by former President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is now embroiled in scandals along with several other prominent party members, including the Popular Movement\u2019s current leader.Nonetheless the U.M.P. won control or was leading in several cities of more than 100,000 while the Socialist Party was losing in several former strongholds.\u00a0Voting turnout in early estimates hovered around 61 percent, a slip from the roughly 65 percent turnout in the 2008 municipal elections, according to exit poll estimates. The low turnout appeared to be a major factor benefiting the National Front, whose voters are more energized and engaged than those of the mainstream parties.Late Sunday, National Front candidates were leading in a half dozen medium-sized cities of more than 10,000, mostly in the south, and winning outright in H\u00e9nin-Beaumont in northern France, the home of Marine Le Pen, the party\u2019s leader.\u201cThis is the end of the two party nature of politics in France,\u201d said Ms. Le Pen on TF 1, a private television channel.

{"Headline": "In Beijing Talk, Michelle Obama Extols Free Speech", "Date": "2014-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 On a visit that was supposed to be nonpolitical, Michelle Obama delivered an unmistakable message to the Chinese on Saturday, saying in an address here that freedom of speech, particularly on the Internet and in the news media, provided the foundation for a vibrant society.On the second day of a weeklong trip to China with her two daughters and her mother, Mrs. Obama, the first lady, spoke to an audience of Americans and Chinese at Peking University, and in the middle of an appeal for more American students to study abroad, she also talked of the value for people of hearing \u201call sides of every argument.\u201d\u201cTime and again, we have seen that countries are stronger and more prosperous when the voices and opinions of all their citizens can be heard,\u201d she said.The United States, she said, respected the \u201cuniqueness\u201d of other cultures and societies. \u201cBut when it comes to expressing yourself freely,\u201d she said, \u201cand worshiping as you choose, and having open access to information \u2014 we believe those are universal rights that are the birthright of every person on this planet.\u201dThe forthright exposition of the American belief in freedom of speech came against a backdrop of broad censorship of the Internet by the Chinese government. The government polices the Internet to prevent the nation\u2019s 500 million users from seeing antigovernment sentiment, and blocks a variety of foreign websites, including Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The authorities compel domestic Internet sites to censor themselves.Criticism of China\u2019s top leadership is quickly deleted and is considered to be of particular concern to the censors. Obliquely, Mrs. Obama drew attention to this by making a comparison with the situation she and President Obama face in the United States.\u201cMy husband and I are on the receiving end of plenty of questioning and criticism from our media and our fellow citizens,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not always easy, but we wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything in the world.\u201dThe White House has stressed that Mrs. Obama\u2019s trip to China during the spring break of her daughters, Malia and Sasha, is intended to highlight the importance of education, and foreign exchanges in particular.Mrs. Obama appeared at the Stanford University complex at Peking University, where she spoke to an audience of several hundred American students studying in China and some Chinese students who had studied in the United States. The president of Peking University, Wang Enge, welcomed her, and the new American ambassador to China, Max Baucus, who is a graduate of Stanford and its law school, also spoke.On Friday, Mrs. Obama visited the elite Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal University, where, along with the Chinese student body, 30 Americans study, most of whom are from private schools in the United States and pay $50,000 annually in tuition. One of the American students in the program came from the Sidwell Friends School in Washington, which Malia and Sasha attend.But in her speech, Mrs. Obama said that study abroad should not be just the preserve of the rich. \u201cToo many students never have this chance, and some that do are hesitant to take it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may feel like study abroad is only for wealthy students, or students from certain kinds of universities.\u201dOthers ask how useful study in a foreign country would be to their lives, Mrs. Obama said. In reality, study abroad is vital for people who want to participate in a world in which countries and economies are increasingly interconnected, she said.During his visit to China in 2009, Mr. Obama announced a program, called 100,000 Strong, that was devised to send more American students to China.But the effort struggled under the auspices of the State Department and was recently transformed into a nonprofit foundation based at American University in Washington in an attempt to encourage more funding and attract more students.About 200,000 Chinese students are enrolled in institutions in the United States, according to the State Department. About 20,000 American students are studying in China, the department says.The president of the 100,000 Strong Foundation, Carola McGiffert, said recently that a lack of knowledge about China among students in the United States stopped some from considering China as an option for study abroad.In an informal session with students after her speech, Mrs. Obama said that fear was often an inhibitor to studying abroad.Life is about \u201cnot letting fear be your guide,\u201d she told the students who participated in a videoconference between the Stanford campus in California and the campus in Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Strike Illustrates Shift in Labor Landscape", "Date": "2014-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside AsiaSHANGHAI \u2014 A wildcat strike at an IBM factory in southern China illustrates the way tectonic shifts in the country\u2019s labor market are emboldening workers to take matters into their own hands, increasing risks for multinationals.More than 1,000 workers walked off the job last week at the IBM factory in Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, where managers had announced the terms of the factory\u2019s transfer to new ownership under the Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group.Lenovo agreed in January to pay $2.3 billion for IBM\u2019s low-end server business.The strike, which continued into Sunday, fits a growing pattern of industrial activism that has emerged as China\u2019s economy has slowed. A worsening labor shortage has shifted the balance of power in labor relations, while smartphones and social media have helped workers organize and made them more aware than ever of the changing environment, experts said.\u201cChinese workers, after being exploited for so long, are now more and more aware of their rights and united,\u201d said Duan Yi, a labor lawyer. \u201cThey have more of an idea of collective action.\u201dA report by the advocacy group China Labor Bulletin said last month that it had tallied 1,171 strikes and protests from the beginning of June 2011 to the end of December 2013.Many worker protests during that time in Guangdong Province, a manufacturing hub where the IBM server factory is located, were set off by the closing, merging or relocation of factories.In November, hundreds of employees stopped work at a Nokia factory in Dongguan, near Shenzhen, complaining of changes after Nokia\u2019s sale of its mobile phone business to Microsoft.Mr. Duan is seeking arbitration for a group of 70 Nokia workers who were laid off at the time.Last August, 5,000 workers in Shandong Province went on strike to protest Apollo Tyres\u2019s proposed $2.5 billion acquisition of the United States company Cooper Tire & Rubber. The deal was eventually scuttled and Cooper reported this month that the work stoppage in China had cut operating profit by $29 million in the third quarter.The labor shortage has pushed up wages and impelled employers to cast a wide net to find employees and to enhance benefits to retain them. Workers have gained leverage.\u201cWorkers know they have greater power,\u201d said Geoffrey Crothall, a China labor expert with China Labor Bulletin.IBM said last week that the terms offered to the workers at the International System Technology Company factory in Shenzhen were \u201ccomparable in aggregate to what they currently are receiving\u201d and that severance packages would be \u201cequitable.\u201dLenovo has declined to comment.Technology has helped China\u2019s workers. When the Nokia factory employees took to the street, they organized through the online chat system QQ and other social media.In the IBM case, the workers had all read about prior strikes, including Nokia\u2019s, and suspected ahead of time that they might have to take a similar stand, said a 28-year-old worker surnamed Chen who has worked there for three years and who is on strike.\u201cWe were basically prepared and expected in advance there wouldn\u2019t be a good deal,\u201d he said by telephone from Shenzhen. He declined to allow his full name to be published out of concern that he might face repercussions.In both cases \u2014 and many others, experts say \u2014 the impetus for a strike was underpinned by derision for the factory branch of the state-backed union.Independent unions are banned in China. The state-backed All-China Federation of Trade Unions and its affiliates have a reputation for being ineffectual and often siding with management.\u201cBecause there\u2019s no real channel of communication at these workplaces, just about the only thing the workers can do is go out on strike and demand that management address their grievances,\u201d Mr. Crothall said. \u201cIn most cases the union plays no positive role, and sometimes it\u2019s even a negative role.\u201dMr. Chen, the striking IBM factory worker, had stronger words.\u201cThe union exists in name only. It\u2019s useless,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italian Leader Offers Plan to Fix Economy", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a televised news conference, Mr. Renzi stood beside a large photograph of a grocery cart filled with food, a prop intended to demonstrate his promise to deliver tax cuts to workers who earn less than $2,100 a month. He said the government would also provide $3.6 billion in tax cuts to businesses, while also investing about $5 billion in renovating schools.\u201cIt is the state that is tightening its belt here,\u201d Mr. Renzi said. \u201cWe are not taxing anyone else.\u201d Over all, Italy\u2019s economy contracted by 1.8 percent in 2013, and unemployment is above 12 percent. Record numbers of businesses have closed or gone bankrupt.Italy\u2019s economy is the Continent\u2019s third-largest, and European officials have sharply criticized the failure of Italian politicians to address the country\u2019s high public debt, lack of competitiveness, and administrative inefficiencies. Last week, Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said the European Union was downgrading its outlook for the Italian economy and urged \u201cdecisive and urgent policy action and a strong commitment to reform.\u201dIn Italy, where austerity policies are deeply unpopular, Mr. Renzi has been jousting with unions and business leaders over how best to improve the economy. Union leaders had threatened to strike if all of the tax cuts did not flow solely to workers, while industrial lobbyists said the only way to encourage new hiring was to reduce the labor taxes assessed on businesses.Hours before Mr. Renzi\u2019s news conference, the lower house of Parliament passed an electoral overhaul that the new prime minister had promoted as a way to break the political gridlock in the country. Italy\u2019s highest court has ruled that many of the country\u2019s voting laws are unconstitutional. Mr. Renzi\u2019s legislation \u2014 which he brokered with the opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister \u2014 is designed to help bigger parties and larger coalitions win the majorities needed to govern.But the legislation must now go before the Senate, where its fate is uncertain. Mr. Renzi also wants to amend the Constitution to turn the Senate into a regional assembly with much reduced powers, though that legislation is expected to take a year or longer.\u201cWe are all aware of the fact that we have to do everything we can,\u201d said Alessia Mosca, a lawmaker in the lower house and a member of Mr. Renzi\u2019s Democratic Party. \u201cWe have only this chance now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sweet Smell of Money for Plumbers", "Date": "2014-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile working underneath a house, Joseph Rosenblum, a plumber in training in northwest Arkansas, confronted a skunk and discovered a talent that he previously hadn\u2019t been aware of: crawling very quickly.\u201cAt least its tail wasn\u2019t facing me,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI had a little bit of a chance to get out of there before I got sprayed.\u201dSmelly creatures, sewage baths and late-night emergency calls to fix broken pipes are all part of the mix in Mr. Rosenblum\u2019s line of work. But the potential to earn a good living, doing a job he finds rewarding, outweighs the drawbacks, Mr. Rosenblum, 34, said. He figures that if he works hard, he can earn from $50,000 to $70,000 a year or even more, once he is fully licensed.\u201cI know plumbers that make $80,000, $90,000 a year,\u201d he said in a recent interview, after spending an afternoon clearing a clogged drain at a restaurant.Turns out there may be something to the advice your meddling uncle gave you at your high school graduation, about skipping college and becoming a plumber instead. Plumbers and the related trades of pipe fitters and steamfitters, who often work in commercial and industrial settings, earned median pay of about $49,000 a year nationally, well above the $35,000 average for all occupations, according to 2012 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The top 10 percent earn more than $84,000 a year. The average in big markets like Chicago and New York is about $70,000. (One caveat: The statistics are gathered from employers subject to paying unemployment insurance, so they don\u2019t include the roughly 11 percent of plumbers who are self-employed.)Demand for plumbers and fitters is strong. The number employed is expected to grow 21 percent by 2022, versus 11 percent across all occupations, according to Labor Bureau statistics. Mr. Rosenblum also reasons that plumbers have a fair degree of job security: \u201cNo matter how technologically advanced the world gets, plumbing is going to be kind of a basic necessity,\u201d he said.Even former Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York, a billionaire who knows a few things about making money, told listeners to his weekly radio show last spring that working as a plumber makes more financial sense for some students than attending an elite, four-year college: \u201cBeing a plumber, actually for the average person, probably would be a better deal, because you don\u2019t spend four years spending 40, 50 thousand dollars tuition, and no income,\u201d he said. While they needn\u2019t have a college degree, most plumbers must undergo years of training to become fully licensed. Requirements vary by state, but prospective plumbers typically spend four to five years as paid apprentices, while also taking classroom instruction in skills like reading blueprints. Then they must pass an exam to obtain a license. Apprentices typically must be at least 18 and have a high school diploma, or the equivalent, to begin training.They also must have a decent grasp of math, especially if they\u2019re working on new construction; they may need to calculate, for instance, the volume of liquids that certain pipes can carry and correctly measure the length of pipe needed for a job.In some cases \u2014 like Mr. Rosenblum\u2019s \u2014 the company that hires a prospective plumber sponsors the classroom training. Alternatively, trainees may join the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing & Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States, Canada and Australia, the major trade union for plumbers. About 30 percent of plumbers and pipe fitters belong to unions, according to unionstats.com, a website that estimates union membership based on federal data. The United Association, with 300 local affiliates in 50 states, provides training programs and acts as an employment hub, matching members with jobs at companies that negotiate contracts with the union. John Murphy, business manager of United Association Local 1 in New York City, said the local\u2019s 6,000 members worked primarily on major construction projects, like office towers and hospitals. Union apprentices at Local 1 start at $14 an hour and make more than $50 per hour after completing a five-year apprenticeship and passing a test to advance to journeyman plumber status, Mr. Murphy said. Experienced plumbers can make $200,000 a year, he said \u2014 but that typically means many hours on the job. Openings for apprenticeships tend to vary with the economy; if the outlook calls for significant new construction, more openings occur. Local 1 tries to maintain its apprentices at about 20 percent of its active membership, he said. The union makes 1,000 applications available about every two years, he said, and about 400 applicants are deemed qualified after taking a basic aptitude test and an assessment of manual dexterity. The union draws from that pool for new apprentice classes. Also, a certain number of apprentices come from \u201cdirect entry\u201d programs, he said, like those promoting the hiring of veterans. Over the last 18 months, the local has accepted 275 new apprentices.While historically sons of plumbers often became plumbers, family members don\u2019t get special preference, said Mr. Murphy, a fourth-generation plumber. \u201cMy son would have to get on line, along with everyone else.\u201d Plumbing is still a male-dominated trade; just 1.1 percent of plumbers and those in related trades are women, according to 2013 data from the Labor Bureau.Some union locals have programs to encourage women to become apprentices. United Association 1 in New York works with Nontraditional Employment for Women, which aims to bring women into the construction trades, to hire women as apprentices, said Mr. Murphy. The local has 39 female apprentices, 22 of whom joined in the past 18 months.Mr. Rosenblum, who chose the nonunion training route, is a fourth-year apprentice; he expects to take the test for his journeyman\u2019s license in the spring. A native of tiny Greers Ferry, Ark., he spent time as a young man helping his grandfather build houses. He graduated from high school in 1998 and later enlisted in the Marine Corps. After completing a nine-month tour in Iraq and Kuwait in 2004, he moved to California and completed an associate degree under the G.I. bill. He worked for about six years as the director of property services for an apartment company that managed 5,000 units in Orange County, but then moved on to work for a friend who owned a plumbing company. (Under California\u2019s rules, he said, individual plumbers do not have to be licensed, as long as they are working for a licensed plumber.) He found he enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of plumbing. Most anybody, he said, can learn how to change an angle stop \u2014 the little shut-off valve found under every sink \u2014 or replace a flapper in their toilet tank. \u201cBut knowing actually how plumbing works and, you know, determining issues and plumbing problems, that\u2019s kind of one of the things I like to specialize in,\u201d he said. About a year ago, he became engaged to a California woman who had family back in his home state, and they decided to move to Arkansas. He researched plumbing companies online and after sending out few applications was hired at Allied Plumbing & Drain Service, a company in Springdale, Ark.Mr. Rosenblum was taking a bit of a risk; under the rules in Arkansas, his plumbing experience in California wouldn\u2019t necessarily count toward licensing requirements. Fortunately, he said, he had good documentation of three and a half years of work, so state authorities required that he complete just one year of training and instruction to become eligible to take the journeyman\u2019s test. He was accepted at an apprenticeship program at NorthWest Arkansas Community College in Bentonville, Ark., and attends classes one night a week. Once he passes the journeyman\u2019s test and works for an additional year, he\u2019ll be eligible to apply to take the exam for a master plumber\u2019s license. That means he\u2019ll be able to obtain work permits on his own and also will be able to train new plumbers. \u201cAt that point in time, you can basically do anything a plumber needs to get done,\u201d he said.Dan Mallory, 56, founder and president of Allied Plumbing and Mr. Rosenblum\u2019s boss, starts apprentices at $10 to $12 an hour and pays for their training; their hourly wage can increase to as much as $18 an hour over four years. Once they pass their journeyman\u2019s test, he said, they are eligible for commissions based on the cost of the assignments they complete, which gives them the opportunity to make more money. A few of his plumbers earn six-figure incomes, he said, but a typical workweek is around 50 hours, and the jobs are often physically demanding. His plumbers take turns being on call overnight and on weekends and often work outside in bitterly cold weather. After four years, his plumbers can make a very good income as long as they don\u2019t \u201chave a mind-set of working 8 to 5,\u201d he said. Mr. Mallory still goes out on calls himself because, he says, he enjoys the work. He began working for a plumber in Oklahoma as a teenager and passed the state\u2019s equivalent of the master plumber test at age 20 \u2014 he was told he was one of the youngest in the state to pass the test at the time.He recalls working 100 hours a week, until his schedule strained his marriage and forced him to cut back. He later became a home builder, but he said he returned to plumbing when he had trouble finding enough plumbers to work on the houses he was building. He built Allied into a regional company and employs 15 plumbers and apprentices. His company does new construction work and service plumbing, responding to residential and commercial customers. Doing both helps the company ride out the ups and downs of the economy. \u201cIf you\u2019re a service plumber,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s pretty much recession-proof.\u201dStill, there\u2019s no avoiding the downsides, including the potential for encountering raw sewage. Mr. Rosenblum said he wore gloves as much as possible on the job and made sure his immunizations were up-to-date to avoid becoming ill. Sometimes, \u201cit\u2019s just nasty,\u201d he said. And the unpredictable work hours are another negative. \u201cYou can\u2019t just drop your pipe wrench and say \u2018O.K., it\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock, I\u2019m going home,\u2019 and they still don\u2019t have water to their house,\u201d he said. But Mr. Rosenblum, who typically gets going with a 5:30 a.m. workout at the gym, says long days don\u2019t faze him, and more hours mean more income. He also plans to complete a business degree at a local university to fully prepare for his career.\u201cIf you\u2019re just a guy that goes in and puts in your 40 hours a week, you\u2019re going to make minimal salary,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you put in a little extra time and a little extra work, you\u2019re going to do well.\u201dIt may (or may not) help homeowners on the receiving end of pricey plumbing bills that Mr. Rosenblum said he often felt bad when toting up the cost of a repair, especially in tough economic times.\"I hate to be the bearer of bad news when it comes to my customers,\" he said, especially since having water and proper drainage is a necessity. It\u2019s hard, he said, to present someone with a bill for $150 or $200, when they might be tight on cash. But, \"at the end of the day, they called me out, and they need to get it done,\" he said.

{"Headline": "Obama and Allies Seek Firm, United Response as Russia Grips Crimea", "Date": "2014-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE HAGUE \u2014 As Russia consolidated its hold on Crimea, raising its flag over seized military bases and detaining ousted Ukrainian commanders on Sunday, President Obama and his international allies prepared to meet here in an effort to develop a strong, united response despite their diverging interests in dealing with the Kremlin.A central question seems to be whether Western unity is more than a veneer of principled language and so-far mild sanctions, which, in the absence of any hint of a military response, has made the West seem powerless.\u201cIt will expose the limitations within the European Union,\u201d said Michael J. Geary, an assistant professor of modern Europe at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, noting that the bloc needs consensus among 28 member states that have disparate ways of dealing with Russia.NATO and the European Union have been shocked but seem galvanized by Russia\u2019s abrupt abandonment of the rules of cooperation and territorial integrity that have governed East-West relations for decades. On Sunday, NATO\u2019s top military commander warned that Russia had a \u201cvery, very sizable and very, very ready\u201d force on Ukraine\u2019s eastern border, Reuters reported.As the West has struggled to respond cohesively, Russia has moved assertively to establish control in Crimea. On Sunday, a base in Belbek was eerily quiet just 24 hours after it was seized in a dramatic incursion by Russian special-forces troops and two armored vehicles.A commander of the base, Yuli Mamchur, was apparently being held along with other base leaders in Sevastopol, somewhere near the headquarters of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, said his wife, Larisa Mamchur. She added that most Ukrainian personnel there had been sent home to pack and prepare for relocation to mainland Ukraine.\u201cThe people are crying,\u201d Ms. Mamchur said. \u201cThey are sad.\u201d Although there were still scattered pockets of Ukrainian resistance across the peninsula on Sunday, it was clear Russia was quickly locking down. Ukrainian military officials in Crimea said that bases continued to fall and that the Russian military had also detained a navy captain from a base near Sevastopol.Even as Russian forces were storming two bases in Crimea on Saturday, the Kremlin agreed to allow monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to start a six-month mission in Ukraine \u2014 though not in Crimea. The move seemed intended to ease fears that Russian forces would push into eastern or southern Ukraine.But Mr. Putin\u2019s recent record of first coy, then bold moves has put Mr. Obama and his European allies on guard, even as they have struggled to coordinate. Caught flat-footed by the initial infiltration of Crimea, the United States seems increasingly alarmed about the 20,000 Russian troops that have massed on the border with eastern Ukraine.The other members of the Group of 7 economic partnership hardly have interests identical with those of the United States, and in many ways they are divided even among themselves, complicating any effort to draw a firmer line with Moscow.Mr. Obama\u2019s sanctions, announced last week, were aimed at sowing pain among members of a Russian economic and political elite who owe their wealth and loyalties to Mr. Putin. But the sanctions were also targeted to minimize disruption to the global economy and to avoid further jeopardizing already meek Russian cooperation on issues like the war in Syria, Iran\u2019s nuclear program, the Middle East and North Korea.For European countries, the risk of wider conflict with Russia is even graver. Britain hosts Russian billionaires and their money; Germany gets about one-third of its energy from Russia and sells it machinery and cars; France is in the process of delivering sophisticated attack ships to the Kremlin; and Italy depends on Russia for some 28 percent of its energy.Canada\u2019s prime minister, Stephen Harper, on Saturday became the first Group of 7 leader to visit Ukraine since the crisis erupted. Japan has an interest in whether China \u2014 whose president, Xi Jinping, began his first European tour this weekend \u2014 draws closer to Moscow or even secures Russian energy supplies in the event that the Kremlin cuts off Western Europe.While there is scant appetite for a military response, the newer members of NATO \u2014 former Warsaw Pact members like Poland, or the three ex-Soviet Baltic states \u2014 have anxiously sought reaffirmation that the alliance will protect them if, for example, Russia expands its operations in Crimea.Crisis scenarios abound in a Europe alarmed by the Kremlin\u2019s use of military muscle. Even normally dispassionate analysts have produced theories ranging from a thorough dismemberment of Moldova \u2014 which is already split by the pro-Kremlin enclave of Transnistria \u2014 to Russian intervention in eastern Ukraine.The acting government in Kiev has also been slow to reach out to Russian speakers and specifically to the East. The interim prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, did give a speech in Russian last week offering broad autonomy to Ukraine\u2019s eastern regions, which are vital to the country\u2019s weak economy, even with rundown coal mines and outmoded factories.A special role in the crisis has fallen to Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, and to Chancellor Angela Merkel, a Russian speaker who is familiar with Mr. Putin and in a stronger position at home than other leaders.Ms. Merkel has been in power for nine years, leads a coalition that unites center-left and center-right, and is a proven crisis manager, said Karl-Heinz Kamp of the NATO Defense College in Rome.Notoriously difficult to rattle in public, she has employed unusually clear language in criticizing Mr. Putin, \u201cwhich means she is really annoyed,\u201d Mr. Kamp said.Germany seems to be trying, Mr. Kamp said, to differentiate between what might be called \u201cPutin policy\u201d and Russia\u2019s broader interests, which may be interpreted very differently by Mr. Putin\u2019s eventual successor.That long-term perspective alone illustrates how profoundly the events in Ukraine have shifted Western thinking. Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, senior trans-Atlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, co-wrote a paper published last week on the crisis and its many implications. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be easy,\u201d she said over the weekend. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to take a long time.\u201dMichael D. Shear and Alison Smale reported from The Hague, and David M. Herszenhorn from Simferopol, Crimea.Advertisement"}

Then he turns with a pleased smile. \u201cThis would never happen anywhere but New York.\u201dThe same could be said of the career of Mr. Eichner, a ferociously funny comic who started as a child actor and was raised in a supportive middle-class household in Forest Hills, Queens. \u201cI was a fat, gay Jewish kid, but I was always confident,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe because I had a good singing voice.\u201d He starred in school musicals, appeared as an extra on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and soaked up everything show business. His bar mitzvah party had giant cutout photos of Madonna and the Phantom of the Opera. He has turned his obsession with fame into his own kind of minor celebrity. Along with his show, which earned him a Daytime Emmy nomination in 2013, he has become a master of the viral video and a favorite on the talk show circuit. Mr. Eichner is also appearing in 10 episodes of \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d playing an oft-irritated co-worker clearly inspired by his television persona.An oddly addictive comedy act wrapped in a game show, \u201cBilly on the Street\u201d takes place entirely outside and features a series of games like \u201cQuizzed in the Face\u201d and \u201cActress Potato Head.\u201d Winners earn small amounts of cash or worse, an onerous prize, like computer paper. (The rapper Nas, a celebrity guest, won a bird cage, which he did not seem pleased about.) The heart of the show is the spectacle of the tall, gangly Mr. Eichner erupting in disappointed rage (\u201cIt\u2019s Kat Dennings, you moron!\u201d) or sharing a strange exchange with a passer-by. \u201cNo one can do what he does,\u201d said Joan Rivers, an early champion. \u201cThe only comparison is the first season of Ali G.\u201d She added that a difference is that Mr. Eichner mixes sweetness with his insanity. \u201cIf you yell at an old lady for not knowing who Debra Messing is, no one gets hurt. She can still go shopping.\u201dSince he\u2019s trailed by a gaggle of production staff members moving in unison, getting approached by Mr. Eichner can be like getting charged by an army battalion led by a lunatic. Yet while some walk right by \u2014 one woman actually slapped him \u2014 a remarkable number of pedestrians not only engage, but also appear delighted to do so. It even surprises Mr. Eichner. \u201cI would never talk to me,\u201d he said.Part of the reason is his rudeness is cartoonish, even innocent. Mr. Eichner, a huge fan of Pee-wee Herman, expresses anger with the physicality of a kid\u2019s temper tantrum. And in an Internet culture that produces a steady stream of outrage quickly forgotten by the next news cycle, his fury seems to carry a satirical edge. There\u2019s also an odd sense of event about the encounters. \u201cPeople are looking for a moment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for something special. There\u2019s looking to this big goofy guy who is angry but doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s going to hurt them to give that to them. Not to sound twee, but that\u2019s the magic of the show.\u201dIn his early videos, he began asking serious questions about Iraq or the economy but then quickly lost interest and turned to \u201cThoroughly Modern Millie\u201d or Julia Roberts. \u201cNo matter how much I say I want to care about more important things, I only care about pop culture,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the point.\u201dRight from the start, they were a hit. \u201cIt was clear that he had a gift for keying into how to get something funny out of people and getting them to enjoy him,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. The show moved to the Off Broadway theater Ars Nova, where it became a cult sensation and led to a pilot for Bravo for a talk show that was like \u201cThe View\u201d with four gay men and Joan Rivers. It didn\u2019t get picked up. His agent dropped him. And in 2008, struggling to pay his rent and considering leaving show business, he asked Ms. Rivers for advice.\u201cJoan said, \u2018When you\u2019re like you and I \u2014 and you don\u2019t look like Brad Pitt \u2014 it takes a long time,\u201d Mr. Eichner recalled, his eyes beginning to water. \u201cAll it\u2019s going take is one person, she said, who will pick you up and put you in the right thing.\u201d That person turned out to be Mike Farah, the president for production at Funny or Die, who met with him after liking one of his videos. Mr. Eichner pitched his idea for packaging his man-on-the-street act in the context of a game show. Mr. Farah loved it, gave him some money, and they shopped it around. Then Fuse made an offer.After an hour of shooting outside, Mr. Eichner, breathing heavily, is still holding a potato, this one dressed as George Washington. \u201cIf I am feeling low energy, I just look at George Washington, and I get fired up,\u201d Mr. Eichner says. \u201cI\u2019m the Betsy Ross of comedy.\u201dBefore long, he hands off the potato and charges into the faces of two young women, leaning forward in his Nikes: \u201cAre you a foodie?\u201d he demands.They physically recoil, heads jerking back. When they regain their bearings, Mr. Eichner is long gone, and they break into the kind of nervous giggles you get at the end of a roller-coaster ride. One said: \u201cI knew something crazy would happen today.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Mexico Is Reaping a Bounty in Pecans as Other States Struggle", "Date": "2014-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAS CRUCES, N.M. \u2014 On the edge of this parched southern New Mexico city, Phillip Arnold surveyed his rows of neatly pruned pecan trees with a satisfied smile.\u201cThere was a time when I wondered what kind of mistake I had made,\u201d said Mr. Arnold, who began helping his family grow pecans along the Rio Grande as a teenager in the 1960s. \u201cBut today, I feel real good about what we\u2019re doing, and I feel good about the future.\u201dFor months on end, the Southwest has been in the clutches of an unrelenting drought, one of the worst in New Mexico\u2019s history. Earlier this month, the federal Agriculture Department declared six counties in the state as natural disaster areas because of the drought, including Do\u00f1a Ana County, where Las Cruces sits.While the lack of rainfall has left many ranchers and farmers reeling \u2014 and has earned the Rio Grande the nickname \u201cRio Sand\u201d \u2014 pecan growers here have been able to thrive.\u201cIt was one of the best years for us,\u201d Mr. Arnold said, noting that he did not expect the crop to drop off much next year.To be sure, even before the Rio Grande began running bone-dry through Las Cruces during the past few winters, New Mexico\u2019s pecan growers had been forced to adapt to a desertlike climate to succeed.Greg Daviet, a longtime Las Cruces pecan farmer, said that pecan growers here were more likely to have invested in irrigation infrastructure than other crop farmers, because pecan orchards were permanent fixtures and required long-term care.\u201cI would expect that we were a little more prepared to adjust to drought conditions,\u201d Mr. Daviet said. He said he had seen the industry expand over the years in the surrounding Mesilla Valley, where a fertile supply of groundwater has also helped offset the lack of rain.As is the case elsewhere, pecan farming in New Mexico is typically a family business. But nobody is quite sure how the trees, which are native to Texas, first got here.Farming historians credit Fabian Garcia, a chile breeder who was head of New Mexico State University\u2019s Agricultural Experiment Station, with planting some of the state\u2019s first pecan trees in 1913. But commercial pecan farming did not really take off in New Mexico until more than a decade later.As Mr. Arnold tells it, a Texas farmer who was hauling a load of pecans westward broke down one day, spilling his wares on the road. Mexican workers, who loved to snack on pecans and had a special affinity for the nuts from their use in northern Mexican cuisine, brought them to Deane Stahmann Sr., a local cotton farmer.As it turns out, the searing New Mexico sun suited pecan trees quite well, as long as they got enough water. Though farmers here must still use elaborate and expensive irrigation systems to manage water efficiently and ensure that their trees get enough water, their front-end investments are now, ostensibly, paying off.\u201cBy and large, you have a far more stable, predictable climate here,\u201d said Richard Heerema, pecan specialist at the Extension Plant Sciences department at New Mexico State University.\u201cIn terms of the dollar value to the economy of the state, it is huge,\u201d Mr. Heerema said. \u201cIt has become a really important crop for New Mexico\u2019s agricultural economy.\u201dIndeed, in a place long famous for its chiles, pecans have now become one of the state\u2019s most valuable commodities, generating well over $100 million annually. According to state data, pecans and hay have ranked among the top two most valuable crops in New Mexico for the past several years.As New Mexico\u2019s pecan market has swelled, production and prices around the country have also risen, farming experts said. Much of that success is largely due to new export markets in China, which has taken a keen interest in American pecans for use in snacks.Though Georgia still holds bragging rights as the nation\u2019s foremost and storied pecan producer, New Mexico\u2019s ascent has not gone unnoticed by farmers in other states.Between 1971 and 1980, New Mexico, California and Arizona made up only a sliver of the nation\u2019s pecan market, according to federal crop statistics. But driven largely by increased production in the Mesilla Valley, those three states now account for nearly a third of all pecan production around the United States.\u201cThe thing about New Mexico is, will they have enough water?\u201d said Lenny Wells, an associate professor of horticulture at the University of Georgia. \u201cAside from that, it\u2019s the perfect climate for growing pecans. They don\u2019t have the disease issues that we do.\u201dStill, farmers in New Mexico know well that as the drought drags on and the chronic water shortage across the West continues, they will be forced to make more adjustments. But once they start, farming families rarely leave the pecan business: Trees typically take at least seven years to produce enough nuts to turn a profit, and even rain is no substitute for patience.Both Mr. Arnold and Mr. Daviet spoke of a mystical feeling when walking through the pecan orchards they had helped tend as young men, of seeing the trees they had once labored to plant in the New Mexico soil now fully grown.\u201cA pecan tree is something you plant and you look at 20 years later, and you say, \u2018Look what I created,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Daviet said. \u201cThey almost become members of the family, because they have been around forever. And in the end, they take care of me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Underappreciated Entrepreneur: The Federal Government", "Date": "2014-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorial ObserverImagine a world in which the United States government \u2014 not the private sector \u2014 is the economy\u2019s indispensable entrepreneur, innovating at the frontiers of science and technology, able and willing to take risks and to persevere through uncertainty.Professor Mazzucato documents the leading role of the government in, for example, \u201call the technologies which make the iPhone smart,\u201d including the Internet, wireless systems, global positioning, voice activation and touch-screen displays. That is not to detract from Apple\u2019s role, but to put it into context. Without government, the technological revolution that has allowed iProducts to exist would not have happened. Ditto the leading role of government in aviation and space technologies, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, and more recently, in nanotechnology, which could be the next \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d breakthrough, akin to electricity or computers. In brief then, it is an essential role of the federal government \u2014 in the interest of tomorrow\u2019s prosperity \u2014 to invest and engage in scientific and technological discovery. And it is a role the government has played well, until now. After rising steadily for decades, federal financing for research and development peaked in 2009, at $165.5 billion, bolstered by that year\u2019s stimulus spending. It has since sunk to levels last seen almost a decade ago, falling to $133.7 billion this fiscal year. That roughly $32 billion drop is even greater when adjusted for inflation, and it encompasses both defense- and nondefense fields, including health, energy, the environment, climate, technology and electronics. One key area, basic science, received about $40 billion in the peak year 2009. Since then, it has fallen, to $30 billion last year, one of the sharpest declines ever. The future does not look much brighter. Constrained by austerity-induced budget caps, the research and development budget recently proposed by President Obama for fiscal year 2015 was only $135.4 billion, the lowest request of his presidency. Chances for more money on top of the budget caps, as Mr. Obama has called for, are virtually nil. And given that Congress invariably enacts less than the president asks for, the trend is all downhill. Worse, the direction is unlikely to reverse as long as prevailing rhetoric reinforces the notion of an inefficient government sector versus a dynamic private sector. To win budget battles going forward, Democratic policy makers and administration officials must also win the debate in favor of entrepreneurial government. The fact that they have not successfully made that case in recent years is a result of both implacable Republican opposition and their own tendencies to exalt the private sector while ignoring its many roots in public spending. Correcting that misimpression is crucial to building and sustaining support for public involvement in science and technology. Equally important is developing ways to ensure that taxpayers share in private-sector profits that ensue from government efforts. Fair and adequate corporate taxation is the obvious way, but that is currently a political non-starter. Non-tax models also need to be considered \u2014 for instance, requiring recipients of federal grants to pay a portion of subsequent profits to the government or establishing a federally backed innovation fund that lets the government retain an equity stake in companies that use the fund.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Needs a Boss?", "Date": "2014-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyIf you happen to be looking for your morning coffee near Golden Gate Park and the bright red storefront of the Arizmendi Bakery attracts your attention, congratulations. You have found what the readers of The San Francisco Bay Guardian, a local alt-weekly, deem the city\u2019s best bakery. But it has another, less obvious, distinction. Of the $3.50 you hand over for a latte (plus $2.75 for the signature sourdough croissant), not one penny ends up in the hands of a faraway investor. Nothing goes to anyone who might be tempted to sell out to a larger bakery chain or shutter the business if its quarterly sales lag.Instead, your money will go more or less directly to its 20-odd bakers, who each make $24 an hour \u2014 more than double the national median wage for bakers. On top of that, they get health insurance, paid vacation and a share of the profits. \u201cIt\u2019s not luxury, but I can sort of afford living in San Francisco,\u201d says Edhi Rotandi, a baker at Arizmendi. He works four days a week and spends the other days with his 2-year-old son.Arizmendi and its five sister bakeries in the Bay Area are worker-owned cooperatives, an age-old business model that has lately attracted renewed interest as a possible antidote to some of our most persistent economic ills. Most co-ops in the U.S. are smaller than Arizmendi, with around a dozen employees, but the largest, Cooperative Home Care Associates in the Bronx, has about 2,000. That\u2019s hardly the organizational structure\u2019s upper limit. In fact, Arizmendi was named for a Spanish priest and labor organizer in Basque country, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arizmendiarrieta. He founded what eventually became the Mondragon Corporation, now one of the region\u2019s biggest employers, with more than 60,000 members and 14 billion euro in revenue. And it\u2019s still a co-op.In a worker co-op, the workers own the business and decide what to do with the profits (as opposed to consumer co-ops, which are typically stores owned by members who shop at a discount). Historically, worker co-ops have held the most appeal when things seem most perilous for laborers. The present is no exception. And yet, despite their ability to empower workers, co-ops remain largely relegated to boutique status in the United States.The blockbuster economics book of the season, Thomas Piketty\u2019s \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d argues that the great equalizing decades following World War II, which brought on the rise of the middle class in the United States, were but a historical anomaly. Armed with centuries of data, Piketty says the rich are going to continue to gobble up a greater share of income, and our current system will do nothing to reverse that trend.The oft-proposed remedy for this state of affairs is redistribution \u2014 namely, taxing the rich to benefit the poor. Piketty, in fact, proposes a global tax, one that can\u2019t be avoided by private jet. Others want to raise the minimum wage. In contrast to those Band-Aids, worker co-ops require no politically unpalatable dictates. And by placing workers\u2019 needs ahead of profits, they address the root cause of economic disparity. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want inequality,\u201d says Richard Wolff, the author of \u201cDemocracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism,\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t distribute income unequally in the first place.\u201dOf course, a workplace doesn\u2019t have to be managed by committee in order to channel more of the capital share to labor. Workers can just be given stock. Thousands of companies, including blue-chip firms like Procter & Gamble, already use stock as part of compensation, with the employee share of the company ranging from the single digits to 100 percent. But even this can be just another management strategy to harness the increased productivity that, studies have shown, accompany employee ownership and profit-sharing.Support for full-fledged co-ops has inched into the mainstream as communities have grown weary of waiting for private investors to create good jobs \u2014 or sick of watching them take jobs away. In Cleveland in 2009, hospitals and a university gave seed money to a new group of businesses, the Evergreen Cooperatives, and now contract with them for laundry, energy retrofits and fresh produce. Last month, a government commission in Wales announced that \u201cconventional approaches to economic development\u201d were insufficient; it needed cooperatives. That same month, the New York City Council held a hearing called \u201cWorker Cooperatives \u2014 Is This a Model That Can Lift Families Out of Poverty?\u201dIt is a good question. Research findings about employee-owned businesses are rarely negative \u2014 they are either just as good as regular businesses, or they are more productive, less susceptible to failure, more attentive to quality and less likely to lay off workers in a downturn (though they may be slower to hire when times are good). Take, for example, the employee-owned British retailer John Lewis, which has recently threatened to outpace its publicly traded corporate rival, Marks & Spencer.One perennial criticism of worker co-ops is that they can\u2019t afford the high-flying talent that would help them innovate. But not every company needs to innovate. Many just need to mop floors, sling burgers or clean linens. And it is usually those companies whose workers struggle most. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to create an Amazon that pays Jeff Bezos to do what he does,\u201d says Melissa Hoover, the executive director of the United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to remove Jeff Bezos from the equation and have everyone else make a little more money.\u201dAnother persistent critique is that workers don\u2019t have enough experience to make good management decisions. Some co-ops solve this problem just as other businesses do, by buying expertise they don\u2019t already have. In 2008, the owners of a Chicago window factory decided to close it with little notice, and the workers staged a six-day sit-in that made them celebrities overnight. Another owner took over but closed the factory again. The workers bought the equipment and moved it to a new factory, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars with sweat equity. The new company, called New Era Windows, opened last year. Though the workers are still paying themselves minimum wage, they elected to hire a high-priced, experienced salesman to drum up business.New Era was lucky to find financing, borrowing $600,000 from a nonprofit called the Working World, which started lending to co-ops in Latin America and has branched out to the U.S. The biggest challenge co-ops face is lack of capital, which is why they are often labor-intensive businesses with low start-up costs. Banks can be hesitant to lend to co-ops, perhaps because they aren\u2019t familiar with the model. Meanwhile, credit unions \u2014 another form of cooperative \u2014 face stringent regulations on business lending.The founder of the Working World, Brendan Martin, would like not only to fund cooperatives, but to reorder the priorities of investors altogether. Martin says that both times the window factory was shuttered, it was not for lack of business. It just didn\u2019t meet the needs of the owners. The Working World, instead of seeking quick returns, accepts no loan repayment until the borrower is on its feet. \u201cWe create the real economy, which is slower but it has less risk,\u201d Martin told me recently, between meetings with the New Era workers in Chicago. Then he proposed something truly radical: \u201cImagine if Wall Street investors were only able to make money by creating incredibly successful American businesses?\u201d Maybe then we wouldn\u2019t need co-ops.Shaila Dewan is an economics reporter at The Times.Deep Thoughts:\n1. Co-ops are back in style.\n2. Because they\u2019re an effective way to battle\nincome inequality. 3. Though\nthey have a hard time attracting capital.\n4. Well, duh.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Relentless Widening of Disparity in Wealth", "Date": "2014-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneTo believe Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics, this future is not just possible. It is likely.In his bracing \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d which hit bookstores on Monday, Professor Piketty provides a fresh and sweeping analysis of the world\u2019s economic history that puts into question many of our core beliefs about the organization of market economies.His most startling news is that the belief that inequality will eventually stabilize and subside on its own, a long-held tenet of free market capitalism, is wrong. Rather, the economic forces concentrating more and more wealth into the hands of the fortunate few are almost sure to prevail for a very long time.It is possible to slow, or even reverse, the trend, if political leaders like President Obama, who proposed that income inequality was the \u201cdefining challenge of our time,\u201d really push.\u201cPolitical action can make this go in the other direction,\u201d Professor Piketty told me. But he also adds that history does not offer much hope that political action will, in fact, turn the tide: \u201cUniversal suffrage and democratic institutions have not been enough to make the system react.\u201dProfessor Piketty\u2019s description of inexorably rising inequality probably fits many Americans\u2019 intuitive understanding of how the world works today. But it cuts hard against the grain of economic orthodoxy that prevailed throughout the second half of the 20th century and still holds sway today. It was shaped during the early years of the Cold War by the Belorussian-born American economist Simon Kuznets.Painstakingly assembling data from tax returns, Mr. Kuznets estimated that between 1913, when the income tax was first introduced in the United States, and shortly after the end of World War II in 1948, the slice of the nation\u2019s income absorbed by the richest 10 percent of Americans declined sharply, to about a third, from a little under half.Mr. Kuznets\u2019s conclusion provided a huge moral lift to capitalism as the United States faced off with the Soviet Union. It suggested that the market economy could distribute its fruits equitably, without any heavy-handed intervention of the state.And it more or less put an end to economists\u2019 interest in the topic. Economic theorists assumed that in a balanced economy, wages and profits rose at the same pace and turned their attention to the ups and downs of the business cycle.The deep concern about the distribution of income and wealth that inspired 19th-century thinkers like David Ricardo and Karl Marx was attributed to a misunderstanding of the dynamics of growth leavened with the natural pessimism that would come from living in a time of enormous wealth and deep squalor, an era that gave us \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d and \u201cOliver Twist.\u201dToday, of course, it\u2019s far from obvious that the 19th-century pessimists were entirely wrong.Glancing back across history from the present-day United States, it looks as if Kuznets\u2019s curve swerved way off target. Wages have been depressed for years. Profits account for the largest share of national income since the 1930s. The richest 10 percent of Americans take a larger slice of the economic pie than they did in 1913, at the peak of the Gilded Age.This is not solely an American phenomenon. Across many other developed nations, the distribution of economic rewards in the 21st century is taking on decidedly 19th-century features.Like Kuznets\u2019s analysis, Mr. Piketty\u2019s is based on data. He just has much more: centuries\u2019 worth, from dozens of countries. He distills from them a simple historical regularity. The rate of return to capital \u2014 understood broadly to include machinery, land, financial instruments, housing and everything else \u2014 is usually higher than economic growth.This was particularly true before the Industrial Revolution, when economies didn\u2019t really grow, but it prevailed even after economic growth took off in the 19th century.This means that the income from wealth usually grows faster than wages. As returns from capital are reinvested, inherited wealth will grow faster than the economy, concentrating more and more into the hands of few. This will go on until capital owners decide to consume most of their income and stop reinvesting as much.Kuznets\u2019s misleading curve is easy to understand in this light. He used data from one exceptional period in history, when a depression, two world wars and high inflation destroyed a large chunk of the world\u2019s capital stock. Combined with fast growth after World War II and high taxes on the rich, this flattened the distribution of income until the 1970s.But this exceptional period long ago ran its course.During the Gilded Age \u2014 a period of enormous concentration of income and wealth \u2014 the stock of the world\u2019s privately held capital amounted to some five years\u2019 worth of global income, by Professor Piketty\u2019s estimate. By 1950, it had fallen to below three, but by 2010, it was back at four. And by the end of this century, Mr. Piketty projects, it will amount to almost seven.Americans will argue that this description does not fit the United States. Wealth here is largely earned, not inherited, we say. The American rich are \u201ccreators,\u201d like Bill Gates of Microsoft or Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, rewarded for their economic contributions to society.Mr. Piketty doubts that the enormous remuneration of top executives and financiers in the United States \u2014 enhanced by the decline of top income tax rates since the 1980s \u2014 really reflects their contributions. What\u2019s more, he points out, inherited inequality has been lower in the United States mainly because its population has grown so fast \u2014 from three million at the time of independence to 300 million today \u2014 driving a vast economic expansion.But this population boom will not repeat itself. The share of national income absorbed by corporate profits, a major component of capital\u2019s share, is already rising sharply.If anything, this means future inequality in the United States will be driven by two forces. A growing share of national income will go to the owners of capital. Of the remaining labor income, a growing share will also go to the top executives and highly compensated stars at the pinnacle of the earnings scale.Is there a politically feasible antidote? Professor Piketty notes that the standard recipe \u2014 education for all \u2014 is no match against the powerful forces driving inherited wealth ever higher.Taxes are, of course, the most feasible counterweight. Progressive wealth taxes could reduce the after-tax return to capital so that it equaled the rate of economic growth.But politically, \u201cthe fiscal institutions to redistribute incomes in a balanced and equitable way have been badly damaged,\u201d Professor Piketty told me.The holders of wealth, hardly a powerless bunch, will oppose any such move, even if that\u2019s what is needed to preserve capitalism against the populist impulses of those left behind.Professor Piketty offers early-20th-century France as an example. \u201cFrance was a democracy and yet the system did not respond to an incredible concentration of wealth and an incredible level of inequality,\u201d he said. \u201cThe elites just refused to see it. They kept claiming that the free market was going to solve everything.\u201dIt didn\u2019t.A chart on Wednesday with the Economic Scene column, about an economist\u2019s belief that economic inequality will widen and prevail for a long time, misstated a year on the horizontal axis in showing the value of private capital as a percentage of national income. The year at the far right was 2100, not 3000.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; \nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Apartheid of Children\u2019s Literature", "Date": "2014-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionI\u2019M talking with a boy. He\u2019s at that age when the edges of the man he will become are just starting to press against his baby-round face. He\u2019s got his first opinions and ideas and jokes, which are horrible, because there is nothing that boys his age love more than corny jokes. There is a whole industry of knock-knock-joke books for boys this age. Everything about him is gangly; his voice and his limbs fit awkwardly, like hand-me-downs. He\u2019s young enough that his smile is easy, and he is the kind of boy who finds reasons to smile in everything: the cracking of his voice, a fire-engine siren, the fact that a grown-up is talking to him and listening to what he says. When I talk with kids like this, our conversations always seem to go the same way:\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me these are all the books published last year for kids?\u201d they ask me. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of books. That\u2019s more books than I could read in a year.\u201d\u201cYep, it\u2019s a few thousand.\u201d\u201cAnd in all of those thousands of books, I\u2019m just not in them?\u201d\u201cWell...um...yes.\u201d\u201cAre there books about talking animals?\u201d\u201cOh, sure.\u201d\u201cAnd crazy magical futures?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\u201cAnd superpowers? And the olden days when people dressed funny? And all the combinations of those things? Like talking animals with superpowers in magical futures ... but no me?\u201d\u201cNo you.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re brown.\u201dI would like to have a proper enemy in this story \u2014 preferably a snide villain with a cape and a British accent and a posh cat or a ferret. With my unique history \u2014 two generations in the business of caring for kids with words and pictures \u2014 I would be the James Bond/Black Dynamite of children\u2019s literature and foil this nefarious conspiracy. But, unfortunately, this story is more truth than fiction, and the villain here is elusive.The mission statements of major publishers are littered with intentions, with their commitments to diversity, to imagination, to multiculturalism, ostensibly to create opportunities for children to learn about and understand their importance in their respective worlds. During my years of making children\u2019s books, I\u2019ve heard editors and publishers bemoan the dismal statistics, and promote this or that program that demonstrates their company\u2019s \u201ccommitment to diversity.\u201d With so much reassurance, it is hard to point fingers, but there are numbers and truths that stand in stark contrast to the reassurances. The business of children\u2019s literature enjoys ever more success, sparking multiple movie franchises and crossover readership, even as representations of young people of color are harder and harder to find.This apartheid of literature \u2014 in which characters of color are limited to the townships of occasional historical books that concern themselves with the legacies of civil rights and slavery but are never given a pass card to traverse the lands of adventure, curiosity, imagination or personal growth \u2014 has two effects.One is a gap in the much-written-about sense of self-love that comes from recognizing oneself in a text, from the understanding that your life and lives of people like you are worthy of being told, thought about, discussed and even celebrated. Academics and educators talk about self-esteem and self-worth when they think of books in this way, as mirrors that affirm readers\u2019 own identities. I believe that this is important, but I wonder if this idea is too adult and self-concerned, imagining young readers as legions of wicked queens asking magic mirrors to affirm that they are indeed \u201cthe fairest of them all.\u201dThe children I know, the ones I meet in school visits, in juvenile detention facilities like the Cheltenham Youth Facility in Maryland, in ritzy private schools in Connecticut, in cobbled-together learning centers like the Red Rose School in Kibera, Nairobi \u2014 these children are much more outward looking. They see books less as mirrors and more as maps. They are indeed searching for their place in the world, but they are also deciding where they want to go. They create, through the stories they\u2019re given, an atlas of their world, of their relationships to others, of their possible destinations.We adults \u2014 parents, authors, illustrators and publishers \u2014 give them in each book a world of supposedly boundless imagination that can delineate the most ornate geographies, and yet too often today\u2019s books remain blind to the everyday reality of thousands of children. Children of color remain outside the boundaries of imagination. The cartography we create with this literature is flawed.Perhaps this exclusivity, in which children of color are at best background characters, and more often than not absent, is in fact part of the imaginative aspect of these books. But what it means is that when kids today face the realities of our world, our global economies, our integrations and overlappings, they all do so without a proper map. They are navigating the streets and avenues of their lives with an inadequate, outdated chart, and we wonder why they feel lost. They are threatened by difference, and desperately try to wish the world into some more familiar form. As for children of color, they recognize the boundaries being imposed upon their imaginations, and are certain to imagine themselves well within the borders they are offered, to color themselves inside the lines.AT a public school in Southeast Washington, D.C., I ask a fifth grader what he wants to do with his life, what the map is that he has drawn for himself. He is talkative and smart, and his high-top fade adds a few extra inches to his height, so that he is almost as tall as his classmates, and far more stylish. He tells me that he will join the N.B.A., and use that money to buy a recording studio and record his first rap album. Looking at him, I think that these are not necessarily his dreams; they are just the dreams that have been offered him, the places he can go in the narrow geography that has been delineated for him, strung along in a surreal and improbable sequence.As much as I hope that I\u2019m wrong, that in several years the Brooklyn Nets sign a 5-foot-8 point guard with amazing flow, who raps and hoops in the same arenas, I think it\u2019s necessary to provide for boys and girls like him a more expansive landscape upon which to dream.\u201cWho would stand in the way of such a thing?\u201d I\u2019ve asked this question of industry folks, of booksellers, of my father, who\u2019s been fighting this battle since before I picked up my first words. The closest I can get to the orchestrator of the plot \u2014 my villain with his ferret \u2014 is The Market. Which I think is what they all point to because The Market is so comfortably intangible that no one is worried I will go knocking down any doors. The Market, I am told, just doesn\u2019t demand this kind of book, doesn\u2019t want book covers to look this or that way, and so the representative from (insert major bookselling company here) has asked that we have only text on the book cover because white kids won\u2019t buy a book with a black kid on the cover \u2014 or so The Market says, despite millions of music albums that are sold in just that way.I remember my first encounter with The Market when I was a kid. My father once wrote a story about Dr. Cosmos, a talking chimpanzee who wore a sequined turban, and some kids from Harlem who were matching pets to people by their astrological signs. I remember Pop coming home disappointed after he was told that the story would not be published, because astrology, the occult, witchcraft and the like would not sell \u2014 or so The Market had dictated. You could draw a map of the places around the country where they said such a book would languish on the shelves and even incur protests and boycotts.This injunction against the occult in children\u2019s literature was presented as an unwritten rule for quite some time. That is, until a number of years later, when a certain wizard came along, and vampires, witches, werewolves and Greek gods, and all manner of magical beings soon followed. Perhaps the wizard and all his supernatural kin were able to elude the dictates of The Market because they had magic wands and powers. Or perhaps the imagination of publishers, parents, teachers, editors, librarians and book buyers, these people who care so much for children and literature and believe in good stories told well, in cartographies that have no blind spots, was much more important, in the end, than that unwritten rule put forth by The Market, that backward segregated map that has led us to this dismal place.So now to do my part \u2014 because I can draw a map as well as anybody. I\u2019m talking with a girl. She\u2019s at that age where the edges of the woman she will become are just starting to press against her baby-round face, and I will make a fantastic world, a cartography of all the places a girl like her can go, and put it in a book. The rest of the work lies in the imagination of everyone else along the way, the publishers, librarians, teachers, parents, and all of us, to put that book in her hands.An author and illustrator of books for children and young adults, including \u201cHarlem\u201d and other collaborations with his father.

{"Headline": "Titans in Russia Fear New Front in Ukraine Crisis", "Date": "2014-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 When Vladimir V. Putin returned to the Russian presidency in 2012, one of the first messages he sent to his political elite, many of them heads of banks and large corporations, was that the times had changed: Owning assets outside Russia makes you too vulnerable to moves by foreign governments, he told them. It is time to bring your wealth home.Nearly two years later, those words seem almost prophetic. After a week of escalating tensions between Russia and the United States, it has become clear that the conflict over Ukraine will move to the battlefield of finance. Those same business titans are now contemplating the damage that the crisis could inflict on Russia\u2019s economy.Twenty years into the project of integrating Russia into Western institutions, they now face the prospect that the process could slow, or even reverse.Financial sanctions, which the United States and the European Union have suggested they will impose if the conflict escalates, are intended to test the cohesion of the political system. Mr. Putin demands complete loyalty from those who are allowed to lead Russia\u2019s business empires, and he has made it clear that he will punish those who undermine him. His tough stance in Crimea, meanwhile, has been enthusiastically welcomed by the general public, including, insiders say, many of those in business. No one is breaking ranks.Still, the prospect of losing access to Western finance is a frightening thought for Russian business leaders, whose voice in foreign policy decision-making is muted compared with the tight circle of Mr. Putin\u2019s former K.G.B. colleagues, for whom economic factors may be secondary.Anxiety over possible economic fallout has begun to radiate from business circles, and some wondered whether Mr. Putin had been warned clearly about the magnitude of the possible damage to the economy. One analyst described their mind-set as one of \u201ccognitive dissonance.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen 10 people from the Forbes list in the recent few days. They\u2019re pale; they don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Aleksandr Y. Lebedev, a prominent banker who sold most of his Russian assets after public disputes with Mr. Putin. But the oligarchs realize, he said, that their interests carry no weight in this situation, especially if they, like Mr. Lebedev himself, own property outside Russia.\u201cIt\u2019s those who are here who will take the burden,\u201d said Mr. Lebedev, speaking from Moscow. \u201cThey all keep their mouths shut.\u201dLast week, days after Russia took control of Crimea, the United States announced a modest first round of sanctions, and the European Union indicated it would follow suit, with both making it clear that there may be further rounds. Officials have suggested that a range of measures is being considered, leaving open, by implication, the most extreme one: barring Russian companies and banks from access to the Western financial system, similar to sanctions adopted against Iran.President Obama has broad executive powers to declare sanctions without approval from Congress, and he would most likely consider the next steps after Crimea votes in a referendum on separating from Ukraine, scheduled for Sunday, said Michael A. McFaul, until recently the American ambassador to Moscow. \u201cIt needs to be spelled out as explicitly as possible, either directly to Putin or to the two or three people who could talk to him about this,\u201d he said.Russia may be betting, as many analysts do, that the United States and its allies will not follow through with draconian sanctions, and has made it clear that it would respond harshly and asymmetrically. On Friday, Gazprom hinted that it might cut off gas exports to Ukraine over unpaid bills, as it did in 2009, and an unnamed Defense Ministry official told Russian news agencies that it would consider stopping international inspections of its nuclear weapons.Russia\u2019s tycoons have been silent since the crisis began, apart from approving messages on social media. Many inside Russia\u2019s large corporations are no doubt supportive of Mr. Putin\u2019s moves in Crimea, which are widely seen here as correcting a historical error made by the Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev, when he transferred Crimea to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Mr. Putin\u2019s approval ratings are at their highest point since he returned to the presidency in 2012. If corporate leaders are complaining, they are doing it quietly.\u201cOf course they\u2019re upset, but it doesn\u2019t mean they are prepared to challenge Russia\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d said Mikhail E. Dmitriyev, an economist whose research group, the Center for Strategic Research, was originally founded to shape Mr. Putin\u2019s economic platform. \u201cThis is a new reality. Even if somebody has reservations with regard to the policy\u2019s effectiveness, I strongly doubt they would express it. This is a policy which, for the moment, is backed by the vast majority of the public. It\u2019s not an exaggeration.\u201dIn private conversations, though, several people described high anxiety within corporations, especially about the prospect of any sanctions\u2019 affecting banks. Large Russian corporations have significantly increased foreign borrowing in recent years, and 10 were negotiating loans when the crisis boiled over, said Ben Aris, the editor and publisher of Business New Europe. Financial sanctions could set off a chain reaction of blocked transactions, frozen accounts and bank closings. \u201cThose oligarchs who are already having trouble would be completely cut off,\u201d he said.Sberbank, the state retail bank, and the state investment bank VTB have actively expanded into Eastern Europe, including Ukraine, and own assets in Western Europe and the United States. Rosneft, the state oil company, has a deal with Exxon Mobil to drill in the Russian Arctic, the flagship project of Igor I. Sechin, a deputy prime minister and one of Mr. Putin\u2019s closest aides.Some pointed to a more long-term danger that the conflict over Ukraine, if it escalated, could culminate in a turn toward isolation for the Russian economy.\u201cIt may be that we look back on the events of last weekend and remember it as an inflection point when Russia\u2019s growing integration with the planet, which has been remorseless \u2014 Russia has integrated into the global architecture, and people feel they are part of the world \u2014 maybe we look back on this weekend as a time when there were a big set of steps back,\u201d said Bernard Sucher, the former head of Merrill Lynch in Russia.It is unclear how heavily Mr. Putin weighed the economic consequences when he decided to take control of Crimea. During his first years as president, Mr. Putin was known as an economic liberalizer, and one of his most trusted advisers was Aleksei L. Kudrin, the liberal-leaning former finance minister who gave him his first job in the Kremlin administration.But Mr. Putin, whose return to the presidency was opposed by many urban liberals, now makes his most important decisions in an inner circle of men who emerged from Soviet security services. Among the first new projects in his new presidency was a push to \u201cnationalize the elite,\u201d requiring officials to sell off investments and properties outside Russia that could, in his view, undermine their loyalty in the event of a confrontation with the West.Indeed, among the small group of people present when Mr. Putin made the final decision on Crimea, according to officials and analysts, were five or six former K.G.B. colleagues believed to have minimal assets outside Russia, and who were therefore not vulnerable to sanctions. Some of those now closest to Mr. Putin, like the head of the Russian Railways, Vladimir I. Yakunin, have long argued for Russia to turn away from Western economic models and toward Chinese-style state capitalism.Mr. Dmitriyev, who has remained in touch with the economic officials who advise the Kremlin, said he believed Mr. Putin had a clear understanding of the potential for damage to the economy when he made the decision on Crimea.\u201cEconomic risks are an important factor in the whole policy agenda, but of course this is not the only factor, and the Ukrainian events cannot be wound back,\u201d Mr. Dmitriyev said. \u201cThis is a ratchet mechanism which unwinds in only one direction. This is one reason there is a lot of wishful thinking in the West.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Debate on Bourbon St.: Should the Good Times Roll Less Loudly?", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Last Thursday, two nights after Mardi Gras, amid the customary debauchery that is apparently immune to the chill and the Lenten hangover, a tall man with a device resembling a 1980s-era cellphone was going door to door on Bourbon Street.He stopped outside one club where the crowd was shouting along to a karaoke rendition of \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019,\u201d another where a live band was hurrying through \u201cThe Devil Went Down to Georgia,\u201d and another where crowds cheered a woman who was sitting astride a succession of men in a barbershop chair and pouring tequila directly into their mouths.\u201cAre you hunting for ghosts?\u201d a moderately sober passer-by asked.If only the aim were so modest. The man was David Woolworth, an acoustics expert hired by the City Council, and he was taking decibel measurements as part of an effort to better manage the volume dial in a city long famous for its street musicians, boisterous crowds and perpetual parades.It would try to fix Bourbon Street.\u201cIt may be one of the biggest challenges anybody could imagine,\u201d Mr. Woolworth said in the quiet light of the next day. Bourbon, perhaps the country\u2019s pre-eminent 24-hour street party, is the way it is, he said, and \u201cpeople just take for granted that that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be.\u201dThe fight over sound goes back centuries here, as do the traditions of music and lax regulation. The latest round began in 2010, when the police forced a well-known brass band to leave its usual sidewalk perch on Bourbon Street, provoking calls for change.With the goal of a revised citywide ordinance delayed, the city, like a bachelor party without a plan, decided to start with Bourbon Street.Noise management is a highly technical issue. It entails deciding the appropriate way to measure decibels, where they should be measured and which city agency should do the measuring. It means dealing with a wide range of constituencies \u2014 including residents, bar owners, professional bands, D.J.s and street entertainers. There is also the thorny issue of the First Amendment, which puts the lovely sounding sidewalk violinist and the man down the block screaming about the end times on similar constitutional footing.All of this comes together on Bourbon Street. It is the noisiest place in the city, and the biggest target for complaints by the neighbors \u2014 one lawyer in the French Quarter is involved in noise-related lawsuits against seven businesses on Bourbon Street.But perhaps most significant, while Bourbon Street might draw millions of tourists and accounts for thousands of jobs, few in New Orleans will rush to its defense.\u201cThe problem with Bourbon is you have a bunch of these new clubs and they\u2019re not the essence of the city,\u201d said Glen David Andrews, the trombone player who led the parade in the City Council chambers. \u201cThey got jam bands, and they\u2019re just blasting music. At least in the \u201980s you still had classy joints.\u201dSince the clubs began opening there in the 1920s and \u201930s, many of them run by enterprising Sicilian immigrants, hating Bourbon Street has been a local tradition, writes Richard Campanella, a Tulane University professor, in his new book \u201cBourbon Street: A History.\u201d \u201cEducated newcomers and sophisticated visitors figure out quickly that declaring disdain for Bourbon Street is the first step toward showcasing their taste and gaining insider status,\u201d he writes.Though Bourbon Street is not the quiet residential strip it was a century ago, there are still plenty of neighbors. Some are frustrated and pushing for action from the city, others are more fatalistic, but pretty much everyone, especially those who have been in the French Quarter for decades, agrees that Bourbon Street has become a pretty loud place.\u201cI don\u2019t quite remember when it got so noisy,\u201d said Freddie Pincus, 89, a retired speech therapist who has lived in the French Quarter for 60 years, most of them just off Bourbon Street. \u201cI think it was pretty gradual.\u201dMs. Pincus suggested that the street really became loud in the 1960s, when the district attorney, Jim Garrison \u2014 later famous for trying to solve the assassination of President John F. Kennedy \u2014 forced the doors and windows of Bourbon Street clubs to stay open as part of a crackdown on vice. Or perhaps it happened with the introduction of the go-cup, the name for a drink bought and consumed out in the street, a privilege just short of a divine right here. Or maybe it just tracked the advances in amplification.In any case, even those who make a living on Bourbon Street acknowledge its less-than-stellar reputation.\u201cThe standards on Bourbon Street have to change,\u201d said Robert L. Watters, who owns Rick\u2019s Cabaret and Rick\u2019s Saloon, two of several strip clubs on Bourbon Street, and has been actively involved in the discussions about the sound issue.Mr. Watters said the best way to fix Bourbon Street, from its sounds to its smells, was to involve the club owners, not to sue them into submission. But despite the street\u2019s critical role in the tourism economy, the bar and club owners and New Orleans\u2019 influential political players rarely meet. \u201cThis is a wild and woolly group,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not really part of the power structure of the city.\u201dNathan Chapman, a civic activist who is leading the push to crack down on noise, said the club owners were fundamentally invested in the status quo, and quite adept at preserving it. With flimsy rules and little to no enforcement, lawsuits are a necessary recourse, he said.Mr. Chapman expressed frustration at the slow pace of efforts to fix the ordinance, and he had little confidence in Mr. Watters, who is now the chairman of a state agency that manages the French Quarter.\u201cWe feel like he\u2019s not the person to do this,\u201d Mr. Chapman said. \u201cI just think it\u2019s funny in the state of \u2018Duck Dynasty\u2019 and Bobby Jindal that we\u2019re having meetings in a strip club, with the pole over there.\u201dMr. Woolworth, the sound expert, is confident that there is more agreement than disagreement. He said he believed that a consensus plan for Bourbon Street could clear the way for sensible sound regulations in other neighborhoods, each of which has its own preferred balance between a good time and quiet time.It is true, at least, that no place is quite as polarizing as Bourbon Street.\u201cI think it boils down to more of a hate for Bourbon Street as much as it is for a noise ordinance,\u201d said Earl Bernhardt, who owns several clubs on Bourbon Street, employs dozens of musicians and has some fame as a co-inventor of the potent fluorescent cocktail known as the Hand Grenade. Mr. Bernhardt said that he was open to a reasonable ordinance and that he had put in measures, like lights that alert bands when they are playing too loudly, that keep the neighbors happy.But clearly, he and his most determined opponents have different ends in mind.\u201cThey feel like if they could destroy the clubs on Bourbon Street, the neighborhood could become quiet and peaceful,\u201d he said disapprovingly. \u201cLike Mayberry.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "McCarthyism Comes to Turkey", "Date": "2014-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 For several months, Turkey has been in the throes of a political war. The latest controversy emerged after a series of wiretapped phone conversations between Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and members of his inner circle were exposed systematically on the Internet. These audio files immediately went viral and confirmed to millions of Turks that many of the rumors they\u2019d been hearing about government interference in the media and judiciary were quite real. In one of the recorded conversations, Mr. Erdogan called Fatih Sarac, a top executive at Haberturk, a popular news channel, to reprimand him for airing the critical views of an opposition leader. Mr. Sarac, a confidant of Mr. Erdogan who suddenly became a top executive at Haberturk in 2012, apologized to the prime minister, telling him: \u201cYes sir, I will have it cut in just two minutes, sir.\u201d He then made a hasty call to tell his subordinates to take it off the air. In another phone call, Mr. Erdogan questioned Mr. Sarac about a story on Haberturk that criticized the government\u2019s health reforms. The reporters and editor responsible for the story were soon fired.In yet another wiretapped conversation, Mr. Erdogan was heard asking his justice minister to ensure a heavy sentence against Aydin Dogan, a disobedient media boss who was facing charges of tax evasion. The justice minister responded by saying that the judge in the case could unfortunately not be controlled because he was an Alevi \u2014 a religious minority that is often politically at odds with Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Sunni-dominated government. What\u2019s most shocking is that Mr. Erdogan has openly confirmed the authenticity of many of the conversations. (He did deny one alleged call between him and his son about colossal sums of cash stashed in the latter\u2019s apartment.) In a press conference, Mr. Erdogan admitted that he called the Haberturk executives to tell them to refrain from publishing \u201cinsults\u201d against him. \u201cWe have to teach them,\u201d he explained, referring to the media. With regards to his attempted interference in the Dogan case, Mr. Erdogan was again unapologetic, saying: \u201cWhat could be more natural than that? I had to ask this in the name of my country and nation.\u201dAll this has confirmed that, after a dozen years in power, the system Mr. Erdogan established is a textbook case of illiberal democracy \u2014 a system whereby the ruler comes to power through elections but is not bound by the rule of law and shows little respect for civil liberties. It is much more similar to Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia than the liberal democracies of Western Europe that Turkey hopes to emulate. And yet all this does not seem to be a problem for many Turkish voters. Surprises are always possible, but polls suggest that Mr. Erdogan is still popular and his Justice and Development Party, known as the A.K.P., will not suffer dramatic losses in the local elections on March 30. Although this is a municipal vote, Mr. Erdogan has defined it as a test for his own popularity. The main reason for Mr. Erdogan\u2019s impressive political endurance in the face of protests and investigations is that most Turkish voters do not care much about his authoritarianism and his party\u2019s corruption as long as the economy is fine. Moreover, most religious conservatives support him reflexively simply because they share his worldview and ideology. Finally, Mr. Erdogan has also been successful in galvanizing his base with a best-defense-is-a-good-offense strategy. He argues that all the wiretapped conversations, and a preceding corruption probe that targeted some of his ministers and his son, are in fact a \u201ccoup plot\u201d against his elected government.\u201cCoup\u201d is an overstatement, but Mr. Erdogan has a point: The very existence of the recordings confirms that there is an effort to embarrass the government. Somebody has been wiretapping the prime minister and his inner circle (along with thousands of others), archiving these audio files and releasing them on the Internet for public consumption. For Mr. Erdogan, and many others in Turkey, this somebody is also quite obvious: The \u201cparallel state\u201d allegedly created within the police and other key branches of the bureaucracy by the religious followers of Fethullah Gulen, a moderate Islamic preacher based in Pennsylvania.That is why Mr. Erdogan has spent the past couple of months condemning the \u201cparallel state,\u201d reassigning thousands of policemen and stalling the work of prosecutors who initiated the corruption probe against him. He has also depicted the \u201cparallel state\u201d not as a domestic rival, but a fifth column of \u201cforeign powers\u201d that supposedly want to weaken Turkey. (The pro-Erdogan media refer to these foreign powers as the \u201cinterest rate lobby,\u201d the \u201cneo-cons\u201d and \u201cZionism.\u201d) He has gone so far as to seek the support of the military, an institution that his government has systematically sidelined over the last decade. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s advisers recently declared that the extensive purges of the military had been executed by the treacherous \u201cparallel state,\u201d and Parliament passed a law which freed dozens of inmates, including the former chief of the general staff, Gen. Ilker Basbug, who were in jail for forming alleged military juntas.On March 30, Mr. Erdogan hopes to win yet another strong mandate and initiate an extensive purge of his political opponents, which may well turn into a McCarthyist witch-hunt. He has declared that his war against the \u201cparallel state\u201d is actually Turkey\u2019s \u201csecond war of liberation\u201d \u2014 after the first one that Mustafa Kemal Ataturk fought 90 years ago against foreign occupying armies. Unfortunately, if too many voters buy the prime minister\u2019s claim that Turkey is in the midst of such a \u201chistoric battle,\u201d liberals\u2019 complaints about the lack of rule of law or civil liberties will simply be dismissed as trivia or condemned as unpatriotic.

{"Headline": "Obama Steps Up Russia Sanctions in Ukraine Crisis", "Date": "2014-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama expanded sanctions against Russia on Thursday, blacklisting a bank and several wealthy businessmen with close ties to President Vladimir V. Putin, as the United States struggled to forestall further Russian incursions into Ukraine.Among those targeted were Sergei B. Ivanov, the president\u2019s chief of staff; Gennady N. Timchenko, a billionaire investor with links to Mr. Putin; and Yuri V. Kovalchuk, whom the administration described as the personal banker for Russian leaders, including the president.Mr. Obama also opened the door to more sweeping measures against core parts of the Russian economy, including the oil and natural gas industries, which account for much of Russia\u2019s exports. He said the actions could disrupt the global economy, but might be necessary because of what he described as menacing movements by the Russian military near eastern and southern Ukraine.Administration officials insisted that the new sanctions would have more bite than the initial ones Mr. Obama announced on Monday. But it remains unclear whether they will be enough to put a brake on Mr. Putin, who brushed aside the previous measures and moved swiftly to annex Crimea.Responding almost immediately, Russia barred nine prominent American officials from entering the country, including the speaker of the House, John A. Boehner; the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada; Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona; and three close advisers to Mr. Obama.Mr. Obama, speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, said Russia\u2019s aggressive moves toward Ukraine had only escalated since the referendum in Crimea on Sunday.\u201cThese are all choices that the Russian government has made,\u201d he said, \u201cand because of these choices, the United States is today moving, as we said we would, to impose additional costs on Russia.\u201dThe hastily arranged statement, delivered with the presidential helicopter idling behind Mr. Obama before he left for a speech on the economy and a Democratic Party fund-raising event in Florida, underscored how the White House has raced to keep up with the rush of events in Ukraine.On Monday, Mr. Obama announced measures against a number of Russian officials while saying he would calibrate the pressure campaign to respond to Mr. Putin\u2019s actions. But a senior administration official said it became clear within 24 hours, with Mr. Putin\u2019s defiant speech to the Russian Parliament and dismissive statements by members of his government, that the United States would have to do more.\u201cThey were exulting in their nationalistic way,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the administration\u2019s internal deliberations. \u201cSo we moved from officials to cronies. These are Putin\u2019s money people.\u201dThe administration was also prodded by signs that the Russian military had moved troops into positions that could threaten southern and eastern Ukraine. While Mr. Obama has ruled out direct military involvement, another senior administration official told reporters that the Pentagon was studying whether to provide communications equipment and other nonlethal assistance to the Ukrainian military.The latest round of sanctions is surgical, experts said: designed to hit the wallets of individuals with close ties to Mr. Putin, rather than to damage the broader Russian economy.\u201cThe dollar figure is not big,\u201d said Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cBut these people are really close to Putin.\u201dIf Europe were to join the United States in targeting Russian individuals, and if Washington were to go after Russia\u2019s energy sector, \u201cThat would have a real economic effect,\u201d he said.New to the list were four men who have amassed vast empires through their ties to the government. In addition to Mr. Timchenko and Mr. Kovalchuk, they are Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, billionaire brothers who were awarded an estimated $7 billion in contracts for the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi.The Treasury also designated Bank Rossiya, the 17th-largest Russian bank, of which Mr. Kovalchuk is the largest shareholder. A senior official said that would pinch Mr. Putin and his friends because Rossiya would no longer be able to conduct transactions in dollars and would find its assets frozen in correspondent accounts in European banks.At least for now, though, a senior American official said he did not expect the European Union to target Russian business executives because it would require additional legal criteria. During Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s trip to Poland and the Baltic states this week, he encountered little desire for broader sanctions against Russia, even in countries with a long history of being subjugated by their Russian neighbor.Mr. Obama said more sweeping sanctions were not his \u201cpreferred outcome,\u201d and analysts said they did not expect him to impose them. Under a new executive order, he could target Russian industrial sectors, including energy, engineering, metals and mining, and financial services.\u201cRussia must know that further escalation will only isolate it further from the international community,\u201d he said.The economic calculus favors Washington, analysts said: Even significantly tougher sanctions \u2014 the kind applied to countries like Iran \u2014 would probably have only a muted effect on the American economy because of the modest size of the Russian economy and its limited trade ties with the United States.A senior Treasury official said there were already signs that the sanctions were having an impact. On Thursday, Standard & Poor\u2019s, the ratings agency, downgraded its outlook on the Russian economy to negative. And jitters over Crimea have weakened the Russian stock market and the value of the ruble.In Russia, officials reacted to the sanctions with a mix of indignation and contempt. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said: \u201cThey are illegitimate. They have no international legal grounds under them.\u201dMr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, denounced them as unacceptable and said Russia\u2019s response \u201cwill be based on the principle of reciprocity and will not take long.\u201d He suggested that one of those targeted, Sergei B. Ivanov, who spent over 20 years in the K.G.B.'s foreign intelligence service and is a close friend of Mr. Putin\u2019s, was already barred by \u201ca majority of countries in the West.\u201dAnother person on the list, Vladimir I. Yakunin, the head of the Russian Railways and a close friend of Mr. Putin\u2019s, said he was being punished for political reasons. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that a country that calls itself democratic uses sanctions for an honest position and for honest statements,\u201d he told the Interfax news agency.Until now, at least, the prospect of sanctions had done nothing to slow Russia\u2019s speedy absorption of Crimea.On Thursday, the lower house of the Russian Parliament ratified treaties making Crimea and, separately, the city of Sevastopol, parts of the Russian Federation.During the debate, many lawmakers wore black and orange czarist-era ribbons symbolizing military valor.An article on March 21 about the expansion of American sanctions against Russia after its annexation of Crimea misstated one of the colors of the czarist-era ribbons worn by Russian lawmakers during their vote to ratify treaties making Crimea and Sevastopol part of the Russian Federation. They were black and orange, not brown and orange.Mark Landler and Annie Lowrey reported from Washington, and Steven Lee Myers from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bangladesh's Coal Delusion", "Date": "2014-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Like most poor countries, Bangladesh needs a lot of energy to develop its economy, the cheaper the better. About 80 percent of its electricity now comes from natural gas. But with gas resources waning and an entrenched, inefficient subsidy system, the government has decided to promote coal instead. This shift comes with great risks: Coal power pollutes, and Bangladesh is at once the most densely populated country on earth and one of the most exposed to the effects of climate change. Under its 2010 master plan for developing the energy sector, the government hopes that by 2030, 50 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s power will be generated by coal, up from about 2 percent now. (Bangladesh currently has one small plant, which runs on local coal.) It expects to accomplish this by building a dozen new coal-run electricity-generating plants, including a controversial one at Rampal, in the southwest of the country. That facility alone is expected to have a capacity of 1,320 megawatts, or about one-fifth of the country\u2019s total current production of electricity. But the Rampal plant, which is scheduled to be completed by 2016, will be located less than 10 miles north of the Unesco-listed Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world and the home to the largest population of Bengal tigers and to the endangered Irrawaddy River dolphin. The forest also acts as a buffer against the deadly cyclones that periodically funnel up the Bay of Bengal. With every storm, estimates Anu Mohammad, an economist at Jahangirnagar University, the mangroves save hundreds of thousands of lives. Despite the Sudarbans\u2019 designation as a World Heritage Site in 1997, waterways will be dredged through the forest to allow convoys of coal-bearing ships to reach the Rampal station. Half a million tons of toxic sludge will be emitted by the plant annually, according to a report by the nearby Khulna University, and it will flow downstream into the forest\u2019s network of rivulets. Another problem, according to Mr. Anu, is that the Rampal project opens the way for opportunistic land grabs and the development of other polluting industrial activities in the area, including so-called ship breaking, the tearing apart of unwanted ships. Electricity production has doubled over the past five years, but Bangladesh is struggling to keep up. Domestic production of natural gas falls about 200 billion cubic feet, or about 20 percent, short of demand for electricity-generation every year: After decades of selling the commodity to consumers and the industrial sector at exceptionally cheap subsidized rates, the country is running out of gas, and state-owned energy companies are operating at a loss. In a merry-go-round of fiscal irresponsibility, state-owned banks hand out bad loans to insolvent companies, which only keeps the gas flowing cheaply and wastefully. All in all, the subsidies system cost the state approximately $3.4 billion in 2012, or nearly one-quarter of the budget, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. Bangladesh has gas reserves in the Bay of Bengal, but exploration has been slow. The state-owned exploration company doesn\u2019t have the capacity or know-how to exploit those resources. And foreign multinationals don\u2019t have the economic incentive: They wouldn\u2019t recoup enough of their investment selling on the massively subsidized local market. At recent auctions, no companies bid on deep-sea blocks, and only two companies bid for the shallow-water blocks. One result is that in recent years the country has had to import liquid fuels to power stopgap plants. This has increased the impoverished nation\u2019s annual imports bill by around $2 billion, out of around $30 billion, according to Mohammad Tamim, a professor of engineering at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. This is untenable in the long term, yet there are few alternatives. Nuclear power is touted, but for a country with little of the required infrastructure, that option seems fanciful. Although Bangladesh has great potential for renewables, policymakers haven\u2019t put in the necessary investment or planning to developing them. This is partly because of cronyism and corruption, and vested interests that are eager to maintain fossil-fuel monopolies. It is also because of basic economics: The power generated by the renewables project on Sandwip Island, for example, is still so expensive that the plant runs at only 50 percent of its capacity because locals can\u2019t afford to buy the electricity, even when it is discounted. And so coal it is for now, despite the risks. Coal is plentiful worldwide, and its price is relatively stable. But since exploiting Bangladesh\u2019s own reserves, for example in the north, would displace many people, the government has favored projects like Rampal: The area isn\u2019t very densely populated, and the plant will run on coal imported from Australia or Indonesia. Bangladesh seems to be caught in a bind. With demand for electricity growing by 10 percent a year, it will need to more than triple production, to over 30,000 megawatts by 2030. But that quantity isn\u2019t so large; the United States produces more than five times as much from renewable sources alone. And there are better ways for Bangladesh to relieve the pressure than turning to coal.Eventually the subsidy system should be entirely reformed. Not only is it inefficient; it doesn\u2019t help the poorest: Only 50 percent of Bangladeshis are on the grid. But reforms will raise gas prices, and in order to avoid related shocks to the economy and possible social unrest, they will have to be undertaken slowly.In the meantime, the gas grid itself should be made more efficient. Waste is rampant, and illegal connections to gas pipes are said to cost the government at least $30,000 a day. Revamping plants and cracking down on theft would reduce total gas bills, as well as the attached subsidy bills, even if the subsidy system remains in place. Foreign governments pump almost $3 billion in development assistance into Bangladesh annually. Instead of financing coal plants (as Japan plans to do in Matarbari), or ineffectual projects to improve governance, donors should channel aid toward developing renewable energy. The World Bank and other foreign donors have funded projects for the sale and distribution of solar-power home systems, helping 320,000 rural households generate small quantities of electricity. But large-scale projects feeding into a national grid are needed; they would allow economies of scale. These projects could be developed with support from China, which is promoting renewables at home, perhaps in exchange for the access it covets to a deep-water port in the Bay of Bengal.The government\u2019s environmental-impact assessment for the Rampal coal plant assures that \u201cthe long-term concentration\u201d of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide will not be significant because the pollutants \u201cmay periodically\u201d be dispersed by the cyclones that hit the area. Indeed. But those emissions will only feed more winds that later disperse them, again and again \u2014 until much of the delta\u2019s silty land is dispersed, too, by the angry rising tides of climate change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Role in Riyadh", "Date": "2014-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 When President Obama arrives here on Friday, he will find the world\u2019s foremost oil producer uncertain of its internal direction, rattled by regional upheaval, and deeply disillusioned about the reliability of its long-time strategic partner in Washington. His mission to restore trust won\u2019t be easy \u2014 not only because of different approaches to the Middle East\u2019s messy turmoil but also because of domestic challenges as Saudi Arabia transitions to a more-complicated, less-isolated society.Outwardly, this country appears an oasis of calm. But its confidence has been severely shaken as the old authoritarian Arab order has disintegrated, only to be replaced by sectarian tensions, civil wars and newly assertive Islamist groups that look askance at monarchies. Washington\u2019s acquiescence in the 2011 ousting of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, its reluctance to arm Syrian rebels, and its lukewarm response to Egypt\u2019s 2013 military coup deposing its first democratically elected leader \u2014 a coup Riyadh wholeheartedly endorsed \u2014 all muddied the bilateral relationship. Like their government, many ordinary Saudis are baffled by what they perceive as incompetent United States policies. Most remain notably pro-American and, ever polite, apologize before averring their lost faith in America\u2019s leader, variously described in as \u201cfeckless\u201d and \u201caddicted to wrong decision-making.\u201d They are most upset at the tentative dialogue Washington has started with Tehran, Riyadh\u2019s fiercest regional rival. The Saudis should be relieved because success would mean Iran agrees to abandon its nuclear weapon ambitions. But this potential benefit is overshadowed by Saudi fears of what might happen the day after Iran signs a nuclear pact: The United States disengages from the region, allowing Shiite Iran to embolden Shiite communities in the predominantly Sunni-ruled Arab world.  If the president could escape the chandeliered palaces of his hosts, he would glimpse another reality just as important for the American-Saudi relationship: That this country, whose native population is projected to reach more than 28 million by 2030, is in the throes of far-reaching transformation. He might see this capital city\u2019s sleek new traffic overpasses, its mushrooming skyscrapers and blueprints for its first subway system. He might view a tweet or YouTube video mocking a prince or religious cleric. Supermarkets and lingerie shops would be unlikely stops, so he wouldn\u2019t see another recent evolution: female cashiers and clerks. Change is unsettling for many Saudis and none more so than at the top. These days, as they sit beneath the ubiquitous pictures of their king, Saudis say they are worried about a potential succession struggle within the royal family. As one university professor explained, \u201cWe cannot predict the future, which means we are not stable, which means I don\u2019t feel secure.\u201dIn the last three years, dissidents, human rights advocates and critics of corruption \u2014 both Islamist and secular \u2014 have become increasingly vocal, especially on social media. A startling example came last July when an online statement contradicted the official Saudi stance supporting the Egyptian coup that ousted President Mohammed Morsi, and condemned the putsch. In response, the government has grown increasingly repressive, sending well-known activists like Abdullah al-Hamed and Mohammed al-Qahtani, the founders of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, to prison for a decade. And on March 7, it dropped a bombshell by designating the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 which has thousands of Saudi sympathizers and roots in the kingdom going back more than 50 years \u2014 as a terrorist organization. The order also outlawed discussion of atheism and many forms of public expression, including online statements. The predictable response was fear. Mouse clicks rippled across the kingdom as Twitter users deleted the four-finger image denoting support for Egypt\u2019s Brotherhood and its slain followers. These developments raise a fair question, given recent sales of American weapons to Saudi Arabia worth more than $45 billion: Is Saudi Arabia more threatened in the long run by an external military attack or by domestic unrest? Washington prefers to whisper criticism in the king\u2019s ear instead of publicly chastising its ally. For the Islamist activist Mohsen al-Awajy this signals that \u201cAmericans are caring about the royal family and are very much ignorant with regard to the Saudi people. Now, human rights are in the lowest level in Saudi Arabia and they are not talking about it.\u201dA nightmare scenario for Washington, one that could bring major rupture to American-Saudi relations, would be having to choose between the royal family and a rebellious citizenry. That scenario is not likely in the next few years. But it would be folly to be complacent. And to secure its long-term domestic future, the Saudi government needs to far more urgently address issues that have drawn mostly talk and baby steps. It needs to reign in the above-the-law status and financial expectations of an ever-growing royal family; replace Saudis\u2019 sense of entitlement created by an oil-based welfare state with a strong work ethic; tackle corruption, and mobilize a sometimes recalcitrant, lazy bureaucracy in educational and economic reforms that will create jobs and a diversified, globally competitive economy. Finally, Saudi Arabia\u2019s absolute monarchy would do well to heed two key messages from the uprisings that have upended the Middle East: Hurried transitions from dictatorships to superficial democracies produce chaos and more grief for the region\u2019s long-suffering residents. And deep-rooted problems left unresolved lead to unpredictable consequences. Saudi Arabia should implement what it so far refuses to even contemplate: A gradual but genuine sharing of power with the people. This need not be democracy as practiced in the West. But it should allow Saudis genuine participation in transparent decision-making and the freedom to build an independent, just and creative civil society. In other words, a model society for the 21st century Muslim world. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Asia's Trilateral Trade Talks", "Date": "2014-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialChina, Japan and South Korea are meeting in Seoul for a fourth round of negotiations to forge a trilateral free-trade agreement. Japan\u2019s relations with the two countries are so strained with disputes over history and territory that it is surprising the meetings are even taking place. This shows that these countries\u2019 leaders have not completely lost sight of the primacy of economics in East Asian relations.Since coming to power a year ago, both President Xi Jinping of China and President Park Geun-hye of South Korea have refused to meet with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, which is an extraordinary situation. China and South Korea, victims of the Japanese empire past, have formed a united front in their campaign to castigate Japan for what they deem to be its wrongheaded and unrepentant view of history, symbolized by Mr. Abe\u2019s visit to Yasukuni Shrine, where convicted World War II war criminals are enshrined among the country\u2019s war dead. Mr. Xi and Ms. Park derive domestic political advantage by stirring anti-Japanese nationalism. And China\u2019s moves in the East China Sea territorial dispute serve Mr. Abe\u2019s effort to elevate the status of the Japanese military. Even so, China is Japan\u2019s largest trading partner. And Japan is China\u2019s third-largest trading partner and South Korea\u2019s second. There is no doubt that economic stakes are high, and trade and investment intricately bind the three countries. For Japan and South Korea, mature economies with rapidly aging populations, successful management of international economic relations is crucial in their effort to sustain the welfare of their peoples. As for China, its rise is the world\u2019s big story. Under Mr. Xi\u2019s leadership, China is now inclined to demand special privileges, believing that it should be granted more deference by its neighbors. But it behooves Beijing\u2019s leaders to understand that China\u2019s expanding economic and military power cannot be sustained without deep engagement with the interdependent global economy.

{"Headline": "Is Canada Tarring Itself?", "Date": "2014-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSTART with the term \u201ctar sands.\u201d In Canada only fervent opponents of oil development in northern Alberta dare to use those words; the preferred phrase is the more reassuring \u201coil sands.\u201d Never mind that the \u201coil\u201d in the world\u2019s third largest petroleum reserve is in fact bitumen, a substance with the consistency of peanut butter, so viscous that another fossil fuel must be used to dilute it enough to make it flow. Never mind, too, that the process that turns bitumen into consumable oil is very dirty, even by the oil industry\u2019s standards. But say \u201ctar sands\u201d in Canada, and you\u2019ll risk being labeled unpatriotic, radical, subversive.Performing language makeovers is perhaps the most innocuous indication of the Canadian government\u2019s headlong embrace of the oil industry\u2019s wishes. Soon after becoming prime minister in 2006, Stephen Harper declared Canada \u201can emerging energy superpower,\u201d and nearly everything he\u2019s done since has buttressed this ambition. Forget the idea of Canada as dull, responsible and environmentally minded: That is so 20th century. Now it\u2019s a desperado, placing all its chips on a world-be-damned, climate-altering tar sands bet. Documents obtained by research institutions and environmental groups through freedom-of-information requests show a government bent on extracting as much tar sands oil as possible, as quickly as possible. From 2008 to 2012, oil industry representatives registered 2,733 communications with government officials, a number dwarfing those of other industries. The oil industry used these communications to recommend changes in legislation to facilitate tar sands and pipeline development. In the vast majority of instances, the government followed through.In the United States, the tar sands debate focuses on Keystone XL, the 1,200-mile pipeline that would link Alberta oil to the Gulf of Mexico. What is often overlooked is that Keystone XL is only one of 13 pipelines completed or proposed by the Harper government \u2014 they would extend for 10,000 miles, not just to the gulf, but to both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. After winning an outright parliamentary majority in 2011, Mr. Harper\u2019s Conservative Party passed an omnibus bill that revoked or weakened 70 environmental laws, including protections for rivers and fisheries. As a result, one proposed pipeline, the Northern Gateway, which crosses a thousand rivers and streams between Alberta and the Pacific, no longer risked violating the law. The changes also eliminated federal environmental review requirements for thousands of proposed development projects.President Obama\u2019s decision on Keystone XL, expected later this spring, is important not just because it will determine the pipeline\u2019s fate, but because it will give momentum to one side or the other in the larger tar sands battle. Consequently, the Canadian government\u2019s 2013-14 budget allocates nearly $22 million for pro-tar-sands promotional work outside Canada. It has used that money to buy ads and fund lobbyists in Washington and Europe, the latter as part of a continuing campaign against the European Union\u2019s bitumen-discouraging Fuel Quality Directive.Beginning in 2006, Mr. Harper pledged to promulgate regulations to limit carbon emissions, but eight years later the regulations still have not been issued, and he recently hinted that they might not be introduced for another \u201ccouple of years.\u201d Meanwhile, Canada became the only country to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol. Instead, in 2009 it signed the nonbinding Copenhagen Accord, which calls for Canada to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 17 percent beneath its 2005 level by 2020. According to the government\u2019s own projections, it won\u2019t even come close to that level. Climate change\u2019s impact on Canada is already substantial. Across Canada\u2019s western prairie provinces, an area larger than Alaska, mean temperatures have risen several degrees over the last 40 years, causing releases of greenhouse gases from melting permafrost and drying wetlands. The higher temperatures have led to the spread of the mountain pine beetle, which has consumed millions of trees. The trees, in turn, have become fodder for increasingly extensive forest fires, which release still more greenhouse gases. Given that scientists now think the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s boreal forests retain far more carbon than tropical rain forests like the Amazon, these developments are ominous. At least the Harper government has indirectly acknowledged climate change in one way: It has made a show of defending the Northwest Passage, an increasingly ice-free Arctic Ocean link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans that winds through Canadian territory.Nevertheless, the Harper government has shown its disdain for scientists and environmental groups dealing with climate change and industrial pollution. The government has either drastically cut or entirely eliminated funding for many facilities conducting research in climate change and air and water pollution. It has placed tight restrictions on when its 23,000 scientists may speak publicly and has given power to some department managers to block publication of peer-reviewed research. It has closed or \u201cconsolidated\u201d scientific libraries, sometimes thoughtlessly destroying invaluable collections in the process. And it has slashed funding for basic research, shifting allocations to applied research with potential payoffs for private companies. With a deft Orwellian touch, Canada\u2019s national health agency even accused a doctor in Alberta, John O\u2019Connor, of professional misconduct \u2014 raising \u201cundue alarm\u201d and promoting \u201ca sense of mistrust\u201d in government officials \u2014 after he reported in 2006 that an unusually high number of rare, apparently tar-sands-related cancers were showing up among residents of Fort Chipewyan, 150 miles downstream from the tar sands. A government review released in 2009 cautiously supported Dr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s claims, but officials have shown no interest in the residents\u2019 health since then. Dr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s experience intimidated other doctors, according to Margaret Sears, a toxicologist hired by the quasi-independent Alberta Energy Regulator to study health impacts in another region near the tar sands operation. Dr. Sears reported that some doctors cited Dr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s case as a reason for declining to treat patients who suggested a link between their symptoms and tar sands emissions. Few Canadians advocate immediately shutting down the tar sands \u2014 indeed, any public figure espousing that idea risks political oblivion. The government could defuse much tar sands opposition simply by advocating a more measured approach to its development, using the proceeds to head the country away from fossil fuels and toward a low-carbon, renewables-based future. That, in fact, was the policy recommended by the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, a nonpartisan, eminently moderate independent research group founded by another right-leaning prime minister, Brian Mulroney, in 1988.

{"Headline": "Court Jails Indian Tycoon", "Date": "2014-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Subrata Roy has long been one of Asia\u2019s most flamboyant billionaires, a bejeweled modern maharajah who lives on an opulent 270-acre estate and presides over the Sahara Group, which is, by its own account, the largest private employer in India. To his allies, Mr. Roy is an up-by-bootstraps hero who built from scratch a sprawling empire that provides vital financial services to the country\u2019s poor.The court contends that Sahara\u2019s investments were illegal and its investors fictitious, and it says that it will hold Mr. Roy until the company returns the billions it collected. The company insists that its investments were appropriate and its investors simply hard to find. At its heart, the dispute is over whether Sahara is one of the world\u2019s most important providers of credit to the deserving poor or a huge money-laundering operation for the crooked rich.In addition to being India\u2019s largest private employer, Sahara claims to be the country\u2019s largest private property owner and its largest private financial institution. Its 1.2 million employees work in about 4,800 finance offices as well as retail shops, hotels, hospitals, newspapers and power generation projects.Sahara executives, several of whom demanded anonymity because of the court proceedings, said the company had done nothing illegal and deserved a Nobel Peace Prize for its work. Any harm brought to Sahara, they said, could hurt all of India.People close to the present investigation who asked to remain anonymous because the case was still being adjudicated said that some of the country\u2019s most powerful politicians called securities regulators in recent years to ask for leniency for Mr. Roy.\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t the Sahara scam been denounced by any politician or political party, like every other scam has?\u201d asked Prithvi Haldea, a securities analyst who sits on government securities oversight committees. \u201cThere\u2019s a deafening silence on Sahara, and it\u2019s because they\u2019re all complicit.\u201dMr. Roy, 65, started Sahara in 1978 with $32 and a scooter that is now kept on a pedestal at the company\u2019s headquarters. He coaxed tiny but regular deposits from hundreds, then thousands, then millions of India\u2019s poor, promising in return to pay for a son\u2019s wedding, a daughter\u2019s dowry or a grandmother\u2019s operation in a service that was part bank, part insurance and part investment. He did not demand the blinding array of documents that Indian banks insist upon, and he and his employees often appeared at depositors\u2019 homes.The police went to his estate in Lucknow called Sahara Shahar, which has an artificial lake, its own gas station, a theater and a 5,000-seat auditorium. Mr. Roy was not present that day but turned himself in the next. Mr. Roy spent his first weekend in custody being pampered in a government guesthouse, but he is now lodged in the notorious Tihar Jail, South Asia\u2019s largest prison complex.\u201cIndia\u2019s present laws are hopelessly out of touch with what\u2019s happening in the real economy,\u201d Mr. Shah said.The World Bank has estimated that only 35 percent of India\u2019s adult population has access to formal banking services, and much of Sahara\u2019s business has been based on serving the remaining 65 percent \u2014 rickshaw pullers, tea vendors and farmers. Using millions of such tiny and untraceable deposits, Sahara reported that two of its companies had created privately placed bonds valued at $4 billion. But Indian law also requires that investments involving 50 or more people be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India, widely known as SEBI.For years the board peppered Sahara with questions about its bonds, and for years Sahara refused to provide answers. In one letter to the securities board, Sahara wrote that it could not answer in detail because \u201cmost of the staff remains on long holidays with their children, due to summer holidays\u201d \u2014 an explanation that prompted the Supreme Court to wonder derisively whether Sahara was \u201crunning a kindergarten where their staff were expected to be unavailable during the summer.\u201dAfter more orders by the board and the Supreme Court, Sahara provided compact discs that purportedly contained the identities of millions of investors, but Sahara refused to divulge the discs\u2019 passwords, regulators said.Then Sahara sent 127 trucks containing nearly 31,669 cartons that it said contained investment records from 30 million people. The cavalcade caused a huge traffic jam in Mumbai, the headquarters of the Securities and Exchange Board. But thousands of letters sent to investors by the board were returned undelivered.The Supreme Court\u2019s cursory examination of Sahara\u2019s investor list led it to conclude that many of the names \u201cmay well be fictitious, concocted and made up.\u201dSahara says it has already returned $3 billion to investors and given an additional $800 million to the board, and that is all that is due. But Securities and Exchange Board officials say that Sahara has provided no verifiable proof that it has paid back its millions of investors. The Supreme Court has ruled that if the board cannot find genuine Sahara investors, the money the company surrendered should be given to the government. With interest, the outstanding balance is $5.4 billion, the board said last Friday.In a hearing on Thursday, the court ordered Mr. Roy to remain in jail and asked the company to come up with a new plan to pay back the investors.

{"Headline": "How Strong Will the Anti-Democratic Backlash Be?", "Date": "2014-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy isn\u2019t the Republican Party paying a heavy price for its dependence on a shrinking white electorate, its rejection of immigration reform and its \u201cjust say no\u201d legislative strategy?\u201cON THE RECORD: Thank you President Obama.\u201dGoing largely unmentioned in most analyses is the inability of the Obama administration to markedly improve the economy, which could end up playing a big role in the unraveling of the Democratic Party\u2019s electoral fortunes, not only in 2014 but also in 2016.Perhaps McInturff should also be thanking Kathleen Sebelius, Obama\u2019s secretary of Health and Human Services, whose department oversaw the Healthcare.gov fiasco.As the figure illustrates, the generic vote shifted from a 5.5 percentage point Democratic advantage on Oct. 15, 2013, to a 2.5 percentage point Republican advantage on Dec. 2.Some political scientists, with a longer-term perspective, argue that no matter how dire Democratic prospects are for the midterm elections, future trends may be more positive.Ansolabehere is pessimistic about Democratic presidential prospects in 2016, noting that since the election of Harry Truman in 1948, no party has won the presidency three times in a row except the Republican Party of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible, but it is unlikely,\u201d Ansolabehere says.In addition, Trende argues, \u201cwhites might be a declining share of the electorate, but they\u2019re still over 70 percent of the electorate, meaning that if Republicans make relatively small improvements in their vote share with whites, they will achieve stasis.\u201dIn fact, a relatively modest boost in white turnout, combined with a slight drop in Democratic margins among minorities when Obama no longer the tops the ticket, Trende writes, will lead to numbers \u201cwell within tolerance for a big Republican win.\u201dThese analyses do not address a separate issue: the failure of the Obama administration to propel strong economic growth.Democratic election victories in recent years have resulted more from hostility to the Republican Party than from support gained through positive economic achievements.The Obama years have been marked by a prolonged period of economic stagnation, a falling standard of living for those in the bottom half and a growing schism in the distribution of income between top and bottom.Demographics look promising for the Democratic Party, but the people who make up those demographics seek economic change that the party shows no signs of delivering \u2013 and may not be able to deliver. The party has mastered the techniques of turning out its voters, at least in presidential election years, but it now faces the much more difficult task of improving the lives of its supporters.It\u2019s not clear that the Democratic Party, as currently constituted, is prepared to take on that task. Has it even conceptualized, let alone implemented, adequate economic or political innovation? Nor is it clear whether the global and domestic forces now imposing such heavy costs on the poor and even the middle class lend themselves to government-directed amelioration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Rational Response to Ukraine\u2019s Crisis", "Date": "2014-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialBut the crisis is not over: Russia remains in control of Crimea, and Mr. Putin prepared the way for possible annexation of the peninsula to Russia when he said it was up to Crimean citizens, a majority of whom are Russian-speaking, to determine their future. The question remains what the United States and the European Union should or can do. The Ukrainian crisis has provoked a broad range of reactions in the West, including angry demands for immediate sanctions against Russia and charges in the United States that President Obama is somehow \u201closing\u201d in the confrontation to Mr. Putin and thus endangering Washington\u2019s credibility and global leadership. Yet leadership and credibility in a crisis mean reacting coolly and rationally, not rattling sabers, or rushing into economic warfare that allies may or may not support, or painting \u201cred lines\u201d that the other side can cross with impunity.A bully welcomes a slugfest, and Mr. Putin revels in claiming American conspiracies; at his news conference on Tuesday, he even described the battering to Russia\u2019s markets on Monday as a result of American policies. But that battering and the decline of the value of the ruble were no doubt major factors behind Mr. Putin\u2019s conciliatory tone on Tuesday. The Russian economy is not in great shape, and Russian businessmen understand full well that the $60 billion wiped off the value of their firms on Monday was because of a needless crisis. Mr. Putin and his countrymen must be reminded, again and again, that seizing Crimea under a blatantly concocted pretext, or taking other measures against the new authorities in Ukraine, will carry a price.Short of war, there is little the United States can do on its own to punish Russia. It is not among Russia\u2019s major trading partners. Europe, which does far more business with Russia, has more leverage, but also a dependence on Russian gas, and, so far, European leaders have shown little enthusiasm for economic sanctions. These are exactly the buttons Mr. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are pushing \u2014 threatening further isolation if Mr. Putin does not back down, and cooperation if he does, while rallying allies and pledging substantial assistance to the new authorities in Ukraine.Closing the door to any further dealings with Mr. Putin, as hard-core cold-warriors want Mr. Obama to do, would not serve any purpose. Russia has already announced that it is ending discounts on the sale of Russian gas to Ukraine, and it could make life even more difficult for its bankrupt neighbor. But at his news conference, Mr. Putin said he felt a sympathy for the longing of the Kiev crowds to throw out a corrupt regime, and he insisted that Russian and Ukrainian soldiers \u201cwill be on the same side of the barricades.\u201dIf he meant all that, then he must agree that the optimal conclusion to the crisis would be the election of a balanced Parliament and a universally accepted president in Ukraine, which would also reassure Russians that their ties to Ukraine, including Crimea, won\u2019t be severed. The United States and its European allies must prepare contingency plans for any escalation of Russian aggression or for the unilateral annexation of Crimea. The Europeans will have to overcome their reluctance on sanctions and form a common front with the United States. But, at the same time, they should reassure Mr. Putin that the West appreciates Russia\u2019s historic ties to Ukraine and has no interest in turning Kiev against Moscow. So far, Mr. Obama is on the right track. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Crimea Crisis Has Little Impact Thus Far on Russian Oil Deals", "Date": "2014-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The French energy giant Total is in talks with Lukoil to form a joint venture to develop shale oil in Russia, as Moscow seeks to offset declining production from its conventional oil fields in Siberia.The talks began before the Crimean crisis and are continuing, according to an oil company executive close to the negotiations who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. Lukoil and Total declined to comment on the project.Lukoil, one of Russia\u2019s largest oil companies, has a pilot drilling project in the massive, but so far unproductive, Bazhenov shale-rock oil deposit in Siberia, which by some estimates could be the largest reserve of shale oil in the world. Unlike conventional drilling, shale extraction involves forcing oil or gas from tight deposits of rock using new techniques like hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which many environmentalists oppose.The prospect of a Russian-French deal to develop shale oil in Siberia is noteworthy not only in the context of today\u2019s geopolitical tension, or because of the importance of future oil output for Russia\u2019s economy, but also because France\u2019s resistance to fracking for environmental reasons means that Total would be doing in Russia what it cannot do on its home turf.The executive close to the talks said that \u201cno decision has been reached\u201d between the companies.Word of the discussions was reported earlier by The Financial Times.The limited economic sanctions imposed by the European Union because of Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea do not cover Russian oil companies. President Obama has approved but not put into effect sanctions aimed at sectors of Russia\u2019s economy that include those petroleum companies.James Henderson, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies, said it was unlikely that the current breakdown in relations between Russia and the West would be sufficient to derail the Total-Lukoil talks.\u201cIt would take a much bigger sanctions package \u2014 think Iran-type sanctions \u2014 for something like this to be sabotaged,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet.\u201dThe companies had been talking long before the Russian annexation of Crimea. Total is in Russia \u201cfor the long term,\u201d Christophe de Margerie, the Total chairman and chief executive, said this month at a conference in Houston.Total has been working in Russia since 1991, and last year it produced about 207,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day there. At the current rate of development, the company says, its Russian operations will be among its most important regions of production by 2018.But if Russia were to invade eastern Ukraine, Mr. Henderson said, Total\u2019s joint venture would be in jeopardy. \u201cThings like this would be seriously questioned,\u201d he said, even without the threat of harsher sanctions, because it would sharply raise the perceived riskiness of investing in Russia.Many environmentalists oppose fracking because they fear that the technique, which involves pumping a mixture of water, sand and chemicals at high pressures into shale formations deep underground to free the petroleum trapped inside, pollutes groundwater.There have also been concerns that fracking creates geological instability, causing earthquakes.Total has nonetheless moved ahead overseas, paying nearly $2.25 billion in 2009 for a 25 percent stake in Chesapeake Energy\u2019s Barnett Shale assets in Texas and $2.3 billion in 2012 for a similar stake in Chesapeake and EnerVest\u2019s Utica project in Ohio. More recently, it took the lead on two shale gas exploration licenses in the East Midlands region of Britain.On Thursday, Total said that exploration on its Xuancheng shale gas project in China was moving ahead with its local partner, Sinopec.Russia\u2019s oil flow of about 10 million barrels a day is projected to decline by about a million barrels by the end of the decade unless companies drill offshore in the Arctic or master the skills to tap shale oil on land. Exxon Mobil is in a joint venture agreement with Rosneft, the Russian state oil company, to drill test wells into Siberian shale oil fields, including in the Bazhenov.\u201cIn the longer term, production from offshore oilfields in the Arctic is the big theme,\u201d Mr. Henderson said, \u201cbut in the medium-term, unconventional oil resources could help to fill the gap.\u201dOther Western energy giants, Statoil and Shell, also through joint ventures, are testing Russian shale oil beds. These existing joint ventures intended to increase shale oil production are expected to continue. Rosneft said in a statement Friday that its shale joint venture with Exxon was \u201cprogressing normally and our plans are not impacted.\u201dThe United States Geological Survey estimates the overall supply of Russian shale oil in West Siberia at 80 billion to 140 billion barrels. For comparison, Russia\u2019s reserves of conventional oil total 67 billion barrels.Most of that shale is in the Bazhenov deposit, considered similar in its vast potential to the Bakken shale field in North Dakota, perhaps the most successful American oil shale patch. The Bazhenov is far larger, covering an area the size of Texas and the Gulf of Mexico combined. It is unclear, though, how much of the petroleum locked up there, if any, will be economically viable to pump.Further piquing international oil companies\u2019 interest in Russian shale deposits this year, the Russian government, to encourage drilling, waived its usual $22 per barrel extraction tax when oil is produced from shale.In other signs Russian and Western businesses are quietly reaching rapprochements even as their governments wield threats, the board of Aeroflot, Russia\u2019s national airline, on Friday approved the purchase of 13 new Airbus A320 airplanes.And this month, a delegation of the American company Boeing visited a major Russian titanium parts supplier, VSMPO-Avisma.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Engineers Allege Hiring Collusion in Silicon Valley", "Date": "2014-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Tech companies love new ideas, unless they belong to someone else. Then any breakthroughs must be neutralized or bought. Silicon Valley executives know all too well that a competitor\u2019s unchecked innovation can quickly topple the mightiest tech titan.Instead, the court documents portray the engineers as \u201cvictims of a conspiracy\u201d who were cheated by their bosses, said Joseph R. Saveri, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. \u201cThese are the engineers building the hardware and software that are the lifeblood of the technology industry,\u201d Mr. Saveri said. \u201cBut they were prevented from being able to freely negotiate what their skills are worth.\u201dMr. Jobs was particularly worried about Google, which was hiring rapidly and expanding into areas where Apple had an interest. In 2005, for instance, Google\u2019s co-founder, Sergey Brin, tried to hire from Apple\u2019s browser team. \u201cIf you hire a single one of these people that means war,\u201d Mr. Jobs warned in an email, according to court papers.Mr. Brin backed off, and Google and Mr. Jobs soon came to an informal agreement not to solicit each other\u2019s employees. Apple made similar deals with other companies. So did Google.By 2007, when a Google recruiter slipped up and contacted an Apple engineer, Mr. Jobs immediately complained. To appease the Apple chief, Google fired the recruiter within an hour. Mr. Jobs\u2019s control extended even to former Apple engineers. When Google wanted to hire some, the suit says, Mr. Jobs vetoed the idea.Google declined to comment for this article. Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Alan Hyde, a Rutgers professor who wrote \u201cWorking in Silicon Valley: Economic and Legal Analysis of a High-Velocity Labor Market,\u201d said the no-poaching accusations go contrary to what has made the valley so successful: job-hopping.\u201cThere is a fair amount of research that tech companies, particularly in California, have distinctive personnel practices,\u201d he said. \u201cThey hire for short tenures and keep ties with former employees so there can be an exchange of information across company lines. The companies in this suit might have been killing the golden goose.\u201dThey certainly tried to keep their practices quiet. Eric E. Schmidt, then Google\u2019s chief executive, said he preferred that the company\u2019s Do Not Call list be shared orally, according to court papers, \u201csince I don\u2019t want to create a paper trail over which we can be sued later.\u201dIn a similar vein, an Intel recruiter asked Paul S. Otellini, the company\u2019s chief executive, about a hands-off deal with Google.\u201cWe have nothing signed,\u201d Mr. Otellini responded in an email. \u201cWe have a handshake \u2018no recruit\u2019 between Eric and myself. I would not like this broadly known.\u201dThe origins of the conspiracy, according to the lawsuit, date back to the 1980s, when the filmmaker George Lucas sold part of his company to Mr. Jobs. \u201cWe cannot get into a bidding war with other companies because we don\u2019t have the margins for that sort of thing,\u201d Mr. Lucas is quoted as saying in the court papers. So Lucasfilm and what was to become Pixar made a deal that there would be no cold-calling, that they would notify each other when offering a job to an employee and that any offer was final and would not be improved in response to a counteroffer.What worked for Pixar would work for Apple, Mr. Jobs decided. The hands-off deals might have been more widespread than many in the valley assumed. The Justice Department is currently pursuing a case against eBay, accusing it of having an illegal no-poaching deal with Intuit. An eBay spokeswoman said the company was in settlement talks with the government.Pixar (bought by Disney for $7 billion in 2006) and Lucasfilm (bought by Disney for $4 billion in 2012) have already settled the class-action suit, as has Intuit. The three companies agreed to pay a total of $20 million. The engineers will get their day in court to face the remaining defendants. Which does not mean they will get much sympathy.\u201cSanta Clara County, in the heart of Silicon Valley, has the highest average wage in the country,\u201d said Stephen Levy, senior economist at the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. \u201cSan Francisco and San Mateo are not far behind. It would be a mistake to think of these plaintiffs as an oppressed set of victims.\u201dOnly one Silicon Valley executive appears to have resisted Mr. Jobs\u2019s threats and blandishments.In the summer of 2007, Palm Inc., a maker of hand-held devices, hired Jonathan J. Rubinstein, a highly respected former Apple executive who played a key role in developing the iPod. Apple engineers were clamoring to work with him.Mr. Jobs proposed a no-poaching deal to Edward T. Colligan, Palm\u2019s chief executive. Mr. Colligan responded that such a deal would be unfair to employees as well as \u201clikely illegal.\u201d Mr. Jobs then threatened to unleash Apple\u2019s patent lawyers on Palm.A patent suit \u201ccertainly had the potential for creating some havoc,\u201d Mr. Colligan said in an interview. But he said he felt it was important not to bend.\u201cA lot of times you\u2019re confronted with things that may be advantageous, but you have to make the critical decision that morally, it is not right,\u201d he said, noting that Apple never did sue. \u201cUnfortunately, this does not happen as often as it should.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The hiss of a milk steamer broke through the low buzz of conversation as a man in a red flannel shirt brewed cappuccino at a food bar.A year earlier, Mr. Santacruz, who has two degrees in finance, was living in Paris near the Place de la Madeleine, working in a boutique finance firm. He had taken that job after his attempt to start a business in Marseille foundered under a pile of government regulations and a seemingly endless parade of taxes. The episode left him wary of starting any new projects in France. Yet he still hungered to be his own boss.He decided that he would try again. Just not in his own country.\u201cA lot of people are like, \u2018Why would you ever leave France?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Santacruz said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you. France has a lot of problems. There\u2019s a feeling of gloom that seems to be growing deeper. The economy is not going well, and if you want to get ahead or run your own business, the environment is not good.\u201dFrom 80 to 90 percent of all start-ups fail, \u201cbut that\u2019s O.K.,\u201d said Eze Vidra, the head of Google for Entrepreneurs Europe and of Campus London, a free work space in the city\u2019s booming technology hub. In Britain and the United States, \u201cit\u2019s not considered bad if you have failed,\u201d Mr. Vidra said. \u201cYou learn from failure in order to maximize success.\u201dThat is the kind of thinking that drew Mr. Santacruz to London. \u201cThings are different in France,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a fear of failure. If you fail, it\u2019s like the ultimate shame. In London, there\u2019s this can-do attitude, and a sense that anything\u2019s possible. If you make an error, you can get up again.\u201dMr. Santacruz had a hard time explaining to his parents his decision to leave France. \u201cThey think I\u2019m crazy, maybe sick, taking all those risks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to wait until I\u2019m 60 to live my life.\u201dFrance has been losing talented citizens to other countries for decades, but the current exodus of entrepreneurs and young people is happening at a moment when France can ill afford it. The nation has had low-to-stagnant economic growth for the last five years and a generally climbing unemployment rate \u2014 now about 11 percent \u2014 and analysts warn that it risks sliding into economic sclerosis.Some wealthy businesspeople have also been packing their bags. While entrepreneurs fret about the difficulties of getting a business off the ground, those who have succeeded in doing so say that society stigmatizes financial success. The election of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a member of the Socialist Party who once declared, \u201cI don\u2019t like the rich,\u201d did little to contradict that impression.After denying that there was a problem, Mr. Hollande is suddenly shifting gears. Since the beginning of the year, he has taken to the podium under the gilded eaves of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace several times with significant proposals to make France more alluring for entrepreneurs and business, while seeking to preserve the nation\u2019s model of social protection.Next month, the National Assembly will convene a panel to examine the issue.Today, around 1.6 million of France\u2019s 63 million citizens live outside the country. That is not a huge share, but it is up 60 percent from 2000, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Thousands are heading to Hong Kong, Mexico City, New York, Shanghai and other cities. About 50,000 French nationals live in Silicon Valley alone.But for the most part, they have fled across the English Channel, just a two-hour Eurostar ride from Paris. Around 350,000 French nationals are now rooted in Britain, about the same population as Nice, France\u2019s fifth-largest city. So many French citizens are in London that locals have taken to calling it \u201cParis on the Thames.\u201dIn the past, most of these people would have gone back to France after some adventure and experience. That may still be true of some in the French diaspora, but nearly 40 percent of French people abroad now say they plan to stay there for at least 10 years, according to the report by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Many are quietly saying that they may not return.Taxes, Frustration, More TaxesMr. Santacruz grew up in his parents\u2019 small, tidy home in a suburb of Aix-en-Provence in the south of France. During one of his summer breaks from college in Bordeaux, he visited a cousin who had become rich working in finance and lived in a sprawling residence in the Luberon Valley. When Mr. Santacruz drove up to the entrance, electronic gates opened to a vast garden.\u201cIt was crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI drove five minutes just to reach the house. That\u2019s when I thought, \u2018I want to make it like him.\u2019\u00a0\u201dA one-month wait for a license turned into three months, then six. They tried simplifying the corporate structure but were stymied by regulatory hurdles. Hiring was delayed, partly because of social taxes that companies pay on salaries. In France, the share of nonwage costs for employers to fund unemployment benefits, education, health care and pensions is more than 33 percent. In Britain, it is around 20 percent.\u201cEvery week, more tax letters would come,\u201d Mr. Santacruz recalled.The government has since simplified procedures and reduced the social costs for start-ups. But those changes came too late for Mr. Santacruz, whose venture folded before it could get off the ground.His parents were relieved when he took a job in Paris at the boutique firm NFinance. But he knew that it was a way station. He quickly turned to drawing up blueprints for a new venture.\u201cI asked myself, \u2018Where will I have the bigger opportunity in Europe?\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cLondon was the obvious choice. It\u2019s more dynamic and international, business funding is easier to get, and it\u2019s a better base if you want to expand.\u201d\u201cThe French are expatriating themselves more and more, but this is encouraging,\u201d Mr. Emi\u00e9 told me. \u201cWe are not worried about it. They get experience, create wealth, and then they will bring that back to France.\u201dDefeat is seen as so ignominious that France\u2019s central bank alerts lenders to entrepreneurs who have filed for bankruptcy, effectively preventing them from obtaining money for new projects \u2014 a practice that Ms. Pellerin would halt.These changes were welcomed by business, but the more than 20 French expatriates I interviewed\u00a0said their country was marked by a deeper antipathy toward the wealthy than could be addressed with a few new policies.Mr. Hollande\u2019s election, and especially his proposal \u2014 since ruled unconstitutional \u2014 to impose a 75 percent tax on the portion of income above one million euros (about $1.4 million) a year, have only reinforced that perception.\u201cIt is a French cultural characteristic that goes back to almost the revolution and Robespierre, where there\u2019s a deep-rooted feeling that you don\u2019t show that you make money,\u201d Ms. Segalen, the recruiter, said. \u201cThere is this sense that \u2018libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9\u2019 means that what\u2019s yours should be mine. It\u2019s more like, if someone has something I can\u2019t have, I\u2019d rather deprive this person from having it than trying to work hard to get it myself. That\u2019s a very French state of mind. But it\u2019s a race to the bottom.\u201dSharing Space, Waiting TablesMr. Santacruz\u2019s efforts to get Zipcube off the ground were full of fits and starts. While London had opportunities, living there was tougher than he had imagined. His apartment in Paris had been spacious, with tasteful modern furniture and French windows overlooking the gold statues atop the Paris Opera. After work, he would go to places like the H\u00f4tel Costes or Le Forum, a bar on the Right Bank, to talk and to sip cocktails.In London, he had none of that. Without a steady income, he was renting a room in a leaky group house with three roommates. He had also taken a night job as a waiter at Momo, a Moroccan restaurant near Oxford Circus, earning 6.50 pounds (about $10.80) an hour to make ends meet. He would come to Campus London every day to work on Zipcube, but by 4:30 he had to leave to be on time for his shift at Momo, which ended at 2 a.m.Embarrassed, he hid the restaurant job from his family for two months.\u201cSometimes I do ask myself if I\u2019m making the right choice,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t take risks, there will be no reward.\u201d\u201cIn London, every day is a fight,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then you get rewarded. I don\u2019t think this would have been possible in France.\u201dThe growing number of French people settling in London is a sign that France needs to enhance competitiveness, Ms. Lemaire told me one afternoon in her office near Camden Market. But Anglo-Saxon-style capitalism was not the solution if it would compromise France\u2019s social model, which she sees as protecting citizens from the ravages of the free market.In Britain, \u201cit has been surprising to see the level of deprivation of some of my fellow citizens,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen things fail here, they can wind up without a penny in their pockets, living on the street. That\u2019s the part of the story you don\u2019t hear.\u201dAt the same time, she said, France\u2019s generous safety net could not continue unchanged without risking further economic malaise. \u201cSocialist politicians all agree on that now,\u201d Ms. Lemaire said.Back in France, Mr. Santacruz\u2019s parents were still trying to grasp their son\u2019s decision. Having spent her career at the state telecom company, his mother, like many others in her generation, assumed that her children\u2019s main aspiration would also be lifelong job security.\u201cIt\u2019s 35 hours a week, good vacation, a pension and protections,\u201d she told me. \u201cO.K., it\u2019s not very interesting, and I don\u2019t get paid much. But it\u2019s stable. I thought that\u2019s a dream that our young people would want, too.\u201dHis father saw Mr. Santacruz\u2019s move as courageous but felt vexed to have invested in his son\u2019s degrees, only to see him leave his country in a state of disillusionment.The elder Mr. Santacruz had grown up poor, but eventually got a job as a government customs official.\u201cFrance gave me an opportunity to make a life,\u201d he said. \u201cThe French Republic formed me, and it also formed Guillaume. When I hear young people disparage the country as they leave, I don\u2019t like that. The children of France should not forget that the state has given them a lot.\u201dFrance? Maybe for RetirementGuillaume Santacruz was grateful for the benefits that his country gave him. But he wanted something else \u2014 to innovate. By September, his project was not where he wanted it to be. Yet he maintained that he was better off pursuing it outside France.He had incorporated Zipcube and had bites of interest from an executive at Booking.com, a website for booking hotel rooms. But Knut, the investor, was not willing to invest after all, and Mr. Santacruz was again seeking financing.Even if Zipcube fell apart, he told me one chilly weekend at his Kensington flat, where paint was peeling off the walls, \u201cI would not change my mind and head back to France; I see only cons to doing that, no pros.\u201d He was skeptical that the government\u2019s recent offensive to spur France\u2019s entrepreneurial environment would quickly bear fruit.Several of his French friends in London felt the same way. \u201cI asked them, if things don\u2019t work out, will they go back? Not one of them would,\u201d Mr. Santacruz said. \u201cMaybe for retirement. But not for work \u2014 we\u2019d rather go to the United States or Asia before returning.\u201d France seemed to have lost another citizen in the prime of his productive working years.And while the bar to succeed was high, \u201cI\u2019m confident I\u2019m going to make it,\u201d he declared.An article last Sunday about entrepreneurs who have left their native France referred incorrectly to Milestone Capital Partners, the firm that employs Erick Rinner, a French executive who has lived in London for 20 years. Milestone is a British-French private equity firm, not a British-based investment bank.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Free Craft Beer!", "Date": "2014-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionCRAFT breweries may be a big story in the media these days, but they face much tougher challenges than most other small businesses.Take the rules governing how beer is distributed, known as franchise laws, which were written decades ago and today are being used to limit consumer choice by keeping small and start-up breweries from moving easily into new markets.Almost every state franchise law demands that breweries sign a strict contract with a single distributor in a state \u2014 the so-called three-tiered system. The contracts not only prevent other companies from distributing a company\u2019s beers, but also give the distributor virtual carte blanche to decide how the beer is sold and placed in stores and bars \u2014 in essence, the distributor owns the brand inside that state.This model was enacted in the 1970s, when the industry was a lot different: Back then there were fewer than 50 brewing companies in America and 5,000 distributors. Many small distributors carried beer only from one large brewer, and they needed protection in case the brewer they represented wanted to pull its product.But today, while Big Beer remains big business, there are more than 2,700 breweries, and fewer than 1,000 viable distributors, so that relatively few distributors control huge sections of national territory, and each one can take on dozens of large and small breweries\u2019 brands.Nevertheless, state laws continue to empower distributors to select brands and manage them however they want \u2014 selling those they choose to sell, while letting other brands sit in their warehouses. The only recourse is to sue, and many small breweries lack even a fraction of the resources needed to take on a big distributor in court. As a result, they\u2019re stuck with the bad distributor, which severely hampers their ability to perform and grow as a business.Buy a small brewer a beer, and pretty soon he or she will be regaling you with war stories about fights with distributors.For example, I once tried to terminate a contract with an underperforming distributor in New York for not only selling my products outside of his territory, but selling out-of-date beer. I thought it would be straightforward, since my contract said I could leave \u201cwith or without cause.\u201dBut the distributor took us to court, saying the state\u2019s franchise law, which sets a high standard for showing cause, trumped whatever my contract said. Two State Supreme Court rulings upheld my position, but, fearing a further appeal, I settled out of court. I was freed from the contract, but the legal fees and settlement cost Brooklyn Brewery more than $300,000.Stories like this abound: My fellow craft brewers at Dogfish Head, in Delaware, faced a half-decade-long, six-figure legal dispute with a distributor just to terminate their contract.Even worse, some small brewers refuse to enter certain markets because of the local distributors\u2019 reputation. That\u2019s bad for these businesses, and bad for the economy, but particularly bad for consumers, who would love to try the latest popular craft beers but can\u2019t find them in their state.Some states have remedied the distribution inequities. In 2012 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and the State Legislature created a \u201ccarve out\u201d from the state\u2019s beer franchise law for the smallest brewers: If your brewery represents less than 3 percent of a distributor\u2019s business, and you produce fewer than 300,000 barrels of beer a year (which covers all but the largest craft breweries), you can switch distributors by paying for the \u201cfair market value\u201d of the distribution rights, as negotiated by the brewer and distributor \u2014 still an expensive proposition, but easier than going to court.North Carolina has a similar law, while in Washington State, small brewers are excluded from the state\u2019s franchise laws completely. Just last week Michigan enacted a law allowing very small brewers to self-distribute. And several other states, including Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, are considering revising their beer laws to allow small brewers to do the same.As the craft-beer sector expands, states are waking up to the economic benefits it offers \u2014 in jobs, tourism and taxes. Many states now offer subsidies and regulatory assistance for new breweries. But too few states have taken on the tougher job of pushing against distributors and their lobbyists.For small brewers, the flexibility to change distributors or distribute their own products is essential to gain access to markets, increase consumer choice, grow and pour money back into the economy. The success or failure of a beer should depend on whether consumers like it \u2014 not on whether archaic distribution laws prevent them from finding it in the first place.A founder and the president of Brooklyn Brewery and a member of the Brewers Association board of directors.

{"Headline": "Copycat Business Model Generates Genuine Global Success for Start-Up Incubator", "Date": "2014-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom its low-key offices near the center of the city, Rocket Internet has turned the usual business model for technology companies on its head, compiling a team of high-flying finance and management specialists and arming them with the money they need to mimic already successful Internet companies \u2014 applying these proven ideas in other countries, often in emerging markets.Since starting in 2007, Rocket has backed about 75 start-ups in more than 50 countries that now generate more than $3 billion in annual revenue and employ about 25,000 people.The business model stands in sharp contrast with the ethos that dominates Silicon Valley, where originality is perceived as the main currency for successful start-ups. It also has raised questions over whether Europe\u2019s tech sector, where Rocket is a major player, can ever foster the same level of innovation that has led to a conveyor belt of successful American tech giants like Oracle, Google and Facebook.Still, Rocket Internet balks at criticism that it is purely a copycat machine. It says all successful business ideas are somewhat borrowed from others, and the ability to take proven tech ideas to emerging markets is a skill unto itself. The small tech start-ups that Rocket supports are often given as little as six months to succeed or face being shut down.\u201cIf there\u2019s a clear business model that is proven to work, we will look at it,\u201d said Oliver Samwer, 41, one of three brothers who started Rocket Internet, and who travels almost constantly to visit the company\u2019s global portfolio of tech start-ups. \u201cEvery new company is like a speedboat, and we want them to become aircraft carriers.\u201dThe rapid expansion has fueled speculation that some of the tech firms could either be bought by larger United States rivals that want to expand globally or potentially become public companies through multibillion-dollar initial public offerings.\u201cRocket has disrupted the entire venture capital industry,\u201d said Christophe F. Maire, a leading Berlin-based investor who has backed several of the city\u2019s best-known start-ups, though none from Rocket Internet. \u201cIt has groomed a lot of people in the art of going international.\u201dBut the success has also raised questions about the value of a company that essentially depends on the ideas of others. Although the Rocket-supported companies are free to copy existing tech businesses as long as they do not infringe on copyrights and trademarks, there is nothing to stop competitors from rising up and pursuing the same strategy. And some companies have already popped up to parrot Rocket\u2019s business model.While the company has created a growing stable of global e-commerce start-ups, it has had less success with other Internet businesses. The company\u2019s version of Pinterest, for example, which allows people to share photographs and other media, has so far failed to win over many consumers.And after Airbnb held talks in 2011 about acquiring Rocket\u2019s Berlin-based copy, the American short-term housing website eventually decided to beef up its own international operations instead of buying the smaller rival.Others in the tech industry question whether Rocket Internet can maintain its success rate, as start-ups from Silicon Valley to Singapore look to expand globally as quickly as possible. That could cut the time Rocket Internet has to replicate successful tech ideas in emerging economies and other non-American markets.\u201cJust copying what the Americans have done is no longer a sustainable model,\u201d said Simon Cook, chief executive of the European venture firm DFJ Espirit.So far, though, no one has found the kind of success that Rocket has.\u201cWe don\u2019t worry if someone else has launched a similar business model before,\u201d said Mr. Samwer, who receives monthly updates on the company\u2019s start-ups during a marathon 20-hour conference call where each business leader is allotted just 30 minutes of Mr. Samwer\u2019s time. \u201cThe Internet moves at Formula One speed; execution is the most important component of a successful business.\u201dThe track record of the Samwer brothers behind the company \u2014 Oliver, Marc and Alexander \u2014 dates to the first dot-com boom when they sold Alando, a German version of eBay, to its larger American rival for $50 million. The entrepreneurs, who were in their mid-20s, built and sold the start-up in less than 100 days.After the eBay deal, they used some of the proceeds to start Jamba, a mobile phone services company that produced the Crazy Frog ringtone, which they sold to the American tech company Verisign for $270 million in 2004. The three German brothers also have bought and sold stakes over the years in a number of high-profile American start-ups, including Facebook, Groupon and Zynga, which have gone on to become global household names.Now, they focus their attention on building start-ups around the world. And the formula is relatively simple.Typically, Rocket\u2019s core team finds the ideas (on a few occasions, outsides have brought them business plans), then brings in entrepreneurs to run the businesses. The Samwer brothers give M.B.A. graduates and former banking traders \u2014 often from companies like Goldman Sachs and McKinsey \u2014 as much as $20 million in early-stage investment. They are then dispatched to distant places like Moscow and Jakarta, Indonesia, where American rivals have yet to establish a strong foothold. Along with borrowing ideas from some of the world\u2019s largest and most established e-commerce Internet companies, the company\u2019s entrepreneurs also have emulated younger businesses like Square, the mobile-payments company founded by Jack Dorsey, the chairman of Twitter.The pressure is intense on the start-up managers, who are usually paid a salary and do not receive a major stake in the company they operate.Several current and former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to harm their future career opportunities, remember high-pressured arguments when financial targets were not met and late-night calls from senior managers ordering them back to the office.But Ralf Wenzel and his company are evidence that the method works.As the co-founder of FoodPanda, an online takeout delivery service for restaurants that mirrors the popular American company GrubHub, Mr. Wenzel juggles a 650-person team spread across more than 40 countries.\u201cWe\u2019re a global, not European, company,\u201d said Mr. Wenzel, 35, who spends roughly 80 percent of his time traveling between the company\u2019s international offices. \u201cGetting to these new markets quickly gives us a huge competitive advantage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "European Officials Reach Deal on Failed-Bank System", "Date": "2014-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European Union lawmakers and finance officials reached a political agreement early Thursday on the structure of a system meant to prevent failing banks from unleashing the kind of havoc that has periodically threatened the survival of the euro in recent years.The agreement \u2014 a preliminary deal among leaders of the political parties in the European Parliament and representatives from member states and the European Commission \u2014 responds to complaints by the European Central Bank and others that earlier plans were insufficiently financed and too cumbersome to deal with a fast-moving financial crisis.The accord, compared with earlier draft versions, would make more shared funds available sooner to pay for shutting down failing banks in a crisis. It would also set up a procedure for shutting down a terminally ill bank quickly to avoid a wider contagion like the one caused by the failure of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008.The agreement, a result of an all-night session typical of decision-making in the European Union, represents a crucial piece of a multilayered effort to bring greater coherence to Europe\u2019s financial affairs by creating a banking union, and to weaken the vulnerability of European nations to the problems of their big banks. The accord is also important to efforts to clean up banks in the euro zone, many of which remain weak and unable to lend, creating a credit crisis that has hobbled economic growth.Leaders in the euro zone have already given the European Central Bank responsibility for overseeing the region\u2019s largest lenders, and the central bank has begun scouring bank books in search of hidden problems. But there was still a need to create a body, to be known as the Resolution Board, to deal decisively with banks that needed to be rescued or shut down.\u201cIt is a very good agreement,\u201d Mario Draghi, the central bank\u2019s president, said on Thursday in Brussels.European Union officials said on Thursday that the central bank would begin the process of shutting down a bank but that the actual work would be done by the Resolution Board. The Resolution Board would also be able to begin a bank closing, but individual governments would have the final word in some cases of disagreement about whether to save a failing bank.Michel Barnier, the European commissioner responsible for overseeing financial services, conceded that the system \u201cmight not be a perfect construction.\u201d But because the agreement sets tight deadlines for all the official organizations involved, in theory the process could be carried out in a matter of days.Mr. Barnier said the agreement was a crucial step toward the formation of a banking union that would \u201cput an end to the era of massive bailouts\u201d and help create \u201cthe right conditions for the financial sector to once again lend to the real economy, which is essential to consolidate the economic recovery and to create jobs.\u201dEmma Marcegaglia, the president of BusinessEurope, a powerful industry lobby, said her group \u201cwould ideally have liked to see a stand-alone resolution authority, with more independence from national political interests.\u201d Even so, Ms. Marcegaglia said the deal should help \u201cresolve the access-to-finance problems that many companies are facing.\u201dThe deal is subject to the approval of the full European Parliament in April, at what will be the lawmakers\u2019 last session before elections in May. For the proposal to take effect, European Union governments would also have to give their consent. That includes the government of Germany, which, since a banking union was first hashed out in principle in late 2011, has resisted many of the details along the way.Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, praised the agreement on Thursday. \u201cOur goal was a sensible decision-making mechanism with effective control of the resources deployed and minimal risk for the taxpayer,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said in a statement. \u201cThat is now possible on a legally sound fundament.\u201dLater in the morning, Mr. Giegold said that the Parliament had shown its teeth. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble \u201cbasically had to make concessions to the Parliament, much more concessions than to his partner and fellow member states,\u201d Mr. Giegold told reporters.Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a French economist and visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said that even with the agreement, authority for closing banks would remain diffuse. The powers of the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s administrative arm, would overlap in some cases with the powers of the Resolution Board and governments of individual states in decisions on whether to shut down a sick bank.But Mr. V\u00e9ron added that the deal was better than expected and that failure to reach an accord could have upset financial markets. The agreement also makes it possible for a banking union law to be passed before elections potentially change the composition of the European Parliament, he said.\u201cIt is a step in a much longer journey toward banking union,\u201d Mr. V\u00e9ron said. \u201cNot having it adopted would have added to the general legal uncertainty, and that would have been a clear negative.\u201dThe future Resolution Board, consisting of national authorities and officials who would include representatives from the European Commission and European Central Bank, would be based in Brussels with a full-time staff of about 300 people, officials said. The Resolution Board would begin operations in 2015 but banks would not have to begin contributing until 2016 to a fund that would help pay the costs of shutting down a failed bank.The fund would take eight years to reach its full capitalization of 55 billion euros, or $76 billion.European Union officials said on Thursday that the Resolution Board should have enough latitude to make many of the decisions about how to shut down failing banks. But in some cases of disagreement, individual governments would have the final word about whether to save a failing bank. Mr. Barnier, the commissioner, conceded that the system \u201cmight not be a perfect construction.\u201dMartin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, said at a news conference early Thursday that the deal was \u201can enormous success\u201d that improved \u201cenormously what was on the table.\u201dThe agreement responds to concerns that the previous framework for the system was too cumbersome. Dani\u00e8le Nouy, a top European Central Bank official who is the de facto bank regulator for the euro zone, told a parliamentary committee this week that it must be possible to shut down a sick bank over the course of a weekend. Otherwise there is a risk that the failure of one bank can spread to others, she said.In a statement on Thursday, the European Parliament said the deal streamlined decision making, would avoid political interference in individual cases and would make it possible to approve the shutting down or rescue of a bank \u201cwithin a weekend, from the closing of the U.S. markets to their opening in Asia.\u201dChristian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg Bank in London, said in a note to investors that a banking union was \u201cnot the solution to the recent crisis but a preparation for the future.'\u2019James Kanter reported from Brussels and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Announces 12.2% Increase in Military Budget", "Date": "2014-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe rate of growth in spending is greater than that of recent years. In 2013, China\u2019s defense budget increased by 10.7 percent over the previous year. The country\u2019s military spending is the second largest in the world, behind that of the United States.The buildup of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, which also includes navy and air force branches, is considered by many analysts to be consistent with the size of China\u2019s economy \u2014 the second largest in the world \u2014 and its global political influence. Nevertheless, the military expansion is being closely watched by other nations in the region and by the United States, the supreme military power in the Pacific.American officials have expressed growing concerns over diplomatic tensions in East Asia and Southeast Asia, much of it related to regional anxieties over China\u2019s military rise and its assertion of sovereignty over rocks, reefs, islands, fisheries and sea lanes in the area. The United States has said it does not take sides in the territorial disputes, but it asserts it will maintain freedom of navigation.Dennis J. Blasko, a former military attach\u00e9 at the American Embassy in Beijing and a retired Army officer, said the 2014 Chinese military budget \u201cwon\u2019t break the bank, but it says to the troops, \u2018Thank you for your service, you are important to us, we support you.'\u201d\u201cA significant portion likely will be used for more pay raises,\u201d he added. \u201cYou may recall hearing some talk about how P.L.A. officers should be paid more than civil servants.\u201dA major portion of the increase will go to \u201cbetter, more realistic training,\u201d Mr. Blasko added. \u201cThe navy will also continue to train more at greater distances from China, which is more expensive than training in local waters.\u201dAndrew S. Erickson, an associate professor at the U.S. Naval War College, said that China\u2019s military spending growth was impressive but could slow, given that it is dependent on the nation\u2019s overall economic health.\u201cChina\u2019s military budget growth continues to steam ahead rapidly, driven by an economic engine that \u2014 at least until recently \u2014 seemed indefatigable,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cToday China is the envy of the world: no other major power can sustain that rate of military or economic growth. But what if China\u2019s economic locomotive continues to slow down, even as competing societal claims cause increasing burdens and expectations to be hitched to it?\u201dChina announced the 2014 military budget on the first day of the National People\u2019s Congress, an annual meeting of a legislature whose purpose is to formally approve policy already made by Communist Party leaders.\u201cWe will comprehensively enhance the revolutionary nature of the Chinese armed forces, further modernize them and upgrade their performance, and continue to raise their deterrence and combat capabilities in the information age,\u201d Prime Minister Li Keqiang said at the opening session on Wednesday.Other Asian nations suspect China\u2019s priority is building offensive capabilities and point to China\u2019s increasingly assertive postures on sovereignty issues. Southeast Asian nations have opposed China\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea, which some analysts say has rich oil and gas reserves and abundant fisheries.Last November, China stunned Japan, South Korea and the United States when it announced a new Air Defense Identification Zone over a swath of the East China Sea, saying that foreign planes, military or civilian, would have to report flight paths through the zone to China. The United States has continued to send military flights through the zone without obeying China\u2019s request.China and Japan have been engaged in a heated diplomatic dispute over the sovereignty of islands administered by Japan in the East China Sea. Military patrols and movements by fishing vessels around those islands, called the Senkaku by Japan and the Diaoyu by China, could unintentionally trigger a conflict, American officials say.\u201cThe last thing we need is some unintended incident that leads to unintended consequences, very severe consequences, whether it\u2019s a fishing boat bumping into a navy vessel and someone drowning,\u201d Gary F. Locke, the departing American ambassador to China, said at his final news conference in Beijing last week. \u201cSo it\u2019s important that both sides lower the temperature and focus on diplomacy.\u201dAmerican military officials have said ties with their Chinese counterparts are much weaker than with Soviet military officials during the height of the Cold War. In late February, Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the United States Army chief of staff, visited China to lay the groundwork for starting a formal dialogue and exchange program between the United States Army and the People\u2019s Liberation Army. The general said he expected the first meeting in that program to take place before the end of 2014.In recent years, the Chinese military has deployed to sea an aircraft carrier it refitted after being purchased from Ukraine, the Liaoning, and tested at least two stealth fighters. Many Chinese defense companies and research programs at state-run universities have been developing a range of drones for use by the People\u2019s Liberation Army and for sale to other nations.Mr. Li, the prime minister, also said Wednesday that China\u2019s economic growth rate for 2014 was expected to be 7.5 percent, which is consistent with projections by many analysts. The target for the consumer price index, a measure of inflation, is 3.5 percent.Unlike in recent years, the Finance Ministry on Wednesday did not release revenue and expenditure budgets of local governments, saying in a report that \u201crelated data is still being collected.\u201d The lack of data made it impossible to tally the total domestic security budget for 2014. The ministry said the budget from the central government for public security was $33 billion, but most of the financing of the huge domestic security apparatus is in the budget of local governments. In 2011, the announced total amount was 624.4 billion renminbi, or $95 billion, the first time the planned budget for the domestic security apparatus, led by Zhou Yongkang at the time, had exceeded the official military budget.That trend has continued each year, and in 2013 the announced amount was 769 billion renminbi, an 8.7 percent increase over the previous year. The knife murders of 29 civilians last weekend in the Kunming train station, which appeared to be an act of domestic terrorism with roots in ethnic conflict, will no doubt contribute to calls for even greater increases in security spending.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Energy Push Runs Into Problems", "Date": "2014-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 It is Germany\u2019s national goal: to have the bulk of its energy supplied by renewable power sources by 2050, without endangering the country\u2019s powerful industrial sector or an export-based economy that is the envy of other Europeans.This energy push, known as the Energiewende, or energy transformation, took on new urgency with the decision to speed up the phasing out of nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima disaster.But the question of whether Germany can meet its 2050 goal has been hotly debated. And the issue has taken on added importance with the Russia-Ukraine crisis threatening Germany\u2019s largest single source of natural gas.Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government plans to revamp the energy law to focus on wind turbine parks and solar energy as the most cost-effective renewable sources, in the hope of reining in runaway electricity prices.But international energy experts, who recently completed a study of the German energy sector, say the country cannot meet its future needs solely through renewable sources. They say the plan must also include a climate-friendly \u2014 even if not renewable \u2014 option, like domestic natural gas.Energy will be on the agenda when European Union leaders convene in Brussels on Thursday, with member countries\u2019 heavy dependence on Russian gas almost certain to galvanize the discussion.Leaders are also to discuss recent changes to the bloc\u2019s climate agenda. Germany hopes that a deal can be reached to end a dispute with the union over Berlin\u2019s exemption of some energy-intensive industries from the country\u2019s environmental surcharges.The German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported this week that a proposal had been floated that would allow Berlin to grant surcharge reductions for companies in approximately 65 sectors.During a visit to Berlin last month, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, said that aluminum and steel industries would be among those exempted. Experts say they expect the industrial gas, cement and electronic components sectors also to be included.About 11 percent of Germany\u2019s energy is provided by natural gas, of which 35 percent comes from Russia. Despite the German government\u2019s assurances that reserves of natural gas held in storage tanks are sufficient to ensure continued supply, there are fears of shortages should Moscow decide to retaliate to Western sanctions by reducing the flow of natural gas to the West.Germany has almost no natural gas of its own \u2014 at least not gas that can be extracted through conventional drilling techniques.It does have potentially promising reserves of gas in shale rock. But extraction of that shale gas through the technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, does not feature in Germany\u2019s current plans.Germany, by 2030, would be able to produce the equivalent of 25 percent of the natural gas that it currently consumes, if it were to tap shale resources within the country, according to the international study conducted by IHS Energy, a research and consulting firm. That could rise to 35 percent, equivalent to what Germany currently imports from Russia, in subsequent years, IHS predicted.But Berlin\u2019s firm belief remains that only by uncoupling from a dependence on gas and other fossil fuels through the expansion of power generated by renewable sources can Germany secure its energy future.\u201cThe energy transformation in Germany will be carried out by two main sources \u2014 those are wind and solar,\u201d Rainer Baake, a deputy energy minister, said this week.The unexpected drop in global energy prices through the emergence of abundant, low-cost natural gas in the United States has posed a threat to the energy transformation, according to a study by the IHS research group presented in Berlin this week.\u201cThere has been a kind of waking up to the fact that the premises of the Energiewende, however well-intentioned they are, no longer hold because the world has changed,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, an energy industry analyst and historian who helped carry out the study.The Renewable Energy Act in Germany has been amended several times over the last 13 years. The latest changes are to be voted on by Parliament before its summer recess, and crucial points have already been approved by Ms. Merkel\u2019s government. Revisions to the law concentrate on managing the expansion of renewable sources by focusing on technologies that have proved to be the most cost-effective over the last decade.These changes reflect lessons learned since Germany first decided to phase out its nuclear reactors in favor of energy generated by renewable resources, which until now have all been promoted equally through government subsidies.Berlin\u2019s nearer-term goals have not changed, aiming for 40 to 45 percent of all energy to come from renewable sources by 2025, rising to 55 to 60 percent by 2035. But the mix of technologies has been revised, with the focus now on large onshore wind parks and solar energy farms.\u201cWith the Renewable Energies Act that we created in 2000, we financed a learning curve that was expensive,\u201d said Mr. Baake, the deputy energy minister, who is considered by some to be the grandfather of Germany\u2019s energy transition. \u201cBut the good news is that we have learned in only 13 years to produce electricity with wind power and large solar facilities at the same price as if we were to build new coal or gas power stations,\u201d he added.In Britain, the government is also responding to complaints from its businesses and consumers about the cost of green taxes and other environmental measures. In a parliamentary speech on Wednesday outlining his budget for 2014 to 2015, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, noted that industrial energy prices in the United States were half those of Britain. \u201cWe need to cut our energy costs,\u201d he said.Mr. Osborne said he would take measures to reduce energy bills, which would include capping Britain\u2019s tax on carbon dioxide at 18 pounds, or about $30, a ton \u2014 although not until after next year\u2019s national elections. The tax, which is now about \u00a35 a ton, would otherwise have increased to about \u00a336 a ton by the end of the decade, analysts say. The freeze would cut a midsize manufacturer\u2019s electric bill by \u00a350,000 a year and a household\u2019s by \u00a315 annually, Mr. Osborne said.Electricity prices in Germany are already among the highest in the world. The price of industrial electricity has risen about 37 percent since 2005, according to the Federation of German Industries. The price in the United States has fallen by 4 percent over about the same time.The rise in energy prices has already cost Germany $52 billion in net exports and could prove even more damaging if steps are not taken to keep prices in check, according to the IHS study. IHS asserts that adding domestic shale gas into the mix would keep prices down.A decision by the European Commission this year made it possible for member countries like Britain and Poland which are interested in pursuing their shale gas reserves to do so.The Federal Environmental Agency in Germany is conducting its own study into the impact that tapping those gas reserves through fracking would have on the environment. The study is to be completed in May. But political support for the practice all but died last June, when the chancellor\u2019s center-right government withdrew a bill that would have furthered progress on the use of fracking. Thus far, there has been no talk in Berlin of seeking to revive that proposal.Stanley Reed contributed reporting from London.

{"Headline": " Most Anything Is Fair Game in Portugal\u2019s Quest for Cash, Including the Mir\u00f3s ", "Date": "2014-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLISBON \u2014 Across much of Continental Europe, the euro crisis did in just a few years what political parties in Britain and the United States had been hacking away at for decades: shrink the size of government. That is true perhaps no more so than here in Portugal. Since the onset of the crisis, the government has shed assets including Portugal\u2019s airport management company, a highway operator and the national postal service.But when it came to selling off a collection of works by the Catalan artist Joan Mir\u00f3, it was for some a step too far. The government\u2019s announcement that it would sell the collection through the auction house Christie\u2019s in London set off intense discussion of what kind of assets the state should be allowed to sell, and whether the nation\u2019s cultural heritage is off limits.Portugal\u2019s controversy has now become part of a broader debate across Europe\u2019s hard-hit, if historically treasured, southern tier over the virtues and limits of downsizing government, often centered on the public preservation or privatization of cultural patrimony that touches on the raw nerves of national identity.\u201cThe obsession with eliminating everything that is public is leading the government to go further down the privatization road, and perhaps they consider paintings to be part of the same strategy,\u201d said Gabriela Canavilhas, a Socialist lawmaker and Portugal\u2019s former culture minister. \u201cBut even in Detroit, which was declared bankrupt, their final decision was not to sell any art.\u201dMs. Canavilhas is among those who are pursuing legal action to prevent the sale of the works and instead have them classified as national heritage. The issue was debated in Parliament on Wednesday, but without reaching any conclusion. Amid an outcry, Christie\u2019s canceled the auction in February, citing legal concerns over whether Portugal was entitled to sell the works. The auction house recently announced that the sale would go ahead in June, though the anguish surrounding the government\u2019s move has hardly eased, and it has become emblematic of similar debates elsewhere.Greece has the most ambitious privatization program, including the pending sale of its gas company and island properties, as it has pledged to sell assets worth 11 billion euros, or $15 billion, by the end of 2015 to cut its debts and pay back creditors. But even its plans have been scaled back amid botched transactions and mismanagement.A recent decision by the Greek government to sell a handful of properties under the Acropolis prompted a fierce backlash from critics who argued that instead of privatizing the historic district in the heart of Athens, the authorities should preserve it as something belonging to all Greeks.In Spain, the mere hint that state-run theaters in Madrid would be sold off has generated street protests by actors and others fearful of the impact on the arts. And in Italy, the cultural debate has focused more on the government\u2019s failure to invest in and safeguard historic sites like Pompeii, where neglect has become tantamount to forfeiture.Here in Portugal, critics charge that the economic crisis has been used to justify the kinds of political moves that have already largely reshaped economies in places like the United States and Britain since the era of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher: selling off assets and subcontracting or outsourcing state services. Portugal has already sold about $11 billion in assets.While such efforts have not always produced the savings their proponents promised, governments in Europe, where the state sector takes up a larger share of the economy than in the United States, have belatedly taken up the idea of privatization, saying the financial crisis has left them little choice.The economic slump in some euro zone countries may be easing, but the debt burdens that precipitated the crisis show few signs of lightening. In some cases, they have grown worse, as tax revenue fails to rebound amid paralyzing levels of unemployment and anemic growth.Trying to balance its books, Portugal\u2019s center-right coalition government has already made deep spending cuts to social services \u2014 including education and welfare programs \u2014 to comply with the terms of an international bailout negotiated in 2011. Socialist opposition politicians are struggling to draw a line at the Mir\u00f3 collection.The works fell into the hands of the Portuguese state in 2008, when the government was forced to seize control of Banco Portugu\u00eas de Neg\u00f3cios, or BPN, a bank crippled by debt and management irregularities. Parvalorem, a state holding company, wants to sell the collection to help cover the cost of bailing out the bank.In 2008, BPN tried to negotiate with an American buyer for the sale of the Mir\u00f3 works. \u201cThe government is just trying to complete what was already planned when the bank was in private hands,\u201d said Michael Seufert, a conservative lawmaker. \u201cThe taxpayer should be made to pay as little as possible\u201d for the cost of rescuing the bank, he said.Opponents argue that the $50 million or so that the government hopes to raise from the auction are almost irrelevant when compared with Portugal\u2019s overall financial burden, or with the cost of the international bailout, $110 billion or so, more than 2,000 times the amount to be gained by selling the Mir\u00f3 works.\u201cThe only good thing about BPN is that they at least brought some special art to Portugal,\u201d said \u00c1lvaro Beleza, a Socialist Party official. \u201cWe\u2019re in economic trouble, many state assets can be sold, but there are limits and keeping these paintings is part of our dignity.\u201dEven if the auction goes ahead, Carlos Cabral Nunes, a gallery owner who has been campaigning to keep the Mir\u00f3 works in Portugal, said the debate over the auction showed authorities \u201ccannot deal with art as if nobody cares.\u201d\u201cWhen you sell something like the electricity company or the postal service, you sell the ownership, but the services still remain here and available to citizens,\u201d Mr. Cabral Nunes said. \u201cWhen you auction art, you make sure nobody in Portugal will ever benefit from it, so this is an irreparable destruction of our patrimony.\u201dWhile the Mir\u00f3 collection has turned into a political hot potato, opposition lawmakers have also claimed that the government violated trade legislation by sending the works to Christie\u2019s in London without proper export certification.Christie\u2019s would neither comment on the legal issue nor say whether the chairman of Christie\u2019s European advisory board, Pedro Gir\u00e3o, who is Portuguese, was involved in the auction project.Before reaching Portugal, the Mir\u00f3 collection had already followed a convoluted path around the art market, from the New York gallery of Pierre Matisse, an art dealer and son of the French painter, to a private collection in Japan and finally to BPN. Along the way, the collection was also split up, so that 85 of about 200 works ended up in Lisbon. Those include \u201cWomen and Birds,\u201d now expected to fetch about $7 million, and \u201cPainting,\u201d valued at $4 million.The Mir\u00f3 collection has not been shown in public in Portugal. In fact, Pedro Lapa, director of the Berardo Collection Museum and one of the few Portuguese art experts to have seen the works, said he had been stunned to discover \u201csuch a huge collection was here and not even properly stored by the bank.\u201dMr. Lapa said he failed to convince BPN, and more recently the government, to organize an exhibition. Portugal should now strive to create a new museum built around the Mir\u00f3 collection and other works to fill a cultural gap, he said, as \u201cno Portuguese government ever built an international collection of modern art.\u201dAsked why a Catalan painter like Mir\u00f3 should be used to promote Portuguese culture, Mr. Lapa was unperturbed. \u201cPeople go to the Louvre to see the Mona Lisa, but Leonardo was Italian and not French,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The End of the \u2018Developing World\u2019", "Date": "2014-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Gates was making a point about improvements in income and gross domestic product; unfortunately, these formal measures generate categories that tend to obscure obvious distinctions. Only when employing a crude \u201cdevelopment\u201d binary could anyone lump Mozambique and Mexico together.It\u2019s tough to pick a satisfying replacement. Talk of first, second and third worlds is pass\u00e9, and it\u2019s hard to bear the Dickensian awkwardness of \u201cindustrialized nations.\u201d Forget, too, the more recent jargon about the \u201cglobal south\u201d and \u201cglobal north.\u201d It makes little sense to counterpose poor countries with \u201cthe West\u201d when many of the biggest economic success stories in the past few decades have come from the East.All of these antiquated terms imply that any given country is \u201cdeveloping\u201d toward something, and that there is only one way to get there.It\u2019s time that we start describing the world as \u201cfat\u201d or \u201clean.\u201d\u201cLean\u201d societies approach consumption and production with scarcity in mind. In the so-called least developed nations of sub-Saharan Africa, where the gross national income averages just $2,232 per capita, populations are young and hungry \u2014 at times for food, but mostly for opportunity. Nothing can be taken for granted or wasted. But resource constraints have provoked an astonishing bounty of homegrown solutions to the problems philanthropists like Mr. Gates address with charity. If necessity is the mother of invention, lean economies have a distinct advantage.In Khayelitsha, a poor township in South Africa, a stack of repurposed shipping containers serves as a health clinic. Lynette Denny, an obstetrician in Cape Town, uses them for cervical cancer screenings. Her staff does \u201ceverything but operate\u201d in the containers. Dr. Denny sees 20 to 30 women each afternoon.Meanwhile, start-ups in Africa measure their seed-funding rounds in comparatively modest figures. M-Pesa, the mobile-phone banking juggernaut now used by 86 percent of households in Kenya, began with investments of about \u00a3900,000 (about $1.5 million) from Vodafone and the British government. Despite lacking the resources richer economies take for granted, similarly lean ventures generate billions of dollars south of the Sahara.So what makes an economy \u201cfat\u201d? The United States is a prime example. Plenty is normal. Gross national income is close to $50,000 per person.There are downsides. The United States has one of the world\u2019s highest obesity rates and has grappled with other, more figurative \u201cfat\u201d problems: a subprime mortgage epidemic, pay-to-play politics, a dangerous taste for fossil fuels. Other countries are also struggling to pay the wages of wealth. South Korea has declared Internet addiction a public health concern. Aging nations in Europe are scrambling to defuse the time bomb of generous pension programs. The consumption-fueled financial crisis exposed bloat from Iceland to Italy. Subsequent \u201causterity\u201d measures have put fat economies in jeopardy for decades to come.By contrast, Africa\u2019s lean economies have more basic concerns. Malaria and childbirth still rank among the top causes of death. Predatory politicians, antique infrastructure, drug shortages and power cuts are all too common. But there are silver linings. Individual Africans waste less food and water, owe less money, and maintain a regional carbon footprint that is the lowest in the world. The energy consumed annually by the 19.5 million people in New York State is equivalent to that of nearly 800 million Africans.And because the region had been largely excluded from reckless global markets, Africa actually avoided the worst of the financial crisis. With few, if any, mortgages or credit cards to max out, African households are underleveraged. Stingy commercial banks push small businesses to follow a \u201clean\u201d model for both operations and finance that can be more efficient. If the world is progressively tightening its belt, it should aim for the notch marked \u201cAfrica.\u201dLEAN thinking also drives a different sort of innovation. The story of Toto, a Japanese company that created the Otohime, or \u201cSound Princess,\u201d illustrates the great divide. Now installed in thousands of restroom stalls across Japan, the device mimics the sound of flushing water. The Sound Princess solved a problem of affluence: women were continuously flushing public toilets to mask the sounds that come with using them. Toto\u2019s innovation saves them the embarrassment. The portable, purse-friendly version is a best-selling consumer product in Japan.In a lean economy, toilet-related innovation looks a lot different. In the densest areas of African cities, one time-honored form of waste disposal is the \u201cflying toilet\u201d: bundling refuse into a plastic bag and chucking it as far as possible. It\u2019s understandable: Most people in Africa\u2019s informal settlements lack the basic dignity of modern sanitation. Waste-contaminated water breeds disease, and fear of crime keeps many from using public toilets at night. The \u201cflying toilet\u201d is a stopgap solution \u2014 with obvious drawbacks.The Umande Trust, a community organization in Kenya, came up with a better plan. They helped build a massive cylindrical biodigester that composts the output of a fleet of toilets. Umande charges a few pennies per use, making about $400 per month. Better yet, the system doesn\u2019t drain the water supply like traditional flush toilets, and it creates biogas that powers a community center and heats water for the 400 residents who also shower there every day.The Sound Princess represents a vanity innovation for the top of the pyramid, where you can also find software that will allow you to find a parking spot or a date, to \u201cfarm\u201d fake digital crops, to shake your iPhone to simulate the sound of a whip. They solve problems that arise when the basics are taken care of.But when the status quo is a flying toilet, anything goes. Lean economies \u2014 however challenged they might appear \u2014 translate minimal resources into maximum social impact.As the old adjectives about Africa \u2014 \u201chopeless,\u201d \u201cwar torn,\u201d \u201cimpoverished\u201d\u2014 fade, fat economies must stop assuming that poor countries should mimic them and instead embrace their models for social innovation and efficiency. The post-crash ethos of doing more with less is essential in modern Africa. And for philanthropists like Mr. Gates and world leaders who have committed to solving big problems, lean thinking is imperative.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina\u2019s Long and Winding Road", "Date": "2014-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetters Regarding \u201cCry for me, Argentina\u201d (Opinion, Feb. 28): After reading Roger Cohen\u2019s ode to the self-destruction of Argentina, I had to run to my computer and perform a quick search. Was I dreaming? Wasn\u2019t the United States deeply involved in Argentina\u2019s political upheavals? Ah yes, here\u2019s some $30 million in annual aid to the military dictators from the Ford and Reagan administrations. After the dictators fall, here\u2019s the United States obstructing efforts to bring them to justice. And the \u201cdisappeared\u201d of whom Mr. Cohen speaks with such reverence? The savagery they fell victim to was, according to documents released in 2002, backed by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, and by many accounts actively supported by the C.I.A. To extend Mr. Cohen\u2019s metaphor of the child who won\u2019t grow up, it is oddly selective and misleading to omit the role of its abusive uncle, Uncle Sam.Maia Ettinger, Guilford, Conn.Mr. Cohen manages, in slightly more than 800 words, to reduce an entire country, its people and history into a caricature designed for easy consumption. He indulges in descriptions of Peronism that would each require 800 words to be properly defined. He makes the \u201cDirty War\u201d into a quaint image of Argentine women sobbing uncontrollably. Even the headline turns Argentina into an antiquated symbol and an image of Madonna singing a pop song.Marianela D\u2019Aprile Knoxville, Tenn.I know that the Peronists\u2019 main goal, their perpetuation in power, comes at the expense of the Argentine economy, but they are very effective at pushing policies (some, like same-sex marriage, that are quite progressive) by building political alliances with both the right and the left. That pragmatism has become the signature of the party, a skill that no other political force has mastered, which is also why Argentina still suffers from the bad and enjoys the good that Peronism brings.I hope that other political forces will address Argentina\u2019s long postponed economic issues while maintaining a progressive social agenda, but if they want to compete with Peronism in future elections, they will have to learn a lot from them.Victoria Ballerini, Brooklyn, N.Y. Mr. Cohen claims that we are a nation that never grew up, a child among the grown-up nations. I believe that this depends on your definition of progress. Progress means that nations have the ability to cooperate with others, to build bridges of solidarity with neighboring countries, and to develop laws that ensure full compliance with human rights. Today, Argentina is considered one of the main emerging economies. In 2013, G.D.P. per capita reached $18,600, the second highest in Latin America. My country has a strong tradition of defending education and public health: It spends 6 percent of its G.D.P. on education and culture, and 9.5 percent of its G.D.P. on health. Despite our history of dictatorships arising every time we began to make progress, Argentina has managed to grow in every way.Valentina Risso Puerto Madryn, ArgentinaI was struck by Mr. Cohen\u2019s comparison of President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner with Isabel Per\u00f3n. Isabel was never elected; Cristina has been elected twice, both times by wide margins. The article suggests both were widows who came to power over the dead bodies of their husbands; but Cristina was elected while her husband, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, was still alive. Any person covering Argentina during the last 11 years knows that the Kirchners were, if anything, a team running the country. Cristina was a successful lawyer, senator and legislator for decades before becoming president; Isabel Per\u00f3n was a cabaret singer and dancer. Under Isabel Per\u00f3n the policies that led to 30,000 disappearances were put into place; under the Kirchners hundreds of those guilty of \u201cDirty War\u201d crimes have been tried and sentenced.Joe Goldman, Buenos Aires \u00a0Putin wants his Russian empireRegarding \u201cRussia has already lost the war\u201d (Review, March 8) by Chrystia Freeland: Yes, the Russians\u2019 attitudes toward Ukraine are rooted in the status quo reaching back a few hundred years. Yes, the Russians\u2019 sense of history makes them worry about their western buffer. But the most important reason President Vladimir V. Putin will never accept a truly independent Ukraine is not really as complex as has been suggested. The success of a democratic Ukrainian society in which corruption has been reined in and oligarchy eliminated would completely undermine the legitimacy of Mr. Putin\u2019s project to recreate an autocratic Russian empire. As such, it can never be permitted.Daniel Bronheim, Great Neck, N.Y. \u00a0Natural gas and climate changeRegarding \u201cTempering oil dependence\u201d (Opinion, Feb. 26): Dennis C. Blair and Michael W. Hagee\u2019s argument that we should reduce our dependence on oil \u201cthrough more deployment of fuels like electricity and natural gas\u201d is flawed. As they should know, electricity is not a fuel but an energy product that requires fuel to produce. Their advocacy of natural gas overlooks mounting evidence that methane emissions from natural gas threaten to seriously exacerbate global warming.

{"Headline": "Low-Wage Workers Are Finding Poverty Harder to Escape", "Date": "2014-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHATTANOOGA, Tenn. \u2014 At 7 in the morning, they are already lined up \u2014 poultry plant workers, housekeepers, discount store clerks \u2014 to ask for help paying their heating bills or feeding their families.And once Metropolitan Ministries opens at 8 a.m., these workers fill the charity\u2019s 40 chairs, with a bawling infant adding to the commotion. From pockets and handbags they pull out utility bills or rent statements and hand them over to caseworkers, who often write checks \u2014 $80, $110, $150 \u2014 to patch over gaps in meeting this month\u2019s expenses or filling the gas tank to get to work.Just off her 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. shift, Erika McCurdy needed help last month with her electricity and heating bill, which jumped to $280 in January from the usual $120 \u2014 a result of one of the coldest winters in memory. A nurse\u2019s aide at an assisted living facility, Ms. McCurdy said there were many weeks when she couldn\u2019t make ends meet raising her 19-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter.\u201cThere\u2019s just no way, making $9 an hour as a single parent with two children, that I can live without assistance,\u201d said Ms. McCurdy, 40, a strong-voiced, solidly built Chattanooga native.She was so financially stretched, she said, that she and her daughter often sneaked into her son\u2019s high school football games free during halftime because she couldn\u2019t afford the $6 tickets. (She proudly noted that her son, Charles, had made the All State football team.) As for her daughter Jer\u2019Maya, who mimics Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s every move on her mother\u2019s iPhone, Ms. McCurdy said, \u201cShe\u2019d love to take ballet and piano lessons, but there\u2019s no way I can afford that.\u201d Having worked as a nurse\u2019s aide for 15 years, Ms. McCurdy has been among the nearly 25 million workers in the United States who make less than $10.10 an hour \u2014 the amount to which President Obama supports increasing the minimum wage. Of those workers, 3.5 million make the $7.25 federal minimum wage or less. And like many of them, Ms. McCurdy hasn\u2019t been able to rely on steady full-time hours \u2014 she has often been assigned just 20 hours a week. Even if she worked full time year-round, her $9 hourly wage would put her below the poverty threshold of $19,530 for a family of three. Climbing above the poverty line has become more daunting in recent years, as the composition of the nation\u2019s low-wage work force has been transformed by the Great Recession, shifting demographics and other factors. More than half of those who make $9 or less an hour are 25 or older, while the proportion who are teenagers has declined to just 17 percent from 28 percent in 2000, after adjusting for inflation, according to Janelle Jones and John Schmitt of the Center for Economic Policy Research.Today\u2019s low-wage workers are also more educated, with 41 percent having at least some college, up from 29 percent in 2000. \u201cMinimum-wage and low-wage workers are older and more educated than 10 or 20 years ago, yet they\u2019re making wages below where they were 10 or 20 years ago after inflation,\u201d said Mr. Schmitt, senior economist at the research center. \u201cIf you look back several decades, workers near the minimum wage were more likely to be teenagers \u2014 that\u2019s the stereotype people had. It\u2019s definitely not accurate anymore.\u201dIn Chattanooga, the prevalence of low-wage jobs has contributed to the high poverty rate: 27 percent of the city\u2019s residents live below the poverty line, compared with 15 percent nationwide. Women head about two-thirds of the city\u2019s poor households, and 42 percent of its children are poor, nearly double the rate statewide.\u201cThe face of poverty in this community is women, especially women of color,\u201d said Valerie L. Radu, a professor of social work at the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga.This city was not always a magnet for low-wage jobs. For much of the last century, the city, which hugs the Tennessee River, was a manufacturing hub with dozens of apparel factories, textile mills and metal foundries.During the last quarter of the 20th century, almost all the factories and foundries were shuttered, and with them disappeared thousands of manufacturing jobs that had once lifted workers, even ones without high school degrees, into the middle class or to the cusp of it. In their place have come thousands of service-sector jobs: at the aquarium and Imax theater built to lure tourists and at hotels, nursing homes, big-box stores, brew pubs, fast-food restaurants, beauty salons and hospitals.Discount stores dot the landscape, including a Family Dollar downtown near the upscale Bluewater Grille, reflecting how much American cities have experienced a hollowing-out of the middle class.\u201cChattanooga has a twofold problem: the low level of educational attainment and the traditional jobs that these people move into have largely disappeared,\u201d said Matthew N. Murray, an economist at the University of Tennessee. Just 23 percent of Tennessee adults have a bachelor\u2019s degree.JeraLee Kincaid, 23, is an $8.50-an-hour cashier who works at the checkout booth at a parking garage next to the Marriott Courtyard hotel downtown. A solid student in high school, Ms. Kincaid, who lives with her mother, planned to study computer programming in college, but instead her family decided that she needed to help pay the medical bills of a 5-year-old niece who has leukemia.\u201cShe can\u2019t eat, talk or walk by herself,\u201d said Ms. Kincaid. She says she feels stuck, but also grateful that her boss is trying to help find her a scholarship to attend college.When Volkswagen opened a $1 billion assembly plant in 2011, 80,000 people applied for 2,000 jobs paying an average of $19.50 an hour. Many low-wage workers, like Ms. McCurdy \u2014 a high school dropout who later obtained her high school equivalency diploma \u2014 would have loved to work there, but they faced difficulty mastering the math tests given for jobs that involve advanced machinery.\u201cWe understand that more individuals have to get some kind of higher education degree or certificate to have a chance in this world,\u201d said Chattanooga\u2019s mayor, Andy Berke. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the South to be a place where businesses go to find low-wage, low-education jobs. That\u2019s a long-term problem that midsized cities in the South face.\u201d Here as well as elsewhere, a college degree cannot guarantee a good job.Landon Howard graduated from the University of Tennessee campus here four years ago with a bachelor\u2019s degree in social work, but has been unable to find a job in that field. Instead he is a prep cook at the trendy Tupelo Honey Cafe. Often scheduled for just 15 to 20 hours a week at $9.50 an hour, he usually takes home less than $200 a week.\u201cI\u2019ve had to move back in with my parents,\u201d Mr. Howard said. His most urgent concern is his lack of dental insurance. \u201cOne of my teeth is cracked,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a big gaping hole. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to lose it.\u201dMs. McCurdy, as a parent in a modest income bracket, would not usually be eligible for the state\u2019s Medicaid program, although her children would, but she was accepted because of a heart condition requiring costly medications.Her family has had to make many sacrifices since she was laid off in 2012 from her job as a full-time nurse\u2019s assistant in the emergency room of Memorial Hospital.Her fall to $9 an hour at the assisted living facility from $13.75 at the hospital forced her to give up a 2,000-square-foot home in Harrison, a local suburb, \u201cwhich is beautiful, and you have better schools,\u201d she said.\u201cIt was a good life,\u201d she added. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to worry about violence or anyone breaking in.\u201dAfter being laid off, \u201cI realized I couldn\u2019t afford to stay in a house where the rent was $625 a month,\u201d she said. So she found a $400-a-month, 1,100-square foot house in Brainerd, known for its gangs and violence. \u201cI stay in at night,\u201d she said. \u201cI put bars on the windows.\u201dThe new house has two modest bedrooms, a largely unfurnished living room, a bathroom and a small shotgun kitchen \u201cwhere I got to move the table when my son gets up from dinner,\u201d she said. \u201cImagine being in a two-bedroom place with a 6-2, 280-pound boy and a little girl. Me and my little girl share a room.\u201dThey also share a bed, but Jer\u2019Maya keeps her dolls, books and clothes in Charles\u2019s room, among his footballs and athletic gear. Ms. McCurdy receives $400 a month in food stamps. Without it, she said, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be eating.\u201d Still, Ms. McCurdy worries about her children\u2019s future.\u201cI have a son that\u2019s graduating in May,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s looking at college. My heart is pounding 99 miles per hour. If he goes on full scholarship, I\u2019ll still need to support him \u2014 how to pay his cellphone bill, how to pay for transportation and food during vacations.\u201dHer February utility bill just arrived and it stunned her: $320. She may again turn to Metropolitan Ministries for help, although she says she hopes the $3,000 or so she expects to receive from the earned-income tax credit will help her pay that bill \u2014 and also buy a new living room couch.Rebecca Whelchel says she has seen big changes in the clientele since she became the executive director of Metropolitan Ministries eight years ago.\u201cIt used to be that folks came in with a single issue \u2014 it was like, \u2018I have to buy a new tire because my tire blew out,\u2019 or, \u2018I\u2019m short on my electrical bill,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Whelchel said. \u201cNow they come in with a rubber band around a bunch of bills and problems. Everything is wrong. Everything is tangled with everything else.\u201dAt age 34, Nick Mason earns $9 an hour as an assistant manager for a Domino\u2019s, overseeing a crew of six. \u201cI don\u2019t think $9 is fair \u2014 I\u2019ve been working in the pizza business for 19 years, since I was 15,\u201d he said.He attended the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga, studying to become a registered nurse, but he dropped out as a sophomore when his marriage fell apart. He returned to work full time, and he and his children moved in with his parents in the suburb of Hixson.\u201cI just wish we could have our home, but I can\u2019t afford to,\u201d said Mr. Mason, father of 7-year-old Halle and 5-year-old Eli. \u201cThat\u2019s what the kids keep asking for.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve had to sacrifice a lot of things,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019d love nothing more than to give them what they deserve. As a single father, it\u2019s impossible. I put my kids in karate about a year ago. They loved it, but I got to the point where it was a choice between paying for a cellphone or karate, and as a manager, I need a cellphone for people to keep in touch with me.\u201dMr. Mason has heard the criticisms: Stop complaining about your pay; just go back to school and that way you\u2019ll find a better-paying job.\u201cI would love to go back to school,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for people to say that because they haven\u2019t been in my shoes. I\u2019m already busy every minute of the day. I already don\u2019t get to see my kids enough. I doubt I\u2019ll be able to afford school, and I don\u2019t know where I would find the time.\u201dHis big hope is to be promoted to run a Domino\u2019s, which might mean earning $15 an hour.Ms. McCurdy, who applied for two dozen jobs this winter, delivered good news with a big smile. She was offered a job as a full-time nurse\u2019s aide on the transition medical floor at Erlanger Health System, a hospital.\u201cThey\u2019re paying me $10.64,\u201d she said, an improvement over the $9 an hour she had been earning. \u201cThat gives me a little room to breathe.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Flurry of Travel, Across the World and Beyond", "Date": "2014-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQuick HistoryThis was a week in which travels told the tale. President Obama went to Europe and Saudi Arabia to try to shore up old alliances; the first lady, Michelle Obama, and her daughters went east to woo the Chinese; President Xi Jinping of China headed west to be wooed by the Europeans; and Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of the German engineering giant Siemens, went to Moscow to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin, saying that his company\u2019s lucrative relationship with Russia would not be sidetracked by \u201cshort-term turbulence.\u201dOther travelers who illustrated the limitations of \u201cisolating Russia,\u201d to use Mr. Obama\u2019s threat, were two Russians and an American who blasted off together from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Tuesday and, after a maneuvering glitch, docked with the International Space Station on Thursday. The station has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years, with Russian Soyuz spacecrafts shuttling astronauts to and from the station. The new crewmen, Aleksandr Skvortsov, Oleg Artemyev and Steven Swanson, were welcomed aboard by Koichi Wakata of Japan, Rick Mastracchio of the United States and Mikhail Tyurin of Russia.The travels also produced some hard questions, one of which was whether \u201cthe West\u201d in its confrontation with Mr. Putin over Ukraine showed itself to be more a union of values or a marriage of convenience. Speaking to a youthful audience at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels on Wednesday, Mr. Obama offered a rousing invocation of a continuing \u201ccontest of ideas\u201d in which Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea endangered the international system that Europe and the United States had constructed to foster democracy and rule of law.Mr. Obama had not made an extended trip to Europe in some time, and part of his challenge was to bolster a flagging trans-Atlantic solidarity. \u201cWe must meet the challenge to our ideals \u2014 to our very international order \u2014 with strength and conviction,\u201d he declared in one of several rousing passages.Those ideals and values were undoubtedly still a powerful beacon for much of the world, but their strength has ebbed, with few European countries willing to meet even the minimum agreed target of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense (the United States spends 4.1 percent), and convictions have been shaken by several years of economic travails. Mr. Obama\u2019s visit coincided with municipal elections in France in which a frustrated electorate punished the established parties of left and right by casting a large number of ballots for the far right.While Mr. Obama was in Brussels, Mr. Kaeser of Siemens was in Russia on a trip planned before the Ukrainian crisis, and met with Mr. Putin and Aleksei Miller, the chief executive of the Russian energy giant Gazprom who escaped the United States and European Union sanctions lists. Whether Mr. Kaeser was right or wrong to go depended on who was commenting. Germany\u2019s Green Party criticized the trip, while the deputy chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Ralf Stegner, declared that such dialogue was \u201cbetter than sanctions, blocking accounts or rhetorical displays of strength.\u201d Trade between Germany and Russia amounted to about 76 billion euros last year.Still, the West did respond to the Ukrainian crisis in what may prove to be the most effective way it can. The International Monetary Fund approved up to $18 billion in urgently needed credits for Ukraine, which could unlock further credits for a total of $27 billion over the next two years. And the United States Congress finally got past its habitual infighting to clear a $1 billion aid package for Ukraine. That, hopefully, will give the next government in Ukraine the respite it needs to rebuild its economy and start on its long-delayed westward shift.In a reassuring demonstration that the rest of the world was not entirely neutral on what Russia had done, the United Nations General Assembly voted 100 to 11, with 58 abstentions, to reject Russia\u2019s arguments for grabbing Crimea. Itar-Tass, the Russian news agency, said the vote showed that Russia was not isolated. Voting with Russia were Armenia, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, North Korea, Nicaragua, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.Against this backdrop, the China visits reaffirmed the primacy of commercial ties. This was familiar choreography \u2014 building relations with the rising power. Mrs. Obama, traveling through China with her daughters, Malia and Sasha, and with her mother, Marian Robinson, seemed to find just the right blend of diplomacy and fun to captivate the Chinese public, and to raise issues of minority rights, Internet access and religious freedom in a way that did not alienate her hosts.Mrs. Obama was formally the guest of President Xi\u2019s wife, Peng Liyuan, who has broken with past practice to behave more like a Western first lady. Last week, Mrs. Peng also accompanied her husband \u2014 and 200 Chinese businessmen \u2014 to Europe. Everywhere they went, the red carpet was rolled out. President Xi began in the Netherlands, where he crossed paths with President Obama; then on to Lyon, France, where he tasted local cheese, sausage and wine, then a state dinner at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris and a concert in Versailles; then on to more dinners and trade talks in Berlin and at the European Union headquarters in Brussels.Official communiqu\u00e9s dutifully noted that Ukraine and human rights were raised, but the deals got the headlines. In France, Mr. Xi signed off on an order with Airbus worth 10 billion euros; in Germany, Daimler signed a deal with Beijing Automotive worth one billion euros to increase production at their Beijing-based joint venture.PostscriptsThe Egyptian military moved steadily to consolidate control and to crush the Muslim Brotherhood. On Monday, a judge in southern Egypt sentenced 529 members of the Brotherhood to death. Though the sentence was certain to be overthrown, it was an astounding reflection of the convoluted course of the revolution that began on Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square in 2011.Two days after the sentence, Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, the defense minister who led the overthrow of the Brotherhood government last July, made the long-anticipated announcement that he was retiring from the military and running for president in elections yet to be scheduled.Serge Schmemann is a member of the editorial board of The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Sticker Shock From the Options Sheet", "Date": "2014-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEVERLY HILLS, CALIF. \u2014 Up a flight of stairs from the Porsche Design boutique on Rodeo Drive, in a room of modernist sofas and chairs, low white coffee tables and oversize video monitors, is the Porsche Exclusive-Personal Design suite. Prospective car buyers come to this luxury lounge to optimize their accessories: Here, they can choose precisely the right optional extras to maximize their vehicular happiness.They can caress a sample of the leather that, for $380, will soon cover the fuse box of their new Porsche 911. Or they can marvel at the $2,070 personalized and illuminated carbon-fiber doorsill guards of their Panamera Turbo S. Go ahead, put your signature on your sills.Or maybe they\u2019ll request a color sample of the Liquid Metal Chrome Blue paint available on the 918 Spyder hybrid supercar. (It adds $63,000 to the car\u2019s $847,975 base price.)That\u2019s right: $63,000 for paint.Here, have a glass of wine while contemplating the luster, sheen and brilliance.\u201cWe don\u2019t sell cars; we just help in coming up with ideas,\u201d said Sascha Glaeser, the German-born manager of the Porsche Exclusive studio. \u201cThe dealers still sell the cars and, to be honest, they get more money, because when people talk to us, they tend to add more options to the cars.\u201dPicking and choosing from long lists of options was once a normal part of the car-buying process. But today it\u2019s a luxury experience reserved almost exclusively for high-end machines retailing in the six- and even seven-figure stratosphere. And those options have grown ever more indulgent.Like the $9,875 teak decking available on a Rolls-Royce convertible, the Phantom Drophead Coup\u00e9, or the $10,545 frosted-glass bottle chiller with bespoke crystal champagne flutes that Bentley offers in its Mulsanne sedan. At this rarefied level, the $390 that Bentley charges for a \u201cjewel fuel-filler cap\u201d on the Mulsanne seems modest. Although it is, of course, only a gas cap.Incidentally, Costco\u2019s website lists a mini-fridge at $149.99 and four Champagne flutes for $129.99. Advance Auto Parts sells Stant plastic gas caps for $6.99 and up.Largely because of the success and influence of Japanese automakers like Toyota and Honda in the 1970s and \u201980s, it became common for mass-market automakers to bundle popular options together into packages or trim levels. The 2014 Honda Accord sedan, for instance, is available in six trim levels, but there are no stand-alone factory-installed choices except the paint and upholstery color. The base-level stick-shift Accord LX comes in only two paint colors: silver and darker silver.In contrast, Rolls-Royce offers its least expensive car, the $267,300 Ghost sedan, in 87 hues of paint. While 14 of those are offered at no extra cost, the 73 others add $9,450 to the sticker price. If none of those are exactly what you want, Rolls will paint the car virtually any way you like \u2014 \u201cHere, match my teacup Maltese\u201d \u2014 as part of its custom bespoke program for $13,375.And to finish the car, the \u201cSpirit of Ecstasy\u201d hood ornament is available in a silver finish strikingly illuminated from below ($3,625), in crystal lighted from within ($7,100) or plated in gold ($9,100).According to data from Edmunds.com, the actual transaction prices for new Honda Accords are, on average, only a few hundred dollars more than their base prices (which start at $22,745). The additional costs are mostly for dealer-installed accessories like floor mats and items like extended warranties and antitheft devices.But over at Porsche, the average 911 sports car left the dealership last month after a $134,590 transaction \u2014 about 34 percent more than its $99,895 base price.\u201cStreamlined product lineups makes ordering cars (and selling them) at dealerships much easier,\u201d Jessica Caldwell, an analyst for Edmunds.com, wrote in an email. \u201cLower-volume brands like Porsche sell on high margins, so they must maximize the profit on each vehicle that leaves the lot. Also, customers that are spending $100,000 per car want it to be more personalized to their tastes, versus cookie-cutter.\u201dSo things that were once available only as options on most cars \u2014 power windows and locks, stereo systems and air-conditioning, for instance \u2014 are now standard features even on the plainest models. Hyundai\u2019s least expensive car, the $15,455 Accent GLS sedan, comes with all those along with remote locking and iPod integration with the audio system.Many, if not most, of the dearest options on high-end cars aim to make the owner\u2019s conspicuous consumption even more conspicuous. Ferrari will add yellow Scuderia Ferrari shields featuring the company\u2019s prancing horse emblem to the fenders of the 458 Italia coupe for an additional $1,620, lest one mistake your car for a Kia, a Buick or a John Deere.So many carbon-fiber exterior trim pieces are available from Ferrari \u2014 including an $8,267 rear air diffuser \u2014 that even the thickest N.H.L. contract will groan under the strain. Of course, those are mere warm-up acts for the glory of the engine (helpfully displayed under clear glass), which can be finished in thousands of dollars of carbon fiber, starting with a $9,312 manifold and a $4,133 box for the air filter.Not to be outdone, Lamborghini suggests that if buyers want to show off the V12 engine in their $449,095 Aventador Roadster, they should fork over $7,550 more for the transparent engine cover.Still, the single most expensive option is on a Porsche. Opting for the Weissach Package on the 918 Spyder increases its price by $84,000 and mostly involves saving weight with substitutions like titanium wheels and the elimination of things like air-conditioning and the sound system.Those tweaks are enough, says Porsche, for this version of the 887-horsepower supercar to be the fastest production car to lap the N\u00fcrburgring racecourse in Germany. That\u2019s an important consideration if your driveway happens to be an exact duplicate of the N\u00fcrburgring.The average transaction price of a new car in the United States this year, according to Edmunds.com, is a substantial $31,167. That\u2019s roughly equivalent to a Honda Accord EX equipped with leather and a V6 engine \u2014 a car that performs better, is more comfortable, is more reliable and gets much better fuel economy than a Rolls-Royce of 20 years ago. It\u2019s about as much car as anyone actually needs.High-end cars are about something other than transportation. They\u2019re about reveling in success, indulging particular tastes and letting the world know about it. The option sheets have become biographical. Jay Gatsby would feel at home sitting next to Sascha Glaeser upstairs over Rodeo Drive, tweaking his Porsche just so, until it tells his personal story as precisely as F. Scott Fitzgerald did.Buying virtually any new car today is a display of relative wealth. How much wealth do you want to display?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Change Your Style, You\u2019ll Survive", "Date": "2014-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut along with the expansion has come a change in the style of the works themselves, in part as a result of the crisis. Many are small in scale, with only a handful of performers. In Spain, \u201cpresenters ask, \u2018Can\u2019t you have fewer people onstage, can\u2019t you dance alone?\u2019\u00a0\u201c Roc\u00edo Molina, one of the most captivating of the new generation of dancer-choreographers, said recently via Skype. For a while, when the economy was booming, flamenco shows seemed to fall into one of two categories: tightly choreographed productions with large ensembles and high production values, often accompanied by a \u201cfusion\u201d of musical styles; or theatrically austere evenings featuring a traditional format of sequential dance numbers, accompanied by guitar and cantaor. Among the austere, Soledad Barrio\u2019s Noche Flamenca company (now based in New York) and the Paco Pe\u00f1a Flamenco Dance Company are well known to local audiences. But lack of flash need not mean pallid dancing. Quite the opposite: Ms. Barrio\u2019s solos crescendo to an almost frightening intensity. And last year, Mr. Pe\u00f1a, a highly regarded guitarist, introduced the bailaor \u00c1ngel Mu\u00f1oz, whose wit and musicality were a revelation. Despite their many admirers in the United States and abroad, however, Ms. Barrio and Mr. Pe\u00f1a do not have much of a presence in Spain. (Ms. Barrio has appeared at the Flamenco Festival only once, in a gala. Mr. Pe\u00f1a, never.) \u201cThere is always someone who will say \u2018This isn\u2019t flamenco,\u2019\u00a0\u201c Miguel Mar\u00edn, the director of the festival, said recently over Skype, sounding a bit tired of the question.\u201cBattle lines have been drawn,\u201d concurred Estela Zatania, a flamenco historian and critic, via email. \u201cIf the \u2018fusion\u2019 people see a dress with lunares\u201d\u2014 polka dots, the traditional pattern for the long dresses known as batas de cola \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s automatic rejection. Likewise the traditional flamenco crowd needs only to see a violin, Indian tablas, a woman with short hair, and they want no part of it.\u201d But flamenco has always adapted to survive. It spread from its Gypsy roots to become an entertainment at caf\u00e9 cantantes, music halls and theaters as early as the mid-19th century. Then, when Spanish dancers became the toast of in Paris in the early 20th century, Diaghilev\u2019s Ballets Russes capitalized on their exotic appeal by presenting a Spanish-theme ballet, \u201cLe Tricorne\u201d (1919), with music by Manuel de Falla, designs by Picasso and dances by Leonide Massine, the Russian ballet choreographer, who had immersed himself in flamenco. Flamenco fusion was born. In the 1970s, the wildly popular guitarist Paco de Luc\u00eda, who died on Wednesday, became a master of fusion, mixing flamenco with everything from pop to rumba.Another first-timer, Karime Amaya, embodies the explosive gitana force that many identify with flamenco\u2019s rough-and-tumble origins. Appropriately, she is the grandniece of Carmen Amaya, the great dancer of the 1940s and \u201850s, whose explosive moves earned her the nickname \u201cthe human Vesuvius.\u201d Mr. Galv\u00e1n\u2019s \u201cLa Curva\u201d and Ms. Molina\u2019s \u201cAfectos\u201d are more free form. In \u201cLa Curva,\u201d Mr. Galv\u00e1n\u2019s partner in crime is the pianist Sylvie Courvoisier, who does Cagean tricks with a prepared piano, banging on the strings and punching out angular, hard sounds with the keys. At a table sit the fantastic cantaora In\u00e9s Bac\u00e1n and the palmero (hand percussionist) El Bobote. Between them, Mr. Galv\u00e1n launches into bursts of furious footwork \u2014 on a table, in a mound of white powder, on the floor \u2014 and knocks over tall columns of chairs, or twists and folds his body into sharp angles. The show\u2019s surreal style is inspired in part by the flamenco avant-gardist Vicente Escudero, who, in the 1920s and \u201830s, performed all manner of crazy tricks, accompanying himself with the snapping of his fingers and tongue-clicks or the sound of machines.\u201cAfectos\u201d is more intimate, a three-way conversation among Ms. Molina, the singer Rosario La Tremendita and a double bassist (Pablo Mart\u00edn). Ms. Molina reacts to each song or jazz improvisation with a different riff of movement, turning her small, powerful, pliant frame into an instrument. As Alastair Macaulay wrote in The New York Times in 2010, \u201cShe\u2019s wonderfully free in her conception of what flamenco may include.\u201dThe diversification of flamenco is also good business. By embracing jazz, conceptual art and contemporary dance, flamenco opens itself to new audiences and ensures itself a future in the always-tenuous marketplace for dance. So, what is flamenco today? Asked this question, Mr. Galv\u00e1n answered, \u201cEsencia, vida y muerte \u2014 with each performance, you have to die a little bit and give life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Music-and-Wine Formula, Multiplied", "Date": "2014-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the crowd settled in for a Steve Earle concert at City Winery one night last month, Michael Dorf, the club\u2019s founder, was busy hunting for candles.The little glass votive holders, usually placed at each table with a notice for \u201cquiet during the show,\u201d were missing. Mr. Dorf made a quick sweep through the 21,000-square-foot downtown space in Manhattan, passing by two private parties and the basement room where custom vintages like Sohovignon Blanc age in oak casks. But no luck. So between sips of Vosne-Roman\u00e9e pinot noir ($174 a bottle), he pulled out his iPhone and fired off a note to the house manager. \u201cWe shush more than any venue I know,\u201d Mr. Dorf explained, with a laugh.The candles (and the shushing) are a small part of City Winery\u2019s plan to lure the people ignored by the youth-obsessed music industry: fans over 40 who will pay extra for a classy meal and a room quiet enough to hear the plucking of a guitar string. Founded five years ago, City Winery is now an established stop on the singer-songwriter touring circuit and expanding rapidly. A Chicago branch opened in 2012, and another will arrive on April 10 in Napa, Calif., the heart of the American wine industry. Nashville is next, in September, and ultimately Mr. Dorf envisions a House of Blues-like network of 30 to 40 clubs.\u201cThis is a really ripe business model that could work in cosmopolitan markets around the globe,\u201d Mr. Dorf said. \u201cThe entertainment world has recognized that you need to put on a good show, but you also have to put in good accouterments to enhance the experience. We\u2019re just doing that at the ultimate level.\u201dNow, energetic as ever at age 51, Mr. Dorf said that City Winery reflected his own changing tastes as he had children and grew tired of standing around in a bar till the wee hours to enjoy a concert. That view is shared by many of his customers. At a Cowboy Junkies show a few nights after Mr. Earle played, Christina Iwasko, 48, and Lauren Hirschbach, 36, who work together at a cosmetics company in Midtown Manhattan, nibbled at appetizers and drank Turner-Pageot syrah ($49) on what they said was a monthly outing there.\u201cI love the fact that you get to sit here and enjoy these great wines, and the age group is nice,\u201d Ms. Iwasko said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to a place that\u2019s not super-super young.\u201dIt\u2019s perhaps no surprise that selling wine and steaks is a more lucrative business than running an avant-garde rock club. Last year, City Winery in New York, where most shows sell out, made $1 million for its investors. \u201cWe made more net profit in the first year of City Winery than I made at the Knit the entire time I was there,\u201d Mr. Dorf said.Major investment has been raised for its growth. The Napa space, set to open with the Canadian singer Bruce Cockburn, is being developed at a cost of $2.5 million at the Napa Valley Opera House, which was built in 1880 but has struggled financially. Nashville, where City Winery is also buying property, is budgeted for $7.5 million; Mr. Dorf is eyeing Boston next. (Chicago cost $9 million, and $5 million was raised for the original New York club.) Mr. Dorf has had his sights on expansion from the beginning. He chose the generic name City Winery to apply anywhere and wants to maintain a uniformity of brand. Each space will seat 300 to 400 people \u2014 small enough to be intimate, big enough for a major dining operation \u2014 and, eventually, the network will be able to offer itself to artists for mini-tours. For anyone who remembers Mr. Dorf\u2019s shaky later years at the Knitting Factory, his growth plans may look risky. In the late 1990s, the company took on more than $5 million in venture capital funding and went on a vertiginous expansion, with a record label, a sponsorship-driven festival business and a huge web presence. A Los Angeles Factory was built, with cost overruns that still make Mr. Dorf wince. But plans for others in Berlin, Paris and Tokyo were scrapped as the Internet bubble burst and the terrorist attacks of 2001 kept the New York club \u2014 which had moved to a three-level complex in TriBeCa in 1994 \u2014 closed for weeks.\u201cThe problem with what we were doing at the Knit is that we were expanding in a bunch of different directions at the same time,\u201d Mr. Dorf said. \u201cThere was some heady, absurd thinking with what we were doing in the dot-com world. It was unsustainable.\u201dPeter Shapiro, who opened Brooklyn Bowl around the same time as City Winery\u00a0and is now expanding far beyond New York, said that both he and Mr. Dorf saw a need in the market for a music venue that offered \u201cmore than just a stage facing a bar,\u201d and they took the necessary risk. \u201cWe both stayed independent and both built better widgets,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople respond to these venues because they\u2019re multisensory.\u201d City Winery\u2019s original business model has also shifted. Mr. Dorf had planned to market the winemaking business to the city\u2019s financial elite, letting patrons make a barrel of their own wine for up to $10,000. But right as the first grapes arrived, in September 2008, the economy collapsed, and his Wall Street client base vanished. City Winery still offers winemaking by the barrel. But more than half the wine it makes is served at the restaurant or shared with the artists as merchandise. A Cowboy Junkies label, for example, can be slapped on a blank bottle and sold for about $35, with $10 of that going to the band. The Napa business, supplied by 30 local wineries, will eschew on-site winemaking altogether. (Why compete with Napa wine in Napa?)\u201cThis is part of an entity that has always been about music, going back to the Knitting Factory,\u201d Mr. Earle said. \u201cThe artists will always be taken care of in a situation like that.\u201d For Mr. Dorf, the thrill of winemaking \u2014 and of meeting the rock stars of the grape \u2014 seems to entice him just as much as putting on music. A few days before Mr. Earle\u2019s show, Mr. Dorf was in Napa, overseeing construction and having dinner with Margrit Mondavi, the widow of the Napa wine pioneer Robert Mondavi, which he described with fanboy delight.\u201cTo connect to the royalty that helped create the American wine industry is so exhilarating,\u201d Mr. Dorf said. \u201cI put that on the same plane as having had a relationship with Lou Reed or John Zorn,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s so cool.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Dollar Endures", "Date": "2014-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorITHACA, N.Y. \u2014 Why hasn\u2019t the dollar plunged? Since the 2007-8 global financial crisis, the public debt of the United States government has soared to $17.4 trillion, roughly equivalent to America\u2019s annual gross domestic product. The Federal Reserve has pumped more than $1 trillion into the economy in an attempt to spur lending \u2014 and, in effect, weaken the dollar. Uncle Sam\u2019s credit rating was downgraded, for the first time ever, in 2011. Round after round of fighting over the debt ceiling led to a government shutdown last October. Bitter gridlock has made it difficult for America to get its fiscal house in order. All of these circumstances would predict, under normal economic theory, a decline in both the value and the importance of the dollar. Strangely, this hasn\u2019t occurred \u2014 instead, quite the opposite. Since the crisis, the dollar has more than held its own against other major currencies, like the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound and the Swiss franc. Over the last decade, experts have variously warned that the euro \u2014 or even the Chinese renminbi \u2014 might threaten the dominance of the dollar; almost no one seriously says that anymore. Most international trade and financial deals are still transacted in dollars. Central banks around the world hold nearly two-thirds of their foreign-currency reserves in dollar-denominated assets, mostly Treasury securities. To understand the dollar\u2019s endurance, it\u2019s necessary to distinguish the different roles the currency plays in global finance. The dollar\u2019s roles as a unit of account (for denominating transactions across countries) and medium of exchange (for settling payments on those transactions) are likely to wane. Developments in financial markets and in technology are making it easier to conduct cross-border transactions using other pairs of currencies. China, South Korea and Japan have signed agreements that will allow them to trade with one another using their own currencies. Oil and other commodities have for a long time been priced and traded almost exclusively in dollars because it was by far the most widely traded currency, but this is unlikely to persist. Technological advances will make it cheaper to settle commodity transactions using other currencies.However, the dollar\u2019s position as the predominant store of value in the world is secure. The demand for American investments, especially Treasury securities, is not just a short-term, panic-driven phenomenon. Since the crisis, the long-term demand for safe and liquid financial assets \u2014 mostly advanced-economy government bonds \u2014 has gone up, while the supply has shrunk. There are three principal reasons why investors continue to turn mainly to the dollar for safety: First, emerging market economies such as Brazil and India, and even richer countries like South Korea, have a stronger incentive than ever to accumulate vast stores of foreign currency reserves. This protects their currencies from speculative attacks and insulates their economies from volatile capital flows. Governments are now trying to restore reserves that they used during the crisis to shore up their currencies and banks. Second, regulatory reforms agreed to by the major advanced and emerging-market economies have increased the demand for safe assets among financial institutions. New regulations require the biggest American and European banks to hold larger buffers of liquid and safe assets. Since the implosion of the market for mortgage-backed securities, private-sector investments are hardly seen as safe anymore. The market for gold is too small and volatile for it to be a realistic alternative. Third, the supply of safe assets has shrunk. Bonds issued by most euro-zone countries look shaky in the aftermath of the euro-zone debt crisis, especially since many of these countries face weak growth prospects. Countries like Japan and Switzerland have taken steps to weaken their currencies (thereby shoring up their exports) and are intervening in foreign exchange markets to prevent their currencies from appreciating in value. Thus they are adding to the demand for safe assets. The centrality of the dollar in global finance is frustrating to many foreign governments, but there is little they can do about it. Countries like China and Japan, each of which hold well over $1 trillion in Treasury securities (let alone other dollar-denominated assets), have nowhere else to turn. The dollar \u2014 which decisively surpassed the British pound sterling as the world\u2019s main reserve currency by the 1950s \u2014 will remain dominant for a long time to come, mostly for want of a better alternative. This turns out to be a mixed blessing, both for the United States and for the rest of the world. The dollar\u2019s dominance lets America borrow cheaply from the rest of the world to help finance its consumer spending and budget deficits. Foreign investors\u2019 eagerness to buy Treasury securities has kept American interest rates low, which translates into cheaper mortgages and consumer loans. But low rates also lessen the pressure on Washington for fiscal discipline. And the recent strength of the dollar against other currencies has held back American exports and job growth. The value of the dollar was in fact gradually declining against that of other major currencies in the decade before the crisis. This trend is likely to resume once financial markets stabilize. Economists see this depreciation as desirable and necessary to bring down America\u2019s trade deficits. But it means that foreign investors pay a high price when they come to the United States financial markets for safety: They settle for very low yields on Treasury securities while accepting a fall in the value of their holdings as the dollar declines in value relative to their own currencies. This is a price they seem \u2014 so far \u2014 happy to pay. Stranger still, when other currencies strengthen against the dollar, American households may have to pay more (for imported goods and for their vacations abroad) but America as a whole makes a profit: Its foreign investments are worth more (in dollars) while the dollar value of its liabilities to the rest of the world is unaffected. Yet another paradox: In 2008, when the Fed began what would be the first of three rounds of quantitative easing \u2014 flooding the financial system with dollars \u2014 capital flowed to emerging markets, fueling inflation and asset bubbles. Indications of a gradual end to this policy have sucked money out of those markets in anticipation of rising United States interest rates. So foreign central banks have been storing money in American assets partly to protect themselves from the spillover effects of American policies themselves.What accounts for this almost childlike faith in the dollar? In fairness to the United States, it has a winning combination that no other country comes close to matching: not just a large economy but also deep financial markets, robust public institutions including a trusted central bank, and an effective legal framework. Why do these institutions matter? With its massive buildup of debt, one scenario for meeting obligations to its creditors is that Washington will tolerate a burst of inflation to bring down the real (inflation-adjusted) value of its debt. Foreign investors, who hold more than half of publicly traded Treasury securities, would suffer disproportionately as they would also be hurt by the dollar depreciation that would almost surely follow. Aren\u2019t foreign investors concerned about this prospect? High inflation would hurt American retirees, pension funds, insurance companies and other politically powerful groups that hold government bonds \u2014 making this scenario politically difficult and therefore less likely.Still, the frustration of the rest of the world at having no significant alternative to dollar-denominated assets is understandable. To fix that, other countries need to improve their own financial systems, making them more stable and capable of providing high-quality financial assets that foreign investors can purchase. In its early years, the euro appeared to be a viable competitor to the dollar. But Europe\u2019s financial markets are less deep and liquid than America\u2019s. Moreover, the euro-zone debt crisis revealed that the European Union is only partway toward becoming a true economic union. To punch at its true weight, the euro zone needs to unify its fiscal, banking and regulatory systems. There has been a great deal of hyperbole about China\u2019s currency, the renminbi. China\u2019s economy could soon equal America\u2019s in size. With better financial markets and freer movements of capital across its borders, the renminbi will become a reserve currency in due course \u2014 but not the dominant one. With its present political and legal frameworks, it is hard to see investors seeing China as a safe haven for their money. To reduce emerging markets\u2019 demand for safe assets, there is a crying need for a global insurance scheme to protect countries from panic-driven \u201cruns\u201d on their currencies. The only existing option is the International Monetary Fund, which bails out countries in distress, but often requires them to undertake painful (but necessary) reforms. This is politically unpalatable, leaving policy makers in these countries to self-insure by building up reserves \u2014 and intensifying their dependence on the dollar. The world needs a system like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which protects American banks against runs. Countries would pay a premium \u2014 depending on how much insurance they wanted and how sound their fiscal, monetary and other policies were. Countries with large budget or trade deficits would pay higher premiums. In the event of a liquidity crunch, countries would get a short-term line of credit they could draw upon up to the amount of insurance purchased and with no reform conditions attached to this credit. A neutral institution like the Bank for International Settlements, an association of central banks based in Basel, Switzerland, could easily manage such a scheme. Of course the stumbling block is that this scheme calls for international cooperation on basic rules and premiums. For now, the world is stuck with the dollar-centric global financial system, because the alternative would be chaos.This is not the system one would design if starting with a blank slate. An ideal system should feature multiple major currencies, with no dominant one. Perhaps even the notion of reserve currencies as safe harbors from financial turmoil would be irrelevant if big economies, and emerging markets, had sound financial systems and good economic policies. The dollar\u2019s continued prominence is ultimately less a parable about American exceptionalism than about weaknesses in the rest of the world and deep problems in the structure of the global monetary system. In international finance, it turns out, everything is relative.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Nonprofits, a Bigger Share of the Economy", "Date": "2014-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDatapointsThe overall economy has been expanding slowly, but at least one sector is vibrant: nonprofits, which have been growing at a breakneck pace.From 2001 to 2011, the number of nonprofits in the United States grew 25 percent while the number of for-profit businesses rose by half of 1 percent, according to the most recent figures compiled by the Urban Institute.There are still considerably more businesses than nonprofits, of course, about four times as many. But over that period, nonprofits also outpaced businesses in their percentage growth in hiring, wages and contribution to the gross domestic product, according to the Urban Institute.All told, roughly 1.6 million nonprofits employed 10 percent of the domestic work force in 2010 and accounted for 5 percent of G.D.P. Nonprofits are all exempt from corporate taxes. But aside from that, they are an extremely varied group. Most are charities, for which donations are tax-deductible. These include organizations as diverse as the Little Sisters of the Poor, Harvard University and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Then there are nonprofits that are not charities and for which contributions are not tax-deductible. These include advocacy groups like AARP, which focuses on issues relevant to older Americans; Crossroads GPS, the Republican-friendly advocacy outfit with ties to Karl Rove; and the National Football League (the head office, not the individual teams). Why have nonprofits multiplied faster than for-profit businesses? One reason is that as the population ages, greater demand for health care services drives growth in hospitals and health care organizations, many of which are nonprofits. Another factor is that charities focused on the needs of poorer Americans have experienced higher demand after the Great Recession. In addition, family foundations have grown in popularity, providing a convenient repository for untaxed wealth that often remains under the control of the donor. Because none of these factors seems ripe for change, it seems likely that nonprofits will play a growing role in the economy.Advertisement"}

This summer, New York City thrill seekers will be able to experience a 90-degree vertical drop, followed by a 100-foot loop and a zero-gravity roll, along with dives, hills and a corkscrew \u2014 all within two minutes.The Thunderbolt roller coaster is returning to Coney Island, only this time, it will be made of steel, not wood, and will reach speeds of 55 miles per hour. On Monday, the city broke ground on the new roller coaster, which will sit where the original Thunderbolt operated from the 1920s through the early 1980s. It will be the first coaster in the area since 1910 to hurtle riders upside-down.The $10 million cost of building the ride represents the single largest private investment in Coney Island\u2019s amusement strip in decades. Designed and manufactured by Zamperla, of Italy, the roller coaster will be operated by Central Amusement International, which also runs Coney Island\u2019s Luna Park, as the amusement area is called.The Thunderbolt will serve as a modern counterpoint to the Cyclone, the beloved, clattering, wooden roller coaster \u2014 and New York City landmark \u2014 that opened in 1927. It will feature three cars, each with a capacity of nine passengers.The new attraction had visitors enthused.Scott O\u2019Malley, of Manasquan, N.J., succumbed to the pull of the boardwalk after attending a friend\u2019s funeral on Long Island. He was taking photographs in the late-winter light and reliving childhood memories. A native of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, Mr. O\u2019Malley said that he spent his summers at Coney Island and rode the Cyclone \u201cat least 100 times.\u201dBut he said the new roller coaster would help Coney Island stay competitive. \u201cHow far is it to Six Flags?\u201d he asked, referring to Great Adventure, the giant amusement park in Jackson, N.J. \u201cIt\u2019s what the public demands.\u201dThe new Thunderbolt, which will rise near Surf Avenue and West 15th Street, is part of a broader effort by the Economic Development Corporation to re-energize Coney Island, which in recent decades had become rundown and shed visitors.In 2009, the City Council adopted a plan calling for expansion of the historic amusement area, the creation of new housing and investment in municipal infrastructure. Last summer, Coney Island\u2019s Luna Park had three million visitors, a record high.The old Thunderbolt roller coaster operated on the site from 1925 until 1982 and was dismantled by the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in 2000. The ride had a star turn in the Woody Allen film \u201cAnnie Hall.\u201d In the movie, the faded house directly beneath the Thunderbolt was the fictional home of Alvy Singer, the character played by Mr. Allen.

{"Headline": "U.S. Official Lobbies for Trans-Atlantic Trade Pact", "Date": "2014-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Completing a landmark trans-Atlantic trade agreement could help Europe wean itself from reliance on Russian energy supplies, the United States trade representative, Michael Froman, has said.Mr. Froman made his comments here on Saturday before a visit by President Obama that is scheduled to start on Tuesday evening, with a summit meeting of European Union and United States officials set for the following day. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, now being negotiated, is among the items Mr. Obama is set to discuss with Herman Van Rompuy and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the union\u2019s top officials.Mr. Obama\u2019s visit, scheduled before the crisis erupted in Crimea, will be his first to Brussels since he took office. Energy is expected to be a key topic at the meeting because of the heightened tensions with Russia. Russia has cut natural gas supplies to Europe a number of times in the past decade during disputes with Ukraine and other transshipment countries, prompting severe shortages in parts of the union.Encouraging the export of American natural gas to Europe \u201cis yet another rationale for completing\u201d the trade talks, Mr. Froman told the Brussels Forum, a conference organized by the German Marshall Fund of the United States.Mr. Froman suggested that if a far-reaching trade agreement were in place, it would be a good deal easier for the Department of Energy to grant licenses to companies wishing to export shale gas from the United States. \u201cIf you\u2019re a free trade agreement country, those licenses are deemed to be in the public interest,\u201d Mr. Froman said during a panel discussion with the European Union trade commissioner, Karel De Gucht.Earlier on Saturday, Mr. Froman told reporters that \u201crecent developments just underscore the importance of the trans-Atlantic relationship,\u201d adding, \u201cFrom both a strategic and economic perspective, the rationale for the T.T.I.P. could never be stronger.\u201dAlthough European and American officials trumpet the importance of the trans-Atlantic alliance, there are thorny elements in the relationship. The last time the two sides held a similar meeting, in Washington in November 2011, the United States was concerned that European leaders\u2019 insistence on austerity was a threat to the global economy. More recently, relations were soured by National Security Agency spying, including tapping of the cellphone of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.The start of negotiations for a trade deal was announced with great fanfare last year, and European officials, eager to find ways of stoking confidence in the region\u2019s beleaguered economy, expressed optimism about reaching an agreement by 2015. Since then, in the course of four rounds of talks in Brussels and Washington, progress has been slower than many officials had hoped. There are widespread concerns among Europeans that any agreement with the United States would jeopardize environmental and food safety standards. Some American companies are concerned that protections for investors will not be part of a deal. Even in the relatively straightforward area of tariff reductions, the two sides have yet to reach agreement on how various industrial sectors should be treated. Another round of talks is expected to be held in Washington before summer.There are many companies willing to export American natural gas. There also is demand in union member countries like Poland and Lithuania for American energy as part of efforts to break their reliance on Russian sources. Russia currently supplies about a quarter of the union\u2019s natural gas needs, but some former members of the Soviet bloc are almost entirely dependent on Russian energy.Yet a number of American manufacturers doubt the wisdom of the United States\u2019 exporting cheap shale gas.\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to block anything,\u201d Heinz Haller, president of Dow Europe, Middle East and Africa, told a separate panel at the Brussels Forum. But he suggested that exporting shale gas could raise American energy prices at a time when \u201cthe U.S. needs to repatriate a lot of industry.\u201d\u201cThere is nobody who is saying we should not have free trade in this, but only when it makes economic sense,\u201d Mr. Haller said.Even so, there are 28 gas export permits awaiting approval by the Department of Energy. Approvals typically take three or four months, according to Nelson W. Cunningham, a former White House adviser who now is president of McLarty Associates, a consulting firm whose clients include energy companies.In an interview, Mr. Cunningham said that even without a trans-Atlantic trade pact in place, export approvals should be accelerated to help Eastern Europe secure non-Russian sources of energy.He said the United States authorities should consider allowing companies \u201cto jump the queue\u201d for export licenses if they could show the gas would go to Eastern Europe.Advertisement"}

In 2014, inflation could accelerate to 45 percent, according to a recent report by J. P. Morgan in New York, approaching the annual rate of 56 percent in Venezuela, a regional ally experiencing social unrest.The price increases have become a wearying feature of daily life. One butcher\u2019s store abandoned its price boards last month, improvising instead with a scrap of paper that cashiers updated daily. Women are taking their former spouses to court as they seek increases in alimony payments. Business owners wrestle with salary demands, and news channels periodically send out reporters to buy groceries with 100 pesos, about $12.70, so they can gauge the weakening buying power of the country\u2019s highest-denomination bill.People fume in the streets about the price of everything from cakes to refrigerators. Cafe owners complain that customers order less food. Wholesalers and store owners, fearful that the peso will slump further and erode profits, struggle to price imported goods.\u201cYou don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ve won or you\u2019ve lost,\u201d said Silvio Fern\u00e1ndez, 67, who owns a small downtown hardware store. \u201cI\u2019m hanging in, for now.\u201dInflation has even struck the informal sector. In one northern city, an extortion racket has doubled the fee of its so-called protection service over the past year, one resident said.Salary increases have blunted inflation and fueled domestic consumption, including record sales of new cars last year. But real wages are now expected to drop, leading one prominent opposition figure to compare them to \u201cwater running through your fingers.\u201dWith inflation soaring, the government has pressed ahead with a new round of price freezes on items like vegetables, meat, canned food and even some school materials. Billboards that hulk over highways and ads that adorn bus stops encourage Argentines to call a hotline to denounce stores that do not respect the freezes, or fail to stock the goods. They are subsequently fined or shut down.\u201cWe have to monitor prices,\u201d President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner told thousands of supporters gathered outside Congress this month. \u201cDon\u2019t let them rob you,\u201d she said, referring to what she and her ministers view as a coterie of rapacious businessmen.In the crowd, Luc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, 60, a nephrologist, said the price increases were disproportionate and equated them to an \u201cundercover coup\u201d against the government. Posters from a pro-government organization singled out business executives, including the head of the Argentine subsidiary of the oil giant Royal Dutch Shell, accusing them of theft.\u201cThey\u2019re toasting with Champagne while the people become divided,\u201d said Sandra Bustos, 50, who runs a market stall.\u201cIt\u2019s good that we can have prices that are not set whimsically,\u201d said Patricia Romero, 30, who sells cellphone plans, as she picked up a four-pack of frozen hamburgers listed under the price freeze one recent evening.But Argentines disillusioned with the government believe the controls are a symptom of haphazard policy making that fails to tackle the causes of inflation.\u201cThe campaign is useless,\u201d said one man who gave his name only as Jos\u00e9, 77, a retired accountant. \u201cIt\u2019s a rule that\u2019s older than the world. If you print money, there\u2019s inflation.\u201dMonetary supply increased by 25 percent in 2013, according to the president of the central bank, which funds the government\u2019s budget deficit.Mr. Kicillof also accuses the news media of stoking fear of unchecked inflation. In recent comments broadcast by a radio station, he said journalists were waiting \u201cto sound the trumpets of the apocalypse.\u201dArgentina has long been plagued by cycles of inflation, starting with price increases provoked by influential British merchants soon after Spanish colonialists were ousted in 1810. More recently, the financial crisis of 2001-2 set off political upheaval, devaluation and inflation. A decade earlier, hyperinflation set off looting and forced President Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn to hand over the presidency earlier than scheduled.\u201cPeople have lived through so many inflationary processes that an escalation in prices is not just economic, but sociological,\u201d said Carlos Germano, a political analyst.Many Argentines harbor sullen resignation about the final two years of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s government.\u201cCrises are routine,\u201d said Hugo Fahler, 57, who installs air-conditioning units, as he shopped for cheese at the food market. Mr. Fahler says he now charges nearly twice as much as before the devaluation because the cost of some materials has jumped by 160 percent. \u201cThis reminds me of Alfons\u00edn. The next government is going to have a real mess on its hands.\u201dThe central bank has recently increased interest rates to prevent the hemorrhaging of dollar reserves, a move that it hopes will also help tame inflation. But the government appears to lack a long-term strategy to confront price increases.\u201cAt the moment, there\u2019s no institutional framework to guide inflationary expectations,\u201d said Vladimir Werning, an economist at J. P. Morgan.\u201cThe government wants to avoid a disastrous exit; it\u2019s patching things up to ensure any economic or institutional bombs detonate after Dec. 10,\u201d said Gast\u00f3n Rossi, a former deputy economy minister under Mrs. Kirchner, referring to the date in 2015 when her term ends.But some fear it is an impossible task.\u201cThis is like a pressure cooker,\u201d said Claudia Bonilla, 54, the owner of a downtown stationery store whose costs are rising and sales falling. \u201cI\u2019m scared it\u2019s going to explode.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But what is problematic is the statement that \u201caffirmations about territorial integrity and cries of foreign invasion are empty mantras.\u201d Territorial integrity is a foundation of international law; without it, there is no \u201cnormalcy\u201d to a nation-state.Adil Baguirov, Alexandria, Va.Russia has committed an act of aggression, as defined by United Nations Resolution 3314. It also has breached the United Nations Charter by territorial moves that represent a threat to global peace. Under the charter, all countries are required to render assistance in response to acts of aggression, to maintain or restore international peace and security. Threatening diplomatic repercussions is not enough. Russia must withdraw or accept the consequences. A military response is required. Appeasement, 1930s style, cannot continue.John Cox, Auckland, New ZealandWhy haven\u2019t we connected the dots from the invasion of Georgia, to the arming of the Syrian mass murderers, to the takeover of Crimea? Russia is gobbling up the Eurasian crossroads where energy resources and key shipping and rail lines will guarantee it can keep its boot on the throats of millions.Mitch Bernard, Altavista, Va.Regarding \u201cPutin\u2019s Crimean crime\u201d (March 4): Roger Cohen echoes a popular refrain when he asserts that President Obama\u2019s \u201cSyrian equivocations underwrote Putin\u2019s assertiveness and sense of impunity.\u201d I find it more likely that President Vladimir V. Putin looked to the American model \u2014 see American interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Grenada, Vietnam \u2014 and felt he was at least as justified in asserting Russian interests in a neighboring state that had just overthrown its elected government, had a large Russian population and was home to Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet. In fact, Russia seems to have more of an interest than we had in those countries that we invaded. Mr. Putin was just being like an American president.John E. Colbert, ChicagoWhat standing and leverage in the Crimean crisis does the United States really have in the wake of Iraq and Afghanistan? Any appraisal of possible American options in this situation without an honest discussion of our foreign wars over the last decade must be judged unconvincing at best and dangerously deceptive at worst.Luke Habberstad, Oakland, Calif. The amount of hypocritical noise emanating from the American government and media about Russia annexing an area that was once part of Russia under \u201cfalse pretenses\u201d verges on the farcical and hilarious. Do Americans remember how Texas and California became part of what was once the world\u2019s great hope? Does the invasion of Iraq to prevent the use of imaginary \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d sound familiar? How about the invasion of Afghanistan? Does anyone remember America\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the democratically elected government in Palestine? Do troops on the ground in Haiti, Panama and Nicaragua (over and over again) ring a bell? Or does it only matter that they wear black hats and ours are always white, if you are still allowed to say that?David Lawson Burlington, OntarioRegarding \u201cWhy Putin doesn\u2019t respect us\u201d (March 6): Thomas L. Friedman is right: We should not try to beat Mr. Putin at his own game. He is a shrewd street fighter not at all interested in Russia and its people. He seems too far gone to recognize the tremendous connectivity of the world \u2014 and that no one can play Stalin anymore.Hendrik C. Blok, Antwerp, BelgiumThose who stand up like the Ukrainians on the Maidan for European values \u2014 freedom, human rights, democracy \u2014 and who defy Russian pressure are called \u201cfascists\u201d by the Kremlin. This is a bad tradition of Russian propaganda from Soviet times, true to Lenin\u2019s philosophy that you accuse your opponents of what you are doing yourself. In truth, the real fascist of our days is Mr. Putin. He conducts power politics in the same style as the Soviet Union in the 20th century or the czarist empire in the 19th century. In ignoring international law and agreements, Mr. Putin has disqualified himself as a strategic partner for the European Union. And the cynical and brutal way in which he has treated Ukraine awakens bad memories of Stalin and Hitler. Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia departs, at least for the time being, from the circle of civilized nations.James Siever, MunichRegarding \u201cU.S. hoping gas boom will thwart Putin\u201d (News, March 7): This article quotes Carlos Pascual, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, as saying that \u201cGazprom\u2019s influence will be further weakened as American supplies are shipped onto the global market.\u201d The oil and gas industry finds it convenient to wrap the case for fracking in the flag of national strategic interests. But rising demand for natural gas around the world means that most of America\u2019s liquefied natural gas exports will go to Asia, where liquefied natural gas sells for $17 per 1,000 cubic feet, and not to Europe, where it costs $11. While the shale revolution is great news for American industry, there is little chance that Europe\u2019s heavy reliance on Gazprom will diminish in the foreseeable future. And European leaders are fully aware of this.Peter Rutland, York, EnglandThe writer is a visiting fellow at the University of York and a professor of government at Wesleyan University.\u00a0Taiwan won\u2019t put its gains at riskRegarding \u201cTaiwan and China edge ever closer\u201d (Opinion, Feb. 18): Jonathan Sullivan rightly identifies Taiwan\u2019s robust democracy as the country\u2019s strongest weapon and most valuable asset. Through sound foreign and cross-strait policies, President Ma Ying-jeou has led Taiwan and the region toward peace and prosperity, while pushing for expanded exchanges and institutionalized talks to ensure that relations with mainland China continue to improve. This leadership has helped preserve stability in an area once considered one of the world\u2019s most dangerous potential flash points.But the future of cross-strait relations is not set in stone. No one path is inevitable in Taiwan\u2019s future. Any unilateral change to the status quo by power or influence will not benefit regional peace and stability and will not be accepted by Taiwan. The Taiwanese people wholeheartedly support peaceful relations with the mainland, but they will never give in to pressure aimed at suppressing or destroying their hard-earned democracy.Brian Su, New YorkThe writer is deputy director general of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office.\u00a0Economic rationality and warRegarding \u201cChina\u2019s growing stake in stability\u201d (Feb. 28): Your editorial argues that China\u2019s overseas investments will incline it to peace.

The meeting of the American ambassador, Nancy Powell, with Narendra Modi, the hopeful prime minister, is a step in the right direction. India is currently led by an academician, Manmohan Singh, who lacks leadership qualities and is an ineffective communicator. There is a total disconnect between his government and the people of India.The rise of Mr. Modi of the opposition Bharatiya Janata party has rekindled the hopes of average Indians, who are facing economic hardship due to the huge financial drain that has resulted from government spending on populist schemes geared to get votes in the next elections. In Mr. Modi, the average Indian sees an effective leader, and a person who can be relied upon to put the economy back on track. His admirable governance of Gujarat has received plaudits, not only in India but in other countries as well.Jayashree Venkatachalam Vadodara, IndiaAn earlier version of a letter used the wrong measure in giving the price of liquefied natural gas in Asia and Europe. The price should have been expressed in units of 1,000 cubic feet, not per cubic foot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine\u2019s Fight to Fix Economy Is Also a Fight for Legitimacy", "Date": "2014-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 Young men in fatigues, bulletproof vests and masks patrol one of Kiev\u2019s better hotels, the Dnipro, and they have occupied several floors. Armed with clubs, pistols and even slingshots, they are the militant Ukrainian nationalists of Pravy Sektor, or Right Sector.On schedule, they march out to the streets, to the encampment known as the Maidan, or Independence Square, where the bloody battle for Kiev was fought. To many they are heroes, but they are an intimidating presence. And their leader, Dmytro Yarosh \u2014 who is also the new deputy secretary of the National Security and Defense Council \u2014 has political ambitions, announcing on Friday that he will run for president in May.The Maidan itself is a memorial, a grave site and a place for visiting dignitaries to lay wreaths to the 82 people who died here. It is a metaphor for the revolution, for people power. But on another level, the Maidan remains an ungoverned trash heap of smoky barricades, broken sidewalks, burned buildings, piles of sandbags and bricks and tents housing more \u201cself-defense\u201d units.The scene, in the heart of the capital, is hardly conducive to the atmosphere of stability and business confidence that the new, interim government says it desperately needs. Yet the Maidan also represents the legitimacy the government requires.Pavlo Sheremeta, Ukraine\u2019s new minister of the economy, said the urgent priority for the new government was cash in the banks. Hard currency reserves are estimated to be only about $12 billion, even with controls on the withdrawal of capital, and large debts are coming due.The central bank is printing cash for now, as the value of the currency drops, and a team of economists from the International Monetary Fund should be able to come up with a better analysis of the country\u2019s needs next week, Mr. Sheremeta said.The second priority, he said, is \u201csafety and security in the streets\u201d to try to restore business confidence and attract new investment. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to have business activity when you feel insecure,\u201d he said. Crimea, in particular, is about to lose its tourist season. \u201cEvents in Crimea worry us in terms of the integrity of the country, but worry us even more in terms of tourist potential,\u201d Mr. Sheremeta said.But compared with 2009, the year of a \u201cgas war\u201d with Russia, when Ukraine\u2019s gross domestic product fell by 15 percent, today\u2019s zero growth is almost a blessing, Mr. Sheremeta said.The struggle to right the economy is as much a struggle for sovereignty as the crisis in Crimea. A weak Ukraine is fated to be dominated by outsiders \u2014 Moscow wants to ensure those outsiders are Russian, not European or American.Ukraine\u2019s vulnerabilities are enormous, partly a result of 23 years of mismanagement since independence from the Soviet Union, when early reforms were quickly jettisoned and the economy was distorted by corruption, favoritism, patronage and outright theft. That history damages Ukraine\u2019s efforts now to hold the country together against Russian pressure, because ethnic Russians and many Russian speakers, both in Crimea and in the industrial east, see Russia as more successful and attractive than Ukraine. Since 1991, Ukraine\u2019s economy has shrunk 30 percent while Russia\u2019s has grown 20 percent.And the connections of Russia and Ukraine keep Kiev in a subordinate position, subject to Russian economic and trade pressure.Take natural gas, which Georg Zachmann of Bruegel, an economic research institution, called \u201cUkraine\u2019s expensive addiction.\u201d Ukraine is dependent on Russia for 60 percent of its energy supplies, purchased at a price considerably higher than that paid by Russian natural gas customers in Western Europe.Before the Orange Revolution of 2004, which shook Moscow, Ukraine paid about $100 per thousand cubic meters of Russian gas, Mr. Zachmann noted. On April 1, after Moscow ends a political discount, the price will again be roughly $400, while in Germany it is closer to $330.On Friday, Gazprom, Russia\u2019s state-run natural gas company, warned Ukraine that it could cut off gas exports, as it did in 2009, if Kiev did not pay its debts that are now at $1.89 billion, said the company\u2019s chief executive, Alexei B. Miller.That threat aside, the answer, everyone agrees, is the politically fraught increase of domestic gas prices to market levels, or close to them, reducing the government\u2019s subsidy and encouraging other gas producers to invest. In 2012, according to the International Monetary Fund, the energy subsidies alone were 7.5 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product \u2014 the rough equivalent of the entire budget deficit \u2014 encouraging wasteful use.The fund is almost sure to repeat earlier demands for domestic gas prices to increase, and Mr. Sheremeta, the economy minister, said that the new government would simply have to do it. Officials will argue, he said, that higher gas bills are the price of freedom.\u201cWe had the option to choose to pay a lower price to Russia or to choose freedom,\u201d he said, then referred to the deaths of protesters at the Maidan. \u201cIf we paid so much for freedom, can\u2019t we find the money to pay more for gas?\u201dNew American and European offers of loans are in part intended to soften the immediate blow to voters of economic reform and higher prices, especially in a country with a weak social welfare system. Some suggest charging sharply different prices for corporate and residential gas consumption. But the heavy industry of the east was built on cheap gas, and on the side deals that Gazprom made with friendly Ukrainian businessmen.Trade is the other obvious weapon Russia has to keep Ukraine unstable. About a quarter of Ukraine\u2019s trade is with Russia. Last week Russia banned pork imports from Ukraine, citing supposedly uncertain safety standards under the new government. Earlier this year, Moscow used tariffs to warn and penalize Ukrainian businessmen and oligarchs who favored the proposed trade and political accords with Europe. A disruption of that trade could be devastating for Ukraine\u2019s economy and stir further separatist feeling in the mostly Russian-speaking region of eastern Ukraine.Some analysts estimate that Ukraine needs about $3 billion to $4 billion before the May presidential vote and at least $15 billion this year. The European and American aid offers are intended to tide the new government over until what is expected to be an I.M.F. stabilization program and longer-term loan.At some point, government officials say, they will have to deal with the autonomy of the Maidan, but they also understand that the demonstrators want to ensure that the new government responds to popular demands for honesty and transparency and does not repeat the mistakes of the past, as in 2004.However messy, \u201cthe Maidan is a constant reminder to the new government and officials around the country of the reasons people protested,\u201d Mr. Sheremeta said. \u201cWe understand there is still concern that the authorities not slip back into the former way of ruling.\u201d In the end, he said, \u201cThe answer is free, fair and democratic elections.\u201dAn article on March 9 about challenges faced by Ukraine\u2019s interim government in fixing the economy and establishing legitimacy misstated the title of Pavlo Sheremeta at one point. As the article initially noted, he is the new minister of the economy \u2014 not the minister of finance, a post held by Oleksandr Shlapak.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macau Rides High on New Round of Casino Construction", "Date": "2014-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare Feet9 PhotosMACAU \u2014 This city on the southeast coast of China already has its own version of Venice, complete with a Grand Canal and a Rialto Bridge.Soon, it will get a taste of France, with an Eiffel Tower and a giant resort modeled on the Palace of Versailles, as part of a building boom that has brought dozens of cranes to a stretch of reclaimed land here.Macau has grown explosively over the last decade, and another burst of expansion is in full swing as some of the world\u2019s biggest casino operators step up their bet on China\u2019s love for gambling.Last month, executives of the Macau casino company Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, or SJM, in gold-colored helmets and wielding spades of the same color, broke ground on construction of the Versailles-like Lisboa Palace. The $3.9 billion complex is expected to open in 2017. It will be equipped with 700 gambling tables and feature three hotels \u2014 including a Palazzo Versace hotel and a hotel designed by Karl Lagerfeld, the chief designer for the Chanel and Fendi fashion houses.A former Portuguese colony that was handed back to Chinese control in 1999, Macau now dwarfs Las Vegas as a gambling hub. And it epitomizes the rising spending power of Chinese and their economy\u2019s evolution away from heavy-duty manufacturing toward more consumption-oriented growth.A four-decade monopoly held by a local gambling magnate, Stanley Ho, ended in 2002, opening the floodgates to a building frenzy that resulted in a tripling of casinos, to 35, in a decade. Many are situated on the Cotai Strip, land that was once a stretch of water between the islands of Coloane and Taipa.Gambling revenue has soared to nearly 361 billion Macau patacas, or about $46 billion, last year, from 22.2 billion patacas in 2002. By comparison, the Las Vegas Strip generated about $6.5 billion last year, and has experienced little growth over that same period of time.\u201cIt\u2019s astounding what\u2019s happened in the past 10 years,\u201d said Edward M. Tracy, chief executive of Sands China, the Hong Kong-listed subsidiary of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation. \u201cWe sit next to the biggest market in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one billion more people than the U.S.\u201dLas Vegas Sands, the company behind the giant Venetian hotel and casino resort and other sites in Macau, is adding a complex called the Parisian scheduled to open next year. A smaller version of the Eiffel Tower will feature an observation deck and a 200-seat restaurant.The Galaxy, a big resort that is part of Galaxy Entertainment Group, a Hong Kong company, opened less than three years ago. Ritz-Carlton and JW Marriott hotels are being added to the site.Wynn Resorts, another American casino operator, is planning a 1,700-room casino-and-hotel complex that is expected to open in 2016. Stephen A. Wynn, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive, aims to make this \u201cthe photo op and the conversation piece of Asia.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything more exciting,\u201d than to be active in Macau, Mr. Wynn said in a recent phone interview from Las Vegas. \u201cThere is nothing like it.\u201dDriving all this activity are people like Mr. Liu, a chain-smoking 57-year-old paint factory owner from Foshan, about 75 miles north of Macau, who was placing bets of as much as 20,000 Hong Kong dollars, or about $2,600, at the baccarat tables in a V.I.P. room at the Venetian this month. (Bets in Macau are typically made in Hong Kong dollars rather than Macau patacas.)\u201cI lost 100,000 yesterday,\u201d said Mr. Liu, who declined to give his first name for privacy reasons. \u201cI didn\u2019t even go back to my hotel room last night and now I\u2019m winning it all back. I have more cash in my hotel safe. I just had a grandson and we\u2019re here to celebrate. Money is not a problem.\u201dNearly 20 million people, or one in five Chinese who ventured outside mainland China last year, came to Macau to gamble, shop and sightsee.They form the vast majority of visitors to Macau, and executives and analysts are confident that rising affluence and improved transportation connections \u2014 including a bridge linking Macau and Hong Kong in 2016 \u2014 will drive growth for some time.Analysts at Nomura, for example, forecast in a recent report that gambling revenue could nearly double to $80 billion by 2018. This helps explain why operators like Wynn, Sands and SJM are prepared to plow billions of dollars into more expansion despite the fact that taxes on gambling revenue in Macau are far above those in Nevada.The forest of cranes on the Cotai Strip is also testimony to the casino operators\u2019 faith that Beijing, despite a recent clampdown on corruption and ostentatious spending, is content to let gambling thrive in Macau, which is a special administrative region of China with its own regulations and where casinolike gambling is allowed, unlike on the mainland.So far, neither the crackdown nor a cooling of China\u2019s once-sizzling economy has dampened Macau\u2019s bustling malls and gambling halls. Hotels, many of which charge several hundred dollars a night, have occupancy rates of more than 90 percent. And statistics released on March 3 showed that gambling revenue in February had jumped 40 percent from a year earlier, to a record $4.8 billion.To cope with this growth, Hengqin Island, next to Macau, has been designated as a site for residential housing and hotels. No gambling will be allowed on Hengqin, which is under the mainland\u2019s jurisdiction.For now, analysts and executives say, labor poses one of the biggest constraints. Wages have risen rapidly, and tens of thousands of additional employees will be needed to staff the resorts under construction, putting pressure on the authorities to allow in more immigrants.\u201cMacau is the China consumption story in one place,\u201d said Aaron Park, an American and a former banker who works for Paradise Entertainment, which operates a casino in Macau. \u201cIn a few years, Macau will become an epicenter for the world\u2019s biggest brands.\u201dAmid the clink of chips and the warbles of slot machines, the atmosphere in the gleaming gambling halls is intense. Gamblers are here to win, not to have fun. They drink tea and coffee, not alcohol. It is not uncommon to see people eating noodles brought to them at the gambling tables. Many bet thousands of dollars on a hand of cards.But the casino operators are also increasingly trying to lure travelers with families and children \u2014 people like Zhao Yi, a 36-year-old electronics salesman from nearby Guangzhou, who visited with his wife and son recently. For them, a three-day stay was not about gambling, but about good food and celebrating their wedding anniversary.\u201cWe thought of Las Vegas, but Macau is just so close, and maybe better anyway, so we came here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had canard au sang yesterday at a good restaurant,\u201d a traditional French duck dish, \u201cand it was pretty special.\u201dThe new sites include luxury shopping arcades, spas, swimming pools and ballrooms. The Venetian has a 15,000-seat arena, where the Rolling Stones performed this month.SJM\u2019s planned Lisboa Palace complex strip will feature a wedding pavilion and a theater, and link to a neighboring family theme park. The Galaxy has cinemas and an enormous \u201cfortune diamond\u201d that emerges from a fountain every half-hour. At the Wynn, a dragon periodically rises from the floor of a domed lobby, to the delight of photo-snapping onlookers.\u201cGambling won\u2019t go out of fashion. It will just become part of a wider offering,\u201d said Ian M. Coughlan, president at Wynn Macau. \u201cWe\u2019ve not really tapped all the demand that exists \u2014 we\u2019re far from it. It\u2019s an iceberg situation.\u201dAlan Wong contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It all reminds me of the early days of the organic food movement, when buying organic often meant trekking to inconveniently located, odd-smelling stores and paying high rates for misshapen apples. Only the devoted few were willing to suffer the hassles.Over time, however, the number of people worried about chemicals in their food grew large enough to support a robust market. The stores eventually became better looking, the apples were less misshapen, and organic food entered the mainstream of American life. A similar evolution in the personal-data-protection market is underway. Traffic to the privacy-protecting search engine DuckDuckGo has more than doubled since Edward J. Snowden revealed vast government surveillance programs last June. The Blackphone, a $629 not-yet-released Android-based smartphone that will have privacy-protecting software installed to allow users to send encrypted texts and make encrypted calls, is being pre-ordered by the thousands. And last year, a New York entrepreneur, Adam Harvey, sold out of his first run of the OFF Pocket \u2014 an $85 cellphone case that blocks signals to and from the phone. \u201cMy vision is that privacy won\u2019t be given to you as a law completely,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou have to commercialize it so people can speak with their money.\u201dStanding in the way of the widespread adoption of these tools, however, is the problem of verification. I have Mr. Harvey\u2019s OFF Pocket and it seems to block the cell signals, but I don\u2019t know for sure that it works as promised. The same is true with the Blackphone, or DuckDuckGo\u2019s privacy policies. I hope their claims are true, but there are few trusted third parties to verify them.This was brought home to me when I signed up for a service from TrustedID. For $35, the company promised to opt me out of some of the biggest American data brokers. A few months later, I contacted those brokers to confirm that my information had been removed from their databases. It turned out that TrustedID had failed to process more than half of the opt-outs. The service has since been suspended.As more privacy-protecting services pop up, we need to consider two important questions: Can we ensure that those who can afford to buy privacy services are not being deceived? And even more important, do we want privacy to be something that only those with disposable money and time can afford? The food industry can offer some possible answers to those questions. Our government enforces baseline standards for the safety of all food and has strict production and labeling requirements for organic food. It may be time to start doing the same for our data.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Weaning Europe From Russian Gas", "Date": "2014-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyEuropean Union leaders at a summit meeting last week made a commitment to cut their dependence on Russian gas. The Ukraine crisis has highlighted the issue: About 30 percent of the gas the Union consumes comes from Russia.Not that there is any immediate risk of the Kremlin turning off the taps. After all, Russia gets about 14 percent of its entire export earnings from the gas it sells to other European countries.What\u2019s more, the European Union is better placed to withstand a disruption of gas supplies than it was in 2009 when Moscow last cut off gas supplies to Kiev. Back then 80 percent of Russian gas was routed through Ukraine, according to the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. Now it is around 50 percent, largely because of a new pipeline that connects Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea.The European Union also responded to the 2009 shutdown by building \u201cinterconnectors\u201d between different countries. As a result, it is easier to shunt gas and electricity from countries that have excess energy to those that face a shortage \u2014 though these connections are still patchy and need to be built up.This is relevant in what some analysts, like Rem Korteweg of the Center for European Reform, a private research group, consider a possible escalation scenario: that Russia cuts supplies of gas through Ukraine but continues pumping it through its other two pipelines to the West \u2014 one through the Baltic and the other through Poland.In such a scenario, the European Union would probably get enough gas during the spring and summer months. Some countries in Central Europe \u2014 such as Austria and the Czech Republic \u2014 and the Balkans would run out of gas they import through Ukraine. But gas could then flow south from Germany through the interconnectors.There is a more dramatic but less plausible scenario: a total gas war, when all pipelines are turned off. In this, Moscow would suffer more pain than the European Union. But that may not be the whole story, as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia may be more willing to suffer pain than his counterparts in Western Europe. Or, at least, he may be more prepared to dare them into a game of Russian roulette.Given this, it makes sense for the European Union to strengthen its negotiating position by diversifying its sources of supply. There will be a cost \u2014 either in cash or the impact on the environment. But it is one worth paying.That said, European Union nations should not prioritize security of supply to the exclusion of their other objectives: increasing competitiveness and fighting climate change. The question is how to best balance these conflicting goals. Part of the answer is to distinguish between short-term and long-term measures.In the short run, European Union countries can use more coal and less gas in their electricity generation. Coal imports from the United States are particularly cheap, so this would advance the competitiveness agenda. The snag is that coal produces much more carbon than the equivalent amount of gas, so that is not good for global warming. Given the imperative to stand up to Russia, the European Union should delay, but not scrap, rules for phasing out dirty coal-fired power stations.The European Union can also increase imports of liquefied natural gas, mainly from Qatar. But there are problems. First, most of the Union\u2019s L.N.G. terminals are in Western Europe, whereas it is the eastern part of the Union that is most vulnerable to a cutoff of Russian gas. So more terminals need to be built, which takes time. What\u2019s more, L.N.G. is expensive \u2014 partly because Japan is buying lots of it after closing its nuclear plants in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.Longer term, European Union nations should embrace shale gas. It is cheap and local. Britain and Poland have the most potential. It is important that the Union does not get in the way of its exploitation.Meanwhile, countries such as Germany should abandon their knee-jerk aversion to nuclear energy. While it has its risks, it has the benefit of being carbon-free \u2014 and of cutting the Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian energy. Finally, the European Union is devising new plans to combat global warming. At present it has targets for cutting carbon emissions and increasing renewable energy. The problem is not the carbon goal, said Raoul Ruparel of Open Europe, a research institute. Rather it is the renewable target, which results in uneconomic wind and solar power being built across the Union. There are, after all, other potentially cheaper ways of achieving carbon emission targets, such as nuclear power.Fortunately, the European Union is considering a target for 2030 that is more focused on cutting carbon emissions than increasing renewable energy. Such an approach could help competitiveness and wean Europe off its Russian gas.So the European Union does have options that can reduce its energy dependence without contributing to climate change or damaging competitiveness. It just needs to grasp them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bloomberg Hints at Curb on Articles About China", "Date": "2014-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The chairman of Bloomberg L.P. said in a speech here on Thursday that the company should have reconsidered articles that deviated from its core of coverage of business news, because they jeopardized the huge sales potential for its products in the Chinese market.The comments by the chairman, Peter T. Grauer, represented the starkest acknowledgment yet by a senior Bloomberg executive that the ambitions of the news division should be assessed in the context of the business operation, which provides the bulk of the company\u2019s revenue. They also signaled which of those considerations might get priority. Acknowledging the vast size of the Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second-biggest after that of the United States, Mr. Grauer, said, \u201cWe have to be there.\u201d\u201cWe have about 50 journalists in the market, primarily writing stories about the local business and economic environment,\u201d Mr. Grauer said in response to questions after a speech at the Asia Society. \u201cYou\u2019re all aware that every once in a while we wander a little bit away from that and write stories that we probably may have kind of rethought \u2014 should have rethought.\u201dMr. Grauer\u2019s comments on Bloomberg\u2019s journalistic priorities in China reflect what some Bloomberg employees say is a re-emphasis on financial news, and skepticism from the business side about whether investigative journalism is worth the potential problems it could create for terminal sales.A Bloomberg spokesman in New York said the company would have no comment on Mr. Grauer\u2019s remarks. A day earlier, Justin B. Smith, the chief executive of the Bloomberg Media Group, outlined an ambitious growth strategy for the news unit that would require expansion and increased investment. In a memorandum posted on the website Medium, he wrote: \u201cBloomberg Media is setting out to build a leading digitally led, multiplatform media company for global business. We want to become the indispensable source of information for the world\u2019s most influential people.\u201dBloomberg, controlled by the billionaire Michael R. Bloomberg, who returned to the company at the beginning of this year after 12 years as mayor of New York City, employs about 125 people in mainland China across its businesses, which also include providing data about the country\u2019s currency and bond futures markets.\u201cBeing in China is very much a part of our long-term strategy and will continue to be so going forward,\u201d Mr. Grauer said. \u201cIt occupies a lot of our thinking \u2014 Dan Doctoroff, our C.E.O.; me; Mike; and other members of our senior team.\u201dIn November, several news outlets, including The New York Times, published reports quoting unidentified Bloomberg employees saying that top editors at the company, led by Matthew Winkler, editor in chief of Bloomberg News, did not publish an investigative article because of fears the company would be expelled from China. Mr. Winkler denied that the article had been killed. A reporter who was the co-writer of the unpublished investigative article \u2014 and who had been a lead reporter on the Xi family wealth article in 2012 \u2014 left Bloomberg News shortly after reports of the controversy were published in November. He joined The New York Times in January.Some current and former Bloomberg journalists, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they had hoped the controversy surrounding Bloomberg\u2019s China reporting would prompt the company to reaffirm its support for investigative efforts. Mr. Grauer\u2019s comments were met with dismay, particularly because he is regarded as close to Mr. Bloomberg and would be unlikely to voice views that were not broadly accepted at the top of the company.In his comments on Thursday, Mr. Grauer did not provide figures for the size of Bloomberg\u2019s business in China. One former executive said in November that the company had about 2,000 to 2,500 terminals in mainland China, out of 300,000 terminals worldwide.Mr. Grauer said the company was investing aggressively in fast-growing emerging markets, including China and dozens of other countries. Such nations account for about 12 percent of people who use Bloomberg terminals, but 30 percent of its sales in the year to date, he said.\u201cOur approach is pretty much to tune out all the news about weaknesses in the emerging markets,\u201d Mr. Grauer said. \u201cWe\u2019re investing full speed ahead.\u201dIn recent weeks, Mr. Bloomberg has taken up residence on the fifth floor of his company\u2019s New York headquarters, which primarily houses the television operation of Bloomberg News. The glass of a small conference room has been frosted since he arrived, and he uses it to take Spanish lessons, an employee said. His influence within the editorial unit has also increased since he left city hall, said people with knowledge of the operation, who insisted on anonymity in discussing internal operations.Bloomberg has moved swiftly to put behind it a scandal in which its journalists were found to have used data from the terminals, like contact information, to help report stories. Reporters have been instructed in meetings, employees said, to avoid the use of proprietary information and to identify themselves clearly as from the news division. The aim, said one person present, has clearly been to assure terminal customers that their information is safe.Neil Gough reported from Hong Kong and Ravi Somaiya reported from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Potential Crackdown on Russia Risks Also Punishing Western Oil Companies", "Date": "2014-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u00a0As the United States seeks to strengthen sanctions on Moscow for its occupation of Crimea, energy experts say the powerful Russian oil industry would make a robust target. But any penalties on energy investments, technology transfers and financial transactions would most likely also punish Western oil companies like Exxon Mobil that are investing heavily in Russia.\u201cEverything is on the table,\u201d said David L. Goldwyn, the State Department\u2019s coordinator for international energy affairs during President Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cThe calculus has to be who will be hurt most, us or them, if sanctions are put in place.\u201dAs the heart of the Russian economy, the energy sector \u2014 led by state oil companies like Gazprom, Lukoil and Rosneft \u2014 would be a natural focus for pressure from the United States and its allies. Oil and petroleum products represent more than two-thirds of Russian export earnings, and they finance just over half of the federal budget. But the rub is that the interests of the Russian companies \u2014 many led by powerful allies of President Vladimir V. Putin \u2014 are increasingly entwined with those of American and European corporations, with which they share critical projects. Exxon Mobil, which is based in Texas and has been investing in Russia for two decades, is exploring for oil and gas in the Russian Arctic and has several joint ventures with Rosneft in and outside Russia. Most notably, the company operates and owns a minority stake in what it describes as the largest offshore oil and gas project in the country, Sakhalin 1, which Exxon Mobil says will produce 630 million barrels of oil.Exxon Mobil\u2019s oil and gas production in eastern Siberia now represents less than 1.5 percent of the company\u2019s worldwide output. But the company\u2019s participation in Russian oil operations is important for its future, and for the Russian energy sector.Russia hopes Exxon Mobil can aid in shale oil development in Siberia and in offshore Arctic exploration. These new oil production sources, energy experts say, are critical if Russia hopes to maintain its output of 10 million barrels a day, which is expected to decline by a million barrels by the end of the decade.At a conference with Wall Street analysts on March 5, Rex Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil, said, \u201cIn terms of our view of country risk, our view of the geopolitical risk and our ability to manage that, other than things like sanctions, which have affected us before, we don\u2019t see any new challenges out of the current situation.\u201d\u201cThat statement still stands,\u201d Alan Jeffers, a company spokesman, said Thursday. Just last year, Mr. Putin gave Mr. Tillerson the Order of Friendship award as a token of Russia\u2019s gratitude to the company.Other Western oil companies also face potential difficulties in Russia. BP has sold many of its Russian holdings, but it still holds a 19.6 percent stake in Rosneft, which contributed $1 billion in profit to BP in the fourth quarter of last year. Eni of Italy and Statoil of Norway also coordinate with Rosneft in Arctic exploration. Eni and other Western companies are heavily involved in plans by Gazprom to build a major gas pipeline from Russia to Europe, but that project is now in doubt, according to Eni\u2019s chief executive, Paolo Scaroni.Royal Dutch Shell and Total, the French oil giant, are invested in the nascent Russian business of exporting liquefied natural gas. Several Western service companies are also involved in Russia, drilling and completing wells with the newest hydraulic fracturing technologies.Sanctions on investments, technology deliveries and financial transactions have been central to United States policy toward Iran and North Korea in recent years, but energy and foreign policy experts say the intimate links between American and Russian energy companies would make sanctions on Russian energy companies awkward if not painful for the West, and the sanctions would probably be resisted by Western oil companies.\u201cRussia is deeply integrated in the global economy and that creates challenges for any sanctions strategy,\u201d said Michael A. Levi, a senior fellow for energy and the environment at the Council on Foreign Relations. But he added that stronger sanctions might eventually be necessary \u201cbecause we have a big problem.\u201dEnergy experts say tough sanctions on Russian oil companies would require coordination with Europe, and maybe tacitly with China, so that Russian companies would not simply replace American partners with other foreign companies.\u201cIt was easier to do this with Iran, because how many American companies were doing business with Iran after 1979?\u201d noted Helima Croft, a foreign policy expert at Barclays Capital. \u201cEscalating to sanctions on relations between U.S. and Russian companies would require a more significant escalation by Russia,\u201d like an invasion deeper into Ukraine, she added.So far, Congress has increasingly pressed the Obama administration to quicken the pace of approvals for natural gas export terminals, with the aim of easing European dependence on Russian gas. The Energy Department has been only gradually approving such terminals, which in any event could not alleviate European dependence until nearly the end of the decade.The administration\u2019s sanctions have been broadly worded but specifically involve only limited asset freezes and travel bans. Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire oil trader and one of Russia\u2019s richest businessmen, has been a target of the sanctions, along with two oil contractors.In a recent commentary, Julia Nanay, a Russia and Caspian region energy expert with the IHS Energy consultancy, predicted that Western sanctions would slow investment into Russia at a time when Russian companies are starting projects for exploration, pipelines and the export of liquefied natural gas.Andrew E. Kramer and Stanley Reed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And \u2014 shocker! \u2014 they are having a pretty good time spending their money.The ultrarich shattered many records last year, buying notable works of art, shiny baubles and sleek toys. A rare 1967 Ferrari Spider went for $27.5 million. Francis Bacon\u2019s \u201cThree Studies of Lucian Freud\u201d sold for $142.4 million. And 12 bottles of 1978 Domaine de la Roman\u00e9e-Conti, described by one expert as \u201cas close to perfect as wine gets,\u201d landed in someone\u2019s collection for a cool $476,405.The world\u2019s club of ultrawealthy individuals, or those with $30 million or more in net assets, added about 5,000 new members last year and now stands at around 167,000, according to the latest Wealth Report, an annual compendium of all things rich from Knight Frank, the property management firm.Over the last decade, the ranks of the \u00fcber-rich have swelled by 59 percent, and the register of billionaires climbed 80 percent, to 1,682, according to Knight Frank\u2019s data.And most of the world\u2019s 0.1 percenters had a pretty good year; three-quarters said their assets had increased. Only 4 percent said they wound up worth less, according to the survey, which polls 600 private bankers and wealth advisers who represent more than 23,000 clients.While the United States, Japan and Germany are still home to more millionaires and billionaires than other countries, wealth is growing rapidly in the Middle East, Latin America, Australasia and Africa. By 2023, China is expected to have 322 billionaires, more than Britain, Russia, France and Switzerland combined, according to the report. The United States is forecast to have 503 billionaires in 2023, up from the current 417, according to the report.Looking for someplace to park their wealth, the world\u2019s rich still prefer property. In commercial real estate, wealthy families and individuals are buying hotels, office towers in Brussels and retail properties in Poland.And while the rich typically have 30 percent of their wealth in their main residence and second homes \u2014 say, a seaside escape or a ski chalet \u2014 demands for vineyards, especially those in France, have also been on the rise, the report notes.Among the biggest buyers? The Chinese.The growing wealth in emerging economies has not gone unnoticed by global luxury brands. The chief executive of Rolls-Royce Motors Cars attributed much of the company\u2019s record performance last year to developing markets. Sales soared 17 percent in the Middle East and grew 11 percent in China, according to the report.Porsche is expected to enter the Kenyan market this year.But more money can mean more problems for the newly rich in such places. Experts say they are increasingly looking for ways to protect their newfound wealth, whether from political instability or high taxes.As various countries vie to attract investors, the result has been a binge of \u201cpassport shopping.\u201dA hotly debated proposal in Malta would allow the country to sell passports for 650,000 euros ($893,000) with no residency requirement.Spain and Portugal are offering residency in return for spending only limited time in the country. Experts expect Latvia and Estonia to follow suit.\u201cFor any country short of capital, this is a quick way of getting hold of it,\u201d Nick Warr, the international head of wealth at Taylor Wessing, a law firm, said in the report.Another popular \u2014 and controversial \u2014 route is investor visas, in which individuals are granted residency or citizenship in exchange for investment.The United States, which limits the number of investor immigrant visas to 10,000 each year, granted 7,641 in 2012, the latest year for which data is available, the report said. Eighty percent went to Chinese investors.In Britain, which, unlike the United States, does not tax individuals on their reported global wealth, the number of investor visas rose by a quarter in the first three-quarters of 2013. Over the last five years, half of those visas went to Russian and Chinese investors.And while London remains the hot spot for the world\u2019s wealthy, New York is forecast to surpass the British capital by 2024, thanks to its increasing importance to ultrawealthy Chinese, Russians and other Europeans.If the wealthy made a mistake en masse last year, it was holding gold, which fell about 28 percent. A big chunk of the respondents in the survey said they would probably reduce their stake in the metal this year.The ultrarich, however, continue to collect jewelry, watches and wine, while the biggest jump in popularity went to art.An index of classic cars has had a five-year gain of 121 percent.

{"Headline": "Toyota Expected to Settle Justice Dept. Investigation", "Date": "2014-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToyota is poised to pay more than $1 billion to settle a criminal investigation into disclosures around the sudden acceleration of its vehicles, a steep fine that caps a multiyear inquiry and provides a template for the authorities pursuing a similar case against General Motors.While the government\u2019s deal with Toyota is not yet final, it could be announced as soon as Wednesday, according to a person briefed on the matter. The Justice Department has scheduled a news conference for 9:30 a.m. Wednesday.The settlement \u2014 which could also include a so-called deferred prosecution agreement in which the Justice Department would suspend an indictment so long as Toyota agreed to correct its missteps \u2014 would represent a victory for the government. It is rare to extract such a significant fine from an automaker, let alone in a criminal context.A Toyota spokesman, Keisuke Kirimoto, said that no final deal had been reached. \u201cToyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney\u2019s office on this matter for more than four years. During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and more consumer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements,\u201d Mr. Kirimoto said by phone.The news of an imminent deal was reported earlier by CNN.The case stems from the unintended acceleration of Toyota cars, a problem that has already cost the automaker billions of dollars and prompted the recall of millions of cars in 2009 and 2010.For the Justice Department, the case hinged on whether Toyota was truthful in conversations with federal regulators and in public statements to investors. At the time, Toyota defended its statements as honest.An investigation by the F.B.I. in New York revealed otherwise.The investigation, two people briefed on the matter said, unearthed evidence that Toyota publicly played down the extent of the problem even as internal records showed that the automaker knew the problem was deepening. The automaker, the people said, also misled its regulators, which is a federal crime.Mr. Kirimoto declined to comment on those allegations.Toyota is separately in talks to settle state and federal lawsuits filed against the automaker that claim wrongful death and personal injury. Toyota said in the aftermath of the recalls that it would hasten its response to reports of defects by giving regional managers a greater say in dealing with quality issues.The scale of the recalls, and criticism over Toyota\u2019s handling of reports of defects, dealt a blow to the automaker\u2019s coveted reputation for safety and reliability. The recall crisis, along with the extensive damage to Toyota plants, suppliers and dealers from the destructive tsunami that hit Japan in 2011, contributed to some of the most difficult years in the automaker\u2019s 77-year history.Still, Toyota has since staged a turnaround thanks to aggressive cost-cutting, more streamlined production, experiments with flashier designs and a renewed emphasis on fuel economy. A weaker yen, which is inflating the value of its overseas earnings, has also helped bolster Toyota\u2019s bottom line. The carmaker forecast last month that its net income for the year through March would reach a record 1.9 trillion yen, or about $18.7 billion, easily exceeding the combined earnings for General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. Toyota is now eager to also put its legal woes behind it, analysts say.Toyota\u2019s case echoes the continuing investigation into recalls at G.M. The F.B.I. and the United States attorney\u2019s office are investigating whether the American automaker, which recently announced two huge recalls after a decadelong failure to address safety problems, failed to comply with laws requiring timely disclosure of the defects.The prosecutors, one of the people said, are questioning whether G.M. misled federal regulators about the extent of the problems.Mary T. Barra, G. M.\u2019s chief executive, sounded a contrite tone in recent days and vowed to fix the breakdowns.\u201cOur goal is to make sure that something like this never happens again,\u201d she said Tuesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Health Law Tied to G.O.P. Victory in Florida Race", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCLEARWATER, Fla. \u2014 For Democrats hoping to claim a prized House seat in a swing district, Alex Sink seemed a shining candidate: a moderate, business-minded banker and former candidate for governor with ample experience in running a big race and raising money for it.But in the end, Tuesday\u2019s special election showed that her campaign could not outrun the tsunami of advertisements tying her to President Obama\u2019s health care law. And, just as important, Ms. Sink was unable to step out of Mr. Obama\u2019s shadow. Although he won twice in Pinellas County, where Tuesday\u2019s vote took place, his approval ratings in Florida were a liability this year. Ms. Sink, 65, lost by 1.9 percentage points to the Republican, David Jolly, 41, a lobbyist whose former boss Representative C. W. Bill Young held the seat for four decades until he died in October.The defeat was devastating at a time when Democrats are desperate to change the prevailing story line that 2014 could cost them the Senate, with the House already out of reach. Tuesday\u2019s special election underscored three persistent themes likely to play out around the country: Republicans are more motivated than Democrats, attacks on the unpopular health care law will dominate many races, and the limitless flood of outside money can easily transform local races into national ones.What is less clear is how much a special election, which typically favors Republican turnout, in a district that is overwhelmingly white and largely older, can predict what will happen months away in general elections elsewhere.Democrats were trying to temper their distress on Wednesday, and Republicans were trying to tamp down their glee, recognizing the reality that the special election \u2014 any special election \u2014 is hardly a perfect gauge of how races will play out in November. \u201cSpecial elections are never predictive, but they are always instructive,\u201d said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cWe are not going to overreact to the lessons. We are going to study and to analyze.\u201dMr. Israel said he would like to see Ms. Sink run again for the seat in the November election \u2014 she was also privately being urged to run by some other House Democrats \u2014 when more Democratic voters are likely to turn out for the election of a new governor.While both Republicans and Democrats said the health care law was not the only factor in the race, Mr. Jolly\u2019s victory guarantees it will become a focus in competitive races elsewhere. \u201cIt is clear to me that the Obamacare message worked for Jolly, particularly for the last two and a half weeks in the campaign,\u201d said Brett Doster, a Republican political consultant who served as senior adviser in Florida to Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cI would be very surprised to see Republican candidates not using the issue. The president doubled down on it, national Democrats doubled down on it, and now it\u2019s going to be a political football for the rest of the country.\u201dThe race was awash in spending by outside groups, more from conservative than liberal ones, who sought to influence voters with negative advertising. This was decisive for Mr. Jolly, because Ms. Sink outraised him three to one and was ahead in the race until recently.Republicans had a 13-point advantage in turnout in the district, even though the number of voters is almost equally divided between the two main parties, said Ms. Sink\u2019s pollster, Geoff Garin. Ms. Sink nearly overcame the tilt, but not quite. And while Ms. Sink did well in leveling the playing field among absentee voters, generally a big advantage for Republicans, Mr. Jolly did surprisingly well with those who went to the polls on Tuesday, capturing 12 percent more of the votes that day.Democrats tried to put the best face on a bad result. \u201cThis district will be in play in November, I can guarantee that,\u201d Mr. Israel said. \u201cHad this race been in November instead of March, then Alex Sink would be Congresswoman Alex Sink, which is why I am so hopeful she will run.\u201dAs early as Monday, the White House political director, David Simas, expressed anxiety about the race, phoning reporters to pre-emptively play down the health law as a factor, something that Democratic leaders continued to do on Wednesday.Mr. Jolly said he would vote to repeal the law. Ms. Sink said it had problems but should be fixed rather than discarded.\u201cThe one thing we do have to reckon with and acknowledge is that the Affordable Care Act was a motivating issue for Republicans to turn out and vote,\u201d Mr. Garin said. Mr. Obama\u2019s approval ratings did not help, he added. Republicans agree and are primed to recycle Tuesday\u2019s playbook in House and Senate races later in the year.Mr. Doster, who is involved in a number of Florida races, said polls here showed that the health care law was almost always ranked highly on a list of issues voters are concerned about, behind jobs and the economy.For voters who supported Mr. Jolly, the race was about more than health care. \u201cAmericans are waking up to the reality that the leftist, progressive agenda of bigger government control, less individual freedom and central economic planning is dangerous to their lives,\u201d said Dr. David McKalip, a St. Petersburg surgeon who voted for Mr. Jolly. And some Republicans say that the health care issue should not be overstated. A Republican consultant, who worked on the Jolly race but declined to be named, said advertisements accusing Ms. Sink of cutting jobs and receiving a bonus as a bank executive were more important in persuading undecided voters to vote against her. Similarly, Mr. Jolly ran as the successor to Mr. Young, a moderate who served the district more than four decades. Although he lived in Washington for years, Mr. Jolly was raised in Pinellas County.This was not true of Ms. Sink who moved here from adjacent Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, to run for the seat. Republican political consultants said that the divide between neighboring Tampa and St. Petersburg is nevertheless wide \u2014 with many in Pinellas County often feeling overshadowed by the larger city to the east.\u201cThis is a very parochial area,\u201d said David Johnson, a Republican political consultant and former executive director of the Republican Party of Florida. \u201cHe grew up here and had deep roots in that community, and she did not. I think, for some people, it has a great deal to do with the feeling that he is one of us, and she is not.\u201dStill, while analysts can debate a host of factors, no one can dispute the role of outside money. In all, $9 million was spent by outside groups like the conservative American Crossroads and the liberal House Majority PAC, which political analysts said was a sign of things to come in House and Senate races down the line. Conservatives outspent liberals by $1.3 million.This was critical for Mr. Jolly, who had never run for office before. \u201cWithout that, David Jolly mostly likely would not have won,\u201d Mr. Doster said.Jonathan Martin and Jeremy W.

{"Headline": "Warily, Europe\u2019s Steel Makers Are Firing Up Their Furnaces Again", "Date": "2014-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by9 Photos\u201cIt is a passion,\u201d he said on a recent day, walking past rivulets of molten slag streaming from a blast furnace. But Mr. Orsoni, who has spent his 33-year career at ArcelorMittal and its predecessors, acknowledged that the last few years, when Europe\u2019s demand for steel all but evaporated, had been painful.Now, though, he and others in the industry are beginning to see signs of a revival in the hard-hit sector, which remains a good proxy for the broader European economy. After sporadic shutdowns during the recession to cope with a lack of orders, all three blast furnaces at Dunkirk are running at full capacity.Mr. Orsoni expects the Dunkirk plant this year to produce about 6.6 million metric tons of raw steel slabs, about 5 percent more than last year. His customers, particularly those in the auto industry, which buys about half of his steel, are increasing their orders as the pace picks up at their factories.But the tough times have made him wary. \u201cWe are feeling only that it is starting to be better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut everybody is cautious.\u201dIf the steel business in Europe does perk up, profits may soar for ArcelorMittal, based in Luxembourg. It is the world\u2019s largest steel maker and produces about 25 percent of European steel. Its main rivals, which include ThyssenKrupp of Germany and Voestalpine of Austria, would also benefit.The big question is whether demand will be sufficient to keep all of Europe\u2019s mills busy. Businesses have been buying about 30 percent less steel than during the peak in 2007, and steel industry employment has shrunk by about 16 percent since the downturn began, to around 350,000 jobs. Like Mr. Orsoni, others in the industry predict that as the European economy stabilizes, demand for steel, which is widely used in building and manufacturing, will gradually increase. But they are not forecasting a boom.\u201cQuite definitely, there will not be any skyrocketing figures,\u201d Wolfgang Eder, Voestalpine\u2019s chief executive, told reporters recently.The crisis in Ukraine, where ArcelorMittal has a large plant, is a worrisome distraction. But because Ukraine and Russia are only small markets for Western European steel plants, unless the situation turns significantly worse, the bigger uncertainties for the industry are whether Western European companies will step up investments, whether consumers will increase their buying of cars, refrigerators and washing machines, and whether construction will rebound.Demand from manufacturers who make things like appliances and cars is on the rise. But construction, which accounts for about 35 percent of European steel consumption, remains slow, said Peter Fish, chairman of the industry consulting firm Meps in Sheffield, England.Countries like Spain and Italy, whose earlier economic booms depended on construction, \u201care still in trouble,\u201d Mr. Fish said. Governments focused on reducing debt are not spending much on large projects.Jean-Christophe Vigouroux, chairman of Bacacier, a French maker and distributor of steel buildings and supplies that will buy 70,000 tons of steel from ArcelorMittal this year, says he thinks the French market for his products will be flat this year but \u201cmuch more interesting in 2015.\u201dSteel makers have been trying to negotiate modest price increases of about 4 percent, to about 470 euros, or $650, a metric ton, but are having trouble making them stick, according to Jeff Largey, an analyst at Macquarie Securities in London. \u201cConfidence in the market is still shaky,\u201d Mr. Largey said.Some of ArcelorMittal\u2019s rivals say that still more cuts in steel production are required in current conditions. Mr. Eder of Voestalpine, Europe\u2019s third-largest steel maker, recently estimated that the European steel industry had permanently shuttered 10 million metric tons of crude steel capacity since the financial crisis but needed to remove an additional 25 million tons of capacity to prevent downward price pressure.\u201cWe should do this as quickly as possible,\u201d said Mr. Eder, who is also president of the industry trade group Eurofer.But closing plants in Europe is far from easy, as ArcelorMittal well knows. Part of the reason Dunkirk is going flat out is that the company has already shut down other operations, including blast furnaces elsewhere in France and in Belgium. The partial closing of operations in Florange in northeast France, with the loss of about 600 jobs, drew a threat of nationalization in 2012 from the government of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in 2012.Determined to stanch persistent losses in Europe, the company has consolidated its production of raw steel, the heart of the business, to a handful of locations. Those include Ghent in Belgium, Fos-sur-Mer in southern France and near the beaches and harbor of Dunkirk, where about 300,000 Allied troops were evacuated in 1940 ahead of advancing German forces.Like the other favored sites, Dunkirk has certain basic qualifications. The blast furnaces, towerlike structures where iron ore is converted to molten iron, are big and efficient. Large ships bearing the vast quantities of iron ore and coal required for steel making can dock at the Dunkirk site, lowering costs.Smaller inland blast furnaces, like those at Florange and Li\u00e8ge in Belgium, are doomed.Dunkirk is the ArcelorMittal site still left in this part of Europe where iron from blast furnaces is blended with a leavening of molten scrap and alloys and then poured into long, glowing slabs of steel.Other plants in the region, including the one at Florange, which still employs more than 2,000 people, then press the slabs into long, flat sheets and coat or otherwise finish them for use as car parts, washing machine bodies, roofing or steel cans.ArcelorMittal has signaled its intent to continue investing in Dunkirk. The company says it will reline one of the blast furnaces next year, a necessary but expensive \u2014 \u20ac90 million \u2014 project.Already the plant, which was built in the 1960s but has been periodically updated, stands out from many other steel facilities. It has bright, airy control rooms with video screens that allow technicians to monitor the caldrons of hot metal without getting too close.Union representatives say that while the investments in Dunkirk are reassuring, they are unhappy that the company is whittling away staff and employing young and temporary workers as the plant\u2019s older workers retire.Serge Vanderlynden, a 39-year employee and representative of the Force Ouvri\u00e8re, a union, recalls that in the 1970s there were about 10,000 employees at the site, compared with about 3,100 now.\u201cWe can feel the gloominess,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are worried.\u201dMr. Orsoni, who runs both Dunkirk and Florange, says that he is bringing in about 200 replacements for the 300 people retiring this year. It is not hard to hire locally, where unemployment is about 14 percent.\u201cI feel very lucky,\u201d said Antoine Desormon, a 29-year-old factory floor worker who was recently hired after working at the plant for a contractor. \u201cIt is hard to find a job.\u201dLakshmi Mittal, the company\u2019s chief executive, has had little choice but to streamline European operations, which he acquired through the hostile takeover of Arcelor, an amalgam of European steel companies, in 2006.The long economic slump in Europe, where ArcelorMittal produces more than 40 percent of its steel, has been a drag on the company. The main European business, for which Mr. Orsoni works, lost $933 million on revenues of $27 billion last year. The company\u2019s comparable business in the Americas made a profit of $852 million.Mr. Mittal says he has cut about $1 billion in costs from the European operation, moves that he says should make it profitable. He forecasts that demand in Europe will rise about 2 percent, compared with projected growth of about 4 percent in the United States.\u201cWe will buy more compared to last year,\u201d said Galina Staykov, Toyota\u2019s senior manager for purchasing in Europe. \u201cEveryone, almost, will buy more steel because the market itself is growing.\u201dStanley Reed reported from Dunkirk, France, and Palko Karasz from London.Advertisement"}

(China now accounts for nearly one-tenth of its global sales.)But last year brought growth of 5.3 percent from the previous year, a far cry from the rates of more than 20 percent it enjoyed in China during the preceding few years. Founded in the United States in 1910, Samsonite listed in Hong Kong in 2011, in part to take advantage of growth in China.A crackdown on corruption and ostentatious spending and the uncertainties surrounding the country\u2019s far-reaching economic overhaul took a toll as corporate and private consumers held off spending, said Ramesh Tainwala, the chief operating officer of Samsonite, at a media event in Hong Kong on Wednesday.But, he added, many of these uncertainties are becoming resolved, while rising wages are lifting an expanding number of Chinese into the ranks of the middle class. So even though China\u2019s economy is cooling, demand for travel \u2014 and suitcases \u2014 is growing robustly, and Samsonite expects sales growth of more than 10 percent this year.\u201cPeople don\u2019t stop living their lives,\u201d Mr. Tainwala said.Wooing Asian consumers is not just a question of stocking the colors they like: It is also being aware of cultural habits and preferences, he said. The company recognized that Asians like to double-check the advertised weight of bags they are considering purchasing. One of its stores in Paris responded by providing a scale \u2014 a practice that is now being adopted by other Samsonite outlets.As for sales staff, he said, Mandarin-speakers are now highly sought after and can command much higher salaries \u2014 at least double \u2014 in cities such as London and New York.Mr. Tainwala\u2019s advice to job seekers: \u201cLearn Mandarin!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rattlesnake Wranglers, Armed With Gasoline", "Date": "2014-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySweetwater JournalMr. Sawyers with a rattlesnake he caught. A quote from Davy Crockett next to the snake tattoos on his arm reads, \u201cYou may all go to hell, and I will go to Texas.\u201d The practice of gassing has outraged animal rights activists and reptile researchers who say that spraying a toxic substance in wildlife habitats hurts the environment, the snakes, and other animals and insects that live underground or use the same burrows.SWEETWATER, Tex. \u2014 At the foot of a rocky cliff here, Riley Sawyers knelt down and peered into a small, dark hole, on the prowl for rattlesnakes. One had already lunged at him and bitten his Kevlar-reinforced boot. The venom was still drying, as was the blood on his arm from where the thorny terrain had scratched him, when Mr. Sawyers went to fetch the gasoline.It was not for his dusty S.U.V. It was for the snakes.To encourage the rattlesnakes to slither out, Mr. Sawyers and his nephew slipped a thin copper tube into the hole and hand-pumped gas fumes into it. In West Texas, as infested with western diamondback rattlesnakes as New York City is with rats, snake hunters like Mr. Sawyers have been using gas fumes to flush out their prey for decades.The practice, known as gassing, has outraged animal rights activists and reptile researchers who say that spraying a toxic substance in wildlife habitats hurts the environment, the snakes, and other animals and insects that live underground or use the same burrows.In recent months, the opponents of gassing have gained a powerful, unlikely ally: the State of Texas. The state\u2019s wildlife agency is considering banning the use of gas fumes to capture rattlesnakes \u2014 a move that would add Texas to the list of more than two dozen states that have partly or completely outlawed the practice, including Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico and Oklahoma, all of which share borders with Texas.In a state that advertises its small government and has fought efforts to protect the dunes sagebrush lizard and other animals as endangered species, the agency\u2019s involvement in snake wranglers\u2019 affairs and its attempt to safeguard a creature that bites and frightens ranchers and others strikes some as anti-Texan. If the ban goes through, snake hunters noted, it will be illegal to use gas to chase out a rattlesnake, but legal to use it to catch a gopher. The debate over the proposed ban has mushroomed into a larger, stranger battle that has attracted the attention of Gov. Rick Perry and other Republican leaders and underscored the cultural divisions between urban and rural Texas.\u201cA lot of people that\u2019s bringing this to issue have never encountered a snake,\u201d said Mr. Sawyers, 46, a state-licensed snake hunter, tile layer and Marlboro chain-smoker who has a cheerful quotation from Davy Crockett next to the snake tattoos on his arm: \u201cYou may all go to hell, and I will go to Texas.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re into the Bible, snakes have intimidated people from the beginning, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s changed to this day. If they were on your land, would you want restrictions on how we can get them off, or would you want them removed?\u201dBut the hearing in Sweetwater in January drew an estimated 250 people. This town of roughly 11,000, about 40 miles west of Abilene, has unusually high stakes in the matter.Every March, Sweetwater puts on the country\u2019s largest rattlesnake roundup. (A billboard on the highway into town claims it is the biggest in the world.) The snakes for the event are supplied by wranglers like Mr. Sawyers, the majority of whom use gassing to capture rattlesnakes in the rugged, dry terrain nearby. Hunters are paid by the pound; at this year\u2019s roundup, they brought in hundreds of live western diamondbacks, totaling about 3,900 pounds. A ban would make it harder for hunters to collect a large number of snakes, and some believe the hunters would not bother to take part because there would be no financial incentive.Town leaders and organizers of the roundup said a ban on gassing would end the roundup and its 56-year tradition, or shrink an event that pumps millions of dollars into the local economy every March as thousands of people travel to Sweetwater to shop, eat and visit. The Sweetwater Jaycees, the nonprofit group that organizes the roundup, use the proceeds to finance community projects, including feeding needy families on Thanksgiving, buying equipment for the fire department, and helping local students, Little League teams and disabled adults.\u201cIt would be a devastating blow to us,\u201d said David Sager, 63, a snake handler at the roundup and a member of the Jaycees. \u201cThe rattlesnake roundup is our ways and means.\u201dThe good deeds that come from the roundup are preceded by rather gruesome ones at the event itself, where attendees and organizers celebrate, photograph, skin and eat the most widespread venomous snake in the state. The live diamondbacks are squeezed for their venom \u2014 a valuable commodity sold by the Jaycees \u2014 and then slaughtered, all in front of the men, women and children at the event. In their most recent report, from 2004, organizers estimated that from 1958 to 2003, the roundup handled 254,000 pounds of diamondbacks \u2014 enough dead reptiles to equal the weight of a small locomotive.Though state wildlife officials have been examining the issue of gassing for years, the primary catalyst for the proposed ban was a petition sent to the agency last year signed by 57 zoologists and others, many from out of state. Some of those who signed the petition oppose not only gassing, but the roundup as well.\u201cThe behavior that occurs at the traditional roundups is animal abuse,\u201d said Kristen Leigh Wiley, curator of the Kentucky Reptile Zoo and one of those who signed the petition. \u201cJust because it\u2019s a rattlesnake and not any other animal does not mean that it cannot experience pain or suffering.\u201dOfficials at the Parks and Wildlife Department said their goal was not to end roundups, but to protect the various species besides rattlesnakes that are exposed to the fumes. They pointed to a 1989 study that showed that a 30-minute vapor exposure impaired or killed seven species of snakes, lizards and toads.\u00a0\u201cI liken this to fishing with dynamite,\u201d said John Davis, director of the department\u2019s wildlife diversity program. \u201cIt\u2019s about a means of take, a means of collection.\u201dSome lawmakers, led by state Representative Susan L. King, whose district includes Sweetwater, oppose the proposal and want more extensive field research. Snake hunters and residents said the amount of fumes used in holes and crevices was too insignificant to warrant a ban, and expressed fear that without the gassing and the roundup, the town would be overrun with diamondbacks \u2014 a claim that supporters of a ban deny.Rattlesnakes are the creatures Sweetwater loves to hate.At the roundup, young women compete for Miss Snake Charmer. This year\u2019s winner of the fried rattlesnake-eating contest \u2014 Tonya Osteen, 39, a mother of three \u2014 has found diamondbacks on her porch, and one bit the neck of one of her dogs. \u201cIt just helps thin out the population,\u201d said Ms. Osteen, whose teenage daughter skinned a snake at the roundup. \u201cSomebody sitting there saying, \u2018Oh, poor little snakes\u2019 \u2014 I don\u2019t want my kids getting bit by rattlesnakes. My three-legged dog, imagine him getting bit by a snake.\u201dAt the hole, they pumped fumes for less than a minute from a can that held about 50 cents\u2019 worth of gas. No snakes emerged. Their only catch of the day was a three-foot diamondback that Mr. Newman, 32, grabbed with a pair of metal tongs. Since the roundup had passed, Mr. Sawyers did not want to go to the trouble of selling one snake. Instead, he said, he planned to marinate it and then smoke it on a barbecue grill.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Eye on Midterms, Obama Pushes Rise in Minimum Wage", "Date": "2014-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW BRITAIN, Conn. \u2014 Flanked by four like-minded New England governors, President Obama took his campaign for a higher federal minimum wage to this rough-hewed city on Wednesday, declaring that \u201cnobody who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s time to give America a raise,\u201d Mr. Obama said to a rowdy crowd of 3,000 students at Central Connecticut State University. \u201cIt\u2019s not bad business to do right by your workers; it\u2019s good business.\u201dSaying that even in a high-tech economy there will always be hospital workers and servers at fast-food restaurants \u2014 \u201cpeople who work their tails off every day\u201d \u2014 Mr. Obama said a higher minimum wage would lift millions out of poverty and stimulate the broader economy.Raising the minimum wage from the current $7.25 an hour to $10.10 is both a legislative priority for the president and the kind of liberal policy proposal that could help the White House hold on to Democratic seats in Congress in a difficult midterm election year.Mr. Obama praised the governors \u2014 Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, Peter Shumlin of Vermont and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island \u2014 all Democrats who have pushed to raise the minimum wage in their states. Mr. Chafee has proposed raising it to $10.10 an hour over three years.Earlier, Mr. Obama ate a Korean-beef sandwich and chili during lunch with the four men at Cafe Beauregard, a diner in the heart of New Britain, a hard-hit town that is the home of the Stanley tool company. The cafe\u2019s owners, Rob Chiovoloni and Alice Bruno, said they paid their workers a minimum of $10 an hour.\u201cAs the owner put it,\u201d Mr. Obama said to reporters, \u201che knows what\u2019s it like to work all his life and he understands that if people are working hard, they shouldn\u2019t be in poverty, and that we should be able to do everything we can to make sure that happens.\u201dTwenty-two states and the District of Columbia have moved to raise their minimum wage above the federally mandated level, ranging from $7.40 to $9.32 an hour. The town of SeaTac, Wash., has been more aggressive, voting to raise it to $15 an hour.Last month, through an executive order, Mr. Obama raised the minimum wage for federal workers on new contracts to $10.10, effective in 2015. But raising the overall federal minimum wage would require Congressional action, a far-fetched prospect in a Republican-controlled House during an election year.Republicans say lifting the wage would cost jobs, pointing to a report last month by the Congressional Budget Office, which asserted that raising the federal minimum to $10.10 an hour would result in a loss of 500,000 jobs. A smaller increase, it said, would cost fewer jobs.But the White House disputes that analysis, saying a higher wage would lift the middle class and generate jobs by giving people more money to spend on goods and services.Mr. Obama had initially proposed raising the rate to $9 an hour, but in his State of the Union address in January, he threw his support behind a bill, sponsored by Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, and Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, that would raise it to $10.10, and index the wage to the rate of inflation thereafter.After discussing his wage proposal two weeks ago with members of the National Governors Association at the White House, Gov. Bobby Jindal, Republican of Louisiana, emerged to criticize Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal as evidence that his economic policies had failed, declaring that the president \u201cwas waving the white flag of surrender.\u201dHis comment drew a sharp retort from Mr. Malloy, who told the crowd on Wednesday, \u201cI don\u2019t see anybody waving a white flag. Bobby Jindal didn\u2019t make it to Connecticut.\u201dJust 5 percent of the nation\u2019s work force currently earns the minimum of $7.25 an hour, but moving that up to $10.10 an hour would affect 21.4 percent of workers, White House officials said, because everyone earning between $7.25 and $10.10 would get raises.\u201cIt\u2019s an appropriate correction; it\u2019s not a half step,\u201d Gene Sperling, the director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said to reporters on Tuesday. He said the increase \u201cwould not have any negative job impacts whatsoever.\u201dWith Mr. Obama\u2019s domestic agenda stymied in Congress, he is devoting a growing amount of time to fund-raising on behalf of Democrats. After speaking in Connecticut, the president flew to Boston, where he spoke at two fund-raising events, the first in Cambridge.Speaking later to about 70 supporters at a candlelight dinner at the Artists for Humanity EpiCenter in South Boston, Mr. Obama warned them about the dangers of complacency in the coming elections.\u201cIn the midterms, Democrats too often don\u2019t vote,\u201d he said. \u201cToo often, when there\u2019s not a presidential election, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s sexy, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s interesting. People tune out. And because the electorate has changed, we get walloped.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Murky Path for the Fed as Yellen Takes Reins", "Date": "2014-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Janet L. Yellen is taking over the leadership of the Federal Reserve on the cusp of a more challenging period for the central bank.For the last several years, Fed officials largely agreed that more had to be done to reduce unemployment and revive inflation. As the economy recovers, however, there are signs that old differences are returning as the Fed emphasizes clear communication as its primary policy tool.\u201cIt\u2019s a much tougher job to manage this committee than Bernanke had, because we\u2019re at more of a transitional point,\u201d said Julia Coronado, chief economist for North America at BNP Paribas, referring to Ben S. Bernanke, Ms. Yellen\u2019s predecessor. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a crisis, we\u2019re kind of recovering to a degree \u2014 and then the question is, How much can monetary policy do?\u201dThe immediate challenge confronting Ms. Yellen, who as Fed chairwoman will lead her first meeting of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee on Tuesday and Wednesday, is to overhaul the Fed\u2019s forward guidance for short-term interest rates.The Fed is gradually ending the expansion of its bond holdings, one aspect of its economic stimulus campaign. It is widely expected to announce on Wednesday that it will add $55 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in April, down from $65 billion in March and $85 billion each month last year. Fed officials say they intend to end purchases in the fall unless the economic outlook changes sharply.But officials have offered much less clarity about the policy they regard as the centerpiece of the stimulus campaign, the Fed\u2019s effort to suppress borrowing costs for businesses and consumers not just by holding short-term interest rates near zero, but also by convincing investors that rates will remain low for some time.They argue that the task of calibrating monetary policy is inherently becoming more complicated as the economy recovers, like the difference between sailing quickly toward an island and then maneuvering slowly into the harbor.Milestones in the career of Janet L. Yellen, President Obama\u2019s choice to be chief of the Federal Reserve, including video recollections from friends and colleagues.John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said that describing the Fed\u2019s plans in terms of a broader set of economic indicators would be more vague, but also more accurate. \u201cHow to do that without going to dates and using numbers, that will be the art of crafting how we communicate,\u201d he said.A shift toward descriptive guidance could diminish the potency of the Fed\u2019s effort to suppress interest rates if investors find the goals less clear or more likely to shift. The Bank of England has struggled to dissuade investors who continue to bet that it will raise rates sooner than the timetable implied by its forecasts.But the Fed is unlikely to face an immediate test of its credibility because the economy remains weak. \u201cTheir job is being made easier by the fact that the data is reinforcing their message of patience,\u201d Ms. Coronado said. \u201cIn contrast to the Bank of England, which is fighting strong data and trying to convince the market that they\u2019re going to be low for long, everyone believes the Fed right now.\u201d\u201cWhen unemployment was so high and inflation was so low, it was just a debate about how much we should do, and eventually we\u2019ll be in a situation where it won\u2019t be so obvious what we should do,\u201d Mr. Williams said.He added that Ms. Yellen, who hired him as research director when she was president of the San Francisco Fed, was well suited to the challenge.\u201cShe\u2019s seen as and is a fair person, and she\u2019ll be listening to counterarguments, she\u2019ll be trying to find a consensus, but at the same time she has strong views and a very determined sense of what our purpose is at the Fed and how we can be set to achieve it,\u201d he said. \u201cHer willingness to entertain conflicting views, accept differences of opinion but at the same time say, \u2018Here\u2019s where we are coming out at the end of the day,\u2019 that will be her strong suit.\u201dAdam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, said that growing divisions would also be a cause for celebration, because they would show the economy was returning to health.\u201cThe only time it should be obvious and you should be seeing unanimous votes is when you\u2019re far away from where you want to be,\u201d Mr. Posen said. When the economy is closer to normal health, \u201cYou should expect lots of split votes, if people are really voting their conscience, because you should be close to the right policy and therefore there should be fine judgments.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Moves on Banking Reforms", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialChinese banking regulators said on Tuesday that the country would remove government limits on the interest rates banks pay on deposits sometime in the next two years. They also said that private businesses would be allowed to open five banks in two major cities and two provinces. Depending on how these changes are carried out (many details are not public), they could significantly shake up the financial system, which is dominated by state-owned banks that primarily lend to inefficient government enterprises and a fast-growing shadow banking system that operates with little regulatory oversight.Allowing the establishment of the first privately operated banks in the country in Shanghai and Tianjin and in the provinces of Guangdong and Zhejiang could help increase lending to privately run small and medium-size businesses. Chinese officials have to strike a careful balance. If they hit the brakes too hard to curb lending by state-owned banks and shadow lenders, they could precipitate a crisis. But if they are slow to act, the financial system will become even more vulnerable. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Indian Students Taking U.S. Graduate School Test", "Date": "2014-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational EducationWASHINGTON \u2014 The number of Graduate Record Examinations taken by students in India increased 70 percent in 2013 from the year before, according to figures released last month. The G.R.E. is the entrance test used by most graduate-school programs in the United States. The numbers, from the Educational Testing Service, a nonprofit company that administers the G.R.E., suggest that a recent surge in the number of Indian students entering American graduate schools may continue. A report released last fall by the Council of Graduate Schools showed a 40 percent rise in first-time graduate enrollments from India from 2012 to 2013.The new figures from E.T.S. show that more than 90,000 G.R.E. tests were taken by Indian students in 2013. The number of tests taken in the United States increased 5 percent from the year before, while tests taken in Asia over all increased 35 percent.The total number of G.R.E. tests taken worldwide last year was the second-highest in the 65-year history of the test, at 731,000, the company said. The highest number was in 2011, when more than 800,000 tests were taken.Christine Betaneli, a G.R.E. spokeswoman for E.T.S., said the company expanded its reach in India last year by conducting more visits to campuses and student fairs. It also increased emphasis on social media engagement with Indian students.\u201cI believe that translated into increased awareness and knowledge,\u201d Ms. Betaneli said. \u201cBut a 70 percent increase is enormous, and there\u2019s probably a lot of factors that go into that jump.\u201dRahul Choudaha, director of research and strategic development at World Education Services, a nonprofit organization that studies international education trends, said the increase in G.R.E. taking in India could be the result of \u201cpent-up demand\u201d from that nation\u2019s poor economy in recent years. He also said an increasing number of business schools were using the G.R.E.According to E.T.S., more than 1,100 business schools accept G.R.E. scores for their M.B.A. programs, an 8 percent increase from the previous year. The number of international programs accepting G.R.E. scores increased by nearly 12 percent, compared with 2012, according to E.T.S.Debra W. Stewart, president of the Council of Graduate Schools, said she was not sure exactly what might be driving the increase in graduate enrollments from India that her group documented in a report in November.\u201cI don\u2019t have any confidence in explanations about this topic,\u201d she said.Applications to American graduate programs from India increased 1 percent from 2009 to 2010, 8 percent from 2010 to 2011, 3 percent from 2011 to 2012, and 22 percent from 2012 to 2013. \u201cIndia has over time been much more difficult to predict than the patterns in most other countries,\u201d she said.When the council released its report in November, Ms. Stewart said that she had often heard speculation that a devaluation of the Indian currency, the rupee, could explain the increase, but she was skeptical.\u201cThat can work two ways,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople can say the Indian economy is in trouble, and therefore people are escaping and coming to the U.S. in large numbers. Or they could say the Indian economy is in trouble, the currency is down, and therefore they can\u2019t financially afford to come to graduate school in the U.S.\u201dMs. Stewart noted, however, that Britain, which has traditionally drawn large numbers of Indian students, had recently become less attractive to international students because of drops in international-student funding and changes in immigration policies. That, she said, might be a factor making the United States more attractive to Indian students.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Gray Jobs Enigma", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHue Galloway, 63, was laid off by Ticketmaster in 2008 but couldn\u2019t find a job. His son has helped him out.In her years as a probation officer north of Dallas, Patricia Lowell reckoned that she would work until age 65, confident that she could then retire halfway comfortably on her pension and Social Security. After retiring, she thought, she would pick up some extra spending money by working part-time retail jobs during the holiday season.In that way, Ms. Lowell was like the three out of four Americans who say they plan to continue working after they retire from their main job.But for Ms. Lowell, things did not turn out as planned. At age 58, she quit her job as a probation officer for Grayson County in order to care for her mother, who had cancer, diabetes and congestive heart failure. Her decision to leave her job of 23 years, she said, was made possible only by Texas\u2019 then-recent decision to provide health insurance to longtime probation officers who retire before they qualify for Medicare at age 65.\u201cI wanted to continue working, but then this opportunity came up allowing me to retire and take care of my mother,\u201d Ms. Lowell said. \u201cIt all came together very nicely.\u201d She retired in late 2004, spending dozens of hours each week caring for her mother, who died in 2010 at age 92.Now, nearly 10 years after leaving her job, Ms. Lowell is happily retired, with no plans to return to work. She is doing better financially than she anticipated, receiving her pension as well as $1,292 a month from Social Security. In an unexpected bonus, she remarried five years ago, and her husband\u2019s retirement income has gone far to solidify their finances.\u201cI don\u2019t regret at all that I retired,\u201d Ms. Lowell said. She is an active volunteer in her church, and she and her husband love taking road trips to explore Texas. And every few months they drive 300 miles south to Houston to visit her son and three grandchildren.Ms. Lowell personifies a disconnect among Americans: while nearly three-fourths of Americans say they will continue working after retiring from their main job, only 18.9 percent of Americans age 65 or older actually remain in the work force. Many workers in their 40s, 50s and early 60s are convinced that they will want to or need to work well past 65 and even after retiring from their principal job, yet many retire earlier than they anticipated. There are many reasons for this: Perhaps they had health problems or grew unsatisfied with their jobs, or they realized that their nest egg was large enough for them to get by in retirement \u2014 or, like Ms. Lowell, they needed to care for a loved one. \u00a0Sara Rix, an analyst at the AARP Public Policy Institute, sees numerous reasons so many Americans retire considerably earlier than they had anticipated. \u201cA lot of people have expectations and desires to work in retirement, but the number who actually do is pretty low,\u201d Ms. Rix said. \u201cA lot of things happen \u2014 workers suffer ill health or job loss and that propels them out of the labor force.\u201dAlicia H. Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, notes that many Americans are working until later in life. The percentage of Americans 65 and over who remain in the labor force has grown significantly \u2014 to 18.9 percent from 12 percent two decades ago. Among the reasons she cites are people remaining healthier longer, fewer physically taxing lift-and-lug jobs, and, after the stock market plummeted during the recent recession, the conclusion that it is smart to work longer to build up one\u2019s nest egg.Ms. Munnell also puzzles over why most Americans say they want to work after retiring from their main job while a far lower percentage actually work after turning 65.\u201cSometimes there\u2019s a positive reason \u2014 your spouse retires, and you decide you want to retire, too,\u201d Ms. Munnell said. She said there were numerous \u201cshocks\u201d that caused people to retire earlier than expected, like deteriorating health or an unanticipated change in wealth \u2014 perhaps because of a soaring stock market. Another common \u201cshock,\u201d she said, is a job change \u2014 maybe a layoff or a transfer to a less satisfactory position or getting a new, more demanding, hotheaded boss.\u201cSometimes people quit their main job and think they\u2019re going to find another job,\u201d Ms. Munnell said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still discrimination in the workplace. A lot of employers don\u2019t like hiring old people that much. Older people look for work, but studies show that they then get discouraged pretty easily. You go, you look and then you give up.\u201dThat was definitely not the case for Hue Galloway, who worked for 12 years as a field technician for Ticketmaster in Connecticut. In that job, he crisscrossed the state, maintaining and repairing Ticketmaster\u2019s computers and printers at dozens of establishments, from the Mohegan Sun casino to theaters in Hartford.In 2008, during the depths of the recession, Mr. Galloway was laid off. He was 58 at the time. \u201cI figured I\u2019d be working there until 67 or 70,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was shooting for. I\u2019d need the money. Plus, I enjoyed my job.\u201dMr. Galloway was determined to find another job; he spent three years looking, applying for more than 200 technical jobs. \u201cI got no place,\u201d he said \u201cI was like applying to five or six places a week, and over those three years, I might have gotten four interviews.\u201d\u201cI really feel I was discriminated against because of age,\u201d he added. \u201cThey found young people with two years of college to do basically the same kind of work I was doing, and they paid them less.\u201dHe was earning $17 an hour when he was laid off. For two years he lived on unemployment insurance and his savings, but that was not enough to keep the bank from foreclosing on his house. He could no longer afford the $1,500 monthly mortgage payments.\u201cIt was very hard,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I just couldn\u2019t pay for it.\u201d He is at least fortunate that his son lets him stay in one apartment of a three-family house that he rents out; \u2014 in return, he serves as the informal superintendent.Many Americans think it won\u2019t be hard to continue working into their late 60s or even their 70s. But Ms. Rix of AARP says it is not always so simple. \u201cEveryone is going to have to run faster and faster to stay in place at work, and that makes it more difficult for us to remain employed,\u201d she said. And once people leave their longtime jobs, she added, \u201cIn this economy, it\u2019s pretty tough to find something else.\u201dTeresa Ghilarducci, an economics professor and retirement expert at the New School, said many aging Americans underestimated the difficulties of continuing to work and overestimated the difficulties of retiring.\u201cPeople see the cost of not working isn\u2019t so bad because they figure that they can get by,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the benefits of not working are much greater than they thought \u2014 they can relax a lot more.\u201dProfessor Ghilarducci added that today\u2019s jobs might not require as much lifting, bending and stooping as the manufacturing or warehouse jobs of old, but a lot of jobs are plenty demanding, requiring keen eyesight and intense concentration. \u201cPeople thought their jobs would get a little easier, but they\u2019ve gotten a bit worse,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a proletarianization of the jobs that older workers have.\u201dHelen Dennis, an author and consultant on retirement and an adjunct professor at the University of Southern California, says it is not surprising that a far larger percentage of Americans say they are going to work into their late 60s and 70s than actually do.\u201cA big factor is uncertainly,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople look at their savings and pensions and say, \u2018I think it\u2019s going to be O.K., but I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t understand the Affordable Care Act, and my mother is 90 and I have a daughter who just got divorced who is coming to live with me. There are so many uncertainties that to be safe I\u2019m going to work until whatever age.\u2019 But then when people reach 61, 62, 63, a lot of them figure out that they can retire.\u201dMany Americans constantly weigh the pros and cons of continuing to work once they reach their late 50s and early 60s. Many conclude it\u2019s not worth it. Ms. Dennis explained: \u201cWith the stresses of the workplace, with the mantra of doing more with less, now I\u2019m doing two people\u2019s jobs. We have a new manager. They\u2019re changing the whole team again. The traffic here in L.A. is killing me, and my best friend just died and there\u2019s a big message that life is short. I think that\u2019s part of why people decide to retire.\u201dShe added, \u201cSome people realize that any job I can find is for a minimum wage, and it\u2019s not worth my time.\u201d Barbara Goldberg is a prime example of this approach. For 30 years, she conducted focus groups for Fortune 500 companies including IBM, Coca-Cola, American Airlines and General Motors. Ms. Goldberg, 72, held regular salons at her Los Angeles home for, in her words, \u201cintellectual and socially aware women.\u201d At one salon in 2008, a retired government official spoke about the problems facing drought-stricken countries in West Africa and the contaminated water that people drink there.\u201cI left my marketing work because I was so moved hearing about the dire need for water in West Africa and the plight of women and girls to get water,\u201d Ms. Goldberg said. \u201cAt the time, my business was slowing down, which was fine with me because I was traveling more and enjoying life a bit more. When this opportunity presented itself, it was the most natural thing in the world for me to do, although I had never worked in the nonprofit world.\u201dAlthough economists would say she has technically retired because she no longer works for pay, Ms. Goldberg does not view herself as retired. She typically devotes 50 hours a week to raising money, holding meetings and speaking at elementary and high schools about Africa\u2019s water woes.\u201cI loved doing focus groups, and doing that suited me just fine,\u201d Ms. Goldberg said. \u201cBut I was very conscious of what I wanted to do in the next chapter of my life. This is something that\u2019s very meaningful to me, and it will leave a very powerful legacy to my three granddaughters.\u201dLike Ms. Goldberg, Gary Westerman left his job voluntarily after three decades. He was an engineer and manager at a semiconductor company in Austin, Tex., and in the fall of 2012, his company announced plans to lay off 900 employees. \u201cTwo weeks before Christmas I volunteered to take the place of somebody else who had two or three kids,\u201d he said. \u201cI could have stayed another four or five years. I have been through 37 rounds of layoffs in 33 years. I survived all of them.\u201dMr. Westerman, 65, is looking for another job, but it is proving harder than he anticipated. He is an adviser to several job clubs where he teaches people how to network better, because networking is such an important part of finding jobs. \u201cIt will be another 10 years before I quit looking for jobs,\u201d he said.Jerry Tollefson shares that sentiment, still reeling from leaving his job in November when the 500-bed nursing home in Milwaukee at which he worked announced it would close. For six years, Mr. Tollefson, 63, was its events coordinator, coaxing residents to tell stories of their youth, serenading them with Ella Fitzgerald and Perry Como records.\u201cI loved it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe nursing home gave me its above-and-beyond award.\u201d\u201cI can probably sneak by financially, maybe not taking all the trips you want to take,\u201d he said. \u201cI can afford my home and have two squares a day.\u201d He has been looking for jobs, but \u201cthe job market is difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cHere in Milwaukee, probably like everywhere else, it seems that the jobs out there are geared to the I.T. computer business. When I get on a computer, I still hunt for the on-and-off switch. Young people who have grown up on computers, they have an advantage. Multitasking and being on the computer are not in my wheelhouse.\u201dStill, Mr. Tollefson, who once did fund-raising for nonprofits, is intent on finding a job. \u201cThe bottom line is, I get very antsy. I like to be busy,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to work until 70. Maybe it\u2019ll be part time.\u201d A few days ago a nursing home invited him to interview for a position as its program and events assistant. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice fit, and hopefully something comes of it,\u201d he said. \u201cHalf the battle is having something you really enjoy doing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yen-Pinching Undercuts Japan\u2019s Push Against Years of Deflation", "Date": "2014-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 The loose change in Yusa Nishimura\u2019s purse could be undermining Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s economic recovery plan for Japan.As often as she can, Ms. Nishimura tucks away 500-yen coins, worth a little under $5. Ms. Nishimura, 23, even has a folder that displays them so Japan\u2019s highest-denomination coins are easier to count.Cash nest eggs like Ms. Nishimura\u2019s made sense in slow-growing Japan, where during 15 years of deflation her money was worth more as time went on. The spa getaway she planned to splurge on was likely to get cheaper if she waited longer. But as Mr. Abe faces pressure to show results in his fight to lead Japan out of deflation, he is urging cash hoarders like Ms. Nishimura to change their modest mind-sets \u2014 for the economy\u2019s sake, as well as for their own.Ms. Nishimura, like many Japanese, is unconvinced. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced inflation. It doesn\u2019t seem real to me,\u201d said Ms. Nishimura, who works at a technology company in the port city of Kobe.If more people expected a future of rising prices and wages instead of falling ones, Mr. Abe\u2019s reasoning goes, they would spend now before goods became more expensive. To beat rising prices, they would also invest their money in higher-yielding investments. Companies, confident of a new era of higher sales and profits, would raise prices and wages, completing a positive economic cycle.A big obstacle in Japan\u2019s path, Mr. Abe says, has been the entrenched attitudes and behaviors in the country after so many years of falling prices. \u201cIt is not easy to alter a deflation mind-set that has been in place here for over 15 years,\u201d Mr. Abe told Parliament last month. For most countries, moderately rising prices are a normal part of life. A Big Mac hamburger in the United States, which went for about $2.50 in 1998, now costs over $4.50. Since the turn of the century, American consumer prices have risen from 1.5 to 4 percent a year. But in Japan, overall prices have not risen since the late 1990s. The Big Mac still costs about the same here as it did in 1998: about 300 yen, or almost $3. The price of another popular fast-food offering \u2014 the beef-and-rice bowl from the Yoshinoya restaurant chain \u2014 has fallen from 400 yen in the late 1990s to 280 yen today. During that time, average worker incomes have also fallen.Mr. Abe hopes his policies will change that. Since coming to power in late 2012, he has pursued aggressive economic and monetary policies to bring an end to deflation. His first measure, a blast of monetary policy that has doubled the country\u2019s money supply, has already elevated prices by weakening the yen and pushing up the cost of energy and food imports. Signs of a broader rise in prices are mixed. Japan\u2019s Consumer Price Index rose just 0.4 percent in 2013. Discounting energy and food prices, the index actually fell 0.2 percent compared with 2012. Both are far below the Bank of Japan\u2019s target of a 2 percent inflation rate by next year. The central bank voted Tuesday to keep its policy on hold.But even that creep upward in prices has been greeted with shock and incredulity. Businesses across the country that are raising their prices are issuing long, apologetic notes. \u201cIt truly pains our hearts to announce that we will soon revise our prices,\u201d the Kidoizumi brewery, which has made sake for 135 years in Chiba, east of Tokyo, said recently in an announcement, blaming rising energy and input costs for its price increase.The slow progress in beating deflation reflects the difficulties of overcoming entrenched expectations and behaviors, especially among younger Japanese who have never experienced rising prices, said Taro Saito, senior economist at the NLI Research Institute in Tokyo.Older generations still remember the \u201coil shocks\u201d of the 1970s, which sent consumer prices soaring, as well the country\u2019s asset bubble of the 1980s. More recently, they remember how Japan fell into deflation after its\u00a0bubble economy burst in the early 1990s.\u00a0But with deflation the norm for years now, younger Japanese tend to expect far less inflation than their seniors, according to a survey taken last year by the Cabinet Office. This helps makes younger Japanese more cautious spenders, as well. A government survey of households last year highlighted stark intergenerational disparities: Households headed by people between 60-69 years increased spending by 2.7 percent, while households headed by under-30-year-olds spent 0.8 percent less. Economists worry that a planned sales tax increase here in April will further dampen consumer sentiment.\u201cIt\u2019s possible that long-term personal experiences with prices are affecting individual inflation expectations,\u201d Mr. Saito said.Some economists are beginning to question whether the obstacles to beating deflation lie with Mr. Abe\u2019s policies, and not with consumers.\u201cInflation should be driven by actual demand for goods and services,\u201d said Shinya Imura, an economics professor at Chuo University in Tokyo. \u201cBut what\u2019s happening now is something else. Businesses are raising prices because they\u2019re being squeezed by higher input costs. That means businesses are unlikely to have the means to raise wages soon, and consumers aren\u2019t going to buy more.\u201dThis dynamic is clear at the Manrai ramen shop, a Tokyo institution loved by locals for its pork and leek broth and a longstanding commitment to rock-bottom prices. When Manrai recently raised the price of its cheapest bowl of ramen for the first time in over two decades, to 250 yen from 200, it caused consternation.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Ryo Kobayashi, a recruitment agency worker and Manrai regular. \u201cIf prices start rising everywhere, I\u2019m not going to be able to eat out anymore.\u201dSuch reactions call into question Mr. Abe\u2019s rosy vision of rising prices, profits and incomes. Manrai raised prices not because it was confident of future sales but because it was squeezed by higher input costs, including electricity, gas, pork and noodles made from imported flour.In fact, by raising prices, Manrai risks losing customers like Mr. Kobayashi. (\u201cI\u2019ll fry up cheap vegetables like bean sprouts,\u201d he said.)Rather than start an economic revival, this \u201ccost-push\u201d inflation, as economists call it, could become a rising threat to Japanese stuck in a deflationary mind-set. Such people could see their hard-earned savings eroded by rising prices, warned Yukio Sakurai, a housing analyst based in Tokyo.And choices that made sense under deflation \u2014 renting, for example, instead of investing in property \u2014 could saddle them with mounting costs, erode their standard of living and shut them out of any benefits of a stronger economy, experts warn.\u201cYounger Japanese need to change their mind-sets now, or get left behind,\u201d Mr. Sakurai said. \u201cThey would do well to talk to their parents and grandparents.\u201dZhiyi Yang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ukraine Turns to Its Oligarchs for Political Help", "Date": "2014-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 As tensions rose on the streets of the Russian-speaking eastern portion of Ukraine, the response of the new government in the capital on Sunday was not to send troops, but to send rich people.The interim government, worried about Russian efforts to destabilize or seize regions in eastern Ukraine after effectively taking control of the Crimean peninsula in the south, is recruiting the country\u2019s wealthy businessmen, known as the oligarchs, to serve as governors of the eastern provinces.The strategy, which Ukrainian news media are attributing to Yulia V. Tymoshenko, a former prime minister and party leader, is recognition that the oligarchs represent the country\u2019s industrial and business elite, and exercise great influence over thousands of workers in the east, which is largely ethnically Russian.The office of President Oleksandr V. Turchynov announced on Sunday the appointments of two billionaires \u2014 Sergei Taruta in Donetsk and Ihor Kolomoysky in Dnipropetrovsk \u2014 and more were reportedly under consideration for positions in the eastern regions.The approach is a gambit, the latest of many, for the interim government that is swaying between efforts to avoid angering its nationalist base in western Ukrainian while trying frantically to put in place a political strategy to tamp down tensions in eastern Ukraine, lest the Russian military find a pretext to intervene.Ms. Tymoshenko, who met late Saturday with Mr. Turchynov and the prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, who are both members of the Fatherland party that she leads, is a savvy operative in Ukrainian politics and was a wealthy businesswoman before entering politics in the late 1990s. A spokeswoman for Ms. Tymoshenko declined to discuss her role in devising the strategy.14 PhotosAfter the meeting, the government began asking the oligarchs to take the positions in the regional governments.\u201cIt was a plan for stabilization,\u201d an aide to one of the leaders, who was not authorized to discuss it publicly, said of the decision.The ultra-wealthy industrialists wield such power in Ukraine that they form what amounts to a shadow government, with empires of steel and coal, telecoms and media, and armies of workers. Persuading some to serve as governors in the east was a small victory for the new government in Kiev.\u201cThe government is doing what it can to avoid provoking any internal divisions,\u201d Steven Pifer, a former American ambassador to Ukraine who is now at the Brookings Institution, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey need people who have credibility in eastern Ukraine. The risk is this will be seen as business as usual by putting wealthy people in government. That has been part of the problem for the past 22 years.\u201dThe push on the Crimean peninsula for decentralization that quickly found support from Russia\u2019s military could easily spread to eastern Ukraine, a region deeply dependent on Russian trade and energy, and where the nationalistic words and deeds of the new government alienated many.In another conciliatory gesture, Mr. Turchynov on Sunday vetoed a divisive law passed last week that would have eliminated Russian as an official second language: about half of Ukraine\u2019s population speaks Russian.What had been the country\u2019s largest political party, the Party of Regions, led by former President Viktor F. Yanukovych, had its base in the east, but now few representatives are in the government in Kiev. The challenge is to quickly restore the foundations of political authority in the east to build up the interim government\u2019s credibility as an inclusive leadership, willing to recognize Ukraine\u2019s diversity, and in time to slow the centrifugal forces of an emerging pro-Russian uprising in the east.Yuri V. Lutsenko, an opposition leader who played a prominent role in the three-month protest movement that led to the toppling of Mr. Yanukovych, told the newspaper Ukrainska Pravda that the purpose of appointing the oligarchs to run the regional governments \u201cis to stabilize the situation in regions using not only state resources, but also private resources for the integrity of Ukraine.\u201dMr. Taruta, appointed to lead the Donetsk region, is the chairman of the board of ISD Corporation, a sprawling Ukrainian steel enterprise. Ukraine\u2019s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov, issued a statement on Sunday through his company, System Capital Management, signaling that he would not enter politics. Mr. Akhmetov said that he supported Ukraine\u2019s territorial unity and would focus on running his company to improve the economy. \u201cOur objective is to ensure the safety of people and their families and secure stable operations of companies in the country,\u201d the statement said.Viktor Pinchuk, Ukraine\u2019s second wealthiest man and the son-in-law of a former president, issued a statement signaling support for the appointments but noting he had not taken one. \u201cIn such times in Ukraine big business can play a role temporarily in government,\u201d it said, \u201cwhile in usual times Ukraine\u2019s challenge is to separate business and politics.\u201dMr. Taruta issued a statement saying that he decided to serve as governor out of a \u201cdesire to protect our country where there is no difference which language you speak or which religion you believe in.\u201d\u201cEverybody has a right for a new, strong Ukraine,\u201d he added.Mr. Kolomoysky, a steel, airline and media tycoon, accepted the position of governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, an area on the fracture line between east and west in Ukraine. His acceptance was first reported on Sunday by 1+1, a television station that Mr. Kolomoysky owns.Ukrainian news media reported that Vadim Novinsky, the owner of Smart Holding Company, who Forbes magazine estimated last year had a net worth of $1.9 billion, is under consideration as Kiev\u2019s representative to Crimea, though his duties would be unclear, since the peninsula is already solidly under Russian control.Another figure reported to be under consideration for a governorship in the east is Aleksandr Yaroslavsky, a developer and banker. The interim government offered him the position of governor of the Kharkiv region, where pro-Russian protesters on Saturday overran a regional administration building.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Routine Flight, Till Both Routine and Flight Vanish", "Date": "2014-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetracing a Lost Flight8 PhotosThe night sky was clear above the clouds, and the last glimmer of a setting half-moon had faded when Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, cruising at 35,000 feet over the Gulf of Thailand, approached the border between Malaysian and Vietnamese airspace on its usual route to Beijing. What happened next should have been routine for a twice-daily milk run between two of Asia\u2019s most important cities. Air traffic controllers outside Kuala Lumpur usually hand the jet off to their counterparts in Ho Chi Minh City as the flight turns northeast toward the Chinese capital.But in those early hours of March 8, pilots flying nearby heard an unusual crescendo of chatter on the radio frequencies used by radar control in Vietnam and Malaysia. Air traffic personnel in both countries were trying and failing to reach the plane.\u201cAny stations in contact with Malaysian 370, please relay.\u201dVietnamese and Malaysian controllers asked one aircraft after another to radio the jet. Pilots listened as one plane after another tried and heard only static.\u201cMalaysian 370, this is Malaysian 88.\u201d\u201cMalaysian 370, this is Malaysian 52.\u201dPeople familiar with the calls, describing them for the first time, said they were calm, even laconic. The pilots trying to reach the airliner had no reason to believe it had suffered anything more than an ordinary radio malfunction. But those initial attempts to find a plane in the skies would soon evolve into an urgent multinational search operation spanning land and sea in two hemispheres. They signaled the start of what has become perhaps the most perplexing case in modern aviation \u2014 one that investigators say may take years to solve, or could remain a mystery forever. More than two weeks after Flight 370 disappeared, unbridled speculation surrounds the unfolding global drama. So much is uncertain about what happened on the plane, and so much of what has been disclosed by Malaysian authorities has been contradicted, that hardly any theory of its fate can be easily dismissed. On Saturday, the authorities said a Chinese satellite had made a new sighting of a possible object floating in the southern Indian Ocean in the area that is now the focus of the search, and China was sending ships to investigate.Based on dozens of interviews with people whose lives were touched by the plane as well as with outside experts and investigators from the two dozen countries searching for answers, this report presents a portrait of Flight 370 and the search to find it using what is known to date. But by necessity, it is an incomplete picture. A Routine NightPassengers are advised to arrive at least two hours in advance. On March 7, a delegation of 34 Chinese artists, relatives and organizers who had spent the past several days participating in an art exhibit in Kuala Lumpur played it safe with the city\u2019s unpredictable Friday night traffic and arrived about 8 p.m.Perhaps the most prominent of the artists was the flight\u2019s oldest passenger, Liu Rusheng, 77, a calligrapher who had published an essay about how much he treasured life because he had \u201ccheated death\u201d six times, beginning when, as a baby, he was abandoned temporarily by his parents as they fled Japanese soldiers invading China. Mr. Liu had \u201cthe energy of a young man,\u201d recalled Daniel Liau, the delegation\u2019s host, who accompanied the travelers to the airport and helped them check their luggage. They stood chatting under the modernist scalloped ceilings of the main terminal for about 90 minutes. Later, after the group had passed through security and taken the monorail to the satellite terminal, Mr. Liau called them one last time.\u201cHow are the artists?\u201d he recalled asking one of the organizers, Hou Bo, who replied they had already reached the gate. \u201cEverybody is O.K.,\u201d Mr. Hou assured him.Boarding began about midnight. The airline would have allowed the elderly \u2014 including Mr. Liu and his wife, Bao Yuanhua, 73 \u2014 and the families traveling with the two infants booked on the flight to get settled first. Next came the passengers holding passes for the 35 seats in business class.Philip Wood, 50, an IBM executive from Texas and a regular on the flight because he was relocating from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur, was in coach, but hoped to be upgraded. He had long legs and a platinum frequent-flier card, said his partner, Sarah Bajc, 48, a teacher.Ms. Bajc said she exchanged a dozen text messages with him before the flight about the movers, scheduled to arrive at their home in Beijing the next morning. \u201cWe discussed the state of packing, what still needed to be done,\u201d she said. His last message came just before he left for the airport.Others on the flight were just passing through Kuala Lumpur, including Shi Xianwen, 26, a new father returning to China from a business trip to Australia. At the airport in Perth, he spent 40 minutes picking out a bracelet watch for his wife, whose birthday was approaching, an employee at the duty-free shop said.And two passengers boarded using stolen passports: Pouria Nourmohammadi Mehrdad, 19, and Seyed Mohammed Reza Delavar, 29, Iranian men described by Interpol as migrants being smuggled into Europe.Mohammad Mallaeibasir, 18, an information technology student in Kuala Lumpur, said the pair stayed in his apartment the night before they left. Mr. Mehrdad, a friend from high school in Tehran, told him he was starting a new life in Hamburg, Germany, where his mother was waiting. \u201cHe was quite nervous,\u201d Mr. Mallaeibasir recalled. \u201cI could see it on his face.\u201dThe next night, he drove them to the airport and offered to help them check in, but they insisted on entering separately, Mr. Delavar first. The two high school buddies waited in the car for five to 10 minutes, smoking cigarettes, before Mr. Mehrdad got out to leave.This animation shows where floating debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 could have drifted if experts are correct about where the plane went down.Mr. Mallaeibasir gave him a hug, told him to have a safe flight and watched as his friend carried a large backpack and a laptop computer bag into the terminal. That was the last he saw of him.The AirplaneThe plane the passengers boarded was a Boeing 777, one of the world\u2019s most popular and advanced passenger jets, and Boeing\u2019s first fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, in which electronic controls replaced manual ones. Pilots send commands that are conveyed to the wings and other components, and a computer helps keep the plane steady.The \u201cTriple Seven,\u201d as it often called, has all but replaced the 747 because it is cheaper to operate and can fly up to 16 hours without stopping to refuel. It also has one of the industry\u2019s best safety records, with only two serious accidents in the 19 years it has been in service.Malaysia Airlines, the nation\u2019s state-run carrier, began using the Boeing 777 in 1997 and eventually had 15 in its fleet. One of them, the 404th model to roll off Boeing\u2019s assembly line in Everett, Wash., was delivered to the airline in May 2002 and registered with tail number 9M-MRO. This was the plane used for Flight 370 that has disappeared.Malaysia Airlines has said the jet has been involved in only one previous safety incident. On Aug. 9, 2012, the tip of one of its wings broke off after it clipped the tail of a China Eastern Airlines Airbus A340 while taxiing at Shanghai Pudong International Airport. No one was hurt. Boeing said it sent a team of engineers and mechanics to remove and replace the damaged wing sections, and returned the plane to service after testing.Boeing recommends a light maintenance inspection of the 777 after about 500 hours of flight time. Known as an \u201cA check,\u201d the inspection usually is conducted in a hangar by a team of about 15 engineers working about 10 hours, often overnight. Malaysia Airlines said the jet\u2019s last A check took place on Feb. 23, and uncovered no problems.By the time it pulled up to the gate at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on March 8, the plane had completed more than 7,500 flights and clocked over 53,400 hours in the air, according to Flightglobal, a news and data service for the aviation sector. That put it well within the average economic life of 23 years for a wide-body passenger jet.In other words, there was little to distinguish this plane from the roughly 1,170 other Boeing 777s in use. That is why it is so crucial to determine if the plane\u2019s disappearance was due to any malfunction or defect related to its design, build or engineering. \u201cThe industry does not like uncertainty,\u201d said Mark Rosenker, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. \u201cWe will find out what happened.\u201dBoardingAs they stepped onto the plane, the 227 passengers of Flight 370 were greeted by the flight attendants, four women in sarong kebayas and six men in gray three-piece suits. Some distributed hand towels, juice and newspapers in business class; others helped those in economy find their seats.Outside, ground crews loaded the passenger luggage into the jet\u2019s cargo hold, which can carry up to six pallets and 14 shipping containers. The airline said no hazardous or valuable goods were on the flight. But among the cargo were a \u201csignificant\u201d number of lithium batteries \u2014 which can be flammable \u2014 more than is typically sent in a shipment, one American official said.After the doors closed, the chief steward, Andrew Nari, would have welcomed the passengers via the loudspeaker and reminded them to turn off their cellphones. Before shutting off his own, he sent a message to his mother. \u201cIt was just a normal SMS telling me that his plane would fly off soon,\u201d she later told The Star, a local newspaper.In the cockpit were the pilots: the captain, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, who joined the airline in 1981 and had 18,365 hours of flying experience, and his first officer, Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, who was transitioning to the Boeing 777 from the airline\u2019s narrow-body fleet.At 1:07 a.m., as the jet approached the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, ground crews received what the authorities have described as a routine text message from the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or Acars, which sends regular updates on the condition of the plane by radio or satellite.By then, the first beverage service of the flight was most likely underway: soft drinks, juice and peanuts in economy; and in business, various drinks, including Champagne, along with a snack such as charcoal-grilled chicken and lamb satay in peanut sauce. The in-flight entertainment system offered a wide selection of movies. Air traffic control in Subang, outside Kuala Lumpur, followed the plane by tracking its transponder, a device that \u201csquawks\u201d or emits an identifying signal in response to a signal from radar. The night began with Flight 370 squawking code 2157 and reporting altitude, speed and bearing.As the plane approached Vietnamese airspace, Subang informed the pilots that they were being transferred to radar control in Ho Chi Minh City. At 1:19 a.m., a voice identified by the authorities as that of the first officer, Mr. Fariq, replied, \u201cAll right, good night.\u201dTwo minutes later, Flight 370\u2019s transponder stopped responding. It is unclear whether someone turned a dial on an instrument panel between the pilot and co-pilot and put the transponder in standby mode, or whether a malfunction caused it to go quiet.One moment, radar showed the plane traveling northwest at 542 miles per hour. The next, it was gone.The military in Vietnam marked the time at 43 seconds past 1:20 a.m.Mystery SignalAs air traffic controllers struggled to re-establish contact with Flight 370, military radar at the Butterworth air force base on Malaysia\u2019s west coast picked up an unidentified aircraft near where the plane disappeared.But the watch team, normally an officer and three enlisted personnel, either failed to notice the signal or decided not to designate and track it as a \u201czombie,\u201d which would have pushed the information up the chain of command and possibly alerted air command.At a briefing on the base the next night, about 80 air force personnel were told there was \u201cno proof\u201d the unidentified signal showed the missing plane making a sharp turn, flying back across Peninsular Malaysia and then turning again and heading northwest over the Strait of Malacca, a person familiar with the situation said.But investigators now believe that is exactly what happened.The failure to recognize Flight 370 in the radar data \u2014 or refusal to do so, to avoid the embarrassment of admitting an unidentified plane had breached air defense \u2014 meant the Malaysian authorities continued to search in the seas to the east instead of the west of the peninsula. Military radar last recorded the signal at 2:22 a.m. about 200 nautical miles northwest of Butterworth, according to an image of the radar track.The authorities also failed to move quickly on data that showed the plane continuing to fly nearly seven more hours: a series of regular handshake signals from the plane to a satellite seeking to determine if the aircraft was still in range.Chris McLaughlin, a vice president at Inmarsat, the satellite communications firm, said technicians pulled the logs of all transmissions from the plane within four hours of its disappearance. Then, after a day without sign of the plane, they began scouring the company\u2019s databases for any trace of Flight 370.\u201cWe decided to go have another look at our network to see if there was any data that we had missed,\u201d Mr. McLaughlin said. It turned out there was. Inmarsat technicians identified what appeared to be a series of fleeting \u201cpings\u201d between Flight 370, a satellite over the Indian Ocean and a ground station in Perth, Australia.The signals \u2014 seven of them transmitted at one-hour intervals \u2014 were an important clue, because they could have come only from an antenna receiving power from the plane itself. But while they carried a unique code identifying the aircraft as Flight 370, the signals contained no positioning or other data that could indicate where the plane was when it sent them.By Sunday afternoon, a team of Inmarsat engineers set to work using the principles of trigonometry to determine the distance between the satellite and the plane at the time of each ping, and then to calculate two rough flight paths. The plane, they concluded, had turned again. But it may have then traveled in more or less a straight line, heading north over countries likely to have picked it up on radar, or south toward the Indian Ocean and Antarctica. The Malaysian government said it received Inmarsat\u2019s data on March 12 and spent three days analyzing and vetting it with investigators from the United States before redirecting the search on March 15.By then, more than a week had passed since the last satellite ping, recorded at 8:11 a.m. on March 8. It appears to have come from over the southern Indian Ocean, halfway around the world from where the plane should have been, on a tarmac in Beijing.

{"Headline": "Euro Zone Economy Expanded Further in March, With Unexpected Gains in France ", "Date": "2014-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The economy of the euro zone continues to expand, with a surprisingly strong improvement in France and signs of recovery in the region\u2019s depressed labor market, according to a private sector survey released on Monday.The euro zone is enjoying \u201cits strongest spell of growth since the first half of 2011,\u201d said Markit Economics, the data analysis company that conducts the monthly survey.Markit\u2019s composite index of economic activity, based on a survey of purchasing managers, showed a reading of 53.2 for March, down slightly from 53.3 in February. The number from last month was the highest in 32 months, but the early number for this month is still firmly in expansionary territory.A reading of 50 or higher signals growth, while a level below 50 suggests contraction. Subindexes measuring services and manufacturing activity also showed continuing growth.The survey indicated that employment in the euro zone rose in March, \u201calbeit only marginally,\u201d Chris Williamson, an economist with Markit in London, said in the report.\u201cThe stabilization of the job market contrasts markedly with the steep rate of job losses this time last year, highlighting the extent to which business confidence has been revived,\u201d he wrote.Most impressive, Markit said on Monday, was the recent reading from France, where manufacturing output and new orders showed the biggest gains since August 2011, and the job market appeared to be nearing equilibrium. By contrast, an index of German activity slipped to a four-month low, though it remained in expansion.The report, one of the most closely watched indicators of economic conditions in the 18-nation euro currency bloc, provides reassurance as the situation in Ukraine has heightened geopolitical uncertainty on the European Union\u2019s eastern border, and as signs of a slowdown continue to emerge in China.The Chinese manufacturing index sank to 48.1 from 48.5 in February, the longest declining streak since the 2008 economic crisis. It puts growth in the country on track for its slowest pace since the second quarter of 2009, economists at BNP Paribas said.Markit said the European numbers indicated economic growth of 0.5 percent in the first three months of this year from the last quarter of 2013.But James Howat, an economist with Capital Economics in London, argued that the data suggested that first-quarter growth in the euro zone would come in at a quarterly pace of only 0.3 to 0.4 percent.That, Mr. Howat said, represented \u201ca disappointingly small improvement\u201d from the 0.3 percent quarterly growth in the last three months of 2013.

{"Headline": "The Wolf Hunters of Wall Street", "Date": "2014-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBefore the collapse of the U.S. financial system in 2008, Brad Katsuyama could tell himself that he bore no responsibility for that system. He worked for the Royal Bank of Canada, for a start. RBC might have been the fifth-biggest bank in North America, by some measures, but it was on nobody\u2019s mental map of Wall Street. It was stable and relatively virtuous and soon to be known for having resisted the temptation to make bad subprime loans to Americans or peddle them to ignorant investors. But its management didn\u2019t understand just what an afterthought the bank was \u2014 on the rare occasions American financiers thought about it at all. Katsuyama\u2019s bosses sent him to New York from Toronto in 2002, when he was 23, as part of a \u201cbig push\u201d for the bank to become a player on Wall Street. The sad truth was that hardly anyone noticed it. \u201cThe people in Canada are always saying, \u2018We\u2019re paying too much for people in the United States,\u2019 \u201d Katsuyama says. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t realize is that the reason you have to pay them too much is that no one wants to work for RBC. RBC is a nobody.\u201dBefore arriving there as part of the big push, Katsuyama had never laid eyes on Wall Street or New York City. It was his first immersive course in the American way of life, and he was instantly struck by how different it was from the Canadian version. \u201cEverything was to excess,\u201d he says. \u201cI met more offensive people in a year than I had in my entire life. People lived beyond their means, and the way they did it was by going into debt. That\u2019s what shocked me the most. Debt was a foreign concept in Canada. Debt was evil.\u201dFor his first few years on Wall Street, Katsuyama traded U.S. energy stocks and then tech stocks. Eventually he was promoted to run one of RBC\u2019s equity-trading groups, consisting of 20 or so traders. The RBC trading floor had a no-jerk rule (though the staff had a more colorful term for it): If someone came in the door looking for a job and sounding like a typical Wall Street jerk, he wouldn\u2019t be hired, no matter how much money he said he could make the firm. There was even an expression used to describe the culture: \u201cRBC nice.\u201d Although Katsuyama found the expression embarrassingly Canadian, he, too, was RBC nice. The best way to manage people, he thought, was to persuade them that you were good for their careers. He further believed that the only way to get people to believe that you were good for their careers was actually to be good for their careers.His troubles began at the end of 2006, after RBC paid $100 million for a U.S. electronic-trading firm called Carlin Financial. In what appeared to Katsuyama to be undue haste, his bosses back in Canada bought Carlin without knowing much about the company or even electronic trading. Now they would receive a crash course. Katsuyama found himself working side by side with a group of American traders who could not have been less suited to RBC\u2019s culture. The first day after the merger, Katsuyama got a call from a worried female employee, who whispered, \u201cThere is a guy in here with suspenders walking around with a baseball bat in his hands.\u201d That turned out to be Carlin\u2019s chief executive, Jeremy Frommer, who was, whatever else he was, not RBC nice. Returning to his alma mater, the University at Albany, years later to speak about the secret of his success, Frommer told a group of business students: \u201cIt\u2019s not just enough to fly in first class; I have to know my friends are flying in coach.\u201dInstalled in Carlin\u2019s offices, RBC\u2019s people in New York were soon gathered to hear a state-of-the-financial-markets address given by Frommer. He stood in front of a flat-panel computer monitor that hung on his wall. \u201cHe gets up and says the markets are now all about speed,\u201d Katsuyama says. \u201cAnd then he says, \u2018I\u2019m going to show you how fast our system is.\u2019 He had this guy next to him with a computer keyboard. He said to him, \u2018Enter an order!\u2019 And the guy hit Enter. And the order appeared on the screen so everyone could see it. And Frommer goes: \u2018See! See how fast that was!!!\u2019 \u201d All the guy did was type the name of a stock on a keyboard, and the name was displayed on the screen, the way a letter, once typed, appears on a computer screen. \u201cThen he goes, \u2018Do it again!\u2019 And the guy hits the Enter button on the keyboard again. And everyone nods. It was 5 in the afternoon. The market wasn\u2019t open; nothing was happening. But he was like, \u2018Oh, my God, it\u2019s happening in real time!\u2019 \u201dKatsuyama couldn\u2019t believe it. He thought: The guy who just sold us our new electronic-trading platform either does not know that his display of technical virtuosity is absurd or, worse, he thinks we don\u2019t know.This made it impossible for Katsuyama to do his job properly. His main role as a trader was to play the middleman between investors who wanted to buy and sell big amounts of stock and the public markets, where the volumes were smaller. Say some investor wanted to sell a block of three million Intel shares, but the markets showed demand for only one million shares: Katsuyama would buy the entire block from the investor, sell off a million shares instantly and then work artfully over the next few hours to unload the other two million. If he didn\u2019t know the actual demand in the markets, he couldn\u2019t price the larger block. He had been supplying liquidity to the market; now whatever was happening on his screens was reducing his willingness to do that.By June 2007 the problem had grown too big to ignore. At that point, he did what most people do when they don\u2019t understand why their computers aren\u2019t working the way they\u2019re supposed to: He called tech support. Like tech-support personnel everywhere, their first assumption was that Katsuyama didn\u2019t know what he was doing. \" \u2018User error\u2019 was the thing they\u2019d throw at you,\u201d he says. \u201cThey just thought of us traders as a bunch of dumb jocks.\u201dFinally he complained so loudly that they sent the developers, the guys who came to RBC in the Carlin acquisition. \u201cThey told me it was because I was in New York and the markets were in New Jersey and my market data was slow,\u201d Katsuyama says. \u201cThen they said that it was all caused by the fact that there are thousands of people trading in the market. They\u2019d say: \u2018You aren\u2019t the only one trying to do what you\u2019re trying to do. There\u2019s other events. There\u2019s news.\u2019 \u201dIf that was the case, he asked them, why did the market in any given stock dry up only when he was trying to trade in it? To make his point, he asked the developers to stand behind him and watch while he traded. \u201cI\u2019d say: \u2018Watch closely. I am about to buy 100,000 shares of AMD. I am willing to pay $15 a share. There are currently 100,000 shares of AMD being offered at $15 a share \u2014 10,000 on BATS, 35,000 on the New York Stock Exchange, 30,000 on Nasdaq and 25,000 on Direct Edge.\u2019 You could see it all on the screens. We\u2019d all sit there and stare at the screen, and I\u2019d have my finger over the Enter button. I\u2019d count out loud to five. . . .\u201c \u2018One. . . .\u201c \u2018Two. . . . See, nothing\u2019s happened.\u201c \u2018Three. . . . Offers are still there at 15. . . .\u201c \u2018Four. . . . Still no movement. . . .\u201c \u2018Five.\u2019 Then I\u2019d hit the Enter button, and \u2014 boom! \u2014 all hell would break loose. The offerings would all disappear, and the stock would pop higher.\u201dAt which point he turned to the developers behind him and said: \u201cYou see, I\u2019m the event. I am the news.\u201dTo that, they had no response. Katsuyama suspected the culprit was Carlin\u2019s setup. \u201cAs the market problem got worse,\u201d he says, \u201cI started to just assume my real problem was with how bad their technology was.\u201dBut as he talked to Wall Street investors, he came to realize that they were dealing with the same problem. He had a good friend who traded stocks at a big-time hedge fund in Stamford, Conn., called SAC Capital, which was famous (and soon to be infamous) for being one step ahead of the U.S. stock market. If anyone was going to know something about the market that Katsuyama didn\u2019t know, he figured, it would be someone there. One spring morning, he took the train up to Stamford and spent the day watching his friend trade. Right away he saw that, even though his friend was using software supplied to him by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and the other big firms, he was experiencing exactly the same problem as RBC: He would hit a button to buy or sell a stock, and the market would move away from him. \u201cWhen I see this guy trading, and he was getting screwed \u2014 I now see that it isn\u2019t just me. My frustration is the market\u2019s frustration. And I was like, \u2018Whoa, this is serious.\u2019 \u201dSo Katsuyama was in charge of a business called electronic trading \u2014 with only Carlin\u2019s inferior software to sell. What he had, instead, was a fast-growing pile of unanswered questions. Between the public stock exchanges and the dark pools \u2014 private exchanges created by banks and brokers that did not have to report in real time what trading activities took place within them \u2014 why were there now nearly 60 different places, most of them in New Jersey, where you could buy any listed stock? Why did one public exchange pay you to do something \u2014 sell shares, say \u2014 when another exchange charged you to do the same exact thing? Why was the market displayed on Wall Street trading screens an illusion?He hired Rob Park, a gifted technologist, to explain to him what actually happened inside all these new Wall Street black boxes, and together they set out to assemble a team to investigate the U.S. stock market. Once he had a team in place, Katsuyama persuaded his superiors at RBC to conduct what amounted to a series of experiments. For the next several months, he and his people would trade stocks not to make money but to test theories. RBC agreed to let his team lose up to $10,000 a day to figure out why the market in any given stock vanished the moment RBC tried to trade in it. Katsuyama asked Park to come up with some theories.They started with the public markets \u2014 13 stock exchanges scattered over four different sites run by the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, BATS and Direct Edge. Park\u2019s first theory was that the exchanges weren\u2019t simply bundling all the orders at a given price but arranging them in some kind of sequence. You and I might each submit an order to buy 1,000 shares of Intel at $30 a share, but you might somehow obtain the right to cancel your order if my order was filled. \u201cWe started getting the idea that people were canceling orders,\u201d Park says. \u201cThat they were just phantom orders.\u201dKatsuyama tried sending orders to a single exchange, fairly certain that this would prove that some, or maybe even all, of the exchanges were allowing these phantom orders. But no: To his surprise, an order sent to a single exchange enabled him to buy everything on offer. The market as it appeared on his screens was, once again, the market. \u201cI thought, [expletive], there goes that theory,\u201d Katsuyama says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s our only theory.\u201dIt made no sense: Why would the market on the screens be real if you sent your order to only one exchange but prove illusory when you sent your order to all the exchanges at once? The team began to send orders into various combinations of exchanges. First the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Then N.Y.S.E. and Nasdaq and BATS. Then N.Y.S.E., Nasdaq BX, Nasdaq and BATS. And so on. What came back was a further mystery. As they increased the number of exchanges, the percentage of the order that was filled decreased; the more places they tried to buy stock from, the less stock they were actually able to buy. \u201cThere was one exception,\u201d Katsuyama says. \u201cNo matter how many exchanges we sent an order to, we always got 100 percent of what was offered on BATS.\u201d Park had no explanation, he says. \u201cI just thought, BATS is a great exchange!\u201dThe increments of time involved were absurdly small: In theory, the fastest travel time, from Katsuyama\u2019s desk in Manhattan to the BATS exchange in Weehawken, N.J., was about two milliseconds, and the slowest, from Katsuyama\u2019s desk to the Nasdaq exchange in Carteret, N.J., was around four milliseconds. In practice, the times could vary much more than that, depending on network traffic, static and glitches in the equipment between any two points. It takes 100 milliseconds to blink quickly \u2014 it was hard to believe that a fraction of a blink of an eye could have any real market consequences. Allen Zhang, whom Katsuyama and Park viewed as their most talented programmer, wrote a program that built delays into the orders Katsuyama sent to exchanges that were faster to get to, so that they arrived at exactly the same time as they did at the exchanges that were slower to get to. \u201cIt was counterintuitive,\u201d Park says, \u201cbecause everyone was telling us it was all about faster. We had to go faster, and we were slowing it down.\u201d One morning they sat down to test the program. Ordinarily when you hit the button to buy but failed to get the stock, the screens lit up red; when you got only some of the stock you were after, the screens lit up brown; and when you got everything you asked for, the screens lit up green.The screens lit up green.\u201cIt\u2019s 2009,\u201d Katsuyama says. \u201cThis had been happening to me for almost two years. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m the first guy to have figured this out. So what happened to everyone else?\u201d The question seemed to answer itself: Anyone who understood the problem was making money off it.Now he and RBC had a tool to sell to investors: The program Zhang wrote to build delays into the stock-exchange orders. The tool enabled traders like Katsuyama to do the job they were meant to do \u2014 take risk on behalf of the big investors who wanted to trade big chunks of stock. They could once again trust the market on their screens. The tool needed a name. The team stewed over this, until one day a trader stood up at his desk and hollered: \u201cDude, you should just call it Thor! The hammer!\u201d Someone was assigned to figure out what Thor might be an acronym for, and some words were assembled, but no one remembered them. The tool was always just Thor. \u201cI knew we were onto something when Thor became a verb,\u201d Katsuyama says. \u201cWhen I heard guys shouting, \u2018Thor it!\u2019 \u201dThe other way he knew they were on to something was from conversations he had with a few of the world\u2019s biggest money managers. The first visit Katsuyama and Park made was to Mike Gitlin, who oversaw global trading for billions of dollars in assets for the money-management firm T. Rowe Price. The story they told didn\u2019t come to Gitlin as a complete shock. \u201cYou could see that something had just changed,\u201d Gitlin says. \u201cYou could see that when you were trading a stock, the market knew what you were going to do, and it was going to move against you.\u201d But what Katsuyama described was a far more detailed picture of the market than Gitlin had ever considered \u2014 and in that market, all the incentives were screwy. The Wall Street brokerage firm that was deciding where to send T. Rowe Price\u2019s buy and sell orders had a great deal of power over how and where those orders were submitted. Some exchanges paid brokerages for their orders; others charged for those orders. Did that influence where the broker decided to send an order, even when it didn\u2019t sync with the interests of the investors the broker was supposed to represent? No one could say. Another wacky incentive was \u201cpayment for order flow.\u201d As of 2010, every American brokerage and all the online brokers effectively auctioned their customers\u2019 stock-market orders. The online broker TD Ameritrade, for example, was paid hundreds of millions of dollars each year to send its orders to a hedge fund called Citadel, which executed the orders on behalf of TD Ameritrade. Why was Citadel willing to pay so much to see the flow? No one could say with certainty what Citadel\u2019s advantage was.Katsuyama and his team did measure how much more cheaply they bought stock when they removed the ability of some other unknown trader to front-run them. For instance, they bought 10 million shares of Citigroup, then trading at roughly $4 per share, and saved $29,000 \u2014 or less than 0.1 percent of the total price. \u201cThat was the invisible tax,\u201d Park says. It sounded small until you realized that the average daily volume in the U.S. stock market was $225 billion. The same tax rate applied to that sum came to nearly $160 million a day. \u201cIt was so insidious because you couldn\u2019t see it,\u201d Katsuyama says. \u201cIt happens on such a granular level that even if you tried to line it up and figure it out, you wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. People are getting screwed because they can\u2019t imagine a microsecond.\u201dBorn and raised in Dublin, he moved to America in 1990, when he was 16. Six years later, his father was recalled to Ireland; Ronan stayed behind. He didn\u2019t think of Ireland as a place anyone would ever go back to if given the choice, and he embraced his version of the American dream. After graduating from Fairfield University in 1996, he sent letters to all the Wall Street banks, but he received just one flicker of interest from what, even to his untrained eyes, was a vaguely criminal, pump-and-dump penny-stock brokerage firm.Eventually he met another Irish guy who worked in the New York office of MCI Communications, the big telecom company. \u201cHe gave me a job strictly because I was Irish,\u201d Ryan says.He had always been handy, but he never actually studied anything practical. He knew next to nothing about technology. Now he started to learn all about it. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty captivating, when you take the nerdiness out of it\u201d and figure out how stuff works, he says. How a copper circuit conveyed information, compared with a glass fiber. How a switch made by Cisco compared with a switch made by Juniper. Which hardware companies made the fastest computer equipment and which buildings in which cities contained floors that could withstand the weight of that equipment (old manufacturing buildings were best). He also learned how information actually traveled from one place to another \u2014 not in a straight line run by a single telecom carrier, usually, but in a convoluted path run by several. \u201cWhen you make a call to New York from Florida, you have no idea how many pieces of equipment you have to go through for that call to happen. You probably just think it\u2019s like two cans and a piece of string. But it\u2019s not.\u201d A circuit that connected New York City to Florida would have Verizon on the New York end, AT&T on the Florida end and MCI in the middle; it would zigzag from population center to population center.Ryan hadn\u2019t been able to find a job on Wall Street, but by 2005 his clients were more likely than ever to be big Wall Street banks. He spent entire weeks inside Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers and Deutsche Bank, finding the best routes for their fiber and the best machines to execute their stock-market trades.In 2005, he went to work for BT Radianz, a company that was born of 9/11, after the attacks on the World Trade Center knocked out big pieces of Wall Street\u2019s communication system. The company promised to build a system less vulnerable to outside attack. Ryan\u2019s job was to sell the financial world on the idea of subcontracting its information networks to Radianz. In particular, he was meant to sell the banks on \u201cco-locating\u201d their computers in Radianz\u2019s data center in Nutley, N.J., to be closer, physically, to where the stock exchanges were located.Not long after he started his job at Radianz, Ryan received an inquiry from a hedge fund based in Kansas City, Kan. The caller said he worked at a stock-market trading firm called Bountiful Trust and that he heard Ryan was an expert at moving financial data from one place to another. Bountiful Trust had a problem: In making trades between Kansas City and New York, it took too long to determine what happened to the firm\u2019s orders \u2014 that is, what stocks had been bought and sold. They also noticed that, increasingly, when they placed their orders, the market was vanishing on them. \u201cHe says, \u2018My latency time is 43 milliseconds,\u2019 \u201d Ryan recalls. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018What the hell is a millisecond?\u2019 \u201d\u201cLatency\u201d was simply the time between the moment a signal was sent and when it was received. Several factors determined the latency of a trading system: the boxes, the logic and the lines. The boxes were the machinery the signals passed through on their way from Point A to Point B: the computer servers and signal amplifiers and switches. The logic was the software, the code instructions that operated the boxes. Ryan didn\u2019t know much about software, except that more and more it seemed to be written by guys with thick Russian accents. The lines were the glass fiber-optic cables that carried the information from one box to another. The single-biggest determinant of speed was the length of the fiber, or the distance the signal needed to travel. Ryan didn\u2019t know what a millisecond was, but he understood the problem with this Kansas City hedge fund: It was in Kansas City. Light in a vacuum travels at 186,000 miles per second or, put another way, 186 miles a millisecond. Light inside fiber bounces off the walls and travels at only about two-thirds of its theoretical speed. \u201cPhysics is physics \u2014 this is what the traders didn\u2019t understand,\u201d Ryan says.By the end of 2007, Ryan was making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year building systems to make stock-market trades faster. He was struck, over and over again, by how little those he helped understood the technology they were using. Beyond that, he didn\u2019t even really know much about his clients. The big banks \u2014 Goldman Sachs, Citigroup \u2014 everyone had heard of. Others \u2014 Citadel, Getco \u2014 were famous on a small scale. He learned that some of these firms were hedge funds, which meant they took money from outside investors. But most of them were proprietary firms, or prop shops, trading only their own founders\u2019 money. A huge number of the outfits he dealt with \u2014 Hudson River Trading, Eagle Seven, Simplex Investments, Evolution Financial Technologies, Cooperfund, DRW \u2014 no one had ever heard of, and the firms obviously intended to keep it that way. The prop shops were especially strange, because they were both transient and prosperous. \u201cThey\u2019d be just five guys in a room. All of them geeks. The leader of each five-man pack is just an arrogant version of that geek.\u201d One day a prop shop was trading; the next, it closed, and all the people in it moved on to work for some big Wall Street bank. One group of guys Ryan saw over and over: four Russian, one Chinese. The arrogant Russian guy, clearly the leader, was named Vladimir, and he and his boys bounced from prop shop to big bank and back to prop shop, writing the computer code that made the actual stock-market trading decisions, which made high-frequency trading possible. Ryan watched them meet with one of the most senior guys at a big Wall Street bank that hoped to employ them \u2014 and the Wall Street big shot sucked up to them. \u201cHe walks into the meeting and says, \u2018I\u2019m always the most important man in the room, but in this case, Vladimir is.\u2019 \u201dIn the fall of 2009, Katsuyama\u2019s friend at Deutsche Bank mentioned this Irish guy who seemed to be the world\u2019s expert at helping the world\u2019s fastest stock-market traders be faster. Katsuyama called Ronan Ryan and invited him to interview for a job on the RBC trading floor. In his interview, Ryan described what he witnessed inside the exchanges: The frantic competition for nanoseconds, clients\u2019 trying to get their machines closer to the servers within the exchanges, the tens of millions being spent by high-frequency traders for tiny increments of speed. The U.S. stock market was now a class system of haves and have-nots, only what was had was not money but speed (which led to money). The haves paid for nanoseconds; the have-nots had no idea that a nanosecond had value. The haves enjoyed a perfect view of the market; the have-nots never saw the market at all. \u201cI learned more from talking to him in an hour than I learned from six months of reading about [high-frequency trading],\u201d Katsuyama says. \u201cThe second I met him, I wanted to hire him.\u201dHe wanted to hire him without being able to fully explain, to his bosses or even to Ryan, what he wanted to hire him for. He couldn\u2019t very well call him vice president in charge of explaining to my clueless superiors why high-frequency trading is a travesty. So he called him a high-frequency-trading strategist. And Ryan finally landed his job on a Wall Street trading floor.Katsuyama and his team were having trouble turning Thor into a product RBC could sell to investors. They had no control over the path the signals took to get to the exchanges or how much traffic was on the network. Sometimes it took four milliseconds for their orders to arrive at the New York Stock Exchange; other times, it took seven milliseconds. In short, Thor was inconsistent \u2014 because, Ryan explained, the paths the electronic signals took from Katsuyama\u2019s desk to the various exchanges were inconsistent. The signal sent from Katsuyama\u2019s desk arrived at the New Jersey exchanges at different times because some exchanges were farther from Katsuyama\u2019s desk than others. The fastest any high-speed trader\u2019s signal could travel from the first exchange it reached to the last one was 465 microseconds, or one two-hundredth of the time it takes to blink. (A microsecond is a millionth of a second.) That is, for Katsuyama\u2019s trading orders to interact with the market as displayed on his trading screens, they needed to arrive at all the exchanges within a 465-microsecond window.To make his point, Ryan brought in oversize maps of New Jersey showing the fiber-optic networks built by telecom companies. The maps told a story: Any trading signal that originated in Lower Manhattan traveled up the West Side Highway and out the Lincoln Tunnel. Perched immediately outside the tunnel, in Weehawken, N.J., was the BATS exchange. From BATS the routes became more complicated, as they had to find their way through the clutter of the Jersey suburbs. \u201cNew Jersey is now carved up like a Thanksgiving turkey,\u201d Ryan says. One way or another, they traveled west to Secaucus, the location of the Direct Edge family of exchanges owned in part by Goldman Sachs and Citadel, and south to the Nasdaq family of exchanges in Carteret. The New York Stock Exchange, less than a mile from Katsuyama\u2019s desk, appeared to be the stock market closest to him \u2014 but Ryan\u2019s maps showed the incredible indirection of fiber-optic cable in Manhattan. \u201cTo get from Liberty Plaza to 55 Water Street, you might go through Brooklyn,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou can go 50 miles to get from Midtown to Downtown. To get from a building to a building across the street, you could travel 15 miles.\u201dTo Katsuyama the maps explained, among other things, why the market on BATS had proved so accurate. The reason they were always able to buy or sell 100 percent of the shares listed on BATS was that BATS was always the first stock market to receive their orders. News of their buying and selling hadn\u2019t had time to spread throughout the marketplace. Inside BATS, high-frequency-trading firms were waiting for news that they could use to trade on the other exchanges. BATS, unsurprisingly, had been created by high-frequency traders.Katsuyama and Ryan between them met with roughly 500 professional stock-market investors who controlled many trillions of dollars in assets. Most of them had the same reaction: They knew something was very wrong, but they didn\u2019t know what, and now that they knew, they were outraged. Vincent Daniel, a partner at Seawolf, took a long look at this unlikely pair \u2014 an Asian-Canadian guy from a bank no one cared about and an Irish guy who was doing a fair impression of a Dublin handyman \u2014 who just told him the most incredible true story he had ever heard and said, \u201cYour biggest competitive advantage is that you don\u2019t want to [expletive] me.\u201dThe deep problem with the system was a kind of moral inertia. So long as it served the narrow self-interests of everyone inside it, no one on the inside would ever seek to change it, no matter how corrupt or sinister it became \u2014 though even to use words like \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201csinister\u201d made serious people uncomfortable, so Katsuyama avoided them. Maybe his biggest concern, when he spoke to investors, was that he\u2019d be seen as just another nut with a conspiracy theory. One compliment that made him happiest was when a big investor said, \u201cThank God, finally there\u2019s someone who knows something about high-frequency trading who isn\u2019t an Area 51 guy.\u201d It took him a while to figure out that fate and circumstance had created for him a dramatic role, which he was obliged to play. One night he turned to his wife, Ashley, and said: \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m an expert in something that badly needs to be changed. I think there\u2019s only a few people in the world who can do anything about this. If I don\u2019t do something right now \u2014 me, Brad Katsuyama \u2014 there\u2019s no one to call.\u201d\u201cIt was stupid,\u201d Katsuyama says, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t even a category to put us into. I think we ended up applying under Other.\u201dWith the purposelessness of the exercise hanging in the air, Park said, \u201cI just had a sick idea.\u201d His idea was to license the technology to one of the exchanges. The line between Wall Street brokers and exchanges had blurred. For a few years, the big Wall Street banks had been running their own private exchanges. The stock exchanges, for their part, were making a bid (that ultimately failed) to become brokers. The bigger ones now offered a service that enabled brokers to simply hand them their stock-market orders, which they would then route \u2014 to their own exchange, of course, but also to other exchanges. The service was used mainly by small regional brokerage firms that didn\u2019t have their own routers, but this brokeragelike service opened up, at least in Park\u2019s mind, a new possibility. If just one exchange was handed the tool for protecting investors from market predators, the small brokers from around the country might flock to it, and it might become the mother of all exchanges.Forget that, Katsuyama said. \u201cLet\u2019s just create our own stock exchange.\u201d\u201cWe just sat there for a while,\u201d Park says, \u201ckind of staring at each other. Create your own stock exchange. What does that even mean?\u201dA few weeks later Katsuyama flew to Canada and tried to sell his bosses on the idea of an RBC-led stock exchange. Then in the fall of 2011, he canvassed a handful of the world\u2019s biggest money managers (Capital Group, T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Wellington, Southeastern Asset Management) and some of the most influential hedge funds (run by David Einhorn, Bill Ackman, Daniel Loeb). They all had the same reaction. They loved the idea of a stock exchange that protected investors from Wall Street\u2019s predators. They also thought that for a new stock exchange to be credibly independent of Wall Street, it could not be created by a Wall Street bank. Not even a bank as nice as RBC. If Katsuyama wanted to create the mother of all stock exchanges, he would need to quit his job and do it on his own.The challenges were obvious. He would need to find money. He would need to persuade a lot of highly paid people to quit their Wall Street jobs to work for tiny fractions of their current salaries \u2014 and possibly even supply the capital to pay themselves to work. \u201cI was asking: Can I get the people I need? How long can we survive without getting paid? Will our significant others let us do this?\u201d They did, and Katsuyama\u2019s team followed him to his new venture.But he also needed to find out if the nine big Wall Street banks that controlled nearly 70 percent of all investor orders would be willing to send those orders to a truly safe exchange. It would be far more difficult to start an exchange premised on fairness if the banks that controlled a vast majority of the customers\u2019 orders were not committed to fairness themselves.Puz\u2019s peculiar ability to solve puzzles was suddenly even more relevant. Creating a new stock exchange is a bit like creating a casino: Its creator needs to ensure that the casino cannot in some way be exploited by the patrons. Or at worst, he needs to know exactly how his system might be gamed, so that he might monitor the exploitation \u2014 as a casino follows card counters at the blackjack tables. \u201cYou are designing a system,\u201d Puz says, \u201cand you don\u2019t want the system to be gameable.\u201d The trouble with the stock market \u2014 with all of the public and private exchanges \u2014 was that they were fantastically gameable, and had been gamed: first by clever guys in small shops, and then by prop traders who moved inside the big Wall Street banks. That was the problem, Puz thought. From the point of view of the most sophisticated traders, the stock market wasn\u2019t a mechanism for channeling capital to productive enterprise but a puzzle to be solved. \u201cInvesting shouldn\u2019t be about gaming a system,\u201d he says. \u201cIt should be about something else.\u201dThe simplest way to design a stock exchange that could not be gamed was to hire the very people best able to game it and encourage them to take their best shots. Katsuyama didn\u2019t know any other national puzzle champions, but Puz did. The only problem was that none of them had ever worked inside a stock exchange. \u201cThe Puzzle Masters needed a guide,\u201d Katsuyama says.Enter Constantine Sokoloff, who had helped build Nasdaq\u2019s matching engine \u2014 the computer that matched buyers and sellers. Sokoloff was Russian, born and raised in a city on the Volga River. He had an explanation for why so many of his countrymen wound up in high-frequency trading. The old Soviet educational system channeled people into math and science. And the Soviet-controlled economy was horrible and complicated but riddled with loopholes, an environment that left those who mastered it well prepared for Wall Street in the early 21st century. \u201cWe had this system for 70 years,\u201d Sokoloff says. \u201cThe more you cultivate a class of people who know how to work around the system, the more people you will have who know how to do it well.\u201dThe Puzzle Masters might not have thought of it this way at first, but in trying to design their exchange so that investors who came to it would remain safe from predatory traders, they were also divining the ways in which high-frequency traders stalked their prey. For example, these traders had helped the public stock exchanges create all sorts of complicated \u201corder types.\u201d The New York Stock Exchange, for one, had created an order type that traded only if the order on the other side of it was smaller than itself \u2014 the purpose of which seemed to be to protect high-frequency traders from buying a small number of shares from an investor who was about to depress the market in these shares with a huge sale.As they worked through the order types, the Puzzle Masters created a taxonomy of predatory behavior in the stock market. Broadly speaking, it appeared as if there were three activities that led to a vast amount of grotesquely unfair trading. The first they called electronic front-running \u2014 seeing an investor trying to do something in one place and racing ahead of him to the next (what had happened to Katsuyama when he traded at RBC). The second they called rebate arbitrage \u2014 using the new complexity to game the seizing of whatever legal kickbacks, called rebates within the industry, the exchange offered without actually providing the liquidity that the rebate was presumably meant to entice. The third, and probably by far the most widespread, they called slow-market arbitrage. This occurred when a high-frequency trader was able to see the price of a stock change on one exchange and pick off orders sitting on other exchanges before those exchanges were able to react. This happened all day, every day, and very likely generated more billions of dollars a year than the other strategies combined.To create the 350-microsecond delay, they needed to keep the new exchange roughly 38 miles from the place the brokers were allowed to connect to the exchange. That was a problem. Having cut one very good deal to put the exchange in Weehawken, they were offered another: to establish the point of presence in a data center in Secaucus. The two data centers were less than 10 miles apart and already populated by other stock exchanges and all the high-frequency stock-market traders. (\u201cWe\u2019re going into the lion\u2019s den,\u201d Ryan said.) A bright idea came from a new employee, James Cape, who had just joined them from a high-frequency-trading firm: Coil the fiber. Instead of running straight fiber between the two places, why not coil 38 miles of fiber and stick it in a compartment the size of a shoe box to simulate the effects of the distance. And that\u2019s what they did.Creating fairness was remarkably simple. They would not sell to any one trader or investor the right to put his computers next to the exchange or special access to data from the exchange. They would pay no rebates to brokers or banks that sent orders; instead, they would charge both sides of any trade the same amount: nine one-hundredths of a cent per share (known as nine mils). They\u2019d allow just three order types: market, limit and Mid-Point Peg, which meant that the investor\u2019s order rested in between the current bid and offer of any stock. If the shares of Procter & Gamble were quoted in the wider market at 80\u201380.02 (you can buy at $80.02 or sell at $80), a Mid-Point Peg order would trade only at $80.01. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the fair price,\u201d Katsuyama says.Finally, to ensure that their own incentives remained as closely aligned as they could be with those of investors, the new exchange did not allow anyone who could trade directly on it to own any piece of it: Its owners were all ordinary investors who needed first to hand their orders to brokers.But the big Wall Street banks that controlled a majority of all stock-market investor orders played a more complicated role than an online broker like TD Ameritrade. The Wall Street banks controlled not only the orders, and the informational value of those orders, but also dark pools in which those orders might be executed. The banks took different approaches to milking the value of their customers\u2019 orders. All of them tended to send the orders first to their own dark pools before routing them out to the wider market. Inside the dark pool, the bank could trade against the orders itself; or it could sell special access to the dark pool to high-frequency traders. Either way, the value of the customers\u2019 orders was monetized \u2014 by the big Wall Street bank for the big Wall Street bank. If the bank was unable to execute an order in its own dark pool, the bank could direct that order first to the exchange that paid the biggest rebate for it.If the Puzzle Masters were right, and the design of their new exchange eliminated the advantage of speed, it would reduce the informational value of investors\u2019 stock-market orders to zero. If those orders couldn\u2019t be exploited on this new exchange \u2014 if the information they contained about investors\u2019 trading intentions was worthless \u2014 who would pay for the right to execute them? The big Wall Street banks and online brokers that routed investors\u2019 stock market orders to the new exchange would surrender billions of dollars in revenues in the process. And that, as everyone involved understood, wouldn\u2019t happen without a fight.On the first day, IEX traded 568,524 shares. Most of the volume came from regional brokerage firms and Wall Street brokers that had no dark pools \u2014 RBC and Sanford C. Bernstein. The first week, IEX traded a bit over 12 million shares. Each week after that, the volume grew slightly, until, in the third week of December, IEX was trading roughly 50 million shares each week. On Wednesday, Dec. 18, it traded 11,827,232 shares. But IEX still wasn\u2019t attracting many orders from the big banks. Goldman Sachs, for example, had connected to the exchange, but its orders were arriving in tiny lot sizes, resting for just a few seconds, then leaving.The first different-looking stock-market order sent by Goldman to IEX landed on Dec. 19, 2013, at 3:09.42 p.m. 662 milliseconds 361 microseconds 406 nanoseconds. Anyone who was in IEX\u2019s one-room office when it arrived would have known that something unusual was happening. The computer screens jitterbugged as the information flowed into the market in an entirely new way \u2014 lingering there long enough to trade. One by one, the employees arose from their chairs. Then they began to shout.\u201cWe\u2019re at 15 million!\u201d someone yelled, 10 minutes into the surge. In the previous 331 minutes they had traded roughly 14 million shares.\u201cTwenty million!\u201d\u201cThirty million!\u201d\u201cWe just passed AMEX,\u201d shouted John Schwall, their chief financial officer, referring to the American Stock Exchange. \u201cWe\u2019re ahead of AMEX in market share.\u201d\u201cAnd we gave them a 120-year head start,\u201d Ryan said, playing a little loose with history. Someone had given him a $300 bottle of Champagne. He\u2019d told Schwall that it was worth only $100, because Schwall didn\u2019t want anyone inside IEX accepting gifts worth more than that from outsiders. Now Ryan fished the contraband from under his desk and found some paper cups.Someone put down a phone and said, \u201cThat was J. P. Morgan, asking, \u2018What just happened?\u2019 They say they may have to do something.\u201dSomeone else put down a phone. \u201cThat was Goldman. They say they aren\u2019t even big. They\u2019re coming big tomorrow.\u201dJ. P. Morgan, in other words, might actually route investors\u2019 trades to IEX, and Goldman might route more of them than they had done so far.\u201cForty million!\u201dFifty-one minutes after Goldman Sachs gave them their first honest shot at Wall Street customers\u2019 stock-market orders, the U.S. stock market closed. Katsuyama walked off the floor and into a small office, enclosed by glass. He thought through what had just happened. \u201cWe needed one person to buy in and say, \u2018You\u2019re right,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt means that Goldman Sachs agrees with us. Now the others can\u2019t ignore this. They can\u2019t marginalize it.\u201d Then he blinked and said, \u201cI could [expletive] cry now.\u201dHe\u2019d just been given a glimpse of the future \u2014 he felt certain of it. If Goldman Sachs was willing to acknowledge to investors that this new market was the best chance for fairness and stability, the other banks would be pressured to follow. The more orders that flowed onto IEX, the better the experience for investors and the harder it would be for the banks to evade this new, fairer market.IEX had made its point: That to function properly, a financial market didn\u2019t need to be rigged in someone\u2019s favor. It didn\u2019t need payment for order flow and co-location and all sorts of unfair advantages possessed by a small handful of traders. All it needed was for investors to take responsibility for understanding it, and then to seize its controls. \u201cThe backbone of the market,\u201d Katsuyama says, \u201cis investors coming together to trade.\u201dWhat he had discovered was just how badly the market wanted to remain in the shadows. Despite Goldman\u2019s activity, many of the big banks were not following the instructions from investors, their customers, to send orders to IEX. A few of the investors in the room knew this; the rest now learned as much. One of them said: \u201cWhen we told them we wanted to route to IEX, they said: \u2018Why would you want that? We can\u2019t do that!\u2019 \u201d After the first six weeks of IEX\u2019s life, a big Wall Street bank inadvertently disclosed to one big investor that it hadn\u2019t routed a single order to IEX \u2014 despite explicit directions from the investor to do so. Another big mutual fund manager estimated that when he told the big banks to route to IEX, they had done so \u201cat most 10 percent of the time.\u201d A fourth investor was told by three different banks that they didn\u2019t want to connect to IEX because they didn\u2019t want to pay their vendors the $300-a-month connection fee.Other banks were mostly passive-aggressive, but there were occasions when they became simply aggressive. Katsuyama heard that Credit Suisse employees had spread rumors that IEX wasn\u2019t actually independent but owned by RBC \u2014 and thus just a tool of a big bank. He also heard what the big Wall Street banks were already saying to investors to dissuade them from sending orders to IEX: The 350-microsecond delay IEX had introduced to foil the stock-market predator made IEX too slow.Soon after it opened for trading, IEX published statistics to describe, in a general way, what was happening in its market. Despite the best efforts of Wall Street banks, the average size of IEX\u2019s trades was by far the biggest of any stock exchange, public or private. Trades on IEX were also four times as likely as those elsewhere to trade at the midpoint between the current market bid and offer \u2014 which is to say, the price that most would agree was fair. Despite the reluctance of the big Wall Street banks to send orders to IEX, the new exchange was already making the dark pools and public exchanges look bad, even by their own screwed-up standards.Katsuyama opened the floor for questions.\u201cDo you think of [high-frequency traders] differently than you did before you opened?\u201d someone asked.\u201cI hate them a lot less than before we started,\u201d Katsuyama said. \u201cThis is not their fault. I think most of them have just rationalized that the market is creating the inefficiencies, and they are just capitalizing on them. Really it\u2019s brilliant what they have done within the bounds of the regulation. They are much less of a villain than I thought. The system has let down the investor.\u201d\u201cHow many good brokers are there?\u201d asked an investor.\u201cTen,\u201d Katsuyama said. (IEX had dealings with 94.) The 10 included RBC, Bernstein and a bunch of even smaller outfits that seemed to be acting in the best interests of their investors. \u201cThree are meaningful,\u201d he added: Morgan Stanley, J. P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs.One investor asked, \u201cWhy would any broker behave well?\u201d\u201cThe long-term benefit is that when the [expletive] hits the fan, it will quickly become clear who made good decisions and who made bad decisions,\u201d Katsuyama said. In other words, when some future stock-market crash happened, perhaps a result of the market\u2019s technological complexity, the big Wall Street banks would get the blame.The stock market really was rigged. Katsuyama often wondered how enterprising politicians and plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and state attorneys general would respond to that realization. (This March, the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, announced a new investigation of the stock exchanges and the dark pools, and their relationships with high-frequency traders. Not long after, the president of Goldman Sachs, Gary Cohn, published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, saying that Goldman wanted nothing to do with the bad things happening in the stock market.) The thought of going after those who profited didn\u2019t give Katsuyama all that much pleasure. He just wanted to fix the problem. At some level, he still didn\u2019t understand why some Wall Street banks needed to make his task so difficult.Technology had collided with Wall Street in a peculiar way. It had been used to increase efficiency. But it had also been used to introduce a peculiar sort of market inefficiency. Taking advantage of loopholes in some well-meaning regulation introduced in the mid-2000s, some large amount of what Wall Street had been doing with technology was simply so someone inside the financial markets would know something that the outside world did not. The same system that once gave us subprime-mortgage collateralized debt obligations no investor could possibly truly understand now gave us stock-market trades involving fractions of a penny that occurred at unsafe speeds using order types that no investor could possibly truly understand. That is why Brad Katsuyama\u2019s desire to explain things so that others would understand was so seditious. He attacked the newly automated financial system at its core, where the money was made from its incomprehensibility.This article is adapted from \u2018\u2018Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,\u2019\u2019 by Michael Lewis,\npublished by W.

{"Headline": "New Rules to Reshape Telecom in Mexico", "Date": "2014-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 In a ruling intended to break virtual monopolies in Mexican telecommunications and television broadcasting, a recently created regulator issued tough new conditions for two of the country\u2019s largest companies, the wireless carrier Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil and the media company Televisa. The ruling promises to redraw the landscape of both industries as it takes direct aim at the core businesses of Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa, whose control over telephony here has made him one of the world\u2019s richest men; and Emilio Azc\u00e1rraga, whose television channels play an outsize role in the country\u2019s politics.Televisa and Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil confirmed on Friday that they had been notified of the ruling. Both companies said they were studying the measures. The conditions imposed on Televisa \u201clook very good in my opinion,\u201d said Irene Levy, president of Observatel, a consumer advocacy group. They are aimed at \u201cpromoting effective competition and avoiding the abuses of such a large company.\u201d Mony de Swaan, a former telecommunications regulator, posted to Twitter that it was a \u201cvery hard pill to swallow\u201d for Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, adding that it was a \u201ctap on Televisa\u2019s shoulder.\u201d At the center of the rulings by the regulator, the Federal Telecommunications Institute, known as Ifetel, is the requirement that the companies share their infrastructure, eliminating the central barrier for new firms looking to enter or to grow in the market. The decisions, announced late Thursday, are a critical step in President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s effort to remake parts of the economy where monopolies have stifled productivity. Last year, Mexico\u2019s economy grew only 1.1 percent. Attempts by regulators over the years to rein in Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil and Televisa have been blocked by weak mandates and wavering political support. The companies have succeeded in blocking decisions by tying them up in Mexico\u2019s labyrinthine courts. But last year, congress rewrote the constitution to take on the powerful companies directly. Legislators created Ifetel and gave it sweeping new powers to declare large companies dominant and set conditions on them. To end the legal maneuvering, they set up specialized courts to handle legal challenges. Shares of Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil increased 1.24 percent on Friday, while Televisa shares dropped 2.29 percent. Analysts warned that the strength of Ifetel\u2019s rulings may be diluted in the coming weeks as lawmakers hash out details of the legislation guiding last year\u2019s constitutional overhaul. Congress is already three months behind a deadline to approve the regulations; experts believe heavy lobbying by the companies may be responsible. Mr. Slim, who owns a stake of about 17 percent in The New York Times Company, turned the high margins he earned from Mexico\u2019s fixed-line telephone monopoly, Telmex, into Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, a telecommunications giant with 270 million wireless subscribers across the Americas. But in Mexico, competitors complained that his control over telecommunications infrastructure made it too expensive to compete. Telmex controls 80 percent of the fixed-line business, and Telcel, the mobile carrier, has 70 percent of the wireless market. The lack of serious competition in Mexico has kept prices high, has limited investment and has held back the penetration of new technologies. According to the International Telecommunications Union, only 26 percent of Mexican households had access to the Internet in 2012, compared to more than 45 percent in Brazil. In a 2012 report, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development estimated that Mexico\u2019s \u201cdysfunctional\u201d telecommunications sector cost Mexican consumers $25.8 billion a year between 2005 and 2009. Televisa controls 70 percent of the television audience through two national television networks and two smaller ones. But this weekend Ifetel will publish conditions to auction two new concessions for national networks, and Televisa will be required to share its towers, rights of way and other parts of its physical network. \u201cWithout exaggeration we are looking at a historic decision,\u201d said Ra\u00fal Trejo Delarbre, a media analyst at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, speaking of the new rules and the planned auction.

{"Headline": "Following Up on Bag Check Rules", "Date": "2014-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the RoadTHERE was a lot of response to last week\u2019s column, in which I asked for comment from readers about the move by United Airlines to crack down on oversize carry-on bags by more strictly enforcing size regulations at the check-in areas. I have the space to use only a handful of the responses, alas. But I\u2019ll try to summarize the gist of them.Michael S. Piraino, an elite-status flier on United, said he made an \u201cinformal study\u201d on 10 recent flights of how the rules were applied at check-in areas. \u201cOn all 10 flights, I watched to see who was asked to put their bags into the sizer,\u201d Mr. Piraino said. No men in business suits were, but males dressed casually tended to be singled out, he reported.\u201cMy wife also shared her observations on four flights she was on. She was asked to use the sizer only when she wore a T-shirt,\u201d he said. On that flight, \u201cwomen in business attire weren\u2019t asked to do so, even though my wife was seated in first class with them.\u201dIncidentally, a United spokesman emphasized to me last week that the airline was not enforcing the crackdown at the boarding gates, where an oversize bag that has managed to get through is gate-checked as usual, without charge. The offending bag-toter isn\u2019t required to trudge all the way back through security to the ticketing counters to pay to check a bag.At least, not yet. Under federal rules, airlines can\u2019t discuss future pricing strategies, but some carriers are hoping to develop technology to easily allow for charging for oversize carry-ons directly at the departure gate, without causing delays in the boarding process.\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable,\u201d said Peter D. Kendall, who described himself as someone who plays by the rules. \u201cI generally check my bags whether the $25 fee is waived or not,\u201d he said. (Most airlines waive checked-bag fees for first-class passengers and various levels of elite-status and airline credit card membership.) \u201cI have to cast my vote with the airlines because for far too long passengers have taken advantage of lax and inconsistent guidelines regarding bag size,\u201d he said.The carry-on bag issue is complicated because most flights have been nearly full for years, and different models of planes have varying storage space in overhead bins. Airlines say that most passengers follow the rules on size. So it\u2019s particularly annoying for some passengers when their regulation-size carry-ons still get flagged for gate-checking because the bins are full.Last week, \u201cI was reading your column on United\u2019s bag-size policy after having boarded a completely full United flight,\u201d said Bob Cunico, who said that he saw as many as 20 regulation-size bags that had to be gate-checked. \u201cIn other words, the plane did not have the storage capacity needed to serve the number of passengers,\u201d he said.Tony Williams was among those who mentioned a common annoyance: \u201cPeople who are sitting in Row 20\u201d and put their carry-on bags into the overhead at, say, Row 10, \u201cshould be immediately escorted off the plane,\u201d he suggested.Stephen Fredericks wrote, \u201cI happened to read your piece last week while sitting in my economy-plus seat on a flight boarding in Houston for La Guardia\u201d and watching people lug on oversize bags. But on a later flight from La Guardia, he noted with satisfaction, United agents flagged two young women \u201ctrying to board with enough luggage to fill the trunk of an oversize car.\u201dLinda Frioud observed that airlines might set a better example by enforcing carry-on rules for crew members. On a recent full flight from Philadelphia to Charlotte, N.C., on US Airways, she said, \u201cthere was no room for overhead storage after the eight US Airways employees flying on our flight had stuffed the overhead bins with four or more carry-ons per person. I counted them.\u201dAnd Barbara Quinn is skeptical about the \u201cstrangely misshapen\u201d sizer boxes that are used to measure bags, which some other readers said don\u2019t readily accommodate odd-size bags that are otherwise of reasonable size, like some backpacks.So let\u2019s not forget traveling musicians. A violin, viola or saxophone case does not fit in the standard sizer, for example. \u201cMy son is the violist of an internationally renowned string quarter. He travels about twice a month, all over the world,\u201d said Judy Amory. It would be folly to consign a valuable, fragile instrument like that to the checked-bag system. \u201cMusicians are an obvious category where one-size-fits-all simply cannot work,\u201d she pointed out.And of course, consider flight attendants, referees of the bag wars as they mediate passenger disputes and often physically hoist and pound bags into crammed overhead bins.Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major airline who wrote what I consider one of the most amusing books in the flight attendant memoir genre, \u201cCruising Attitude: Tales of Crash Pads, Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 35,000 Feet\u201d (2012). The bin wars are \u201cmy biggest peeve,\u201d Ms. Poole said:\u201cI\u2019ve had passengers actually take someone\u2019s bag out of a bin to make room for their own bag, leaving the other person\u2019s bag in the middle of the aisle for passengers behind them to step over. It\u2019s out of control.\u201dEmail: jsharkey@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "We Can\u2019t Grow the Gap Away", "Date": "2014-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe shocking level of income inequality in this country has set off alarms that grow louder by the day, but little seems to be underway to reverse the trend.\u201cIn the United States, the share of market income captured by the richest 10 percent surged from around 30 percent in 1980 to 48 percent by 2012, while the share of the richest 1 percent increased from 8 percent to 19 percent. Even more striking is the fourfold increase in the income share of the richest 0.1 percent, from 2.6 percent to 10.4 percent.\u201dAt the same time, the plight of the poor has grown worse and has become stubbornly resistant to improvement. It stands to reason, then, that food insecurity in this country remains alarming high. The United States Department of Agriculture reported in September that 14.5 percent of the country, or 17.6 million American households, \u201chad difficulty at some time during the year providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources\u201d in 2012. This widening gap between the hardscrabble and the high rollers is unseemly and unsustainable.While these moves would help, they are not nearly enough.Addressing this issue is not about ensuring an even redistribution of wealth while disregarding great ideas and hard work. Imbalance is built into a capitalistic economy. But the degree to which that imbalance has grown in this country is not only alarming; it could prove deleterious to our economic health.There are some who suggest that the solution to this inequality problem \u2014 if indeed they concede that it is a problem \u2014 is simply to grow the economy. Furthermore, as the I.M.F. pointed out in its January paper, inequality could, in fact, be an impediment to growth: \u201cThere is growing evidence that high income inequality can be detrimental to achieving macroeconomic stability and growth.\u201dWe can\u2019t grow our way out of this obscenity. It\u2019s a barrier to growth. We must forthrightly address the issue with policy prescriptions. The I.M.F.\u2019s list includes things like means-testing benefit programs, improving access to higher education and health care for the less well off, and \u201cimplementing progressive personal income tax rate structures\u201d while \u201creducing regressive tax exemptions.\u201dSurely we can figure out how to fix this. We just don\u2019t have the political will to do so. Gail Collins is off today. Joe Nocera is on book leave. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Anyone Save French Food?", "Date": "2014-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySuddenly, though, Paris is showing signs of renewed vigor, much of it coming from an unexpected source: Young foreign chefs. The city\u2019s most-sought-after tables now are at places like Spring, whose chef, Daniel Rose, is American, and Bones, whose chef, James Henry, is Australian. These are not restaurants serving foreign dishes; they are restaurants serving French fare that happens to be produced by non-French chefs. At the same time, the most talked-about French chef in Paris these days, Gregory Marchand, did much of his training in New York and London and brings a distinctly Anglo-American sensibility to cooking and hospitality. As a group, these chefs are reviving an artisanal spirit that had largely vanished from French food culture, composing menus based entirely on what\u2019s available in the market on a given day and cultivating relationships with individual vendors. (\u201cI have 16 different suppliers for the four dishes on the menu,\u201d Rose says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy.\u201d)Twenty years ago, the idea of an American or an Australian cooking French food worthy of discerning Parisians would have been dismissed as laughable. But diners in Paris are yearning for the sense of adventurousness and fun that prevails in other international cities. As Simone Tondo, the young Italian chef behind Roseval, puts it: \u201cThey want Paris to be New York.\u201d This openness expresses itself in the embrace of foreign wines (which were rarely found on wine lists in Paris a decade ago), in the long lines for the gourmet hamburgers that the American Kristin Frederick serves from her food truck (another phenomenon that has now reached Paris) and in the acceptance of the idea that an Illinois native like Rose can make French food every bit as authentic, sophisticated and delicious as a chef from Lyon.The stirrings of insurrection began in the late \u201890s, with the advent of the bistronomie movement, during which some of the city\u2019s most talented young French chefs eschewed the quest for Michelin stars in favor of opening no-frills bistros serving upscale fare at modest prices. (For generations of French chefs, it has been an article of faith that the more sumptuous the setting, the more likely a restaurant is to win Michelin\u2019s approbation.) But the food they were serving was, on the whole, pretty conservative \u2014 classic French bistro fare made in a lighter style. Moreover, bistronomie was as much a reaction to economic circumstance \u2014 a weak French economy was a powerful disincentive to open luxury restaurants \u2014 as it was about remaking French cuisine.Today diners are flocking to restaurants acclaimed by publications like Omnivore and Le Fooding, which focus on \u201cyoung\u201d cuisine and are at the forefront of the love of the new that is sweeping Paris. \u201cThe food scene is the strongest cultural movement in France right now,\u201d Luc Dubanchet, Omnivore\u2019s founder, told me recently. \u201cFor this generation, it\u2019s what music was in the \u201860s and \u201870s.\u201d In his view, this is now a watershed moment in French food history. The nouvelle-cuisine movement, which made French cooking lighter and more seasonal in orientation, was the last time French cuisine underwent a major overhaul. But that was primarily a revolt by a new generation of French chefs who, caught up in the revolutionary fervor of the late 1960s, wanted to liberate themselves from Escoffier classicism. What\u2019s different today is that change is being led not from the kitchen but from the dining room. For the first time, Dubanchet says, young restaurantgoers are seizing control of France\u2019s culinary tradition and making it their own.In embracing expat chefs like Henry, these patrons are also signaling that French cuisine no longer belongs exclusively to the French. In 2010, the French food establishment succeeded in getting Unesco to designate what was termed \u201cthe gastronomic meal of the French\u201d as part of the world\u2019s cultural patrimony. The effort to win Unesco recognition generated some criticism in France, both because it was viewed as consecrating the idea that French cuisine had become an artifact, a museum piece, and because it was seen as an expression of French chauvinism. Regardless of the judgment of world bodies, what matters is what\u2019s happening in the kitchens and dining rooms of the most exciting restaurants in Paris. The food there, for the first time in a long time, is very much alive.BONESThe son of an Australian foreign-affairs official, James Henry lived as a child in Canberra, Paris, Riyadh and San Francisco before ultimately settling in Brisbane. He moved to Paris in 2010 and opened Bones to instant praise in January 2013. His menu changes daily and is based on seasonality and relationships with individual purveyors, like the farmer from the Ard\u00e8che who drives to Paris each week to drop off fruits and vegetables at Bones and a few other restaurants. Henry also makes his own charcuterie and churns his own butter. He demurs when asked if Bones serves French cuisine \u2014 \u201cWe use French product, but I don\u2019t know how to describe it\u201d \u2014 while suggesting that his ultra-artisanal approach has been instrumental in winning over French critics and diners. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of touching a French person\u2019s heart.\u201dROSEVALWhen you talk to expatriate French chefs in London and New York, the constant refrain is it is too expensive to open a restaurant in France and there is too much red tape. The regulatory hurdles are steep, but the actual start-up cost of a restaurant in Paris is not particularly high if you are willing to open in out-of-the-way districts like Belleville, where a Sardinian cook named Simone Tondo and an Anglo-American cook named Michael Greenwold opened Roseval in 2012. The avant-garde wine list created by their Colombian-born sommelier, Erika Biswell, put Roseval at the forefront of the natural-wine craze in Paris. She says she has learned to be diplomatic dealing with Frenchmen intent on proving that they know more about wine than a woman. \u201cI have patience,\u201d Biswell says. \u201cBut I am also Latin.\u201dALBIONIn late 2011, two colleagues from the highly regarded Left Bank restaurant Fish La Boissonnerie \u2014 Hayden Clout, a New Zealander, and Matt Ong, a Brit \u2014 opened Albion, its name a nod to the latter\u2019s British roots. Clout oversees wine service (including the small wine shop at the front of the restaurant), while Ong runs the kitchen. The fact that Ong is British doesn\u2019t appear to be an issue for Paris restaurantgoers: When I had lunch at Albion recently, much of the conversation around me was in French, and Ong and Clout told me that dinner draws a heavily local crowd. One thing they have come to appreciate about Paris is that its restaurant culture moves at a slower pace than other cities\u2019. \u201cIn London, you can be a hit for a year, then it\u2019s over,\u201d Clout says. \u201cIt takes a long time to fail in Paris. It is a bit of a breather \u2014 you get more of a chance to get it right.\u201dLES ENFANTS ROUGESLike French cooking, Japanese cuisine emphasizes seasonality and terroir, which surely goes some way toward explaining why the Japanese have proved to be so adept at French cooking. There are said to be around two dozen French restaurants in Paris with Japanese chefs at the helm. One of the most talked-about is Les Enfants Rouges, which the 35-year-old Dai Shinozuka took over last fall. A Tokyo native, Shinozuka moved to France in his early 20s, and after half a dozen years working in the kitchen of Yves Camdeborde, widely regarded as the father of the bistronomie movement, he is now serving terrific neo-bistro fare in his own charmingly dilapidated space. A recent lunch there \u2014 crab meat and celery r\u00e9moulade in lobster broth; roasted veal with winter vegetables; Baba au rhum with a big bowl of whipped cream \u2014 was homey, totally satisfying French cooking.ABRIAbri has become one of the toughest reservations in Paris. It\u2019s also quite possibly the craziest restaurant in Paris, just slightly larger than a shoe box, and the open kitchen, set on a raised platform to one side of the narrow space, looks as if it belongs in a diner. The staff is all Japanese, none of them speak English and their French is pretty spotty, too. (Not that it matters; they almost never pick up the phone or respond to emails. I got in only because I stopped by one afternoon, put myself on the waiting list and received a call at 11 in the morning two days later saying I could have a table at 1:30 that afternoon.) The enigmatic man behind Abri, Katsuaki Okiyama, trained with the celebrated French chef Jo\u00ebl Robuchon and also worked at Taillevent, one of the great old-guard Paris restaurants, before setting out on his own. He said he had no interest in opening a restaurant back in Japan; he wanted to \u201ccook French for the French.\u201dFRENCHIEGregory Marchand is perhaps the most American chef in Paris \u2014 despite having been born and raised in France. After graduating from cooking school in Brittany, he went to work first in Scotland, then at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in London. In 2003, he was hired by the British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver at his renowned London restaurant 15. The experience, says Marchand, who rose to head chef, \u201cfreed me from all this French-based cooking.\u201d What\u2019s more, the atmosphere there \u2014 \u201cthis notion of team, of let\u2019s make it nice\u201d \u2014 stood in marked contrast to the rap-the-kid-on-the-knuckles approach prevalent in many French kitchens. After three years with Oliver, Marchand decided to move to New York. Though he had a job offer from Daniel Boulud, he chose to work at Danny Meyer\u2019s Gramercy Tavern instead; he had no interest in crossing the Atlantic to cook French fare: \u201cWhat was the point of going to New York to do French-style food?\u201d When Marchand and his pregnant wife returned to Paris in 2008, he had no idea it was on the cusp of a food revolution. He knew only that he wanted to serve upscale fare at prices affordable to younger diners in a casual setting. Frenchie, from Oliver\u2019s nickname for him, opened in April 2009. Following its success, Marchand opened a wine bar across the street and then, in 2013, Frenchie to Go, an all-day cafe and carryout shop that is the most unabashedly American of his ventures, with offerings like doughnuts and pastrami sandwiches.VERJUSThe opening of Verjus at the end of 2012 was the next step for a young American expat couple, Braden Perkins and Laura Adrian, after several years of holding first a monthly dinner party and then a more frequent supper club in their apartment. Expat food writers and bloggers immediately embraced Verjus, but the French magazine L\u2019Express gave it a blistering review. Perkins says that people in the neighborhood would chide him, too. \u201cI was definitely hurt,\u201d Perkins says. \u201cI thought we would win over the French immediately. Greg [Marchand] was cooking modern American food, I cook modern American food. But because I was American, they closed me out.\u201d Ultimately the many French who patronized the wine bar in the basement began to give the dining room a try. Suddenly, two years after opening, Verjus is drawing a substantial number of local diners. But hardly any French cooks. \u201cThe system in France is that you spend your first nine months washing lettuce in the basement,\u201d Perkins says, comparing that to the autonomy he gives his staff. \u201cI get these guys cooking right away, and the French just can\u2019t take that freedom.\u201dSPRINGDaniel Rose is American by birth \u2014 and considered the forerunner of the expat invasion \u2014 but he is perhaps the most French chef in Paris. He moved to France to study the language in 1998 after earning a joint degree in philosophy and the history of mathematics from St John\u2019s College in New Mexico. But he was quickly seduced by the flavors of the food, the elaborate rituals of the French restaurant experience and the fact that the French culinary tradition was an intellectual as well as aesthetic one. Rose attended Paul Bocuse\u2019s cooking school in Lyon, then worked in restaurants in Brittany and Avignon; he opened Spring in 2006. Although the Michelin Guide has yet to award Spring even one star (a snub that says more about Michelin\u2019s unreliability than it does about the quality of Rose\u2019s cooking), Rose believes he\u2019s answering to a higher authority: Escoffier. \u201cI think Escoffier would understand what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he says. \u201cHe might even like it.\u201d Validation comes in other ways. Last fall, Gilles Chesneau, who worked for nearly 20 years for the three-star chef Guy Savoy and is one of the most respected veterans of the high-end Paris food scene, left Savoy to become chef de cuisine at Spring. Rose says: \u201cI spent about five minutes feeling flattered when Gilles agreed to come to Spring, and 25 minutes feeling anxiety about whether I was up to the task.\u201dLE CAMION QUI FUMEIntroducing the French to two American phenomena \u2014 quality hamburgers and gourmet food trucks \u2014 isn\u2019t exactly the future that the Los Angeles native Kristin Frederick saw for herself when she left a job as a traveling-nurse recruiter in 2009 to attend cooking school in Paris. The French didn\u2019t see it, either. Acquaintances, she says, \u201ctold me that the French don\u2019t like to eat in the street and don\u2019t like to eat with their hands.\u201d But she had noticed that burgers were the most popular items on the menu at the few restaurants in Paris that served decent ones. Once she got permission to bring her truck, which she named Le Camion Qui Fume (the Smoking Truck), to two outdoor markets in Paris in November 2011, it was immediately written up by Le Fooding; the next day, 200 customers showed up. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick now has two trucks crisscrossing Paris, and recently opened both a sandwich shop called Freddie\u2019s Deli \u2014 which serves pastrami sandwiches, Philly cheesesteaks and Brooklyn Brewery beer \u2014 and a popcorn bar at a multiplex cinema on the outskirts of Paris. She\u2019s also creating a Chinese restaurant, having noticed on moving to Paris that there wasn\u2019t much Chinese takeout there. Along with things like fried rice and noodles, she\u2019s going to do to pork buns \u2014 \u201cPeople here have been staring at pictures of Momofuku for years,\u201d she says.Advertisement"}

Taking action to reduce the extreme inequality of 21st-century America would probably increase, not reduce, economic growth. Let\u2019s start with the evidence.In short, Okun\u2019s big trade-off doesn\u2019t seem to be a trade-off at all. Nobody is proposing that we try to be Cuba, but moving American policies part of the way toward European norms would probably increase, not reduce, economic efficiency.But how can the effects of redistribution on growth be benign? Doesn\u2019t generous aid to the poor reduce their incentive to work? Don\u2019t taxes on the rich reduce their incentive to get even richer? Yes and yes \u2014 but incentives aren\u2019t the only things that matter. Resources matter too \u2014 and in a highly unequal society, many people don\u2019t have them.Think, in particular, about the ever-popular slogan that we should seek equality of opportunity, not equality of outcomes. That may sound good to people with no idea what life is like for tens of millions of Americans; but for those with any reality sense, it\u2019s a cruel joke. Almost 40 percent of American children live in poverty or near-poverty. Do you really think they have the same access to education and jobs as the children of the affluent? Now, I don\u2019t want to claim that addressing income inequality would help everyone. The very affluent would lose more from higher taxes than they gained from better economic growth. But it\u2019s pretty clear that taking on inequality would be good, not just for the poor, but for the middle class (sorry, Senator Santorum). In short, what\u2019s good for the 1 percent isn\u2019t good for America. And we don\u2019t have to keep living in a new Gilded Age if we don\u2019t want to. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sharply Criticized by Government, Head of the Central Bank of Cyprus Resigns", "Date": "2014-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The central bank chief of financially plagued Cyprus resigned Monday, following political tensions with the Cypriot government and an investigation into his role in the 10 billion euro international bailout for the island last year.On Monday, the Cypriot government brushed off concerns that Mr. Demetriades resigned under political pressure. \u201cHe stepped down among other things for family reasons,\u201d Victor Papadopoulos, a deputy government spokesman, said.Mr. Demetriades, an economics professor at the University of Leicester in Britain, was not well known in monetary policy circles before his appointment in 2012 by the Communist-led government then in power. He had been at odds with the conservative government that took office last year as the country\u2019s banking system was collapsing.Mr. Demetriades had faced sharp criticism from Cyprus\u2019s conservative government about the way he handled the bailout, including his use of European funds made available to him to help recapitalize one of Cyprus\u2019s two major banks shortly before the banking system collapsed, turning the country into the latest trouble spot in the euro zone crisis.Cyprus is just a tiny part of the euro zone economy. But in central banking circles, the specter of governments seeking to assert influence over an independent institution raises deep concerns.Last month, the central bank governor of Nigeria was fired after charging repeatedly that billions of dollars in oil revenue owed to the country\u2019s treasury had gone missing. In 2013, a Hungarian deputy central bank governor resigned to protest the new central bank chief appointed by the prime minister, Viktor Orban, saying the new banker, an ally of Mr. Orban\u2019s, was incompetent and suggesting his policies threatened the central bank\u2019s steering of the economy.Mr. Demetriades has faced off with Cyprus\u2019s president Nicos Anastasiades, who accused him of crushing the Cypriot economy by enacting harsh austerity terms that were attached to the international rescue package.In the midst of the crisis, Mr. Demetriades said his family had received death threats. They moved to London, where he is now expected to join them.In September, Mr. Anastasiades said he was talking to government lawyers about how to remove Mr. Demetriades, prompting European Commissioner Olli Rehn to express further concern that the government was meddling with the central bank. A month later, Cyprus\u2019s attorney general, shortly after his appointment by the Cypriot president, opened a criminal investigation into a controversial agreement in which Mr. Demetriades paid an American consulting firm, Alvarez & Marsal, an estimated \u20ac4.75 million fee at the height of the crisis to find money needed to recapitalize Cyprus\u2019s hobbled banks. Since then, Cypriot police have entered the central bank several times to collect information.\u201cContinuous pressure is being put on the governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus by the government through public statements made by several of its members,\u201d Mr. Draghi wrote in his December letter, which followed one similar in tone that he wrote last April to Mr. Anastasiades. The president responded by accusing Mr. Draghi of \u201cmisinformation.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Papadopoulos, the government spokesman, said: \u201cThe president fully respects the independence of the central bank of Cyprus and the regulations of the European Union. Neither the president nor the government wants to interfere with the exercise of the duties of central bank governor.\u201dLike all central bank heads in the euro zone, Mr. Demetriades sat on the 24-member governing council of the European Central Bank. The bank does not release minutes of its meetings or say how members of its Governing Council voted, but it is unlikely that Mr. Demetriades had a great influence on policy.His predecessor, Athanasios Orphanides, had worked as an economist at the Federal Reserve and was more influential. Mr. Orphanides clashed with the previous Cyprus government, which did not reappoint him after his term expired in 2012. Mr. Orphanides is now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Still, Mr. Draghi, the bank\u2019s president, took umbrage at what he perceived as an attempt by the current Cyprus government to force Mr. Demetriades from office.In his reply, Mr. Anastasiades also accused Mr. Demetriades of delaying a cleanup of Cyprus banks until after national elections in early 2013, in an unsuccessful attempt to help the Communist-led government retain power.Mr. Demetriades said at the time he had just been following the advice of European Union authorities.An article on Tuesday about the resignation of Cyprus\u2019s central bank governor misstated the details of a separate, earlier resignation involving the Hungarian central bank. A deputy governor of the Hungarian bank resigned in 2013 to protest the appointment of a new central bank governor by Prime Minister Viktor Orban. It was not the central bank governor who resigned, and the episode did not happen in 2012. Nor was Mr. Orban new to his office at the time; he was elected in 2010.Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt and David Jolly from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Westchester Leader Opens Bid to Deny Cuomo a Second Term", "Date": "2014-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 Entering a field devoid of formidable Republican contenders, Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive, formally announced his candidacy for governor on Wednesday, beginning a campaign to unseat Andrew M. Cuomo, the popular and well-funded Democratic incumbent.In the announcement, Mr. Astorino made it clear he intended to attack Governor Cuomo on a variety of issues. It appeared that he would make the economy, taxes and jobs central to his campaign, mentioning other states like Florida, North Dakota and Texas \u2014 which have Republican governors \u2014 as models for growth and competitors for New York\u2019s jobs and citizens.\u201cThese are the places where the jobs are going, the ones that used to be in New York,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cThis is where New Yorkers are moving to escape the crazy cost of living and killer property taxes.\u201dIn even more pointed remarks, Mr. Astorino accused Mr. Cuomo of allowing a culture of corruption in Albany. He also attacked the governor\u2019s propensity for highlighting accomplishments and new programs in television ads, which Mr. Astorino called misleading and \u201cgimmicky.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m tired of listening to the fairy tale that everything is just great when it\u2019s just the opposite,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m tired of watching New York\u2019s decline.\u201dMr. Astorino faces a daunting challenge: Mr. Cuomo has clear advantages with Election Day eight months away, including campaign coffers stuffed with about $33 million and generally favorable approval ratings. Opinion polls also show him beating Mr. Astorino in a head-to-head match.In January, Mr. Astorino reported having $1 million in hand, and has readily acknowledged not being well known outside of his home county, just north of New York City. Nonetheless, he is sure to attract votes aligned with conservative and Tea Party agendas, and he is more battle-tested than Carl P. Paladino, the Republican businessman whom Mr. Cuomo easily defeated in 2010. Mr. Astorino \u2014 a former radio producer who, at 46, is a decade younger than Mr. Cuomo \u2014 has also shown surprising strength as a candidate in the past, handily winning a second term as county executive last fall, even though Westchester has more registered Democrats than Republicans.\u201cGoliath, meet David,\u201d said Ed Cox, the state chairman. \u201cRob Astorino has proven that a Republican can win in two-to-one Democratic New York. Rob has what it takes to reverse the decline of New York, not just try to manage it like our last three Democratic governors.\u201dDespite the seemingly long odds, Mr. Astorino\u2019s early tactics appear to suggest several political avenues that could be potent. Mr. Cuomo has repeatedly tried to woo upstate voters, but support there has lagged. (Mr. Astorino will visit Albany, Rochester and Syracuse on Friday.)Likewise, Mr. Astorino seems intent on making an issue of hydraulic fracturing, the gas and oil extraction method known as fracking. The process is effectively banned in New York, and Mr. Cuomo has been accused of stalling on the issue by awaiting a long-simmering report from his Health Department. That accusation was echoed by Mr. Astorino in his video on Wednesday, in which he said the natural gas industry could \u201clower electric rates, improve air quality, create tens of thousands of new jobs and billions in new revenue.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cGovernor Cuomo sat on his hands for four years and refused to make a decision.\u201dMr. Astorino, who lives in Mount Pleasant, N.Y., with his wife and three children, was a radio host for the Catholic Channel, a SiriusXM satellite radio station, and helped to start ESPN Radio in New York over a decade ago. As a fluent Spanish speaker, he capitalized on his popularity among Latino voters when he was first elected county executive, in 2009.Mr. Astorino\u2019s announcement comes after months of speculation about his intentions and flirtations by other possible candidates, including the real estate developer Donald J. Trump, who has said that he would run, but only if the party asked him to, without primary challengers. Michael Cohen, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, said on Wednesday that the Astorino announcement \u201cwill do little to curb\u201d the notion that \u201conly Donald Trump has the ability to win the gubernatorial race.\u201d State Democrats reacted to Mr. Astorino\u2019s announcement with indifference.\u201cWe look forward to an entertaining Republican primary process,\u201d said Peter Kauffmann, a spokesman for the New York State Democratic Committee, \u201cand are ready to run against whomever their nominee is.\u201dMr. Cuomo, who also lives in Westchester, has had little to say about Mr. Astorino, and said last week that the campaign was far from his mind.\u201cI\u2019m trying to stay away from the politics until I finish the government,\u201d he said in an interview with the Fox Business Network, adding that he wanted \u201cto stay away from talking any politics until June,\u201d when the legislative session ends. But he has been active in fund-raising, attending a glamorous event in Los Angeles in late January, which was reported to have netted more than $500,000 for his campaign.In his announcement, Mr. Astorino hammered on the theme that businesses and residents were fleeing New York because of high taxes, a poor business climate and even more basic issues like high electricity rates. \u201cLiving in New York shouldn\u2019t sound like a prison sentence,\u201d he said, in a video that struck both humorous and serious notes, with images of moving vans and prison cells.He suggested that his tenure in Westchester had been a success thanks to lower taxes and spending, bipartisan cooperation and consolidated government. \u201cWe can do the same for all of New York State,\u201d he said.If Mr. Astorino is the Republican nominee, he would accept the nomination on his home turf: The state Republican convention is to be held in May in Rye Brook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Easy Way to Rewrite E.U. Treaty", "Date": "2014-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyBoth Continental euro enthusiasts and British Conservatives received a boost last week when the German and British finance ministers called for a rewrite of the European Union\u2019s treaties. The goal, outlined by Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and George Osborne, was to kill two birds with one stone: shore up the euro zone and keep Britain in the European Union.The entente is significant. Relations have certainly warmed since December 2011, when London tried to block one of Berlin\u2019s pet projects \u2014 a treaty that restricted borrowing by euro zone countries \u2014 unless it was given guarantees to protect the City of London.But have the two countries really found a formula that simultaneously solves the European Union\u2019s two main problems? There are reasons to be skeptical.In a joint article in The Financial Times, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble and Mr. Osborne wrote that the euro zone needed a common fiscal and economic policy. Meanwhile, as it integrates further, those European Union countries that do not use the single currency, like Britain, should not be put at a \u201csystematic disadvantage.\u201dWhat this means is that \u201cfuture E.U. reform and treaty change must include reform of the governance framework to put euro area integration on a sound legal basis, and guarantee fairness for those E.U. countries inside the single market but outside the single currency.\u201dSome observers see this declaration as the basis of a grand bargain. After all, Germany is the European Union\u2019s most powerful country. What Berlin wants, Berlin gets.But is this really so?Take Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s desire for a new euro zone governance framework. During the crisis years, three important new entities have been or are being created: the European Stability Mechanism, the bloc\u2019s bailout fund; the single supervisory mechanism, under the aegis of the European Central Bank, for overseeing banks; and the single resolution mechanism, for shutting down bust lenders.Meanwhile, the zone\u2019s finance ministers meet regularly in the Eurogroup \u2014 which, in due course, will have its own full-time president. On top of that, Germany got its stricter rules to control countries\u2019 borrowings.The conventional wisdom is that monetary union requires fiscal union \u2014 and that what the euro zone has done so far does not amount to fiscal union. But what else is needed?Here views diverge. Germany wants more discipline, giving either a euro zone finance minister or a European Union budget commissioner the power to veto national budgets. Other countries, especially in the periphery, want some form of \u201cdebt mutualization\u201d \u2014 under which euro zone members would guarantee each other\u2019s borrowings.These different visions will be hard to reconcile. Underwriting foreign countries\u2019 debts is anathema to many Germans, while giving a supranational czar the ability to overturn budgets will be deeply unpopular in most other nations.But can\u2019t Berlin just ram its vision through, as it has done so often during the crisis? Probably not. After all, the existential threat posed by a possible euro breakup has receded, meaning other countries are no longer so afraid that they have to dance to Germany\u2019s tune.What\u2019s more, the rise of euro-skepticism in many countries \u2014 something that the European Parliament elections in May are likely to underline \u2014 means it will be hard to push through a new treaty even if the political elites want one. Remember that European Union treaty changes require approval by all 28 members and, in many countries, there will have to be referendums. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, for one, seems hostile to such a vote, fearing he would lose it given the rise of the far-right National Front.If there was an urgent need for a treaty change, all countries might still fall into line. But there isn\u2019t. The euro zone still has problems. But most can be solved by increasing competitiveness \u2014 and that does not require a treaty.What about Britain? Doesn\u2019t Prime Minister David Cameron need to secure treaty changes in order to win the \u201cin-out\u201d referendum on British membership in the European Union that he has promised to hold in 2017?Quite apart from the fact that Mr. Cameron may not be prime minister in 2017, Britain can significantly advance its interests within the European Union without revamping the treaties. The economic priorities are: completing the single market; securing trade deals with the United States, Japan and China; cutting unnecessary red tape; and building a modern financial system based more on capital markets than banks. The latter change is needed because banks are deleveraging and will not be able to finance growth on their own.Britain, of course, has other interests, which can only be secured through treaty change. It would, for example, be good to strengthen the principle of subsidiarity, under which the European Union is supposed to take action only if it can do so more effectively than a nation-state can alone. That would help stop meddling by Brussels.What\u2019s more, if the euro zone does go for full fiscal union, Britain and other countries like Denmark that do not use the euro will be in a bind. The euro countries might then form a common position on all important matters and so dictate to the others how the single market operates. In such a scenario, it will be vital to guarantee fairness for those not in the single currency, as Mr. Sch\u00e4uble and Mr. Osborne say.But this is not the only, or even the most probable, scenario. Mr. Cameron should not place all his bets on treaty change.Advertisement"}

But Masayoshi Son wants to help.Mr. Son, the founder of SoftBank, the Japanese technology and telecommunications giant, took an unusual tack in a rare address to an American audience on Tuesday, saying that he wants to rescue the United States from broadband oblivion.What he really wants, of course, is to merge Sprint, which he took control of last year in a $21.6 billion deal, with T-Mobile. But American regulators have told him that the prospects are not good for joining the third- and fourth-largest mobile phone companies.The address was a remarkable combination of patriotic appeal \u2014 a slide show regularly featured a backdrop of the American flag \u2014 a biographical sketch of his hardscrabble upbringing in a working-class family, and recognition of his achievements at the University of California, Berkeley, and as a businessman in Japan. Mr. Son said he believed it was unacceptable for the United States to rank 15th out of 16 large economies in the world for wireless broadband speed but to have the second-most-expensive cost to consumers.\u201cIt\u2019s not the case that American consumers pay more because Americans use more data\u201d than wireless customers in the rest of the world, Mr. Son said, rejecting a standard argument used by wireless companies.Japanese consumers use an average of 1.5 gigabytes of data a month, while Americans use 1 gigabyte, he said. But, he added, Americans also pay $52 per gigabyte on average, versus $30 in Japan. In a television interview on Monday with Charlie Rose, Mr. Son said if he were successful with his bid to acquire T-Mobile, he would start a \u201cmassive price war\u201d among wireless companies.But after his formal remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Son told reporters that he could not start such a price war on his own, at least with Sprint at its current size.\u201cWe have the spectrum; we have the technology,\u201d Mr. Son said. \u201cBut we need scale efficiency to make an investment in the network.\u201d Sprint currently has a negative cash flow, he said. \u201cWe can start a small fight but it does not scale, it does not last, it\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to have a real fight \u2014 a long and deep and heavy fight. And for that we need scale.\u201dSoftBank also announced Tuesday that it was opening a Washington office to be run by Bruce Gottlieb, who formerly served as chief counsel at the Federal Communications Commission and who, most recently, served as general counsel and senior vice president for corporate strategy at Atlantic Media.Advertisement"}

From one side of the political aisle, William Bennett, a former education secretary and a noted conservative, wrote in 2001: \u201cIt is these absent men, above all, who deserve our censure and disesteem.\u201dFrom the other, Barack Obama, in 2007, observed that \u201cthere are a lot of men out there who need to stop acting like boys, who need to realize that responsibility does not end at conception, who need to know that what makes you a man is not the ability to have a child but the courage to raise one.\u201dThe expansion \u2014 which the White House estimates would help an extra 13.5 million people work their way out of poverty \u2014 represents a sharp break from the mind-set of the \u201cdeserving\u201d and \u201cundeserving\u201d poor that has hamstrung American public assistance from the beginning.Stripping moral condemnation out of social policy is essential to help dysfunctional families succeed. If the objective is to help poor, marginalized children and young people achieve better lives, it is time to get away from trying to reshape families into some platonic ideal and turn our attention to helping the kind of complicated families that raise children in today\u2019s flawed world.For all the condemnation, the trends Mr. Moynihan identified 50 years ago as signs of social dysfunction among blacks have spread throughout America: 36 percent of white children are born to single mothers, as are 53 percent of Hispanics. Among blacks, the figure is 72 percent.\u201cIt seems reasonable to conclude that nonmarital births will continue to swell the ranks of female-headed families for the foreseeable future,\u201d Maria Cancian of the University of Wisconsin and Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution wrote in a soon-to-be-published study on low-income families. \u201cWe must therefore analyze what can be done to improve outcomes for children in single-parent families.\u201dThis includes not only vesting less hope in the policies to encourage marriage that were so popular during the administration of George W. Bush, but also, for instance, offering child care so poor mothers can work. And it means taking some of the pressure off the deadbeat dads, and maybe even lending them a hand.For years, policies to help disadvantaged children have been designed to provide as little help as possible to their estranged parents. Mothers benefit from support programs like the earned-income credit and public housing only to the extent that they are caring for children.Noncustodial fathers have been treated exclusively as sources of cash, subjected to things like wage garnishment or incarceration to enforce child-support orders that can remain in place even when fathers lose their jobs or go to jail, making little allowance for fathers\u2019 ability to pay.Incarceration rates have multiplied by five over the last 35 years. Most of those imprisoned are young black men. More than half have young children. When they get out, their chances of finding a job will be minimal. But their child-support arrears will be waiting.Ms. Edin and Mr. Nelson criticize the conventional wisdom across the political spectrum that \u201cblames the significant difficulties that so many children born to unwed parents face \u2014 poor performance in school, teenage pregnancy and low school-completion rates, criminal behavior and difficulty securing a steady job \u2014 on their fathers\u2019 failure to care.\u201dThe proposition fits neatly with longstanding arguments made by conservative thinkers like Charles Murray of the American Enterprise Institute, who argues that the root of the problems faced by low-income America lies in the abandonment of core values that are fundamental to achieving a middle-class life.But there is an alternative explanation for the instability plaguing low-income families that fits the data substantially better than the assertion of sudden moral decline: The job market has changed in such fundamental ways that many men can no longer fulfill their part of the marriage bargain.Men without a high school degree earn a third less, in real terms, than they did in 1979. High school graduates who never went to college earn a fifth less.It\u2019s true that low-income women earn less, on average, than men. Still, they are better equipped for a labor market that keeps shedding brawny guy jobs and adding service positions that require a more nimble touch. Their earnings are on a more favorable trend.At the low end of the income scale, this sea change has rendered many men, in their own and their potential partners\u2019 eyes, unmarriageable.\u201cA seismic shift has occurred in lower-skilled men\u2019s ability and willingness to shoulder the traditional bread-winning responsibilities of the family,\u201d Ms. Edin and Mr. Nelson wrote. \u201cAt the bottom end of the skills distribution we see not just a withdrawal but a headlong retreat \u2014 it is nearly a dead run \u2014 from the breadwinner role.\u201dThere\u2019s no denying the crisis among low-income families. Today, however, there is an opportunity to offer a different prescription.If dysfunction is recognized as a result of broad forces reshaping the American economy, perhaps government can get over the appetite to punish so much and instead offer the support \u2014 to employment, earnings, housing \u2014 that might actually help low-income men and women offer their children a better deal.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Urbanizing China", "Date": "2014-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialNow, the government has ordered up yet another migration that, it says, will further economic growth. The plan calls for expanding existing cities and for creating new towns and the housing, roads, rail lines and other public amenities that go with them. Addressing the frequent criticism that many new buildings are constructed poorly, the government has even promised to improve building standards as part of its plan. The overall goal is to increase the number of people living in cities to 60 percent by 2020. But there are problems that the new plan hasn\u2019t adequately addressed. One is the fact that local governments exercise great, even decisive, power over the lives of ordinary Chinese, requiring a hukou, or urban registration, of anyone who wants access to health, education and other public services. Just 36 percent of Chinese have a city hukou now, and rural migrants often find themselves denied services.Another set of problems has to do with farmers and their land. Because the Chinese government owns all the land, rural residents have only the right to use the plots that they farm and cannot easily sell or transfer those rights to other people. That keeps many farmers tied to their land. The government should make it easier for farmers to buy and sell usage rights in a transparent market. China\u2019s government has put forward an intriguing urbanization plan. But it has a lot more work to do to make sure its ideas are designed and carried out in ways that benefit its people.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Getting Ukraine Wrong", "Date": "2014-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPresident Obama has decided to get tough with Russia by imposing sanctions and increasing support for Ukraine\u2019s new government. This is a big mistake. This response is based on the same faulty logic that helped precipitate the crisis. Instead of resolving the dispute, it will lead to more trouble. The White House view, widely shared by Beltway insiders, is that the United States bears no responsibility for causing the current crisis. In their eyes, it\u2019s all President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s fault \u2014 and his motives are illegitimate. This is wrong. Washington played a key role in precipitating this dangerous situation, and Mr. Putin\u2019s behavior is motivated by the same geopolitical considerations that influence all great powers, including the United States.The taproot of the current crisis is NATO expansion and Washington\u2019s commitment to move Ukraine out of Moscow\u2019s orbit and integrate it into the West. The Russians have intensely disliked but tolerated substantial NATO expansion, including the accession of Poland and the Baltic countries. But when NATO announced in 2008 that Georgia and Ukraine \u201cwill become members of NATO,\u201d Russia drew a line in the sand. Georgia and Ukraine are not just states in Russia\u2019s neighborhood; they are on its doorstep. Indeed, Russia\u2019s forceful response in its August 2008 war with Georgia was driven in large part by Moscow\u2019s desire to prevent Georgia from joining NATO and integrating into the West. Fast forward to last November, when it seemed that President Viktor F. Yanukovych would sign an agreement with the European Union that was designed to deepen Ukraine\u2019s integration with the West and greatly reduce Moscow\u2019s influence there. Mr. Putin offered Ukraine a better deal in response, which Mr. Yanukovych accepted. That decision led to protests in western Ukraine, where there is strong pro-Western sentiment and much hostility to Moscow.The Obama administration then made a fatal mistake by backing the protesters, which helped escalate the crisis and eventually led to the toppling of Mr. Yanukovych. A pro-Western government then took over in Kiev. The United States ambassador to Ukraine, who had been encouraging the protesters, proclaimed it \u201ca day for the history books.\u201d Mr. Putin, of course, didn\u2019t see things that way. He viewed these developments as a direct threat to Russia\u2019s core strategic interests. Who can blame him? After all, the United States, which has been unable to leave the Cold War behind, has treated Russia as a potential threat since the early 1990s and ignored its protests about NATO\u2019s expansion and its objections to America\u2019s plan to build missile defense systems in Eastern Europe. One might expect American policymakers to understand Russia\u2019s concerns about Ukraine joining a hostile alliance. After all, the United States is deeply committed to the Monroe Doctrine, which warns other great powers to stay out of the Western Hemisphere. But few American policymakers are capable of putting themselves in Mr. Putin\u2019s shoes. This is why they were so surprised when he moved additional troops into Crimea, threatened to invade eastern Ukraine, and made it clear Moscow would use its considerable economic leverage to undermine any regime in Kiev that was hostile to Russia.When Mr. Putin explained why he was playing hardball, Mr. Obama responded that the Russian leader \u201cseems to have a different set of lawyers making a different set of interpretations.\u201d But the Russian leader is obviously not talking with lawyers; he sees this conflict in geopolitical, not legal terms. Mr. Putin\u2019s view is understandable. Because there is no world government to protect states from one another, major powers are acutely sensitive to threats \u2014 especially near their borders \u2014 and they sometimes act ruthlessly to address potential dangers. International law and human rights concerns take a back seat when vital security issues are at stake.Mr. Obama would be advised to stop talking to lawyers and start thinking like a strategist. If he did, he would realize that punishing the Russians while trying to pull Ukraine into the West\u2019s camp will only make matters worse. The West has few options for inflicting pain on Russia, while Moscow has many cards to play against Ukraine and the West. It could invade eastern Ukraine or annex Crimea, because Ukraine regrettably relinquished the nuclear arsenal it inherited when the Soviet Union broke up and thus has no counter to Russia\u2019s conventional superiority. Furthermore, Russia could stop cooperating with America over Iran and Syria; it could badly damage Ukraine\u2019s struggling economy and even cause serious economic problems in the European Union due to its role as a major gas supplier. Not surprisingly, most Europeans aren\u2019t very enthusiastic about employing costly sanctions against Russia.But even if the West could impose significant costs on Russia, Mr. Putin is unlikely to back down. When vital interests are at stake, countries are invariably willing to suffer great pain to ensure their security. There is no reason to think Russia, given its history, is an exception. Mr. Obama should adopt a new policy toward Russia and Ukraine \u2014 one that seeks to prevent war by recognizing Russia\u2019s security interests and upholding Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity. To achieve those goals, the United States should emphasize that Georgia and Ukraine will not become NATO members. It should make clear that America will not interfere in future Ukrainian elections or be sympathetic to a virulently anti-Russian government in Kiev. And it should demand that future Ukrainian governments respect minority rights, especially regarding the status of Russian as an official language. In short, Ukraine should remain neutral between East and West. Some might say these policy prescriptions amount to a defeat for America. On the contrary, Washington has a deep-seated interest in ending this conflict and maintaining Ukraine as a sovereign buffer state between Russia and NATO. Furthermore, good relations with Russia are essential, because the United States needs Moscow\u2019s help to deal with Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, and eventually to help counter China, the only genuine potential rival to the United States.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Downside of Inciting Envy", "Date": "2014-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlexis de Tocqueville phrased it a little differently, but his classic 19th-century text contains the same observation. Visiting from France, he marveled at Americans\u2019 ability to keep envy at bay, and to see others\u2019 successes as portents of good times for all.For decades, survey data has supported the Bono-Tocqueville Hypothesis. The 2006 World Values Survey, for example, found that Americans are only a third as likely as British or French people to feel strongly that \u201chard work doesn\u2019t generally bring success; it\u2019s more a matter of luck and connections.\u201d This faith that success flows from effort has built America\u2019s reputation as a remarkably unenvious society.My own data analysis confirms a strong link between economic envy and unhappiness. In 2008, Gallup asked a large sample of Americans whether they were \u201cangry that others have more than they deserve.\u201d People who strongly disagreed with that statement \u2014 who were not envious, in other words \u2014 were almost five times more likely to say they were \u201cvery happy\u201d about their lives than people who strongly agreed. Even after I controlled for income, education, age, family status, religion and politics, this pattern persisted.It\u2019s safe to conclude that a national shift toward envy would be toxic for American culture.People who believe that hard work brings success do not begrudge others their prosperity. But if the game looks rigged, envy and a desire for redistribution will follow.How can we break the back of envy and rebuild the optimism that made America the marvel of the world?First and foremost, we must increase mobility for more Americans with a radical opportunity agenda. That means education reform that empowers parents through choice, and rewards teachers for innovation. It means regulatory and tax reform tailored to spark hiring and entrepreneurship at all levels, especially the bottom of the income scale. It means recalibrating the safety net to ensure that work always pays \u2014 such as an expansion of the earned-income tax credit \u2014 while never disdaining the so-called dead-end jobs that represent a crucial first step for many marginalized people.Second, we must recognize that fomenting bitterness over income differences may be powerful politics, but it injures our nation. We need aspirational leaders willing to do the hard work of uniting Americans around an optimistic vision in which anyone can earn his or her success. This will never happen when we vilify the rich or give up on the poor.Only a shared, joyful mission of freedom, opportunity and enterprise for all will cure us of envy and remind us who we truly are.The president of the American Enterprise Institute and a contributing opinion writer.

{"Headline": "Republican\u2019s Tax Plan Awkwardly Aims at Rich ", "Date": "2014-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceTax the rich.What do you think a Republican congressman would say about a tax proposal that contained numerous provisions to take away benefits from some taxpayers simply because they made too much money?The proposal in question would force some high-income taxpayers to pay taxes on municipal bonds that have so far been tax-free. They would lose the tax break available to others when they sell their homes. They would have to pay taxes on the value of their employer-provided health insurance and would lose the deduction for contributions to 401(k) retirement plans.Furthermore, everyone who has taken advantage of the \u201ccarried interest\u201d tax dodge that lets private equity partners treat their pay as capital gains would lose it. That provision allowed Mitt Romney to pay an effective tax rate of less than 15 percent on millions of dollars.This particular proposal would also hit high-income taxpayers by phasing out some deductions and other tax provisions for couples making more than $450,000. Other benefits would vanish for those making more than $517,500. The interplay of all these complicated provisions would \u2014 for a few taxpayers \u2014 lead to marginal tax rates as high as 67 percent.If this were President Obama\u2019s tax proposal, you can be assured that there would be cries about \u201cclass warfare.\u201dBut it\u2019s not.Instead, it describes some of the proposals in the Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed last week by the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Representative Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican.The Camp proposal seems unlikely to go anywhere, in no small part because the House Republican leadership has gone out of its way to distance itself from the proposal, praising Mr. Camp for his diligence and calling it worthy of consideration but not getting close to an endorsement. He wanted to reduce the top tax rate to 25 percent but could not do that without taking away many more tax goodies than he does. So he has a special 35 percent bracket that applies to couples with incomes of more than $450,000 but picks and chooses what income above that level is taxable. Municipal bond interest can be taxed at a 10 percent rate, but there is no extra tax on manufacturing income.There is also a special tax on big banks. That is something you might expect from a liberal Democrat, and there are reports that some Wall Street organizations are so angry they are threatening to withhold donations to Republican candidates this year.There was a time when any proposal by the Ways and Means Committee chairman would be viewed as a blueprint for legislation that would most likely become law. In those days, chairmen sometimes seemed to serve forever, and they knew how to work across the aisle to get deals done.Wilbur Mills, an Arkansas Democrat, was committee chairman from 1958 to 1974, during five presidential administrations. In the press, it often sounded as if his title were truly \u201cPowerful Chairman.\u201d He had the power to grant, or withhold, tax provisions that individual members sought for favored constituents. A legislator who offended him might face problems for years. Mr. Camp, on the other hand, is a lame duck. Next year, under the rules of the House Republican Caucus, he will have to step down after four years as chairman. I had hoped that his eagerness to accomplish something would overcome inertia, but it appears it will not. The last thing the House Republican leadership wants is votes that will call attention to splits within the party.Seniority no longer calls the shots when new chairmen are named, and the campaigning to replace Mr. Camp is already underway. One man who wants the job is said to be Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who was Mr. Romney\u2019s running mate.In the talk about tax reform, there has been a general agreement that top rates should be reduced and loopholes closed, something Mr. Ryan has loudly endorsed. But there has been a great reluctance to get specific. This proposal does get specific, and in doing so it makes clear that much more needs to be done to reduce tax preferences and loopholes if we want both to finance the government and to lower tax rates. Even with the efforts to soak the rich, Mr. Camp comes up well short of making the proposals revenue-neutral, although some artful dodges enable him to claim that is true over the next 10 years.To make the limited progress he does, Mr. Camp has to attack many tax preferences. Some are easy (did you know that for some reason the National Football League is tax-exempt?), but many are not. Americans who work overseas lose a tax break. The tax credit for buying electric cars goes away. So does the credit for adopting a child. A lot of tax provisions to provide aid for higher education costs are consolidated.The dodge of avoiding taxes through a \u201clike-kind\u201d exchange would end. Clever ways that some self-employed people have found to avoid paying payroll taxes on their income would be barred.He would change the way we save for retirement, something that prompted outrage from the retirement industry. He would do that by limiting the amount of pretax money that can be saved. Traditional individual retirement accounts would vanish (for new contributions, that is.) The amount of pretax money that could go into 401(k) accounts would be reduced. Instead, Roth I.R.A.s would be encouraged and made available to high-income taxpayers who cannot use them now. The money you put into a Roth I.R.A. is money on which you have paid taxes. But it then accumulates tax-free and you don\u2019t pay taxes on the money you withdraw after you retire. Normal I.R.A.s, like 401(k) accounts, produce taxable income when it is withdrawn after retirement.Similarly, the bill would put an end to so-called deferred compensation at many companies, where the money is put into a savings plan but not paid out until years later, when the employee may be in a lower tax bracket. The effect would be to raise tax revenue now and reduce it in the later years when the deferred compensation would have been paid.There is no logical reason employees should be taxed on the money they are paid but not on the value of the fringe benefits the employer provides. Mr. Camp touches that on the margin, with the provision on extremely wealthy people, but not for the rest of us. He reduces the mortgage interest deduction, but only for those with the most expensive homes.The bill also would force companies to take depreciation expenses over a longer period. That makes sense economically, but it would also push corporate taxes up in the next few years, though not over the long term. All of those things combine to make the estimate that the bill is revenue-neutral suspect. It may be neutral over the 10-year period they count, but not over a longer period.It is good to see some specifics. It is too bad that nothing is likely to come from it.Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pushing the Uighurs Too Far", "Date": "2014-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBEIJING \u2014 The roots of the hatred between ethnic Han Chinese, China\u2019s dominant group, and the mainly Muslim Uighurs of the western borderlands go deep. In 1949, the fledgling Communist government subsumed the independent Uighur state of the East Turkestan Republic, and ever since, the Uighurs have agitated for some degree of autonomy from Beijing. Chinese dominion has never ceased to remind the Uighurs of their status. In 1993, the ashes of a loathed People\u2019s Liberation Army general, Wang Zhen, were scattered from atop a sacred mountain in the Tien Shan range, which is the main source of the Uighurs\u2019 water in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. Since then, the Uighurs feel they have been forced to live on water tainted by the remains of their nemesis. A terrorist attack earlier this month, killing 29 people in a train station in Kunming in the southwestern Yunnan Province, was blamed by Chinese officials on militant Uighurs. The radicalization of the Uighurs\u2019 cause is an inevitable result of Beijing\u2019s continued repression.As Beijing has ramped up the pressure in recent years against the Uighurs, violent clashes between them and Chinese security forces have been on the rise. When a Uighur man drove a car through a crowd near Tiananmen Square in October, killing two pedestrians and the two other occupants of the car, Beijing\u2019s heavy-handed tactics only worsened. The government likes to flaunt how much money it has showered upon Xinjiang in the last decade. Beijing boasts that urban residents in the region saw their annual per capita income more than double from 2000 to 2009, while rural villagers, officials say, tripled their annual income in that period. New transportation infrastructure and natural gas pipelines, mostly financed by Han Chinese from the East, have continued apace. The changes have propelled Xinjiang into the 10th-fastest-growing region in the country.But while the economic indicators have soared, the majority Uighurs have been left behind. The best jobs have gone mostly to the Han Chinese. Uighurs lucky enough to find jobs often end up doing manual labor \u2014 toiling in coal mines, cement plants and at construction sites. Unemployment among young Uighurs is widespread. On my nine visits to Xinjiang, I have often seen bands of working-age Uighur youths loitering on the streets, whether I was in a city or in the countryside. Beijing\u2019s economic push into Xinjiang comes with a demographic rush that many Uighurs find most overwhelming. As money from the east has been piped westward, so have people \u2014 more than 8 million of them. Han Chinese now make up some 40 percent of Xinjiang\u2019s population, a sharp rise from just less than 7 percent half a century ago. The Han go West to make money and look after their own, explaining why Uighurs are not benefiting from the economic boom. So long as Xinjiang\u2019s economy is run by the Han Chinese, Uighurs will be at a disadvantage \u2014 in language and personal networks. In Urumqi, the regional capital, I saw a public square that had been turned into a restaurant featuring live dance performances. I would pass by to find only a handful of Uighur tour guides accompanying foreign visitors among the several hundred overwhelmingly Han patrons. The local Uighurs had to peek through a new iron fence to enjoy performances by their own people. The image of Uighurs peering through the bars at Han Chinese and foreigners was symbolic of how marginalized the Uighurs have become in their land under Han Chinese rule.Before Xinjiang\u2019s economy took off, conflicts between Uighurs and the Han were centered on historical disputes \u2014 abstract legal and moral concepts. Most regular Uighurs were not bothered in their day-to-day lives by the Chinese encroachment. But economic development has brought the conflict closer to home. Now, most Uighurs have to confront their lower status every day, as they see Han prospering all around them. There\u2019s little wonder that discontent has become so widespread. The efforts of the central government to develop Xinjiang \u2014 some even say well-intentioned efforts \u2014 have backfired dramatically. Still, the core conflict between Beijing and the Uighurs is political, not economic. That\u2019s why the Uighur economist Ilham Tohti, of the Central University of Nationalities in Beijing, who has dedicated his life\u2019s work to building bridges between Han Chinese and Uighurs, points to China\u2019s Constitution as the way forward. Mr. Tohti has long advocated not independence but genuine autonomy for Xinjiang, under Chinese rule, similar in spirit to what the Dalai Lama has been urging for Tibetans. \u201cThe Constitution has laid out a sound framework for all ethnic groups to live and thrive together,\u201d Mr. Tohti wrote on a website dedicated to Uighur issues. Under the Constitution \u201can ideal balance between national unity and minorities\u2019 autonomy is possible.\u201dUnfortunately, seeing how the Dalai Lama has failed after nearly three decades of trying, many of Mr. Tohti\u2019s fellow Uighurs have rejected his bridge-building as a quixotic quest. And with Mr. Tohti\u2019s arrest this January, on charges of inciting separatism, the bridges are being burned \u2014 both by the oppressors and by the oppressed. For years, Beijing has characterized Uighur protests as the work of a few pesky separatists, as if the Uighurs\u2019 desire for self-rule was not a serious concern. But more than ever, Uighurs see separation from China as the solution. And many are looking beyond Chinese borders, toward militant Muslims overseas, for inspiration. Backed into a corner by Beijing\u2019s relentlessly antagonizing tactics, the Uighurs are likely to resort to more deadly terrorism. Xinjiang is poised to become China\u2019s Chechnya.Advertisement"}

Putin of Russia last Sunday.The minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and Mrs. Merkel are probably the two Western leaders who have had the most contact with their Russian counterparts over Ukraine since its crisis escalated after former President Viktor F. Yanukovych fled to Russia three weeks ago.Thousands of well-armed, uniformed men assumed by their equipment and speech to be Russian troops surfaced in Crimea days later, later working with what were described as volunteer militias, or self-defense forces.Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, an American who is the supreme commander of Allied Forces in Europe, told a gathering in Brussels on Sunday that there was little doubt Russia was deeply involved in the swift, successful operation to take over Crimea.Military observers working under decades-old accords to allow the O.S.C.E. to monitor conditions in member states have been in Ukraine throughout the recent crisis, but were prevented three times from entering Crimea.The O.S.C.E. \u2014 which includes the United States, Canada, all Europe and former Soviet republics in Central Asia \u2014 grew out of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, a Soviet-era accord that spurred monitoring of East bloc human rights.Mr. Steinmeier told German reporters afterward that he wanted to see whether influential Ukrainians supported recent changes in their country, and indicated that Mr. Akhmetov, one of a handful who grew enormously wealthy in the corrupt privatization of Ukraine\u2019s post-Soviet economy, had done so.Ukraine\u2019s economy is estimated to need at least 1 billion euros, or about $1.38 billion, in direct emergency aid to stave off bankruptcy and loans of perhaps \u20ac11 billion via various European institutions to stay afloat this year.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s no longer enough for chefs to cook hot food that makes us happy; they are supposed to dumbfound us with flavors the human tongue has never tasted. This is why writers like me devote energy to, for example, puzzling postmodern taquerias while taking for granted the simple excellence of traditional ones. The change in restaurant culture is something like the shift that overtook popular music after the Beatles. Singing old Cole Porter tunes was out; suddenly every kid with a guitar and an amplifier was supposed to have the songwriting chops of Lennon and McCartney combined.R\u00f4tisserie Georgette isn\u2019t writing any new music. The kitchen, now under Chad Brauze, plays standards from the French songbook and plays them well, with what a colleague who has eaten high and low around the city calls \u201ca refreshing lack of creativity.\u201d If this restaurant had a clock, its hands would be stopped at five minutes before nouvelle cuisine, when meat was carved to cover the plate and sauce came on the side and nobody turned down potatoes, when people eating a roast with a good but not-too-expensive Bordeaux could hardly imagine a better night out.

There is one Georgette. Her last name is Farkas. A coiled spring of proprietary energy, Ms. Farkas started cooking in restaurants at 15, attended hotel school in Switzerland and interned with Alain Ducasse in Monte Carlo. She was on her way to running a restaurant of her own when Daniel Boulud offered her a job. After she said yes, she learned that she would be handling marketing and public relations. That little gig lasted 17 years, which may be one reason that R\u00f4tisserie Georgette seemed to have traveled from another decade when it landed on East 60th Street last November. The loft-height walls are hung with a cluster of antique mirrors, an Aubusson tapestry and bronze Louis XV-style sconces. Carpeting helps muffle the noise, which tends to wane around 9 p.m. This is an early-to-bed crowd, and with an 8:15 reservation one night I was the last to leave. At one end of the room is a porter\u2019s chair, its egg-shaped back upholstered in leather. Now I know where to seat the dowager countess when she comes to visit.In some ways R\u00f4tisserie Georgette is a delayed-gratification version of the restaurants opened in the \u201970s and \u201980s by young Americans who fell for European ways of dining. What set Ms. Farkas\u2019s heartstrings humming were the rotisseries of France. R\u00f4tisserie Georgette will sell you half a chicken for $24 or a whole one, which feeds two people for $36 each. The economy model, raised on an Amish farm in Indiana, is rubbed with herbes de Provence and cracked coriander seeds. Roasted chickens don\u2019t always pick up the flavor of the herbs they\u2019re stuffed with. These birds do. The legs are tender without disintegrating into strands, as rotisserie dark meat can do. The white meat is close to ideal, with just a whisker of dryness at the narrow tips.The pricier chicken is called the poule de luxe, French slang for a woman with high upkeep costs. It is brought up in Pennsylvania under Mennonite supervision, hides a terrific mushroom stuffing under its skin, and features a slab of seared foie gras that is both unsatisfying and beside the point. Too bad you can\u2019t get the stuffing without paying for the liver, but I\u2019m sure if I were French I\u2019d understand that this is always the way with a poule de luxe.There is nothing fancy about the quail, just juicy meat wrapped around a pale-pink poultry forcemeat seasoned with paprika and piquillo peppers. The dorade, roasted whole and then filleted, breaks into beautiful white lemon-scented chunks. A special one night was rotisserie duck \u00e0 l\u2019orange, carved and arranged on a silver platter. Mr. Brauze had defied the modern rule of duck cookery, taking the breast all the way to medium. He knew what he was doing, because medium-rare meat wouldn\u2019t have taken as well to the bittersweet orange-peel sauce. Only once was I served meat that didn\u2019t come off the spit at the ideal moment: a crumbly, dried-out lamb shoulder with a merguez stuffing that tasted as if it had been left out in the rain.With any main course, the fat-basted rotisserie potatoes are almost required, although the frites, fried to a mahogany crisp, will also do. But a strict meat-and-potatoes diet can be supplemented by creamed spinach with garam masala, tiny and fiery-hot brussels sprouts and purple cabbage stewed with cider and bacon. I\u2019d be surprised if the vegetables at Ms. Farkas\u2019s long-ago French rotisseries were worth noticing, but these are. Ms. Farkas put her first initial on the better of two salads, the salade G, with a time-tested mix of endive, pears, blue cheese, bacon and candied walnuts. There is also a salade Francine. If I were Francine, I\u2019d be on the phone with my agent trying to get my name taken off it.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableEmail: petewells@nytimes.com.

{"Headline": "Mouths to Feed", "Date": "2014-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe story goes that when Andr\u00e9 Breton visited Mexico in 1938, he was struck by the beautiful handicrafts and asked an artisan to make him a chair. Breton sketched a design in crude perspective, with a fourth leg hidden by the square of the seat. The artisan built a splendid chair, with only three legs. Breton proclaimed Mexico \u201cthe most surrealist country in the world.\u201d Salvador Dal\u00ed supposedly agreed and swore he would never return to a country more surrealist than his paintings. When a spaceship appears at the climactic moment of Juan Pablo Villalobos\u2019s new novel, \u201cQuesadillas,\u201d the narrator dismisses his father\u2019s disbelief: \u201cWeren\u2019t fantastic, wonderful things meant to happen to us all the time? Didn\u2019t we speak to the dead? Wasn\u2019t everyone always saying we were a surrealist country?\u201d Villalobos mines Mexico for its everyday surrealism, even as he mocks how outsiders exoticize his country. Thus far the wonderful things that have happened to the 13-year-old boy, named Orestes by his schoolteacher father, are beatings, eviction and general exploitation. Mexico isn\u2019t that magical after all.Villalobos\u2019s first novel, \u201cDown the Rabbit Hole,\u201d a finalist for the Guardian First Book Award, made the horrible homely. It featured a precocious little boy who grows up in a concrete palace ringed with barbed wire and alarms. He learns from his father, a drug baron, that \u201cthere are actually lots of ways of making corpses, but the most common ones are with orifices.\u201d In \u201cQuesadillas,\u201d the humor is less black, broader, more uproarious. This time the homely \u2014 the poverty and bad luck \u2014 is fantastical. This is realism mixed with absurdism. When a rich Polish family moves in next door, Orestes is disappointed by their normalcy: \u201cI had supposed that rich people\u2019s days were devoted to surprise, to experiencing continually the euphoria of discoveries, the frisson of first times, the optimism of new beginnings. I hadn\u2019t imagined the force of attraction imposed by the need to feel safe: a second law of gravity, the power of inertia calling its children to the warm bosom of boredom.\u201d While the neighbors\u2019 son plays video games all day, Orestes runs away from home in pursuit of two of his younger siblings, who disappeared amid the chaos of protests against the national government.During his fruitless search, he proves an adept hustler, but he\u2019s disappointed to find that the rest of Mexico is just like home. Villalobos leaves no doubt as to whom he considers responsible for creating a country full of people \u201cconstantly trying to screw you over.\u201d The author\u2019s notes include a section titled \u201cMexico\u2019s National Team of the Worst PRI-ist Presidents in History,\u201d PRI being the acronym of Mexico\u2019s dominant political party. (It stands for Institutional Revolutionary Party. Villalobos: \u201cNo joke.\u201d) Still, the local rebellion, a replay of the Cristero uprising, seems as futile as Orestes\u2019s flight from home. After a while, the Greek tragedy gag becomes tiresome, but Orestes does have some excellent adventures.When our unrepentant hero returns home it\u2019s only because \u201cthe class struggle had worn me out and I wanted to eat quesadillas for free.\u201d He has discovered that there are people far poorer than he \u2014 the local rebels for example. His father explains their motivation: \u201cThese poor people want to die and they don\u2019t know how. They\u2019re trying to die of hunger but it takes ages \u2014 that\u2019s why they like war so much.\u201d Maybe the only way to justice on earth is through extraterrestrial intervention. The novel has a better title in Spanish: \u201cIf We Lived in a Normal Place.\u201d Does such a place exist?

The sweaters were for his daughters. The cash was for his political allies.In a whirlwind visit, Mr. Obama headlined two big-dollar fund-raisers for Democrats at the Manhattan homes of two prominent investors, Hamilton E. James, the president of the Blackstone Group, and Alan Patricof, managing director of Greycroft Partners.But before hanging out with his wealthy supporters, the president made a photo-friendly stop at a Gap store at Third Avenue and 42nd Street for a little shopping and a political point.

{"Headline": "Dependence on Russia Is Likely to Leave Region\u2019s Economy in a Precarious State", "Date": "2014-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYALTA, Crimea \u2014 Many A.T.M.s in this sun-dappled seaside resort city in Crimea, and across the region, have been empty in recent days, with little white \u201ctransaction denied\u201d slips piling up around them. Banks that do have cash have been imposing severe restrictions on withdrawals.All flights, other than those to or from Moscow, remain canceled in what could become the norm if the dispute over Crimea\u2019s political status drags on, a chilling prospect just a month before tourist season begins in a place beloved as a vacation playground since czarist times.In January, the Crimean Parliament adopted a 2014 budget of about $540 million, of which about $300 million was expected to come from the central government in Kiev. Crimean officials in recent days have said they now expect Moscow to fill the gap.The potentially large price tag has arisen at a time when Russia itself is bracing for a severe economic slowdown, making annexation a far more complicated calculation for Mr. Putin and his advisers despite huge public support for reclaiming primacy over Crimea.Crimea and Russia have deep linguistic, historic and cultural ties, and the peninsula holds a nostalgic place in the minds of many Russians as a summer destination and popular retirement spot, where czars and Politburo chairmen kept vacation homes \u2014 including the last Soviet president, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who was briefly exiled to his dacha in the Crimean town of Foros, overlooking the Black Sea, during a coup attempt in 1991.Russia\u2019s regional development minister, Igor N. Slyunayev, has offered a sobering assessment of the peninsula\u2019s infrastructure needs.\u201cThe peninsula is not self-sufficient when it comes to the entire group of vitally important resources \u2014 first of all, electricity and water,\u201d Mr. Slyunayev said in a question-and-answer interview with the Russian newspaper Kommersant. \u201cAbout 80 percent of water comes to its territory through the northern Crimean canal from the Dnieper River. Also, 80 percent of Crimea depends on imports of electricity.\u201dIn a bleak bottom-line assessment that many residents here would dispute, Mr. Slyunayev said, \u201cToday, our Crimea looks no better than Palestine.\u201dThe authorities here have waved aside concerns about public salaries, pensions and other costs, saying Moscow will cover them. But while Mr. Putin and Russian lawmakers have made reassuring statements, including some promises of more than $1 billion in immediate aid, there are no guarantees.Russia is facing its own fiscal challenges in the months and years ahead, as revenue growth from oil and natural gas is projected to slow precipitously and the Kremlin confronts big bills from salary increases for the police, the military and other public workers that preceded Mr. Putin\u2019s return to the presidency in 2012.The financial costs are just one reason that annexation is easier said than done.Fully absorbing Crimea is a potentially herculean undertaking, which would require issuing new passports, changing the currency to rubles from Ukrainian hryvnias, and integrating completely distinct systems for property records, taxes, legal disputes and more.The process is also fraught with risks, including the possibility that the Ukrainian government could move to further isolate the geographically remote peninsula by shutting vital transportation lines.There is no overland transportation link between Russia and Crimea, and building a bridge across the shortest waterway, near the Crimean city of Kerch, would take years and cost an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion.The costs for Russia \u2014 and for Crimeans \u2014 could also rise sharply, experts said, if political instability disrupts the peninsula\u2019s major industries, particularly tourism and banking, which are already suffering.A.T.M.'s have been empty as banks, most based in mainland Ukraine, face obstacles delivering currency, and grapple with mounting concerns about long-term business risks. If world leaders refuse to recognize Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, flights could be restricted for years, as they are in northern Cyprus, which has direct air links only with Turkey.At a minimum, Kiev\u2019s strong leverage over utilities and other vital services stands to force the Kremlin into negotiations with the new Ukrainian leaders whom Mr. Putin has denounced as illegitimate and has so far refused to meet.Last week, in a meeting with the country\u2019s top economic officials, including the ministers of finance and economics and the head of the central bank, Mr. Putin expressed his own concerns about Russia\u2019s financial prospects.\u201cLet me say that the current and forecast growth rates the government has given cannot satisfy us in any way,\u201d he said, according to a Kremlin transcript. \u201cWe must step up the pace of development.\u201cAbove all, we need to maintain the existing general macroeconomic stability,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cWe need to be ready to respond rapidly to both internal and external risks \u2014 and they are not getting any fewer \u2014 ensure that the budgets at all levels are executed and keep inflation at an acceptably low level.\u201dMr. Slyunayev, the regional development minister, said he believed that the government in Kiev would be reasonable and not cut off essential services but might begin charging for water and electric service. \u201cUkrainian authorities will not provoke a humanitarian crisis,\u201d he told Kommersant.While financial markets reacted with tentative calm to the Crimean secession vote, the economic sanctions announced by the United States and Europe, and the prospect of a renewed cold war with the West, present just the type of external risk that could destabilize the Russian economy at a moment of vulnerability, experts said.One immediate risk is a continued decline in foreign investment, though the fear of sanctions may result in a positive effect for Russia by driving home assets that Russian citizens and businesses had stockpiled overseas.\u201cPrivate sector capital flight may have been partially neutralized by the return of official assets,\u201d Timothy Ash, an analyst with Standard Bank, wrote in a note to clients on Monday offering analysis in the aftermath of the referendum here.Some Crimeans said they were already feeling the financial sting from political instability.As crowds in the cities of Simferopol and Sevastopol held raucous celebrations well into Monday morning after the vote, here in Yalta, Ihor B., the owner of a small travel business, went to bed with a growing sense of dread: The roughly two dozen bookings that he had received since the start of the year had all disappeared.\u201cI got 10 requests from Germany, and 10 assignments from Ukrainian agencies for Western tourists; a couple of requests from Dutch tourists and cruise ships,\u201d said Mr. B, who asked that his last name not be used for fear of reprisal by the new Russian government. \u201cAt the moment, all of them, absolutely all of them, are canceled.\u201dMr. B., whose two grown children live and work in Kiev, said the majority of tourists who visited Crimea came from mainland Ukraine. They are likely to go to Odessa or other destinations this year, because of fear over the political unrest, he said.Boris Perederko, the deputy director of the Bristol Hotel here, said he supported the outcome of the referendum, even though guest bookings were down.\u201cThis year will be a very complicated, very unclear year,\u201d Mr. Perederko said. \u201cA revolution has happened, figuratively speaking.\u201dAs for Crimea\u2019s future as a resort destination, he said: \u201cPeople come here to spend their money and we try to earn this money. That\u2019s normal. Now, it is just a moment of high suspicion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Agent in His Labyrinth", "Date": "2014-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The dream flickered briefly after the end of the Cold War: a shared space from Lisbon to Vladivostok, Russia gathered into a close association with NATO, or even becoming an alliance member, and the European Union working in cooperation with Moscow on the modernization of the country.It was a nice idea, like the end of history, and as with many nice ideas, it did not come to pass.Vladimir Putin, a former K.G.B. agent obsessed with the loss of the Soviet imperium, had a different idea: to define himself and the motherland against the West by casting it as promiscuous and devious, a power lacking true virility and cloaking its interests in empty talk of human rights, advancing to the very gates of Russia through deception and intrigue.The Russian president\u2019s vision of a revived imperium developed around four pillars. The first was military (the liquidation of Grozny, Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia, and now the drive to annex Crimea). The second was political (drawing the countries of the former Soviet Union into an autocratic Eurasian Union). The third was economic (Russian gas as a tool of coercion and oligarchs\u2019 money as suasion from Berlin\u2019s Kurf\u00fcrstendamm to London\u2019s Knightsbridge). The fourth was cultural (a heady blend of Orthodoxy and autocracy as expressions of Russian purity and strength against the nihilistic decadence of Europe and the United States).The culmination of this process sees Putin the bare-chested muscleman of the Siberian outback pitted against America\u2019s languid leg-crossing law professor and the pastor\u2019s methodical daughter in Berlin. Neither of these leaders of the West (whose feelings for each other are cool) will utter of Crimea those four resonant words: \u201cThis will not stand.\u201dPutin notices this unuttered sentence. He notes the flaccid body language in the White House, the post-modern man\u2019s teleprompter, the bloodlessness of the liberal realism emanating from the Oval Office. He hears the Kremlin phone ring and mutters, no, not Angela again, with her reasonable pleas. Germany, unified by America but nullified by it too, was far better when there were two of them.He has heard the lectures, the veiled and not-so-veiled threats, the expressions of outrage. Let them squeal! He is not going to let that loser of an ousted Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych, lose him Crimea to the \u201cNazis\u201d and pederasts of Kiev, or the oily Beltway-to-Berlin human rights agents, those peddlers of false promises and color revolutions.Putin laughs at the theory that the West lost the Lisbon-to-Vladivostok dream and turned him into the conspiracy-spouting strongman he is through its provocative failure to reach out to Russia after the fall of the Berlin Wall, its decision to expand NATO eastward into the Baltic states, its enlargement of the European Union, and its general lack of solicitous regard toward Moscow.No, he was always this way, schooled in Russia\u2019s particular greatness and vastness, its immense sacrifice in the Great Patriotic War, its pursuit of power through ideology. And power, as America knows, must be defined against something or it becomes uninteresting and unpersuasive. The mistake was Russia\u2019s, not the West\u2019s. How could it have stood by while NATO locked in the security and Westward-looking stability of the Soviet empire\u2019s former dominions, from Estonia to Poland, from Latvia to Romania? As a man dedicated to the projection of power, he had to admire the temerity and brilliance of this post-Cold-War American advance.But America had grown weaker since then. Its wars did not get won. Its red lines did not count for much. Its doctrine was indistinct, an endless series of improvisations whose bottom line was no more shooting wars. All it threatened was visa bans! Weakness was an attitude against which Russia had roused itself. First stop Simferopol, next stop Donetsk!Putin knows Germany and the United States need him for Iran, need him for Syria, need him for Russia\u2019s energy. He has them where he wants them.Or Putin thinks so most of the time. But what was it Angela Merkel was saying in her fifth phone call about Russia\u2019s self-isolation? How dare she suggest he had reached a point where black was white, day was night, and two plus two was five!What was she parroting about Russia\u2019s dependence on European trade? What was that talk of testing the resilience of the Russian economy if he did not step back from the illegal seizure of Crimea and unacceptable threats to east Ukraine? Were the Chinese really unhappy that Crimea could give Taiwan ideas? Did some people honestly think Simferopol was the desperate gambit of a Russian president who had lost Kiev and Ukraine?Every now and again, in the gilded mirrors of the Kremlin, Putin glimpses his reflection and struggles to avert his eyes: a small man with six-pack abs, eyes cold and pale as a glacier, and a maniacal grin. The agent in his labyrinth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuba Moves to Attract More Foreign Investment", "Date": "2014-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAVANA \u2014 Cuban lawmakers approved a law on Saturday intended to make Cuba more attractive to foreign investors, a measure seen as vital for the island\u2019s struggling economy.Meeting in an extraordinary session, Parliament replaced a 1995 foreign investment law that has lured less overseas capital than the island\u2019s Communist leaders had hoped.The foreign media were not given access to the closed-door meeting, but some details of the new law emerged in official news media in recent days.The law would cut taxes on profits by about half, to 15 percent, and make companies exempt from paying taxes for the first eight years of operation.Companies that exploit natural resources, however, could pay taxes as high as 50 percent.Investment projects wholly financed by foreign capital would be allowed in all sectors except health care and education, which is essentially unheard-of today.Many foreigners doing business with the country would be exempt from paying personal income tax. Cuba\u2019s gross domestic product expanded 2.7 percent last year, below targets and weak for a developing nation.

{"Headline": "Crimea, a Pyrrhic Victory?", "Date": "2014-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 However the Ukraine crisis ends, it is now clear that Russia is not the partner America has expected. Both countries have crossed a Rubicon, and there is no going back. So the United States needs a new game plan for managing Russia.After the Soviet Union collapsed, America was charitable; to compensate the Kremlin for its loss of superpower status, we ignored its foibles and gave it an outsize role on the world stage. When the United States met resistance to plans for its war in Iraq in 2003, Condoleezza Rice counseled: \u201cPunish France, ignore Germany, forgive Russia.\u201d But after Russia\u2019s grab for Crimea, America is done forgiving. This is not the start of a new Cold War, but Americans now know they will contend with a troublesome Russia over the coming years \u2014 one that fears American encroachment on its turf in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia, and is confident that it can defy the West. President Vladimir V. Putin may well have overplayed his hand, however. If he gets his way in Ukraine, as he seems to expect, that would be a Pyrrhic victory; America has the upper hand in the broader competition for power and influence that will follow. However much Russian ambition profited from American inattention as tension in Ukraine built, the Kremlin will not do as well when it faces American competition. America\u2019s immediate concern now must be to contain the crisis; its current mix of diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions, combined with its strong support for the government in Kiev, is a good start. But to change Mr. Putin\u2019s strategic calculus, America must expose his hubris and convince him of the high cost to Russia of his foreign policy.First, we must counter his overconfidence in the growing dependence of Europe and Asia on Russia\u2019s vast energy reserves. Europe has invested its future in natural gas, which Russia alone can provide at prices and quantities that can keep European economies competitive. But the United States can rewrite its laws to allow energy exports and invest in liquefied natural gas terminals for ships carrying the fuel to Europe. America\u2019s gas would be more expensive than Russia\u2019s, but the mere fact of an alternative would sap Russia\u2019s leverage to blackmail Europe with threats of price rises or cutoffs.After Russia, Iran has the world\u2019s second-largest gas reserves, and it, too, might compete with Russia to supply Europe and Asia. Mr. Putin understands this; in 2007, he went to Iran offering to temper the international pressures on that country, to give Iran an incentive to shun two proposed pipeline projects pointing toward Europe. Russia has since offered financial support for pipelines to Armenia and Pakistan, as an alternative. The last thing Mr. Putin wants for Iran is an end to its isolation from the Western economies.Indeed, an Iran in conflict with the West has been a strategic godsend to him. So long as Iran\u2019s rich gas reserves remain off limits to Europe, Russia can hold the Continent hostage. Meanwhile, he can barter with the West for concessions to Russia\u2019s own interests, in exchange for his collaboration on matters like Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The West has to change that equation, and use Iran to its advantage instead. The merest hint that Iranian gas might soon flow to Europe and Asia would begin to do that. And if nuclear talks succeeded in bringing Iran fully back into the global economy, Russia\u2019s hold on Europe would be a thing of the past.The United States has never recognized Russia\u2019s claim to its \u201cnear abroad\u201d; since the 1990s, Washington has encouraged the European Union and NATO to move east. Washington should now apply that principle to the Caucasus and Central Asia and seek closer partnerships there. Russia will resist, as it did in Georgia in 2008, but it would do so at a growing cost, especially if it no longer had Iran as a partner. In addition, Russia\u2019s problems with Muslim societies are bigger than the West\u2019s. Some of its restless Muslim regions are turning to extremism; that is why Russia has always looked at the Arab Spring with suspicion, fearing that successful Arab rebellions would inspire Islamic risings in Russia. From the start, Russia saw the Syrian uprising as a black-and-white choice between the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and a takeover by Sunni Islamic extremists, and put its bets on Mr. Assad\u2019s butchery. That has won it few other friends in the Middle East, but until now, American acceptance of Russia as a partner has protected it from much damage to its relationships in the region. America must free its Syria policy from the drag of its Russian anchor. The deal brokered by Moscow to destroy Syria\u2019s chemical weapons was an achievement, but it came at the cost of legitimating Russia\u2019s position on Syria. In reality, Russia has been no help in finding a political solution that would end the killing there. It has no intention of pushing Mr. Assad into a deal. And after Ukraine, it should come as no surprise if Syria starts to backtrack on its chemical weapons promises. The United States should declare an end to its partnership with Russia on Syria, escalate diplomatic and military pressure on Mr. Assad and seek a diplomatic solution on its own. There is precedent for doing without Russia; NATO did so in Kosovo.For too long, America has played down its difficulties with Russia. But Russia now poses a clear and present strategic challenge to the United States that is at least on par with any from Iran or China.

With 99 percent of the vote counted, Serbia\u2019s election commission said Monday that Mr. Vucic\u2019s center-right Progressive Party had won 48 percent, with 13.5 percent for its current coalition partner, the Socialist Party, which came in second.Mr. Vucic, 44, once a close ally of the Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic, has attained wide popularity as the country\u2019s first deputy prime minister by waging a battle against corruption and lawlessness, and advocating strong ties with Europe and the United States.More than two decades after politicians across the Balkans stoked a virulent nationalism that boiled over into war, countries from Bosnia to Serbia to Kosovo have abandoned the nationalism of the past and are jockeying to integrate with Europe.Mr. Vucic has promised to continue to press for membership in the European Union, overhaul Serbia\u2019s pension system and labor market, tackle its large debt, and improve the quality of life of Serbs, who have faced a weak economy and are becoming impatient as their country languishes on the margins of Europe.Even in a region where former archnationalists and guerrilla fighters have sought to recast themselves, Mr. Vucic\u2019s transformation from staunch Milosevic ally to ardent proponent of the West is viewed as remarkable. Yet some critics say it is a move born of pragmatism rather than conviction and have warned that Mr. Vucic is determined to centralize power.Ljiljana Smajlovic, the editor in chief of Politika, a leading Serbian newspaper, said Mr. Vucic\u2019s spectacular rise had caused some concern in Serbia that he could become intoxicated with power and revert to the ways of the past. But she said she believed that his political transformation was credible, and that he would not deviate from a pro-Western path. \u201cHis power is for real, and this gives some people pause that the new soft-spoken Vucic will revert to the old ways,\u201d she said by phone from Belgrade.Later, he became a leading light in the Serbian Radical Party, an anti-Western, ultranationalist party that celebrated indicted war criminals and was led by the fiery Vojislav Seselj, who turned himself over to the tribunal in The Hague in February 2003 to face war crime charges.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Growth in the Fourth Quarter Is Revised Up a Shade, to 2.6% ", "Date": "2014-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe previous estimate for the months of October, November and December, reported in late February, was 2.4 percent. Thursday\u2019s slight upward adjustment was in line with expectations among economists on Wall Street. The pace in the third quarter was 4.1 percent.Still, the 3.3 percent increase in personal consumption expenditures last quarter was the healthiest showing since the fourth quarter of 2010, when consumption rose 4.3 percent.It also came despite wintry weather in many parts of the country during the final weeks of the holiday shopping season, which prompted some economists to conclude that underlying consumer behavior was somewhat more robust than recent data had suggested.\u201cThe number for gross domestic product is good,\u201d said Lawrence Creatura, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in Rochester, N.Y. \u201cIt is not the exciting number that is typical of postrecession recoveries, but it is good enough. This has been a stumbling sort of recovery all along, and this number is a continuation of that pattern.\u201dOne part of the economy that has grown over all in recent years, the housing sector, seems to be slowing markedly.The drop, showing demand for previously owned homes rather than new construction, reflects the impact of cold weather as well as the rise in interest rates since the spring of 2013.As the Federal Reserve gradually eases up on its stimulus efforts and reduces the pace of its monthly bond purchases, 10-year note yields have crept up, pushing up rates for most mortgages. Housing was crushed in the recession of 2007 to 2009, but has rebounded in many parts of the country more recently. One headwind for the economy in the first half of 2014, at least in terms of the picture provided by coming economic data, will be from the aftereffects of the big inventory gains recorded by businesses in the third quarter of 2013.Unless demand turns out to be stronger than expected, those stockpiles will be drawn down gradually, reducing the rate of reported growth now.On the other hand, some experts believe that consumer activity has been inhibited by the cold so far in 2014, so some catching-up might help growth as shoppers venture out again in April, May and June.The sharp drop in federal spending, which shaved a full percentage point off growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 amid the government shutdown in the fall and the automatic budget cuts imposed by Congress, should also moderate in 2014 because of a budget deal reached on Capitol Hill in January.That budget agreement also provides a bit more certainty for businesses in terms of what Washington will be laying out, something that has been lacking over the past few years because of repeated standoffs over government spending and the federal borrowing limit.Economists had been expecting a slight increase in initial claims, so that figure represented a potential bright spot for the labor market.The four-week moving average for unemployment claims, which tends to be a bit more reliable than the more volatile week-to-week numbers, fell to 318,000, also an improvement from previous weeks and the healthiest rate in six months.For the quarter, many economists predict the economy will expand at an annual rate of 1 to 2 percent.Corporate profits rose by 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter, but for the year were up 4.6 percent, which suggested companies continued to improve profits at a slightly faster rate than overall economic growth, thanks in part to efficiency gains. While the stock market and corporate profits have been healthy in recent years, those gains have not translated into the kind of hiring experienced in previous recoveries.With the arrival of spring and better weather, the thinking goes, the economy\u2019s momentum could pick up slightly. One indicator of what lies ahead will come next week, when the Labor Department reports figures for job creation and the unemployment rate in March.Job creation was anemic in December and January, and came in well below expectations, but picked up a bit in February.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Euro Zone Inflation Stays Low; Joblessness Remains High", "Date": "2014-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Inflation in the euro zone remained stuck at a very low level in February, while the jobless rate was unchanged in January, official reports showed on Friday, providing the European Central Bank with crucial data before its monetary policy meeting next week.The central bank is concerned that, with unemployment depressing demand, extremely low inflation could ultimately bring on a debt spiral that hurts borrowers and already-weak banks. Whether the latest data will prompt any action by the central bank is hard to predict.On Thursday, at an international meeting of central bankers in Frankfurt, the central bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, was sticking to his script of recent weeks, which so far has resulted in the bank\u2019s taking no new action to stimulate the euro zone economy. \u201cOverall, we see the euro area\u2019s economic recovery gradually taking hold, albeit at a slow and uneven pace,\u201d Mr. Draghi said in a speech.Mr. Draghi expressed concern about the low level of prices, but added, \u201cWe are clearly not in deflation,\u201d a condition he defined as \u201ca self-reinforcing fall in prices that is broad-based across items and across countries.\u201dThe numbers contrast with the United States\u2019 jobless rate of 6.6 percent in January. But questions remain about the strength of the American recovery.Revised data released on Friday in Washington indicated that the economy in the United States grew at a slower pace in the fourth quarter of 2013 than first thought, weighed down by disappointing retail sales, inventory adjustments and a less robust trade balance.The Commerce Department now estimates that the American economy grew 2.4 percent in October, November and December, down from an initial estimate of 3.2 percent released in late January. At 2.4 percent, the revised figure represents a substantial slowing from the pace of growth in the third quarter, which was 4.1 percent.Most experts predict that the American economy will continue to expand at a lackluster pace in the first several months of 2014, with growth picking up over the remainder of the year. Economists are looking for growth of about 2 percent in the first quarter.While the European headline numbers were largely in line with market expectations, investors read the small increase in the core inflation rate as making it less likely that the European Central Bank would take policy action when it meets next week, and the euro jumped 0.6 percent to its highest level of the year, at $1.3802.The euro rose against the dollar, reflecting diminishing expectations of a rate cut by the central bank next week. The Federal Reserve is holding its own benchmark, the federal funds rate, at a record low near zero. With the European bank\u2019s key rate at 0.25 percent, money managers have an incentive to park funds in short-term euro securities to eke out a small premium over what they would get in dollar investments.That growth is too weak to make much of a dent in the region\u2019s record joblessness, however, and Mr. Rehn said that he expected the euro zone jobless rate to fall only to 11.7 percent by next year. Eurostat said on Friday that 26.2 million people across Europe are currently classified as unemployed, including more than 5.5 million young people.The jobless rate varies widely between countries. Austria, at 4.9 percent, and Germany, at 5 percent, are the lowest in the European Union. But Spain, at 25.8 percent, and Greece, at 28 percent in December (the latest data available), are both experiencing depression-level unemployment.In Italy, where the new government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is grappling with political turmoil and a stagnant economy, the jobless rate rose to 12.9 percent, the highest in decades, from 12.7 percent in December.Rolf Campos, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Navarra, Spain, said the rebound in core prices might reassure the central bank, making it feel \u201cless pressed to do something to prevent undershooting\u201d its target of keeping prices rising at a level of just under 2 percent.The concerns over deflation may be overstated, he added, as \u201clow inflation rates are actually showing that the healing process has begun in the European periphery.\u201dJ\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, predicted before the data was released that the European Central Bank would cut its main interest rate target, currently at a record low of 0.25 percent, when it meets next week.But the inflation report \u201cweakens the position of the doves in the E.C.B. governing council,\u201d he said after the Eurostat report. \u201cThe decision on interest rates on Thursday is therefore quite open.\u201dCentral bank officials may decide to find another way to provide monetary stimulus, he said, perhaps by using technical measures to increase the money supply, while allowing the central bank to hold the interest rate weapon in reserve.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the consumer price data from the euro zone released on Friday. Prices rose at an annualized rate of 0.8 percent, not 0.8 percent for the month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Walls Are Closing In", "Date": "2014-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFiction depicting the lives of working-\u00adclass Americans has a long tradition. Its practitioners \u2014 John Steinbeck, Raymond Carver, Tillie Olsen and Stewart O\u2019Nan, to name a few \u2014 aim for a frank portrayal of men and women whose freedom is limited by economic and social realities, and whose American dream is elusive at best. These works often bypass overt lyricism in favor of unadorned prose, to create a kind of literary cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9.But just as there is no objective truth when a camera is turned on a subject, so too is literary realism a tricky practice. Some novels are so wedded to a blunt rendition of reality that they seem, paradoxically, less real than life, which after all is studded with moments of poetry and metaphoric resonance. The challenge for the writer of social realism is to enlist the plastic qualities of fiction to produce something lifelike, in which artifice creates the shimmer of recognition.In his fourth novel, \u201cThe Free,\u201d Willy Vlautin demonstrates an impressive ability to navigate this challenge. Seamlessly structured like a fugue \u2014 Vlautin is an alt-country singer and songwriter as well as a novelist \u2014 \u201cThe Free\u201d tells the story of hard-luck characters whose worlds collide when a brain-damaged Iraq war veteran tries to kill himself. He winds up in the hospital instead, under the steadfast attention of a nurse with troubles of her own. (Among other things, she takes care of her mentally ill father despite his constant abuse.) Vlautin also introduces the night manager at the group home where the veteran lives, and a young runaway named Jo. Each is engaged in a quiet struggle against daunting but everyday odds: the human costs of war, the inequities of health care, the crush of debt, the subtle ravages of loneliness. When Jo arrives at the same hospital as the veteran, with an infection resulting from drug use, the nurse becomes emotionally invested in her predicament. Meanwhile, the night manager stops by to visit his unconscious resident, and we learn his life is no easier: His ex-wife has taken their children while he works two jobs to meet medical bills and keep a family home. (Vlautin may be an alt-country musician, but as a novelist he can be pure country.)These characters face their burdens with unwavering dignity, and Vlautin\u2019s affection for them is evident at every turn. With straightforward economy, he draws us into their seemingly intractable problems, revealing their persistence and decency. In the novel\u2019s one surreal gesture, Vlautin dramatizes the veteran\u2019s dystopian nightmares, about a militarized world where a vigilante group called the Free brutalizes and murders citizens who do not serve. For the most part, Vlautin\u2019s unadorned narrative is affecting; these unassuming characters bore into us in surprising ways. When Jo insists she will remain with her addict friends because \u201cthey\u2019re the only people I know,\u201d her plain truth is a harrowing reminder of all the ways in which people become trapped. At times, however, Vlautin\u2019s refusal to let the characters react with anything but plain-spoken equanimity begins to feel like idealism, and it has the effect of flattening the narrative. Interestingly, the veteran\u2019s bizarre nightmares \u2014 and our understanding of what they convey about the dark heart of society \u2014 do as much to suggest the reality Vlautin has set out to capture.

{"Headline": "Surge in Stocks Helps Norway Oil Fund\u2019s Profit Soar", "Date": "2014-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNorway\u2019s giant oil fund said on Friday that it earned 15.9 percent, or about $115 billion, on its investments last year, profiting from big bets on American and European stocks that offset losses in government bonds from around the world.While that was a somewhat modest return in a year when many stock indexes reached records, it raised the holdings of the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund to a value of about $840 billion. As the fund grows in stature and potential clout, it is under political pressure to exercise its power in new ways, while financial analysts around the world closely follow its activities.Some other large government funds in oil-rich countries, like the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Kuwait Investment Authority, disclose little about their investments. But because the Norwegian fund reports its activities in detail, it is closely watched \u201cas one of the large pools of capital in the global economy,\u201d said Rachel Ziemba, an analyst on oil producers at Roubini Global Economics in London.And while the Norwegian fund has been a largely passive investor so far, mainly holding small-percentage stakes in more than 8,000 companies around the world, it is under pressure to start taking a more activist role \u2014 whether to invest in climate-friendly sectors, as Norwegian environmental groups are insisting upon, or to diversify more aggressively into other types of investments, like airports and real estate, as the conservative-led government would like.So far, the fund\u2019s activism mainly takes the form of declining to invest in some companies, based on recommendations from an ethics committee. The forbidden entities include tobacco companies like Philip Morris, and weapons makers like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. \u201cThey are already an activist investor and might get a bit more activist,\u201d Ms. Ziemba said.Officially known as the Government Pension Fund Global, the fund has the mandate of preserving and increasing Norway\u2019s profits from oil for future generations. Last year, the government provided the fund with about $40 billion from the state\u2019s portion of petroleum revenue.Norway, while a small country in terms of population, has saved a large cushion, about $170,000 for each of its roughly five million citizens, in case of hard times or falling oil prices. While most of the Gulf oil states also have large funds, some other oil producers, including Britain, have chosen to use their oil income for current expenditure.The Norwegian fund said on Friday that it held an average stake of 2.5 percent in all European listed stocks and 1.3 percent in stocks across the globe.\u201cThe year\u2019s results were driven by our equity investments,\u201d Yngve Slyngstad, who heads Norges Bank Investment Management, which runs the fund, said in a statement.The fund\u2019s rules limit its holdings in any company to no more than 10 percent of equity. But so far it has remained well below those limits. At the end of the year, the fund\u2019s largest stock position was a 2.7 percent stake worth about $6.5 billion in the Swiss food giant Nestl\u00e9, followed by a roughly $5 billion holding in Royal Dutch Shell, a roughly 2 percent stake.Mr. Slyngstad, whom the fund declined to make available for an interview, took over in 2008, during the global financial crisis. He made up for a 23 percent loss in 2008 by reversing the fund\u2019s bond-heavy weighting to take advantage in the global sell-off in stocks by increasing the fund\u2019s equity holdings to 60 percent, from 40 percent previously. That led to a 26 percent gain in 2009.He also persuaded the government to take its first step away from stocks and bonds by moving into real estate in 2010. About 1 percent of the fund\u2019s total is now in property, a category that yielded a 12 percent return last year.The fund\u2019s solid returns were unremarkable given the boom on Wall Street and other stock markets. The MSCI Index, which tracks stocks in 23 countries, was up 27 percent that year.Mr. Slyngstad adjusts the holdings within guidelines set by Norway\u2019s Finance Ministry. Equities, for instance, are supposed to account for 50 to 70 percent of total assets. Last fall, he decided that stocks had risen too far, too fast, and so he sold about $25 billion worth of shares in the fourth quarter. It was the first year since the fund\u2019s founding in 1996 that it was a net seller of equities.Those holdings cut the exposure to equities by only about two percentage points, to 62 percent, and the large equity positions, particularly in North America, were the critical factor behind the fund\u2019s double-digit returns.The conservative-led Norwegian government, which took office last year, has been debating whether the fund should try for higher returns by shrinking its bond portfolio in favor of private equity and infrastructure like airports and toll roads.A government-sponsored report on investment strategy is expected in April., Environmental groups and the opposition labor party want the fund \u2014 despite the carbon-based source of its wealth \u2014 to actively combat climate change by, for example, selling its shares in coal companies.\u201cWe think the pension fund should withdraw all of their investments from fossil fuels,\u201d said Lars Haltbrekken, chairman of Friends of the Earth Norway. \u201cThe money we earn on fossil fuels we invest in the coal oil and gas industries worldwide. This harms the climate and the future Norwegian economy.\u201dThe fund is responding to some of that pressure, though cautiously. Last year, it divested itself of holdings in 27 mining companies that failed to satisfy its environmental risk criteria, the fund said on Friday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Use of Public Transit in U.S. Reaches Highest Level Since 1956, Advocates Report", "Date": "2014-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe trade group said in its annual report that 10.65 billion passenger trips were taken on transit systems during the year, surpassing the post-1950s peak of 10.59 billion in 2008, when gas prices rose to $4 to $5 a gallon.The ridership in 2013, when gas prices were lower than in 2008, undermines the conventional wisdom that transit use rises when those prices exceed a certain threshold, and suggests that other forces are bolstering enthusiasm for public transportation, said Michael Melaniphy, the president of the association.\u201cNow gas is averaging well under $4 a gallon, the economy is coming back and people are riding transit in record numbers,\u201d Mr. Melaniphy said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a fundamental shift in how people are moving about their communities.\u201dFrom 1995 to 2013, transit ridership rose 37 percent, well ahead of a 20 percent growth in population and a 23 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled, according to the association\u2019s data.Stronger economic growth is playing an important role in the increased use of public transit, as more people are using the systems to get to an increasing number of jobs, the association reported, and transit agencies are nurturing growth by expanding their systems or improving services.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing that where cities have invested in transit, their unemployment rates have dropped, and employment is going up because people can get there,\u201d Mr. Melaniphy said.Overall public transit ridership increased by 1.1 percent from 2012, with the biggest gains in rail service and in bus service for smaller cities.In New York, where use of all modes of transit in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority increased 3.6 percent last year, according to the data, ridership has been bolstered by falling unemployment and improved service, said Kevin Ortiz, a spokesman for the authority.The system is also being increasingly used during off-peak times, especially by younger people, who are encouraged by promotions like free transfers between subways and buses and by a decline in crime in the city, Mr. Ortiz said.In Denver, the Regional Transit District topped 101 million passenger trips last year, its most ever, helped by an improving economy and an increasing acceptance that public transit is an attractive alternative to the automobile, said Scott Reed, a spokesman for the district.One of the challenges is simply getting people to try public transportation, Mr. Reed said, but when they do, \u201cthey find it is so much easier than they had feared.\u201dThe estimated $7 billion cost is being paid for in part with a 0.4 percent sales tax, which voters approved in 2004. Nationally, taxpayers are increasingly willing to finance public transportation improvements, Mr. Melaniphy said.In the last two years, more than 70 percent of transit tax initiatives have succeeded, he said.\u201cA lot of people would prefer to drive less and rely more on walking, cycling and public transit, provided that those are high-quality options,\u201d Mr. Litman said.Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about the use of public transit in the United States having reached its highest level since 1956 misstated the number of passenger trips taken on transit systems in 2008. It was 10.59 billion, not million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela Goes Mad", "Date": "2014-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 THE violent demonstrations that have rocked Venezuela for weeks are threatening to wipe out what little democracy is left here after 15 years of systematic erosion by the state. The government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has responded with massive military force, raiding offices and houses without judicial orders, imprisoning civilians in military compounds and applauding the killing of protesters by paramilitary groups. Yet the riots do not portend a Venezuelan Spring. For the government they are a welcome deflection of public attention from a faltering economy and rising crime. They may even invigorate this flaccid dictatorship. The turmoil started on Feb. 4, after the sexual assault of a student ignited a protest on a university campus near the Colombian border. The National Guard responded with disproportionate force, and demonstrations multiplied throughout the country. A lot of rage was waiting to explode. In Mr. Maduro\u2019s first year in office, Venezuela has experienced urban violence and shortages of basic goods usually associated with wartime. The annual rate of inflation, which exceeds 56 percent, is one of the highest in the world. By March 5, when Mr. Maduro\u2019s more-military-than-civilian government commemorated the first anniversary of the death of its revered comandante, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, close to 20 people had died and more than 1,000 had been detained. Most of the prisoners were released within days, but some alleged being raped and tortured. Today, large rallies continue in the middle-class neighborhoods of all the main cities. The protesters, in a gesture mixing anarchic defiance and self-defense, block the streets with makeshift barricades, or guarimbas, and set them on fire. That only invites more violence from the National Guard and the colectivos, the Chavistas\u2019 civilian militias. By creating traffic jams and keeping bread and other basic groceries out of shops, the guarimbas also increase tensions between protesters and ordinary citizens. As I was writing this article, smoke filled the streets outside my family\u2019s apartment; barricades were smoldering after another battle between protesters and the public forces. But we were lucky. In other neighborhoods, the National Guard and colectivos barged into buildings to come after protesters, arresting not just the hooded teenagers but infuriated housewives who insulted them for charging after demonstrators. At this point, nobody \u2014 no political party, no social movement, no one leader \u2014 is in charge of the protests. The demonstrations have created a political crisis all right, but it is a crisis less for the government than for its opponents. After years of struggling to forge a coalition, the opposition seems divided again. Beyond the students who started the protests, there are two main strands within the opposition. One is a group of hard-liners led by Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, a congresswoman from an opposition stronghold in Caracas, and Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, a former mayor of the anti-Chavista neighborhood of Chacao. They want the government to fall; their crowd is active in the streets and spews insults on Twitter at Chavistas and moderate anti-Chavistas alike. (Mr. L\u00f3pez has been in military custody since Feb. 18 on charges of inciting violence.) Another opposition force is trying to keep alive the Mesa de la Unidad Democr\u00e1tica (Democratic Unity Roundtable), an umbrella group of anti-Ch\u00e1vez parties that believes in institutional politics. At this point the radicals seem to be the most popular among protesters; they certainly are the loudest. And the more they scream, the more the security forces beat up demonstrators, and the more barricades the demonstrators set on fire. The situation is wildest in T\u00e1chira, where the uprising began and where violence and the scarcity of household goods have been more widespread for longer than in the rest of the country. There, the protests have spread from middle-class neighborhoods to the slums. Occasionally, a fighter jet crosses the sky. Still, the revolt in Venezuela isn\u2019t some Latin American version of the Arab Spring. Just one National Guard soldier has been killed so far; the demonstrators are not going after state forces. Instead, they build barricades and burn them, and cry out that they won\u2019t accept a Cuban-style dictatorship. There is no group backing Venezuela\u2019s protesters like the Muslim Brotherhood, with a platform, a network and the logistics to overthrow the current government. Despite what the Chavistas in power claim, repeating the tired leftist line about American meddling, these rallies and riots are not a conspiracy to topple an elected government. The hard-liners in the opposition who want regime change cannot drive Mr. Maduro from office, much less replace the sprawling Chavista establishment. The military remains firmly aligned with Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s heirs. The government shows no sign of buckling; nothing, its officials insist, can stop Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s socialist revolution. If anything, the protests may inject new energy into a weak and inefficient dictatorship. The government seems to be biding its time until the silent majority gets impatient with the protesters. It is trying to borrow more money from China, its newest key ally, to restart the economy. It also appears to be reaching out to local business captains in the hopes of reviving agricultural production and industrial activity.The violence will continue, meanwhile, even if this wave of protests is crushed under soldiers\u2019 boots. I can see that in the rage of drivers who encounter blockades on their way home; in the curses that even neighbors exchange; in the decaying control of municipal authorities; in the myriad reports on social media about assaults, arson, break-ins, vandalism. Crime and out-of-control inflation will make life harder for almost everyone. Venezuela has long been a country with no space for independent media, the rule of law or competitive politics. Now, it is also a country where thousands of protesters, absurdly, are taking orders via Twitter from a self-proclaimed prophet in Miami, Reinaldo dos Santos, who has announced Mr. Maduro\u2019s fall. And it is a country where thousands of Chavistas are calling for jailing, exiling or disappearing the opponents of their repressive government. Venezuela isn\u2019t undergoing a revolution. It is going mad.Rafael Os\u00edo Cabrices is a journalist and author. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Government Sends Soldiers to a Protest Site in Caracas", "Date": "2014-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe government on Monday deployed hundreds of soldiers in a part of Caracas where weeks of often violent protests have taken place, and a top official boasted that the area had been \u201cliberated.\u201d The operation centered on a public square, Plaza Francia, in the city\u2019s well-off Altamira district, where virtually every night up to hundreds of young protesters gathered to engage in battles with the police and National Guard troops, building barricades to block streets and throwing rocks and gas bombs at security forces, who responded with tear gas and plastic buckshot.The deployment extended into other nearby neighborhoods where residents had been active in the protests and had barricaded many streets. Soldiers, some armed with assault weapons, were stationed in the plaza and on many of the major streets in the area, which has long been an opposition stronghold. Municipal workers removed barricades and cleaned up the trash and debris.People going to and from work or entering or leaving the subway station at the plaza walked past the soldiers, who stood about in small groups.\u201cThe soldiers should have come earlier,\u201d said Neida Macuma, a government supporter whose daughters, government opponents, live in the area. \u201cThe students were getting out of control, and they had no right to be blocking the streets.\u201dBut Juan Carlos Salas, 28, an opposition supporter who works at a market, said the military presence was excessive, as the protesters were \u201cstudents, armed only with rocks at the most, while they have tear gas, bulletproof vests, guns.\u201dIn the midafternoon protesters, most of them students, began arriving. About 30 young people walked around the plaza, chanting slogans, including one directed at the National Guard soldiers: \u201cBrother guardsman, we are also fighting for you.\u201dAt one point the soldiers surrounded the students as they stood on the corner of a main avenue, apparently to prevent them from trying to block the street.The protests, which started in February, sprang from dissatisfaction with living standards, a hobbled economy and high crime, as well as from the frustration of government opponents who felt shut out of the political system.President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro dismisses the protesters as coup-plotters and fascists.Diosdado Cabello, the president of the National Assembly, said on Twitter post Monday that the plaza had been \u201cliberated.\u201dAlso on Monday, government officials said that a National Guard soldier had died after being shot in the head a day earlier at a barricade set up by protesters on a street in the city of Maracay. The government says that 29 people have been killed in episodes linked to the protests.Catalina Lobo-Guerrero and Mar\u00eda Eugenia D\u00edaz contributed reporting from Caracas, Venezuela.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "High-Interest Web Banks on the Rise in China", "Date": "2014-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Last June, an affiliate of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba made an offer to its hundreds of millions of users: Give us your cash, and we will pay more than Chinese banks will.Savers swamped the company seeking interest rates that were significantly higher than the low rates fixed by the government. By early February, 81 million people had signed up for the company\u2019s money market product called Yu\u2019e Bao, which translates as \u201cleftover treasure.\u201dThe fund, which was established by Alipay, a unit of Alibaba, now has $40 billion in assets under management, making it the country\u2019s biggest money market fund.Other big Chinese Internet companies have followed suit, promising even higher returns than Yu\u2019e Bao. The result is an assault on one of the crucial instruments the Chinese government uses to manage the economy: interest rates.\u201cThis is the beginning of interest rate liberalization,\u201d says Chang Chun, who teaches at Shanghai Jiao Tong University\u2019s Advanced Institute of Finance. \u201cPeople want to get a higher yield on their savings deposits, and so this is one way to get around the regulation.\u201dJack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s flamboyant and sharp-tongued chairman, insists China\u2019s financial regulations are suffocating smaller investors and average consumers. He has vowed to shake up the country\u2019s banking and financial services sector. \u201cThe financial industry needs spoilers to make a revolution,\u201d he said during a speech last June.The big winners so far are Chinese savers, who now earn up to 7 percent annually on cash deposits. Traditional banks have rarely been so generous. They now pay 3.3 percent.For years, Chinese policy makers have promised to liberalize interest rates as part of a bold reform effort aimed at letting market forces play a larger role in the economy so that it grows in a more sustainable and healthy way. Perhaps because of strong opposition from banks and other state institutions, the interest rate controls have not yet been lifted.Analysts say the government\u2019s decision to permit Internet companies to offer a wide range of investment and financial services is an effort to create alternatives to state banks and, in effect, loosen interest rate controls.While the money involved is relatively small \u2014 about $50 billion in a $9 trillion economy \u2014 the phenomenal growth of Internet finance is intensifying competition for deposits and putting pressure on China\u2019s dominant state-run banks, which are already struggling to cope with a severe cash squeeze. Internet finance is also emerging at a time when the government is trying to contain the growth of shadow banking, which could be masking huge risks and liabilities that exist outside the purview of regulators.Not everyone is pleased. In recent weeks, critics have referred to the online products as \u201cvampires sucking blood out of banks,\u201d and warned that investors may not be aware of the risks. Chinese regulators said in late February that they are considering new rules to govern the sector.For their part, the leaders in Internet finance, such as Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, play down the risks of their new investment products. They say they are operating within the law and putting the cash to work in investments that carry low risk. There are, of course, serious challenges ahead for Internet finance in China, analysts say. For instance, although the online deposits are promoted as if they were savings accounts, they are investment products that carry risk. The principal is not guaranteed, and if consumers begin to suffer losses, analysts say, there could be a flood of redemptions.For the last decade, the government has aided state-run banks by placing a ceiling on the savings deposit rate and a floor on bank lending rates. The wide spread between the two, known as the net interest spread, has helped banks pocket fat profits that they needed to restructure after massive losses in the 1990s.Savers, on the other hand, have seen the value of their cash deposits deteriorate, since the rate of inflation has usually been higher than the government-controlled deposit rate. Economists say the policy has acted like a tax on savers.It has also forced some wealthy Chinese investors to channel their money into hard assets: art, gold and property. In recent years, many investors have also sought higher yields by buying so-called wealth management products through financial leasing companies, trust companies and even local banks. The products, though, can be risky because the money is often used to finance high-interest loans to developers and local government infrastructure companies.Now, investors are turning to online investment products. The high rates offered by products like Yu\u2019e Bao are exposing weaknesses in China\u2019s financial system, where investors have fewer options than in the West, especially with fixed interest rates.Major Chinese Internet companies are now disrupting those controls by offering enticing yields aimed at ordinary savers with spare cash, people like Gao Yue, a 25-year-old health care consultant in Beijing. Since October, she has put about $15,000 into her new Yu\u2019e Bao account.\u201cAs long as I get a higher return than the regular bank deposit, I\u2019m happy to put my money in there,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s better than being beaten by inflation.\u201dAlibaba is the prime mover in the new business. The company has dominated online shopping for years with its popular websites Taobao and Tmall and even established an arm that lends to small businesses. In 2013, the company\u2019s online payment service, Alipay (a kind of Chinese version of PayPal) moved into banking and finance by partnering with Tianhong Asset Management, a small, state-backed firm. (In October, Alipay agreed to pay $200 million to acquire a controlling stake in Tianhong.)Alipay\u2019s 800 million registered users were then encouraged to transfer any money left over in their online shopping account to Yu\u2019e Bao, the new online fund set up by Alipay and Tianhong. The rates promoted by Tianhong were higher than those offered by banks.Soon after, Yu\u2019e Bao took flight. Analysts say Yu\u2019e Bao\u2019s appeal is its simplicity and convenience. Alipay account holders can transfer as little as one renminbi, or about 16 cents, into Yu\u2019e Bao and withdraw the money at any time, without being penalized. They can also get daily earnings updates on their mobile phones.\u201cWhat makes Yu\u2019e Bao attractive is the small size. You don\u2019t need to invest much,\u201d says Joe Zhang, a Hong Kong banker. \u201cSmall is the killer app.\u201dHow does Yu\u2019e Bao get such high rates? Company executives say they invest mostly in the interbank market, where banks and other financial institutions extend loans to one another, usually for short periods. Interbank rates have soared in China during the last year because banks, particularly smaller banks, are desperate for cash.\u201cBanks are definitely short of cash,\u201d says Charlene Chu, who formerly followed Chinese banks for Fitch Ratings. \u201cThis is why the interbank rate is going up.\u201dIn the United States, PayPal flirted with a similar online money market fund product for years before closing it in 2011. Since then, no major American Internet company has ventured into the banking or investment business.But Bill Harris, a former chief executive at PayPal, says American Internet companies are missing a big opportunity. \u201cThe reason none of them is doing it is they haven\u2019t tried,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cIf a tech firm did it, they could build systems with no humans. Amazon could do it. PayPal could do it. Apple could do it in spades. I think they\u2019re missing the boat.\u201dAnalysts say soaring interbank rates are a sign of stress in the banking system, which means banks or financial institutions could default, leading to losses; or if conditions improve, interbank rates could slide, meaning lower interest rates and lower returns for consumers.For now, though, Internet finance looks lucrative. With $40 billion in assets under management, Alibaba and its partners are expected to reap $250 million in revenue annually just from management and service fees. Baidu and Tencent have formed partnerships to offer new funds with other fund companies, including the state-run China Asset Management Company.\u201cInternet finance is here to stay,\u201d says Johnson Chng, a banking expert at A. T. Kearney, the global advisory firm. \u201cInternet players are targeting a segment that banks don\u2019t look at.\u201dStephanie Yifan Yang contributed research.\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Door to Art of the World, Barely Ajar", "Date": "2014-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMuseums Special SectionOn a pay-what-you-wish Saturday evening in late February, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum rotunda was dense with visitors to a new show, \u201cItalian Futurism, 1909-1944: Reconstructing the Universe.\u201c Suddenly, a bugle squawked out a few notes, and from two upper ramps banners unfurled. One was painted with the words \u201cWage Theft.\u201c The other carried a drawing of a world globe accompanied by the phrase \u201c1% Museum.\u201c A call-and-response chant began: \u201cWho is building the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi?\u201c\u201cMigrant workers in labor camps! Is this the future of art?\u201c Then a single voice called out: \u201cThe Guggenheim Museum has a museum empire. The Guggenheim should not be on the wrong side of history.\u201c After about 20 minutes of this orchestrated interruption, which included a tossing of leaflets and the posting of a manifesto, the demonstrators left the premises.They were members of an activist political group called G.U.L.F. (Global Ultra Luxury Faction), which is affiliated with two larger groups, Gulf Labor and Occupy Museums. For two years Gulf Labor, a coalition of international artists, has been protesting, largely through the web, the state of what some critics likened to indentured servitude of laborers, many from South Asia, brought in to work on a new Guggenheim franchise located on Saddiyat Island \u2014 \u201cIsland of Happiness\u201d \u2014 just off the coast of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.Asked for a response to the protest, the Guggenheim\u2019s director, Richard Armstrong, said the complaints were misplaced. Construction on the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, designed by Frank Gehry, had not yet begun at the time of the demonstration. G.U.L.F. countered that all the labor-intensive structural groundwork that would make the building possible \u2014 roads, sewage systems \u2014 had been underway for some time, and reports of worker abuses were rife. Whatever the reality, in the eyes of at least some art world citizens, the Guggenheim was doing at the very least a convincing impersonation of a globalizing corporation with new headquarters, built by and for the rich at the expense of the poor, to supply a luxury leisure and tourist spot in the Middle East with global art exhibitions. Global \u2014 as in globalism and globalization \u2014 has been a period-defining word in talk about art and its institutions in the last few decades. And along with certain other zeitgeisty terms like multiculturalism and postmodernism, it once had a utopian ring. When the economy, including the art market, bottomed out at the end of the 1980s, walls came down, and long-excluded art came in. Not only did the art of African-Americans, Asian-Americans and Native Americans gain admittance, but so did new art from Africa, Asia and South America, art that we barely even knew existed. Back then, globalism seemed to hold one main promise: finally bringing us all, with our manifold colors and languages, to the table, where we wouldn\u2019t all just break bread side by side, we\u2019d cook up whole new fusion cuisines.Even before the financial crisis in the late 1980s, there were indicators of incipient change. One came with the 1984 exhibition \u201c\u2018Primitivism\u2018 in 20th Century Art: Affinity of the Tribal and the Modern\u201c at the Museum of Modern Art, organized by William S. Rubin and Kirk Varnedoe, that paired examples of traditional African, Oceanic and Native American objects with Western modern art. The take-away idea was to demonstrate the ingenious use Western artists had made of those \u201cprimitive\u201c sources. Non-Western art objects were reduced to illustrating Western accomplishments.The response was explosive. In a widely read review in Artforum, the critic Thomas McEvilley, who died last year, slammed the museum with accusations of cultural colonialism. The curators came back with a defense, only to have Mr. McEvilley demolish it and, by doing so, to decisively accelerate a broad rethinking, already underway, of the blinkered attitudes of Western museums toward the rest of the world.The debate had international repercussions. In 1989 an exhibition called \u201cMagiciens de la Terre,\u201c organized by Jean-Hubert Martin at the Pompidou Center in Paris, was conceived as a corrective to the MoMA exhibition and had the distinction of being one of the first truly global museum shows, bringing together 50 contemporary artists from Europe and North America with 50 from Africa, Asia, South America and Australia.But in a different way from MoMA, it gave the non-Western work a primitivizing gloss, beginning with the title. Art by the Western artists was, for the most part, presented for cool contemplation, but the work chosen by many of the non-Western participants had an ethnographic spin as if the objects were expected to do something: heal, receive prayers, create magic, be spiritual. Despite the show\u2019s stated intention to create something like a globalist balance of values, a West-in-control-of-the-rest perspective remained intact.Still, a door to a larger view of the world did open. But has it stayed open, and if so, how wide? In terms of genuine globalist reach, MoMA is a more expansive institution than it was in 1984, but only in the area of contemporary art. Global modernism remains either outside its ken or perhaps hidden away in its storage vaults. In any case, we rarely see it.The Guggenheim has been more on the ball, though too often in a self-aggrandizing, one-shot way. For a show in 1996 imported from the Royal Academy of Arts in London, called \u201cAfrica: The Art of a Continent,\u201c it jammed hundreds of \u201ctraditional\u201c African objects, representing dozens of cultures, into its rotunda in an inchoate, context-free display. It took roughly the same omnibus approach in \u201cChina: 5000 Years\u201c in 1998 and in \u201cBrazil: Body and Soul,\u201c which opened in 2001. It was no coincidence that these blockbusters came at a time when the museum was working hard to establish international branches. The situation at the museum has improved. The Guggenheim has mounted some large Asian shows since \u2014 a Cai Guo Qiang retrospective in 2008, the 2013 Gutai show \u2014 and there are on-staff Asian art curators. But the museum\u2019s much advertised global art acquisition initiative has gotten off to a disappointingly stingy start. The first installment, last year\u2019s \u201cNo Country: Contemporary Art for South and Southeast Asia,\u201c was small and tucked away in a side gallery.In New York it has been left to smaller museums, often short of money, to pick up the globalist slack in a consistent and venturesome way. These include the Queens Museum, the Bronx Museum of the Arts, El Museo del Barrio, the Studio Museum in Harlem and Asia Society. Most innovative of all was the Museum for African Art, which opened in 1984 and revolutionized ideas about how to present non-Western culture in a Western context. Dismayingly, last year the museum changed its mission and name \u2014 it is now the New African Center \u2014 leaving its future as an exhibiting institution unclear. And, of course, what has changed most boldly over the last decade is the global art landscape and the place of museums in it, a story still very much in the process of unfolding. With \u201cMagicien\u201c as an originating model, international biennials and art fairs have proliferated. Essentially pop-up events, they plunk down large shipments of price-tagged pluralism everywhere, standardizing and neutralizing the experience of \u201cdifference\u201d \u2014 editing it to a manageable market and determining what we will see in our big, ostensibly \u201cglobal\u201d museums, the \u201c1%\u201d as the protesters had it.Some of the newest of these institutions are in the Middle East and China. For the last several years China has indulged in a spectacular binge of museum construction, thanks both to competitive nationalism and to new wealth. New regional museums of archaeological or other traditional material abound. So do private museums housing personal collections amassed by members of the newly rich. There are even museums of world culture, all but unheard-of outside the West until now. Two state-run museums that opened in Shanghai in 2012, one devoted to modern and the other to contemporary art, are mandated to show at least some Western work.In Hong Kong, among the exclusive shops and restaurants of the developing West Kowloon Cultural District, the colossal M+ museum is in operation even though its building won\u2019t be finished until 2016. The institution\u2019s bias is 20th- and 21st-century Asian-centric work, but it will incorporate significant Western material.The M+ pointedly calls itself a visual cultural museum rather than an art museum. But with a starter collection that appears to draw heavily on the internationally approved contemporary Chinese canon, it could, without strong curatorial direction, adhere to a now standard-issue global format.Is there any place to escape from this model among new or newish museums outside the Western sphere? Southeast Asia presents serious possibilities, with a lively art scene and interesting contemporary spaces in Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and Yogyakarta, Indonesia. And Africa, where large-scale Western-style museums are all but impossible to sustain, produces alternatives almost by default.Institutions like Bandjoun Station in the western region of Cameroon; Zoma Contemporary Art Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; and Raw Material Company in Dakar, Senegal, are all small, artist-built-and-run institutions that multitask as exhibition venues, archives, libraries, studios, guesthouses, gathering spots and schools.Far from being part of the floating world of a market-driven museum culture, they\u2019re thoroughly grounded in a local context, yet, through social media, networked internationally. Given their slender means, they have to stay flexible, light on their feet and open to alteration. In most cases, the one component they lack is a permanent collection. Deeply committed to the idea of art being, intrinsically, a form of social activism, their very existence carries a political charge.Our big globalizing institutions of modern and contemporary art carry no such charge. Despite their fabulously rich holdings in art, any spark of a vision of the museum as a community of cultures, a forum of equal Others, is hard to find. In this context, globalism is shut down, out of fuel.Even unbuilt, the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi feels like a white elephant, corralled on the Island of Happiness with others of its kind: an Abu Dhabi branch of the Louvre designed by Jean Nouvel, and a performing arts center designed by Zaha Hadid, all constructed by people who will most likely never get in the doors and whose art is still hard to find in comparable museums in New York. Yet it would take a real cynic not to speculate about how this might be different. What if seemingly incompatible institutional features \u2014 humane local wisdom and custodianship of treasures of art \u2014 could be made to coexist? We\u2019d have museums that are on the right side of history, and in which the future of art would be secure. That ideal is worth storming an empire for.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ultra-Orthodox Jews Clog Jerusalem Streets to Protest a Draft Bill", "Date": "2014-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 In a formidable show of force, at least 300,000 ultra-Orthodox Jewish men flooded the streets around the main entrance to Jerusalem on Sunday, bringing much of the city to a standstill with a protest against a government plan that aims to conscript more of their numbers for military service and holds out the threat of arrest for religious draft dodgers.The rally, described as a mass prayer gathering by ultra-Orthodox leaders, was a largely peaceful expression of what many here are calling a culture war over one of the most significant challenges facing Israeli society.For decades, the ultra-Orthodox, known as Haredim, or those who fear God, have been exempted from military service as long as they were registered in a yeshiva, or religious seminary, and engaged in full-time Torah study. Mainstream Israelis, who are conscripted at 18, have come to view the enlistment of the fast-growing Haredi minority and its subsequent integration into the work force as imperative for the viability of the country and its economy.But for the disciplined ranks of ultra-Orthodox men who answered the call of their rabbis on Sunday, the proposed draft bill, and in particular, the call for criminal sanctions, is an abomination.All shades of Haredi sects, including old rivals, came together in an unusual display of unity and strength. Their spokesmen accused the government of turning Israel into the only country in the world where a Jew could theoretically be jailed for studying the Torah, though they acknowledged that in practice, that was unlikely to happen.\u201cIf this is the Jewish state, it is one that must have Torah at the center,\u201d said Rabbi Mordechai Bloy, an educator of Haredi youth in Bnei Brak, a mostly Orthodox town near Tel Aviv, as he made his way to Jerusalem. \u201cA Torah scholar must not be treated like a drug dealer.\u201dProtesters\u2019 posters carried slogans like \u201cWe will all go to jail\u201d and biblical verses like \u201cSave me, I pray, from the hand of my brother,\u201d a plea made by Jacob, who feared that his brother, Esau, might kill him.The police closed the main highway into Jerusalem for six hours, as well as the city\u2019s central bus station, and deployed about 3,500 officers. Haredi leaders called on males from the age of 9 to attend and designated a separate zone for women to demonstrate, to comply with religious standards of modesty. Police estimates put the crowd at 300,000; organizers said it was twice as large.The popular demand for ultra-Orthodox men to be drafted has built up since Israel\u2019s Supreme Court invalidated a law that allowed wholesale army exemptions for yeshiva students, ruling in 2012 that it contradicted the principle of equality. Many Israelis have been pressing for a more equal sharing of the burdens of citizenship.The ultra-Orthodox sector constitutes up to 10 percent of Israel\u2019s population of eight million but is rapidly increasing because its members favor large families. Many Haredi men well past draft age opt to stay in religious seminaries, preferring study to work and living on welfare payments.Last month a government committee proposed a law establishing annual quotas for the drafting of yeshiva students for military or national service and calling for criminal sanctions against those who evade the draft if the quotas are not met by mid-2017. The bill stops far short of enforcing conscription for all Haredi young men, instead proposing a gradual increase in recruitment levels. Each year 1,800 outstanding students will be granted full exemptions. Thousands of yeshiva students beyond draft age will immediately be allowed to enter the work force.The Israeli Parliament is expected to pass the bill into law later this month.Yair Lapid, the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, and Naftali Bennett of the right-wing Jewish Home party, who championed the ultra-Orthodox draft in their election campaigns, have already declared victory.\u201cSince approximately 30 percent of first graders are Haredi, Israel will not survive as a country unless Haredim are incorporated into our economy and service,\u201d Mr. Bennett wrote on his Facebook page this weekend, adding: \u201cEveryone, including those who are shouting, because they are expected to shout, knows that not one person studying Torah will be sent to jail. Period. The law is balanced, gradual and good for all Israelis and for the Haredim in particular.\u201dBut critics of the proposed law say it will do little to equalize the burden and may even do harm.\u201cSharing the burden is just good copywriting,\u201d said Rabbi Aaron Shushan, a teacher from Telz Stone, a Haredi community near Jerusalem, noting that many Israeli women do not serve in the army on religious grounds and that members of Israel\u2019s Arab minority are exempted from service.Yedidia Z. Stern, a law professor and vice president of research at the Israel Democracy Institute, an independent research organization, wrote in the newspaper Yediot Aharonot on Sunday: \u201cThe experts on the Haredi sector \u2014 from its toughest critics to its sworn supporters \u2014 agree that the bill that is being prepared is a double failure: From a practical standpoint it is not effective, and from the symbolic aspect, it is offensive and drags us into a dispute between brothers. It\u2019s hard to imagine a worse outcome.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His remarks, which lasted 47 minutes, were interrupted repeatedly by thunderous applause, standing ovations and at the end chants of \u201cRussia, Russia.\u201d Some in the audience wiped tears from their eyes.A theme coursing throughout his remarks was the restoration of Russia after a period of humiliation following the Soviet collapse, which he has famously called \u201cthe greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.\u201dHe denounced what he called the global domination of one superpower and its allies that emerged. \u201cThey cheated us again and again, made decisions behind our back, presenting us with completed facts,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it was with the expansion of NATO in the East, with the deployment of military infrastructure at our borders. They always told us the same thing: \u2018Well, this doesn\u2019t involve you.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe speed of Mr. Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea, redrawing an international border that has been recognized as part of an independent Ukraine for 23 years, has been breathtaking and so far apparently unstoppable. While his actions, which the United States, Europe and Ukraine do not recognize, provoked renewed denunciations and threats of tougher sanctions and diplomatic isolation, it remained unclear how far the West was willing to go to punish Mr. Putin. The leaders of what had been the Group of 8 nations announced they would meet next week as the Group of 7, excluding Russia from a club Russia once desperately craved to join.Certainly the sanctions imposed on Russia ahead of Tuesday\u2019s steps did nothing to dissuade Mr. Putin, as he rushed to make a claim to Crimea that he argued conformed to international law and precedent. In his remarks he made clear that Russia was prepared to withstand worse punishment in the name of restoring a lost part of the country\u2019s historic empire, effectively daring world leaders to sever political or economic ties and risk the consequences to their own economies.Mr. Putin, the country\u2019s paramount leader for more than 14 years, appeared to be gambling that the outrage would eventually pass, as it did after Russia\u2019s war with Georgia in 2008, because a newly assertive Russia would be simply too important to ignore on the world stage. As with any gamble, though, the annexation of Crimea carries potentially grave risks.Only hours after Mr. Putin declared that \u201cnot a single shot\u201d had been fired in the military intervention in Crimea, a group of soldiers opened fire as they stormed a Ukrainian military mapping office near Simferopol, killing a Ukrainian soldier and wounding another, according to a Ukrainian officer inside the base and a statement by Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry.The base appeared to be under the control of the attacking soldiers, who like most of the Russians in Crimea wore no insignia, and the ministry said that Ukrainian forces in Crimea were now authorized to use force to defend themselves.The episode underscored the fact that the fate of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers, as well military bases and ships, remains dangerously unresolved.In the capital, Kiev, Ukraine\u2019s new prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, declared that the conflict had moved from \u201ca political to a military phase\u201d and laid the blame squarely on Russia.Mr. Putin\u2019s determined response to the ouster of Ukraine\u2019s president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, last month has left American and European leaders scrambling to find an adequate response after initially clinging to the hope that Mr. Putin was prepared to find a political solution \u2014 or \u201coff ramp\u201d \u2014 to an escalating crisis that began with the collapse of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government on the night of Feb. 21.Within a week, Russian special operations troops had seized control of strategic locations across Crimea, while the regional authorities moved to declare independence and schedule a referendum on joining Russia that was held on Sunday.Even as others criticized the vote as a fraud, Mr. Putin moved quickly on Monday to recognize its result, which he called \u201cmore than convincing\u201d with nearly 97 percent of voters in favor of seceding from Ukraine. By Tuesday he signed a treaty of accession with the region\u2019s new leaders to make Crimea and the city of Sevastopol the 84th and 85th regions of the Russian Federation.The treaty requires legislative approval, but that is a mere formality given Mr. Putin\u2019s unchallenged political authority and the wild popularity of his actions, which have raised his approval ratings and unleashed a nationalistic fervor that has drowned out the few voices of opposition or even caution about the potential costs to Russia.Mr. Putin appeared Tuesday evening at a rally and concert on Red Square to celebrate an event charged with emotional and historical significance for many Russians. Among the music played was a sentimental Soviet song called \u201cSevastopol Waltz.\u201d\u201cAfter a long, hard and exhaustive journey at sea, Crimea and Sevastopol are returning to their home harbor, to the native shores, to the home port, to Russia!\u201d Mr. Putin told the crowd. When he finished speaking, he joined a military chorus in singing the national anthem.He recited a list of grievances \u2014 from the Soviet Union\u2019s transfer of Crimea to the Ukrainian republic in 1954, to NATO\u2019s expansion to Russia\u2019s borders, to its war in Kosovo in 1999, when he was a little-known aide to President Boris N. Yeltsin, to the conflict in Libya that toppled Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011 on what he called the false pretense of a humanitarian intervention.Reaching deep into Russian and Soviet history, he cast himself as the guardian of the Russian people, even those beyond its post-Soviet borders, restoring a part of an empire that the collapse of the Soviet Union had left abandoned to the cruel fates of what he described as a procession of hapless democratic leaders in Ukraine.\u201cMillions of Russians went to bed in one country and woke up abroad,\u201d he said. \u201cOvernight, they were minorities in the former Soviet republics, and the Russian people became one of the biggest \u2014 if not the biggest \u2014 divided nations in the world.\u201dHe cited the 10th-century baptism of Prince Vladimir, whose conversion to Orthodox Christianity transformed the kingdom then known as Rus into the foundation of the empire that became Russia. He called Kiev \u201cthe mother of Russian cities,\u201d making clear that he considered Ukraine, along with Belarus, to be countries where Russia\u2019s own interests would remain at stake regardless of the fallout from Crimea\u2019s annexation.He listed the cities and battlefields of Crimea \u2014 from the 19th-century war with Britain, France and the Turks to the Nazi sieges of World War II \u2014 as places \u201cdear to our hearts, symbolizing Russian military glory and outstanding valor.\u201dHe said that the United States and Europe had crossed \u201ca red line\u201d on Ukraine by throwing support to the new government that quickly emerged after Mr. Yanukovych fled the capital following months of protests and two violent days of clashes that left scores dead.Mr. Putin, as he has before, denounced the uprising as a coup carried out by \u201cRussophobes and neo-Nazis\u201d and abetted by foreigners, saying it justified Russia\u2019s efforts to protect Crimea\u2019s population.\u201cIf you press a spring too hard,\u201d he said, \u201cit will recoil.\u201dHe justified the annexation using the same arguments that the United States and Europe cited to justify the independence of Kosovo from Serbia and even quoted from the American submission to the United Nations International Court when it reviewed the matter in 2009.Mr. Putin did not declare a new Cold War, but he bluntly challenged the post-Soviet order that had more or less held for nearly a quarter-century, and made it clear that Russia was prepared to defend itself from any further encroachment or interference in areas it considers part of its core security, including Russia itself.He linked the uprisings in Ukraine and the Arab world and ominously warned that there were efforts to agitate inside Russia. He suggested that dissenters at home would be considered traitors, a theme that has reverberated through society with propagandistic documentaries on state television and moves to mute or close opposition news organizations and websites.\u201cSome Western politicians already threaten us not only with sanctions, but also with the potential for domestic problems,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to know what they are implying \u2014 the actions of a certain fifth column, of various national traitors? Or should we expect that they will worsen the social and economic situation, and therefore provoke people\u2019s discontent?\u201dReporting was contributed by Alan Cowell from London; David M.

{"Headline": "The Folly of Thinking We Know", "Date": "2014-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSANTA BARBARA, Calif. \u2014 WE\u2019VE most of us, surely, heard all the figures: Humanity now produces as much data in two days as it did in all of history till the year 2003 \u2014 and the amount of data is doubling every two years. In the time you take to read this piece, the human race will generate as much data as currently exists in the Library of Congress. For that matter \u2014 yes, your inbox and Facebook page would reflect this \u2014 10 percent of all the pictures ever taken as of the end of 2011 were taken in 2011. Yet as we think about how an entire Boeing 777 has gone missing for almost two weeks now, we\u2019re also painfully reminded of how much we can\u2019t \u2014 and may never \u2014 know, even in the Knowledge Economy.The Nobel Prize-winning economist and psychologist Daniel Kahneman has noted, after decades of research, that it\u2019s our nature to overestimate how much we understand the world and to underestimate the role of chance. And it\u2019s our folly to assume we know very much at all. There\u2019s \u201ca highly objectionable word,\u201d he writes, \u201cwhich should be removed from our vocabulary in discussions of major events,\u201d and that word is \u201cknew.\u201dI think of this as I watch one expert after another offer informed guesses about the fate of the missing plane, even as all we know about it so far is how provisional \u2014 and contradictory \u2014 our speculations have been. I also recall how the words that most convey authority and credibility whenever I listen to any pundit speak are \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Whatever the field of our expertise, most of us realize that the more data we acquire, the less, very often, we know. The universe is not a fixed sum, in which the amount you know subtracts from the amount you don\u2019t.As Gardiner G. Hubbard, the first president of the National Geographic Society, said in 1888, when his magazine set out to chart everything in the known universe, \u201cThe more we know, the greater we find is our ignorance.\u201d And it can often seem as if nature \u2014 or something beyond our reckoning at least \u2014 intrudes every time we\u2019re tempted to get above ourselves. Whenever we begin to assume we can command or comprehend quite a bit, some Icarian calamity pushes our face, tragically, in the limits of our knowledge.It\u2019s been humbling, as well as horrifying, to see the entire globe, in an age of unprecedented data accumulation, up in the air, more or less, but poignantly aware that, whatever we do learn, a grief beyond understanding is likely to be a part of it.We imagine how those with loved ones on the plane must be trying to fill the absence, of knowledge as well as of their sons or wives, and how they may fear, even if at times they long for, certainty. We imagine the people on the aircraft, whose not-knowing might have been felt on the pulse, accelerating, as the vessel suddenly changed course. We translate the story into our own lives, and think about how the things we don\u2019t know haunt and possess us as the things we do seldom can.Even if we do learn more about the fate of the airliner, it\u2019s unlikely that all of our questions will ever be answered. And the memory of how much we didn\u2019t know \u2014 and how long we didn\u2019t know it \u2014 ought to sober us as we prepare for the next sudden visitation of the inexplicable.We\u2019re all grateful that we know as much as we do these days, and enjoy lives that are safer, longer, healthier and better connected than those of any generation before ours. Yet each day that passes, Malaysia 370 keeps hovering like a terrible blank in our minds, more visible the longer it\u2019s out of our view.Pico Iyer is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Man Within My Head\u201d and a distinguished presidential fellow at Chapman University.

{"Headline": "Why Poland Loves Ukraine ... For Now", "Date": "2014-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEastern Europe, which beginning with Poland is celebrating its 25th anniversary of freedom from Communism, has suddenly awakened from a beautiful dream about the end of history. No less an authority than Adam Michnik, the legendary Polish anti-Communist dissident, recently announced that 2014 marks the end of the best period in Poland\u2019s history in three centuries. We are entering uncertain times: In contrast to Eastern Europe\u2019s foray into independence after World War I, no close intraregional alliances were formed in the aftermath of 1989; rather, each country placed all its hopes in joining NATO and the European Union. Now, faced with the powerlessness of the West before Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia, the countries of Eastern Europe are suddenly confronted with the need to reflect on their foreign policies \u2014 and no country more so than Poland. The primary problem for Eastern Europe is not so much Mr. Putin\u2019s aggression, but rather the disunity in the region\u2019s response. Some see the occupation of Crimea as an attempt by Mr. Putin to conceal his great defeat: the loss of Ukraine. Others speak more darkly of a demonstration of strength by Russia, which may not be the last. Nor can Eastern Europe depend on its Western allies. European weapons manufacturers, foremost among them German and French companies, are arming the Russian military, while Russia pays Europe with the money it earns from supplying gas, making Europe energy-dependent on Russia. Meanwhile European firms are signing multibillion-dollar energy contracts with the Russian energy companies Gazprom and Rosneft. As a result, Europe, the largest economy in the world, finds itself helpless in a confrontation with a country that, in economic terms and excluding the energy sector, belongs in the global third division. The swirl of opinions, analyses and interests can be bewildering, especially in contrast to an essentially simple calculation by Russia. Unlike the West, it values geopolitical expansion, not economic conditions. Otherwise, Russia would invest the money it earns from oil and gas in economic development, and not in its military, which according to projected spending will account for well over a quarter of the national budget by 2015. This situation casts a dark shadow on the place where the Iron Curtain used to be. \u201cOld Europe\u201d is not threatened, and so it can focus on its own economic interests, while \u201cNew Europe\u201d is reminded of the nightmares of its past. The fact that Ukrainians were willing to die in order to open the door to the European Union, which is now unwilling to bear the economic costs of a confrontation with Russia in order to protect them, is hardly comforting. In a threatening situation, it is natural to seek out allies who find themselves in a similar position. Unfortunately, Eastern Europe is even more divided by economic interests than the European Union as a whole. Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria are more energy dependent on Russia than any other countries in the European Union, while the Czechs value their local \u201csplendid isolation\u201d in the warmth of Germany and Austria. Poland has common interests only with the Baltic countries. But because of their weakness, as well as Lithuania\u2019s historic distrust of Poland, such an alliance doesn\u2019t get anyone anywhere. And Romania, the second-largest country in \u201cNew Europe\u201d after Poland, lacks strong ties to anyone. This explains why Poland bears such love for Ukraine. At this past Saturday\u2019s party convention in advance of the May elections to the European Parliament, the Polish prime minister and leader of the Civic Platform party, Donald Tusk, said, \u201cThe fundamental security of Poland and Europe depends on these elections.\u201d The campaign slogan for Mr. Tusk\u2019s party will be \u201cA Strong Poland Within a Secure Europe.\u201dThe key to that strength and security is Ukraine. As Mr. Tusk told the Ukrainian protest leader Vitali Klitschko, a special guest at the convention, \u201cEveryone who wants a secure Poland within a united Europe has to keep his fingers crossed for Ukraine.\u201d The foreign press is writing a lot about Poland, which, thanks to its engagement in Ukraine, has strengthened its international position, especially compared with the rest of the European Union. Nevertheless, Poland\u2019s security depends on the strength of the union, and so seems more threatened than at any point since the fall of Communism. Not only is there a lot to lose, but there is also more to gain than ever in our modern history. If Ukraine survives in its current shape (even without Crimea) and enters a path similar to that followed by Poland, the human and economic potential of both countries, strengthened by ad hoc alliances within the European Union, will allow the realization of Poland\u2019s historical dream to balance Russia\u2019s role in the region and ensure a significant position for Eastern Europe within the West. Today, though, this scenario seems unlikely. Not counting the risks associated with Russian expansion and the West\u2019s dilatory attitude, corrupt habits and social divisions within Ukraine are a major obstacle. Another obstacle may be the West itself, which, if it presses for too-severe economic reforms in exchange for too-paltry economic assistance, may well bring the same people out into the Maidan. And even if this can be overcome, in the end Poland and Ukraine, rather than finding mutual love for each other, might well start a war over historical memory, for which neither lacks pretexts. We have seen the history books reopened on Crimea; there is no reason they cannot be reopened on Polish-Ukrainian tensions as well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anger Grows in Taiwan Against Deal With China", "Date": "2014-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 Demonstrators who have occupied Taiwan\u2019s legislature since last week expanded their protest of a trade deal with China on Sunday evening by invading the government building nearby that houses the offices of the prime minister.The protesters, including many students from local universities, have accused President Ma Ying-jeou and his allies in the governing Kuomintang of forcing through the trade measure without allowing a review of its details, which they fear will give Beijing too much influence over the island\u2019s economy.By early Monday morning the police had cleared demonstrators from the government building, detaining dozens, according to local news media reports, although hundreds of protesters remained in the courtyard outside.Prime Minister Jiang Yi-huah said the intrusion was an \u201cillegal and violent act,\u201d Taiwan\u2019s Central News Agency reported, citing a cabinet spokesman.Police officers were seen swinging wooden clubs to clear protesters from the road behind the building. At least 70 were injured, the news agency reported.Earlier Sunday, the student leaders occupying the legislature called for a bipartisan \u201ccitizens constitutional conference\u201d and for sending the trade pact to committee for further review.In a news conference Sunday morning, Mr. Ma said that legislative approval of the pact was important for Taiwan\u2019s economic competitiveness, and that rejecting the deal would threaten Taiwan\u2019s ability to sign trade accords with other countries. Taiwan faces higher average duties on its exports than regional competitors like South Korea, Japan and Singapore, the president said.Regional economic integration is \u201can unstoppable global trend,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we do not face this and join in the process, it will only be a matter of time before we are eliminated from the competition.\u201dWhile Taipei is used to seeing large protests, an extended occupation of the legislative chambers is unprecedented.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t really responded to our questions,\u201d Hao Chang-cheng, a 21-year-old junior at the National Taipei University of Technology, said after Mr. Ma\u2019s news conference. The students seem likely to continue their occupation of the legislature.\u201cI feel like we must keep continuing on,\u201d Mr. Hao said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In-Depth Report Details Economics of Sex Trade", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A street prostitute in Dallas may make as little as $5 per sex act. But pimps can take in $33,000 a week in Atlanta, where the sex business brings in an estimated $290 million per year. It is not nearly as lucrative in Denver, where prostitution and other elements of an underground trade are worth about $40 million.The report does not estimate the size of the illicit sex economy nationwide, instead analyzing the trade as of 2007 in eight cities: Miami, Dallas, Washington, Denver, San Diego, Seattle, Atlanta and Kansas City, Mo. The report, commissioned by the Justice Department, is intended to address what researchers describe as wide gaps in the understanding of how the underground sex trade works, especially in the Internet age. \u201cIt is the first of its kind to look in-depth and create a road map of the commercial sex economy \u2014 from point of entry to reasons to stay within it, and what the business and operations structure looks like,\u201d said Meredith Dank of the Urban Institute, the report\u2019s lead author. \u201cWe\u2019d hear numbers from law enforcement and advocacy groups. But there was never any empirical rigor that was used to estimate its size.\u201d The study focused on the business side, rather than on consumers, and researchers conducted more than 250 interviews with law enforcement officers, lawyers, pimps, sex traffickers, prostitutes and child pornographers, many of whom were in jail. Those interviews provide a wealth of data on pricing, market structures and the sex workers\u2019 motivations.Researchers not involved in the study say that it has produced the best estimates yet of the sex trade\u2019s financial impact, but that the numbers underscore the need for more and better data. \u201cThey were scraping to find data that was reliable in just these communities,\u201d said Amy Farrell of Northeastern University, who applauded the study\u2019s findings. \u201cAnd they found a lot of variation across communities.\u201d The study did find pricing was consistent across the country, with $150 an hour the common going rate for prostitution. The age, race and drug use of a sex worker affected the price. Pimps told the interviewers that they could charge more for white women and younger women. But, one said, \u201cHonestly, you just have to stay away from minors.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never known a pimp that got in trouble for messing with adults,\u201d the pimp said. \u201cLaw enforcement focuses on minors.\u201d The sex business can be hugely lucrative, the study found. But sex workers reported burning through money as soon as they made it, and their expenses were high, too. One pimp in San Diego reported paying a hotel $24,000. Another spent $3,000 to $4,000 a week on shopping sprees for employees. \u201cProstitution and pimping \u2014 in many cases that\u2019s not particularly profitable,\u201d Ms. Farrell said. \u201cSome parts are more marketable than others.\u201dUnlike other illicit markets \u2014 in counterfeit consumer goods or drugs, for example \u2014 the sex economy is mostly made up of small-scale operations, the study found. On average, pimps keep five employees at any given time, and turnover is high. \u201cGirls would always come and go,\u201d said one of the people interviewed. \u201cWork for a weekend and then head back to the boyfriend after saying they\u2019ve made enough.\u201dAs other studies have shown, the Internet has had a profound effect on the sex economy. Half of respondents advertised online. One in four recruited employees through sites like Craigslist and Backpage. Most sex transactions were once negotiated on the streets, the study found, but most are now arranged online, where rates are significantly higher. The recession has caused some in the sex industry to offer deals or drop prices. Atlanta law enforcement officials reported some sex workers even offered Veterans Day specials.The study also shed light on why people get into sex work. Pimps and sex workers often said they were encouraged by their families to do so, and many cited poverty as a major factor in their decisions. About 30 percent of those interviewed said a family member was also involved in sex work.\u201cWhen I was little, I was on welfare, I lived in the projects,\u201d one pimp said. \u201cDope fiends, pimps and prostitutes. Gang bangers, helicopter over your roof. That\u2019s no way to live. Seeing glitz and glamour, I always wanted that. Coming up like that, having square jobs was never appealing.\u201dThe researchers also analyzed the specialized markets for Asian massage parlors and Latino brothels, which operated in all eight cities studied. The massage parlor business \u2014 often with a legal front hiding illegal trade \u2014 is growing. The number of parlors jumped to 4,790 in 2013 from 4,197 in 2011, the study found.Among the study\u2019s most interesting findings is that the market for child pornography in the United States is small because it is generally traded for free. And most of the people interviewed about their use of child pornography described it as a victimless crime. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you\u2019re buying drugs you\u2019re supporting crime or supporting terrorism,\u201d one individual said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t getting any money from me to do any bad things or other things.\u201dThe study should help law enforcement officials understand the sex trade and opportunities to help its most vulnerable victims get out, experts said. It also shows how much more research the topic could use. \u201cThe more empirical evidence we have, the better understanding we\u2019ll get,\u201d said Sheldon Zhang, a sociologist at San Diego State University. \u201cIt is the same as in the medical model. If you think that cancer is a problem, a serious problem, you need to invest money to understand it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, Shaking Up Currency\u2019s Strength", "Date": "2014-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisHONG KONG \u2014 One of the surest bets on China is starting to look a bit shaky.Every business day for the last nine years, at 9 a.m., government workers in the blandly named Building No. 30 in Shanghai\u2019s Pudong financial district have published what their country\u2019s currency will be worth that day, when compared with the United States dollar.More often than not, the staff of the China Foreign Exchange Trade System has assigned a value to the currency, the renminbi, slightly stronger than it had finished the previous day. Thanks to the guiding hand of the Chinese state, the renminbi today is about 25 percent stronger than it was in July 2005, when China scrapped the currency\u2019s fixed peg to the dollar in favor of a steady, crawling appreciation.But recent developments suggest such strengthening is no longer the certainty it once appeared to be. So far this year, the renminbi has weakened 1.6 percent against the dollar. And on Saturday, the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, said that beginning on Monday, it would allow the currency to climb or fall as much as 2 percent per day against the dollar, compared with 1 percent previously.Widening the trading band \u201cwill further drive away speculators betting on a one-way appreciation of the Chinese yuan\u201d \u2014 another name for the renminbi \u2014 \u201cthanks to the possible bigger and more frequent exchange rate fluctuations,\u201d Tan Yaling, president of the China Forex Investment Research Institute, told Xinhua, the state-run news agency, on Sunday. This newfound volatility and uncertainty over the currency is just one area where, despite recent economic data suggesting that growth is decelerating to its slowest pace in over a decade, China is pushing ahead with a campaign of wide-ranging financial overhauls. If carried out, they are likely to redefine the nation\u2019s state-driven growth model and to reverberate in economies far beyond China\u2019s borders.A risk for companies and countries that do business with China is not that Beijing will balk at restructuring its economy if growth slows beyond a certain point; it is that policy makers will stay the course.Over the years, China\u2019s investors and trade partners have come to rely on what amounts to a \u201cBeijing put,\u201d an option that provides assurance that a minimum level of growth will be attained. When the country looked set to fall short, the government would intervene to prime the pumps \u2014 freeing up credit, introducing subsidies and otherwise ensuring that China avoided any real economic pain and remained on track as the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy.Yet in the face of apparently slowing growth, this implicit guarantee is showing signs of fraying. Markets around the world are growing worried, from Australian iron ore miners to the luxury fashion houses of Europe to American scrap exporters.Take copper, where global prices have fallen sharply in recent weeks. This is partly the result of concerns that growth is slowing in China, which accounts for more than 40 percent of global consumption of the metal. But the falling prices represent another, bigger fear \u2014 one that focuses on the role copper plays in China\u2019s huge shadow finance sector and the realization that Beijing will not always be there with a bailout.Many Chinese companies and investors buy copper they have no intention of using. Instead, companies that otherwise have difficulty securing traditional loans will purchase copper from overseas suppliers by using letters of credit issued by banks, which only require a deposit of around 15 percent of the value of the goods being purchased, according to analysts.The Chinese importer then parks the shipment of copper in a duty-free warehouse and uses it as collateral to secure a bank loan at favorable rates, the proceeds from which are used to make higher-yielding investments. When the letter of credit comes due, usually in three to six months, the importer cashes out of the financial investment or sells the copper.This month, a small producer of solar panels based in Shanghai failed to pay the interest on a bond worth 1 billion renminbi, or $163 million. It was the first default in China\u2019s onshore corporate bond market in recent history, and it sent shock waves through global copper markets.Investors are worried that Chinese buyers who imported copper purely for financing purposes could be forced to sell, and prices of the metal have plummeted on fears that hundreds of thousands of tons of copper could begin to flood global markets as a result. As of Friday, benchmark three-month copper contracts closed at $6,469 per ton on the London Metal Exchange, down more than 8 percent from March 6, the day before the panel maker, the Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology Company, defaulted. Chaori\u2019s default \u201cwas probably the trigger\u201d for the slide in global copper prices, said Helen Lau, a senior metals and mining analyst at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong.\u201cBefore, people still had wishful thinking that the government would bail out whatever, but now?\u201d Ms. Lau said. \u201cOne default can lead to another. People are really scared.\u201dSo far, the Chinese leadership is showing no signs that it shares those fears. Indeed, analysts have said that allowing a struggling company to default instead of rushing in with a government bailout is a necessary form of near-term pain if China\u2019s 8.5 trillion renminbi corporate bond market is to mature and develop over the long term.\u201cI\u2019m afraid sometimes in certain individual cases such defaults are hardly avoidable,\u201d Li Keqiang, China\u2019s premier, told reporters on Thursday in response to a question about the country\u2019s debt situation. He said the government\u2019s response should be \u201cto step up monitoring\u201d in order to \u201censure that there will be no regional or systemic financial risks.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t want today\u2019s steppingstone to become tomorrow\u2019s stumbling block,\u201d Mr. Li said.Still, analysts question how much economic pain Beijing is willing to endure for the sake of overhauls to its financial system. At least four investment bank economists cut their G.D.P. growth forecasts for China on Thursday and Friday, citing weak data on investment, retail sales and property sales.Analysts said letting the currency trade more freely was a step that could help the country to liberalize interest rates, which leaders have said is another major goal that could be reached as early as next year.Still, policy makers made it clear that by stepping back from the market, the government was not stepping out of the picture entirely.\u201cMarket participants should view fluctuations in the exchange rate rationally and respond proactively,\u201d China\u2019s central bank said in a statement posted on its website on Saturday. \u201cOf course, if the exchange rate sees large or abnormal swings, the central bank will carry out the necessary adjustments and supervision in order to protect the normal floating exchange rate of the renminbi.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Politics Won\u2019t Be on First Lady\u2019s China Itinerary, Aides Say", "Date": "2014-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Michelle Obama\u2019s trip to China starting on Wednesday will be nonpolitical, the White House says, a \u201cpeople-to-people exchange\u201d emphasizing the importance that both nations place on education. As if to underscore the point, no reporters are traveling with the first lady, and she does not plan to give interviews while there. But with the United States and China locked in disagreements over trade, cyberweapons, territorial claims and, as always, human rights \u2014 and with President Obama preparing to meet with President Xi Jinping next week at a nuclear summit meeting \u2014 political overtones will be almost impossible to avoid.\u201cPolitics can be imposed,\u201d said Melanne Verveer, who accompanied Hillary Rodham Clinton to China in 1995 as the first lady\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cPeople will want to put a political spin on the trip.\u201dTina Tchen, Mrs. Obama\u2019s chief of staff and a first-generation Chinese-American, said a multigenerational visit would be appreciated by the Chinese, who value tradition. Mrs. Obama\u2019s aides describe the visit as a cultural exchange unencumbered by official talks at the presidential level. \u201cHer focus on people-to-people relations, her focus on education and youth empowerment is one that we believe will resonate in China,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser. Mrs. Obama will be promoting educational exchange programs, emphasizing the need for American and Chinese youths to understand each other\u2019s cultures as their economic fortunes become further intertwined. About 200,000 Chinese are studying in the United States, more than from any other country, compared with about 20,000 Americans studying in China, White House officials said. The Obama administration is trying to raise that number.\u201cIf young Americans are able to understand China, able, through our educational exchanges, to study in China, that will be invaluable experience for one of the principal actors in the global economy,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said.Mrs. Obama will document her trip on a White House blog. Students will be able to follow Mrs. Obama and participate in virtual discussions using the websites for PBS LearningMedia and Discovery Education. Ms. Peng will greet Mrs. Obama when she arrives in Beijing on Thursday after an overnight flight. They will visit a school and tour the Forbidden City before taking in dinner and a performance. Mrs. Obama will also address American students at Peking University and visit the Great Wall. Later in the trip, she will view the terra cotta warriors and visit the Walled City in Xi\u2019an, and visit a school in Chengdu specializing in technology. The trip will last seven days. It is Mrs. Obama\u2019s third trip abroad as first lady without her husband.Experts on the office of the first lady say the context of Mrs. Obama\u2019s visit is quite different. Throughout her time in the White House, she has been decidedly nonpolitical, they say, and her focus on education and young people in China fits neatly with the causes she champions at home and on other trips abroad. Will she be able to avoid calling attention to politics? \u201cIt\u2019s a very tightly controlled schedule, and there is no media and no interviews, so it\u2019s entirely possible,\u201d said Anita McBride, who was Laura Bush\u2019s chief of staff and now runs a program at American University on first ladies. \u201cBoth teams are going to do everything they can to prevent it from going in that direction.\u201dThere is no plan for Mrs. Obama to meet with Mr. Xi, though Mr. Rhodes said, \u201cWe would certainly welcome the opportunity should it arise.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Swiss Confront the Costs of Curbing Foreign Labor", "Date": "2014-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHAYNGEN, Switzerland \u2014 Werner Bernhard, who was selling roasted chicken from a cart across from the train station in this prosperous village north of Zurich, is eager to see Switzerland close its borders to some of the thousands of European Union citizens who come here every year.\u201cLook at that parking lot in front of us,\u201d Mr. Bernhard fumed. \u201cIt\u2019s full of German license plates. They take the train to Zurich and come back in the evening with their pockets full of money. There are foreigners all over the place. And I can\u2019t get a job. Do you think I want to sell chickens? I am a graphic designer.\u201dOne month after the Swiss voted to clamp down on immigration, putting the country at loggerheads with the 28-nation European Union and its policy of free movement of people, Switzerland is confronting the practical complexities and potentially substantial economic costs of turning the anti-immigration vote into new laws and regulation \u2014 and coming to terms with citizens like Mr. Bernhard who were, before the vote, somehow rendered invisible by this country\u2019s booming economy.The vote, a referendum on a measure put forward by a far-right party, was not initially taken seriously by opponents. But it passed by a slim margin, requiring the development of quotas for foreigners and priority hiring for the Swiss.Now the government is technically obligated to go forward with these policies within three years. Even experts in Swiss constitutional law are scratching their heads, wondering what Swiss officials could come up with that might satisfy the referendum and yet keep the country in the good graces of the European Union. Switzerland is not a member of the bloc, but it is the country\u2019s main trading partner.Such uncertainty is already prompting discomfort in Switzerland\u2019s large multinational business community, which has been able to enjoy both the country\u2019s low tax rates and the ability to pluck talent from anywhere in Europe. Up the road from here, the mayor of Neuhausen, Stephan Rawyler, said he had heard one multinational company in his village say almost immediately that plans to expand there had been canceled. The company will probably turn to Ireland instead.\u201cIt worries me very much,\u201d Mr. Rawyler said. \u201cAbout 20 years ago we lost about half our jobs, and it was very difficult.\u201dSwiss officials have been trying to calm the waters with the European Union. But many officials here worry that no matter what happens, Switzerland will pay a heavy cost for the anti-foreigner vote.\u201cWe used to be seen as a place of stability, which is what businesses like,\u201d said Jacqueline Fehr, a member of the Social Democratic Party who represents Zurich in the lower house of Parliament. \u201cBut this referendum may have changed that even more dramatically than we realized. If you are an outsider, you have to wonder, \u2018What will be the next crazy decision coming out of Switzerland?\u2019\u00a0\u201dSwitzerland, through a series of bilateral treaties with the European Union, has had virtual member status, but in exchange it agreed to adhere to the union\u2019s core principles, including the freedom of movement of goods and people within the bloc. With far-right parties increasingly questioning these principles, union officials have already shown an inclination to stand tough.When, shortly after the vote, Swiss officials backed away from a routine treaty that would have given Croatians, as new European Union members, access to Switzerland, the bloc reacted quickly. It notified the government that Swiss students would no longer be eligible for its prestigious Erasmus student exchange program and that its scientists would be excluded from competing for European research funds \u2014 more than 80 billion euros, or $111.5 billion, over the next seven years.\u201cIf you are a really ambitious scientist in Slovakia now, would you come here?\u201d Ms. Fehr asked. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you would risk it.\u201dOn the surface it is not hard to see why the Swiss government was taken by surprise by the vote. While much of Europe is mired in debt and financial difficulties, all seems extraordinarily well in Switzerland, where unemployment is negligible. Even among young people, the unemployment rate is only 5 percent, compared with about 50 percent in Spain and Greece, for instance.To some degree, it is Switzerland\u2019s prosperity, along with the resulting crowded trains, urban sprawl and an ever-growing number of foreigners, that has caused the unease among the Swiss who voted for the new limits on immigration.Foreigners now make up 23 percent of the population, a huge number compared with other European countries like France, which has about 6 percent, and Germany, which has about 8 percent. Last year 80,000 foreigners arrived in Switzerland, roughly the same amount as in every year for the last decade.On top of that, thousands more drive over the border every day from France, Germany and Italy to work here, eager for Swiss salaries that are often higher than what they can earn at home.Switzerland has hosted many foreigners at other points in its history, such as when thousands of construction workers helped build tunnels through the Alps. But those immigrants created wealth and opportunity for the Swiss. Recently, immigrants have been more educated, multilingual and managerial, leaving some Swiss, like Mr. Bernhard, feeling that they are losing out. \u201cOn a macro level everything is fine,\u201d said Rudolf Minsch, a board member of Economiesuisse, an umbrella organization for Swiss industry associations. \u201cBut on a micro level everybody has a story, a son or an uncle who didn\u2019t get the job. And of course, they don\u2019t really consider whether they were as qualified as they should be.\u201dIn Thayngen, which is near the German border and home to several multinational companies, including Unilever, the percentage of those voting in favor of the referendum was among the highest in the country, at 68 percent.\u201cEverything is just over the top,\u201d said Beat Schneckenburger, a retired banker in Thayngen who was watching over his grandchildren in the village playground. He believes that many people voted for the referendum, as he did, to protest the rapid changes the country is experiencing, without truly expecting it would pass. \u201cThere is no way to control the number of people coming here. Would the U.S. put up with that? We will be able to get the workers we need without Brussels telling us what to do.\u201dBefore the vote on Feb 9, surveys indicated that the referendum would be voted down. Instead, the referendum passed, barely, with 50.3 percent of the vote, a number that masks huge regional differences. The French-speaking part of the country voted heavily against the referendum. In German and Italian areas, particularly in rural regions, the vote was overwhelmingly in favor of putting a lid on immigration.What to do now is a major topic of discussion across the country, with even some members of the far-right party, the Swiss People\u2019s Party, saying that they had never supported the referendum. But holding another vote would make the Swiss angry, experts say, and could produce an even larger approval of limits on immigration.Walter K\u00e4lin, a constitutional expert, pointed out that when Switzerland first refused to enter the European Union in the 1990s, it caused a recession. But eventually, the country found a solution in the bilateral agreements that have given it all but equal status.Perhaps another such solution is out there to be found, he said. One idea is to establish a quota so high that it would not block the movement of European workers. Or perhaps it is a combination of high quotas and changes to tax laws, which could make the country less attractive to outside workers. Or a broader package of measures giving smaller towns more support to deal with foreigners in their schools.\u201cBut whatever it is,\u201d Mr. K\u00e4lin said with a sigh, \u201cwe will pay for this vote. We already have with the Erasmus and the scientists.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Top Russians Face Sanctions by U.S. for Crimea Crisis", "Date": "2014-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States prepared Monday to impose sanctions on high-level Russian officials involved in the military occupation of Crimea, as the escalating crisis in Ukraine prompted turmoil in global markets, pounding the Russian ruble and driving up energy prices.The Obama administration suspended military ties to Russia, including exercises, port visits and planning meetings, just a day after calling off trade talks. If Moscow does not reverse course, officials said they would ban visas and freeze assets of select Russian officials in the chain of command as well as target state-run financial institutions. Congressional leaders signaled that they would follow with sanctions of their own, and quickly approve economic aid for the fragile, new pro-Western government in Ukraine.The besieged Kiev government said Monday that the Russians had deployed 16,000 troops in the region over the past week and had demanded that Ukrainian forces there surrender within hours or face armed assault. While Russia denied it had issued any ultimatums, it was clearly moving to strengthen its control over Crimea, the largely Russian-speaking peninsula in southern Ukraine where Moscow has long maintained a military base. In response to the Russian moves, European leaders indicated Monday that they would go along with limited action like suspending unrelated talks with Moscow and halting arms sales, but they resisted more sweeping efforts to curb commercial activity and investment in Russia. 14 PhotosGerman officials emphasized the need for diplomacy, while Dutch diplomats ruled out sanctions for now. A British document photographed by a journalist said the government of Prime Minister David Cameron would not support trade sanctions or block Russian money from the British market.Without European backing, American officials worry that economic sanctions may not carry enough bite to persuade President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to reverse course in Ukraine. By itself, the United States is not even among Russia\u2019s top 10 trading partners, with no more than $40 billion in exports and imports exchanged between the two each year. By contrast, Europe does about $460 billion in business with Russia, giving it far more potential clout, but also exposing it to far more potential risk.\u201cIt\u2019s particularly important for the United States to bring Europe along,\u201d said Julianne Smith, a former national security aide to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cTo the extent that the United States tries to put economic pressure on Russian industry, they won\u2019t feel the impact as much as they would if we had Europe standing with us. That\u2019s easier said than done.\u201dEven without taking action, Western officials hoped the immediate and unscripted reaction of world markets would give Moscow pause. Russia\u2019s benchmark stock index dropped 9.4 percent, and the ruble fell to a record low against the dollar. The Russian central bank took the extraordinary step of raising interest rates by 1.5 percentage points, spending an estimated $20 billion to support the currency.In his first public comments on the confrontation in three days, President Obama said Monday that he was focused on assembling an economic aid package to shore up the Ukrainian government and asked that Congress make it \u201cthe first order of business,\u201d drawing quick endorsements on Capitol Hill.\u201cWhat we are also indicating to the Russians,\u201d Mr. Obama added, \u201cis that if, in fact, they continue on the current trajectory that they\u2019re on, that we are examining a whole series of steps \u2014 economic, diplomatic \u2014 that will isolate Russia and will have a negative impact on Russia\u2019s economy and its standing in the world.\u201dSecretary of State John Kerry\u2019s spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, went even further: \u201cAt this point, we\u2019re not just considering sanctions, given the actions Russia is taking.\u201dRussia responded that it was only protecting its interests and those of Russians in Ukraine. \u201cThose who try to interpret the situation as an act of aggression, threaten us with sanctions and boycotts, are the same partners who have been consistently and vigorously encouraging the political powers close to them to declare ultimatums and renounce dialogue,\u201d Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said in a speech in Geneva.The Pentagon press secretary, Rear Adm. John Kirby, said in a statement: \u201cAlthough the Department of Defense finds value in the military-to-military relationship with the Russian Federation we have developed over the past few years to increase transparency, build understanding and reduce the risk of military miscalculation, we have, in light of recent events in Ukraine, put on hold all military-to-military engagements between the United States and Russia.\u201d The crisis prompted tense meetings at the United Nations, NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. NATO called its second emergency meeting on Ukraine in response to a request from Poland under Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty relating to threats to a member state\u2019s security and independence.Meeting in Brussels, European Union foreign ministers called on Moscow to return its troops to their bases. They also threatened to freeze visa liberalization and economic cooperation talks and skip a Group of 8 summit meeting to be hosted by Russia in June. Heads of the European Union governments will meet in emergency session on Thursday to discuss the measures.But the Europeans made clear they were not yet willing to go as far as the United States in terms of economic strictures at this point. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German foreign minister, said that \u201ccrisis diplomacy is not a weakness, but it will be more important than ever to not fall into the abyss of military escalation.\u201dFrans Timmermans, the foreign minister for the Netherlands, the largest Russian export market, told reporters that \u201csanctions are not in order today but sanctions will become inevitable\u201d if there is no change in Russia\u2019s position.Visiting Kiev, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, William Hague, urged Russia to pull back its forces or face \u201csignificant costs,\u201d echoing comments made by Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry, who was to arrive in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, on Tuesday.But a British government document carried by an official near 10 Downing Street in London and photographed by a journalist indicated a resistance to tougher measures. The document, shown on the BBC, said that Britain should support ways of providing energy to Ukraine \u201cif Russia cuts them off\u201d but that European ministers should \u201cdiscourage any discussion\u201d of military preparations. \u201cThe U.K. should not support for now trade sanctions or close London\u2019s financial center to Russians,\u201d the document said. Russia is effectively the world\u2019s biggest energy supplier, exporting more natural gas than any other country and more oil than any other nation after Saudi Arabia. Russia is also the biggest exporter of industrial metals and the fifth-biggest consumer market globally. \u201cThe biggest argument for severe economic sanctions not being imposed is that the European countries don\u2019t have much of an alternative to Russian energy supplies,\u201d said Jens Nordvig, the New York-based managing director of currency research at Nomura Holdings Inc. Several of the biggest Western energy companies have major investments in Russia, including B.P. and Royal Dutch Shell.It may also be difficult for Mr. Obama to sell sanctions to the American business community if it is being cut off while competitors still have access to Russian markets. Russia is Pepsi\u2019s second-largest market and a significant market, too, for companies like Boeing, General Motors, John Deere and Procter & Gamble.ExxonMobil, the largest American oil company, has a joint venture deal with the state-controlled oil company, Rosneft, to explore what may be a very rich Arctic area called the Kara Sea. ExxonMobil is also working with Rosneft on drilling in the Baltic Sea and on other projects.But congressional leaders said they would move forward with sanctions as well as aid to Ukraine. A Senate Foreign Relations Committee bill would use $200 million in aid and loan guarantees to leverage $1 billion in international economic assistance. An additional $50 million would be steered from existing State Department accounts for electoral administration.Beyond that, lawmakers are drafting legislation focused on denying visas to members of Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle and denying Russia assistance through the International Monetary Fund. Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, said House leaders were reviewing measures aimed at \u201cRussian officials, oligarchs and other individuals complicit in Russia\u2019s efforts to invade and interfere with Ukraine\u2019s sovereign affairs.\u201dReporting was contributed by Steven Erlanger from Kiev, Ukraine; Liz Alderman and David Jolly from Paris; Stanley Reed from London; and Jonathan Weisman from Washington.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Western Businesses in Russia, Watchful and Wary", "Date": "2014-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Shortly after pro-Russian troops infiltrated Crimea last weekend, the phone in Alexis Rodzianko\u2019s Moscow office started ringing. He is president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, and local managers for some of the world\u2019s biggest brands were calling to discuss the safety of their operations and the risks that might arise if the West were to impose sanctions.A few miles away, at the Association of European Businesses, the main trade group for European multinationals, a similar scene unfolded. They all had an overarching concern: How hard might their Russian operations be hit if the turmoil kept escalating?\u201cForeign companies have seen many ups and downs in their relationship with Russia, and we hope this is just another one of them,\u201d Mr. Rodzianko said. \u201cBut this situation is full of uncertainties.\u201dWestern multinationals with big investments in Russia have faced other crises over the years. But the standoff between Russia and the West is posing a range of new challenges that threaten to undermine Western companies\u2019 business in Russia.American companies including PepsiCo, McDonald\u2019s and John Deere are active in Russia, of course. But for many Western European businesses, that market is even more crucial.In Paris, officials at the French carmaker Renault have been in constant contact with their Russia-based executives to assess the rapidly shifting climate in the country, where Renault has a pivotal joint venture. Directors at Porsche in Stuttgart, Germany, are analyzing political frictions. At the giant beer brewer Carlsberg, managers in Copenhagen are providing additional security for assets and employees in Russia and Ukraine, the company\u2019s biggest markets.\u201cRussia is important for European and American companies,\u201d said Chris Weafer, co-founder of Moscow-based Macro Advisory, a consulting firm. \u201cWith events escalating and bringing Russia into greater conflict with Western governments, there could be serious consequences.\u201dOne of the biggest concerns is that international sanctions may hit Russia\u2019s large but increasingly sluggish economy and prod Moscow to retaliate against Western interests.\u201cThis is a situation in which those applying the sanctions will get hurt as much as the side being sanctioned,\u201d Mr. Rodzianko said.The European Union\u2019s economy is tightly intertwined with Russia\u2019s. Europe does about $460 billion in business there, much of it in the energy sector, making it Moscow\u2019s largest trading partner. And more than half of Russia\u2019s foreign investment comes from European multinationals and financial institutions.The United States is not even among Russia\u2019s top 10 trading partners, exchanging around $40 billion worth of exports and imports each year. And yet, Russia remains a crucial market for American retail, construction and energy companies, as well as some of the biggest United States banks.On Thursday, the United States and its allies imposed visa bans on individuals deemed responsible for undermining Ukrainian sovereignty, and threatened further sanctions if Russia did not de-escalate tensions. The Kremlin warned of countermeasures, including possibly seizing American property in Russia.Earlier in the week Russian lawmakers also considered a proposed law allowing for the confiscation of property, assets and accounts of Western companies. Other Russian officials advocated dropping the dollar as a reserve currency and refusing to pay off Russian loans to American banks.So far, the Russian threats have been only that. But the tenor of the statements has made Western multinationals jittery.European businesses \u201chave no interests in any deterioration of the current international situation linked to Ukraine,\u201d Frank Schauff, the chief executive of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, said on Friday. \u201cWe call upon all parties to engage in a constructive dialogue, which will secure stability, welfare and economic growth on the European Continent.\u201dEuropean Union leaders are not eager to pick an economics fight. A document photographed in the hands of a British official near 10 Downing Street this week and shown by the BBC read in part, \u201cThe U.K. should not support for now trade sanctions or close London\u2019s financial center to Russians.\u201dChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose economy has deep ties to Russia, has also been reluctant to rush into sanctions.The visa bans announced so far will not hit Russia financially. But any trade curbs could be painful. After years of growth propelled by oil and natural gas, the Russian economy is already slumping toward a recession. The ruble has been increasingly volatile against the dollar and the euro, and dipped to record lows against those currencies after the Russians moved into Crimea.J\u00e9r\u00f4me Stoll, head of sales at Renault, said in a recent interview that the company\u2019s top management was pondering what to do if a devalued ruble caused inflation to rise and undercut the buying power of Russian consumers.Renault executives are discussing \u201chow we can cope with the situation in case we have to raise our prices,\u201d Mr. Stoll said.But the situation is still too fluid to gauge the impact, he said. \u201cWhen you have such a big financial crisis,\u201d he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t know how the situation will move.\u201d Asked whether Renault had expressed its concern to the Russian government, he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not our duty.\u201dAmerican companies are also nervously watching Russia. Those companies include Ford Motor, which operates three assembly plants in Russia and recently formed a joint venture there.The John Deere Company, one of the world\u2019s biggest makers of farm equipment, has two factories and an operations office in Russia. \u201cWe have taken steps to ensure the safety of our employees and have restricted travel in the region,\u201d said Ken Golden, director of global public relations for Deere. Mr. Golden would not specify what those steps were.While Russia represents less than 5 percent of Deere\u2019s total equipment sales, the company recently cited Russia as being key to its future growth. \u201cWe urge political leaders to solve this issue without violence and in accord with international agreements,\u201d Mr. Golden said.Russia is Pepsi\u2019s largest market outside the United States, contributing nearly $5 billion in annual revenue, about 7 percent of the company\u2019s total. McDonald\u2019s also has a sizable presence. The fast-food giant, which was the official restaurant of the recent Olympic Games in Sochi, has 413 Russian restaurants generating $2.5 billion a year, or around 9 percent of the company\u2019s total revenue, according to an analysis by Deutsche Bank Securities.\u201cRussia is a high-growth market, and it\u2019s important to them,\u201d said Jason West, a research analyst for Deutsche Bank. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how bad things are going to get yet, but it could really hurt growth prospects.\u201dNor are Russian companies immune to the turmoil. State-owned banks that could be the target of further Western sanctions were pounded this week on Russia\u2019s stock exchange. Shares in Gazprom, the behemoth Russian gas producer that sends gas through Ukraine to European markets, have also slumped.Despite the uncertainty, American and European companies are hunkering down. None yet seem ready to heed Mr. Kerry\u2019s admonition to \u201cstart thinking twice about whether they want to do business with a country that behaves like this.\u201dIt is not that simple, according to Mr. Rodzianko of the American Chamber.\u201cNobody is particularly happy with the fact that the business climate is suffering, but you don\u2019t come in here, build a plant, and pull out tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stick to our knitting, and deal with the setbacks until the climate improves.\u201dRebecca Ruiz contributed reporting from New York and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}

Tesla is valued at 119 times its expected earnings and Twitter, which has not yet made a profit, is trading at more than 3,000 times as much as what analysts expect it to earn this year.\u201cThe real story in the market is this valuation correction\u201d and investors\u2019 declining taste for risk, said Steve Massocca, a fund manager for the Wedbush Hedged Dividend Fund. \u201cThe more speculative areas have seen money come out of them in a hurry.\u201dCitigroup was one of the biggest decliners in the S.&P. 500, falling $2.71, or 5.4 percent, to $47.45, after the Federal Reserve criticized the bank\u2019s financial projections and raised concerns about its capital. Investors had been bidding up the big banks\u2019 stock prices in anticipation that the Fed would allow the banks, five years after the financial crisis, to return more money to investors. The nation\u2019s biggest banks have proposed $22.79 billion in dividends this year, a 23 percent increase from a year ago, according to data from Thomson Reuters. As they have often done in recent weeks, investors looked past the latest positive reports on the economy. The government estimated that the economy expanded at a 2.6 percent rate between October and December, slightly better than previously thought. Consumer spending rose at the fastest pace in three years. The government also said the number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell 10,000 last week to 311,000, the lowest level since late November. Economic data has had less impact on the stock market recently as many investors assume that this year\u2019s harsh winter has skewed the data. At the same time, many attribute improvements in economic indicators this month to a temporary bounce because of pent-up demand.\u201cWe are not likely to get \u2018pure\u2019 data until the summer,\u201d said Andres Garcia-Amaya, a global market strategist for J. P. Morgan funds. Among the stocks on the move, the video game retail chain GameStop fell $1.57, or 4 percent, to $37.33. The company reported higher fourth-quarter earnings, but missed analysts\u2019 forecasts. King Digital Entertainment, the producer of the Candy Crush Saga video game, continued to slide a day after flopping in its stock market debut, dropping 51 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $18.49. It plunged 15.6 percent the day before.In the bond market, interest rates showed little change. The yield on the Treasury\u2019s 10-year note slipped to 2.68 percent from 2.69 percent late on Wednesday, and its price rose 3/32, to 100 19/32. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Years Later, Tea Party Is a Faction Republicans Must Court", "Date": "2014-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneRoss Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.The Tea Party in Texas got its start five years ago \u2014 Happy Birthday \u2014 and has become the favorite label for a no-compromises variety of conservatism that might or might not have anything to do with the original idea embodied in the T.E.A. acronym: Taxed Enough Already.The political mood of the group at its start recalled Ross Perot\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign, with its charts and talk of ballooning federal spending and debt. On the Democratic side, Bill Clinton was ringing some of the same bells with concerned voters in a campaign branded with the now-familiar slogan: \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201dThose initial Tea Party rallies had little to do with social conservatism; the focus was squarely on the fiscal side. It was the economy all over again, a reaction to a then-new Democratic president, stimulus packages, federal spending and debt. It also had a new and strong element of federalism, a motif adopted quickly by Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and other conservatives who heard the anti-Washington melody and started humming along.Mr. Perry popped out a book \u2014 \u201cFed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington\u201d \u2014 and then rode the themes through his 2010 re-election campaign. The first round pitted Mr. Perry against United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a popular Republican who found herself suddenly identified as a denizen of horrible Washington, and Debra Medina, a newcomer with legitimate ties to the new Tea Party.Politicians are magpies, stealing anything that looks like it works, and this Tea Party thing works. The 2010 general election \u2014 President Obama\u2019s first midterm \u2014 was a Republican windfall in Texas. The most visible evidence was in the state House, where Republicans turned a two-vote edge into a supermajority in that November election.Since then, it has been all but impossible to find a Republican in Texas who does not court the Tea Party. It has been appropriated, standing not as a separate entity or movement so much as the label for the most energetic faction within the Republican Party. More than half of Republican voters tell pollsters that they would be Tea Party members if that and the Republican Party were separate.It no longer works as an identifier separating fiscal from social conservatives, or from movement conservatives, or populists, or the establishment, or moderates. With the appropriation of the group\u2019s energy, Republicans have blurred the lines and made labeling tricky, like they did in other times with the religious right. Successful candidates have jumped into the fastest-moving line, which is one of the reasons they are successful candidates.The federal candidates who faced serious or noisy challenges \u2014 United States Senator John Cornyn and United States Representative Pete Sessions of Dallas \u2014 got away easily this week. But those results had more to do with the shortcomings of the challengers than with the strength of the various Republican factions.Not all of Tuesday\u2019s winners carried the Tea Party label, but it is hard to find a winner anywhere on the Republican ballot who ignored the party\u2019s most animated wing. In Texas, that wing has outflanked the establishment.rramsey@texastribune.org Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Health Security and Infectious Disease", "Date": "2014-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:The last decade has seen a renaissance of advanced low-cost molecular diagnostics to detect and monitor the spread of deadly infectious agents, including drug-resistant variants. A single organism can now be reliably identified from small amounts of human blood, tissue and respiratory specimens, as well as from environmental sources like air and water.The global installation of new technology allows multidrug-resistant tuberculosis to be diagnosed as effectively in a poverty-ridden township in South Africa as it is in the most sophisticated clinic in the United States.Health security is a global necessity and must remain a domestic priority. The United States and Europe should lead the way to expand our surveillance networks in rural and urban communities, and transportation hubs.Integrated regional, national and global networked diagnostics are an important start. Yet true health security will require a further investment in the entire global health care enterprise. Diagnosing an infection without the ability to treat and manage patients effectively renders diagnostics useless. It is time for a comprehensive investment plan that addresses total global health needs.The writer is executive director of the Public Health Research Institute and the Rutgers Regional Biocontainment Laboratory, a global center for infectious diseases and biodefense research at New Jersey Medical School-Rutgers.\u00a0To the Editor:We wholeheartedly agree with the new initiative for global surveillance of infectious diseases announced by the Obama administration. Preventive measures and prompt responses clearly save thousands of lives.The obvious examples come from emerging diseases with rapid and devastating outcomes like SARS or Ebola, but surveillance must include diseases with less dramatic clinical courses, especially for antibiotic resistance.Many common diseases have the potential to become epidemics with just a few seemingly trivial genetic changes. These are precisely the diseases that creep up without causing much of a stir. The MRSA epidemic (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) gained traction and spread across the United States before we could respond. MRSA spreads mostly asymptomatically from carrier to carrier, presenting most often as a treatable skin infection.Today, MRSA causes about as many deaths in the United States as H.I.V. There has been a similar insidious rise in CRE, or carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Monitoring common diseases creates new surveillance challenges, but new technologies offer cost-effective strategies that can be carried out now.\u00a0To the Editor:The critical role that wildlife and domestic animals play in the spread of disease cannot be stressed enough. For example, the vehicle for SARS was likely the civet. Studies by the United States Agency for International Development from wildlife have yielded 300 new viruses with the potential to infect people.Studies suggest that there is a potential of tens of thousands of additional, undiscovered, similar viruses. The emphasis now is to prevent these viruses from moving from \u201chot spots\u201d driven by behavioral, epidemiological and economic factors associated with zoonotic disease emergence.This endeavor requires teams of scientists with backgrounds in medicine, veterinary medicine, public health, wildlife biology, microbiology and animal science to tackle the complex environmental and ecological factors involved in preventing the rapid spread of these diseases to animal and human populations.Thus, the continued funding of programs by U.S.A.I.D. and others will reduce pandemics and minimize the cost to global economies.The writer, dean emeritus of the School of Veterinary Medicine at U.C.

{"Headline": "Dreaming in Code", "Date": "2014-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn June of this year, the World Cup in Brazil will begin not with a flashy musical number or a team of flying acrobats but with a simple scientific demonstration. A paralyzed teenager will make the ceremonial first kick. This feat will be accomplished through an \u201cexoskeleton\u201d directly controlled by the teenager\u2019s thoughts and read through a helmet-mounted EEG machine. That kick, guided by an extraordinary brain-to-machine interface, may be our initiation into our post-human future. In that brave new world our memories will be recorded and swapped like old videotapes, self-aware robots will be our companions, and our consciousness, downloaded onto machines, will live forever. It\u2019s a future Michio Kaku, the string theorist turned popular scientist, believes is inevitable and closer than we think. In his previous book, \u201cPhysics of the Future,\u201d Kaku took readers on a whirlwind tour of science fictions he believes are poised to become science realities: space travel and nanotech medical robots. In \u201cThe Future of the Mind,\u201d Kaku ushers us to even stranger territory \u2014 the science of consciousness. Kaku claims the mysteries of the mind will soon be mysteries no more. It\u2019s an audacious assertion backed up, he says, by a flood of new neuroscience technologies. But behind his buoyant optimism lie questions that threaten the enterprise he describes so skillfully. What does a science of the mind, rather than the brain, look like? Does such a science require reducing the mind to \u201cjust neurons,\u201d or are there other paths to understanding the phenomena of consciousness? For Kaku, the brain is a computer made of meat, and understanding the mind is just a really, really hard engineering problem. The fundamental laws are already known, and Kaku tells us we\u2019ll soon be manipulating the stuff of consciousness with the same acuity we push electrons around in our digital devices. This singular confidence is both strength and weakness as Kaku unspools his narrative, and doubts about his core convictions begin to trail the reader like a parade of ghosts. Kaku takes us to laboratories where researchers are studying the microscopic dynamics of the brain\u2019s wiring. For example, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which tracks neural activity, researchers have recorded how the brain lights up when shown fragments of a video. Scientists can then determine a subject\u2019s neural response to seeing various things. Comparing this dictionary of neural responses to the observed fMRI patterns in a person viewing a different film, researchers can reconstruct a reasonable facsimile of the film based purely on brain activity. With this kind of technique it may even be possible for scientists to crudely identify what people hooked to fMRI machines are dreaming about. From these developments, Kaku imagines an era when memories can be recorded and then played back into someone else\u2019s head by stimulating the same pattern of neural activity. Going one step further, machines wired directly to brains will be able to read and transmit our thoughts instantaneously. Minds made of meat (ours) are just one of Kaku\u2019s concerns. He is also interested in the possibilities of silicon and even alien minds. A compelling chapter on artificial intelligence describes the explosion in robotics and the new research that seeks to broaden the requirements for silicon self-consciousness, including a capacity to feel emotion.Like the futurist Ray Kurzweil, Kaku believes the most important advances in silicon computing will still serve our needs and not the coming robot overlords (if we do create them). By mapping out the \u201cconnectome\u201d \u2014 the explicit account of every neural connection in your head \u2014 Kaku tells us it should be possible to reverse-engineer each and every person\u2019s brain. Reconstruct this connectome in a computer and you will have downloaded yourself into that machine. In this way the future of the mind, your mind in particular, might last as long as there are computers to run your connectome.But are you nothing more than the sum of your brain\u2019s connections? Here\u2019s where Kaku stumbles. It\u2019s been almost 20 years since the philosopher David Chalmers introduced the distinction between \u201ceasy\u201d and \u201chard\u201d problems in the study of consciousness. Easy problems, according to Chalmers, were things like figuring out how the brain cycles through signals from the arm allowing you to pick up an object. Researchers developing the next generation of prosthetics will tell you this \u201ceasy\u201d problem remains pretty hard, but as Chalmers rightly pointed out, control of the arm is nothing compared with developing a scientific account of the vividness of our own experience. It\u2019s the internal luminosity \u2014 the \u201cbeing\u201d of our being \u2014 that constitutes Chalmers\u2019s hard problem and that eludes Kaku\u2019s engineering-\u00adbased perspective.The problem is that we still don\u2019t have much in the way of a working model of consciousness. With a physicist\u2019s eye for economy, Kaku tries to provide one through what he calls a \u201cspace-time theory.\u201d It\u2019s a model of consciousness with a graded scale of awareness based on the number of feedback loops between environment and organism. Thus, in Kaku\u2019s view, a thermostat has the lowest possible level of consciousness while humans, with our ability to move through space and project ourselves mentally backward and forward in time, represent the highest level currently known. I\u2019ve spent most of my professional life running supercomputer simulations of events like the collapsing of interstellar gas clouds to form new stars, and it seems to me that Kaku has taken a metaphor and mistaken it for a mechanism. There has always been the temptation to take the latest technology, like clockworks in the 17th century, and see it as a model for the mechanics of thought. But simulations are not a self, and information is not experience. Kaku acknowledges the existence of the hard problem but waves it away. \u201cThere is no such thing as the Hard Problem,\u201d he writes. Thus the essential mystery of our lives \u2014 the strange sense of presence to which we\u2019re bound till death and that lies at the heart of so much poetry, art and music \u2014 is dismissed as a non-problem when it\u2019s exactly the problem we can\u2019t ignore. If we\u2019re to have anything like a final theory of consciousness, we had better be attentive to the complexity of how we experience our being.When Kaku quotes the cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky telling us that \u201cminds are simply what brains do,\u201d he assumes that scientific accounts of consciousness must reduce to discussions of circuitry and programming alone. But there are other options. For those pursuing ideas of \u201cemergence,\u201d descriptions of lower-level structures, like neurons, don\u2019t exhaust nature\u2019s creative potential. There\u2019s also the more radical possibility that some rudimentary form of consciousness must be added to the list of things the world is built of, like mass or electric charge. On the ethical front, Kaku does an admirable job of at least raising the troubling issues inherent in the technologies he describes, but there\u2019s one critical question he misses entirely. The deployment of new technologies tends to create their own realities and values. If we treat minds like meat-computers, we may end up in a world where that\u2019s the only aspect of their nature we perceive or value.Keeping these questions in mind, however, only enhances the enjoyment of this wide-ranging book. Kaku thinks with great breadth, and the vistas he presents us are worth the trip even if some of them turn out to be only dreamscapes.

The three cities are in remote areas, including Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. The dirtiest cities, including Beijing, are in northern China, where coal-fired industries are concentrated; the Yangtze Delta in the east; and the Pearl River Delta in the south. A former health minister, Chen Zhu, has estimated that 350,000 to 500,000 people die prematurely as a result of air pollution each year.The report provides especially dramatic evidence of what the world and the Chinese people have long known \u2014 that China has a huge air pollution problem arising mainly from a policy of industrializing first and cleaning up later. To its credit, China has been making serious efforts to foster renewable energy, studying and seeking to emulate the environmental policies of the advanced economies. One quarter of China\u2019s electricity-generating capacity now derives from wind, solar and hydroelectric sources. But rapid economic growth has not diminished the nation\u2019s appetite for fossil fuels, and while the government is moving to tighten pollution standards on vehicles, many Chinese automobiles are using cheaper and dirtier gasoline than that allowed in Western countries. China is not alone. Around the world, the World Health Organization reports, air pollution contributed to seven million deaths in 2012, with more than a third of those occurring in fast-developing nations like India. Yet the situation in China is so dire that Prime Minister Li Keqiang announced this month a \u201cwar on pollution.\u201d Mr. Li acknowledges the need to find a balance between economic growth and environmental protection. China still needs to elevate several hundred million people out of poverty and into the middle class. But it is past time for China\u2019s leaders to think of growth in the long term and in a comprehensive manner, factoring in the human and economic costs of millions of pollution-related illnesses and deaths.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Crisis in Ukraine Threatens Russia as Market for Auto Sales Growth", "Date": "2014-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENEVA \u2014 This year\u2019s Geneva car show should have been the most upbeat in years. But among auto executives who gathered here on Tuesday, relief about an incipient recovery in the European auto market was clouded by the crisis in Ukraine and the fear that Russia might no longer serve as the source of sales growth it had in the recent past.The auto industry provides one clear example of how political events in Ukraine may have far reaching economic consequences. A prolonged Ukrainian crisis could not only derail the weak rebound in European car sales but also threaten an anemic recovery in the broader European economy, auto executives said.\u201cIt\u2019s a little more complicated than it was a short time ago,\u201d Dan Ammann, the president of General Motors, told reporters in Geneva, referring to Russia.Like most of his fellow auto executives, Mr. Ammann said it was too early to judge how damaging the crisis could be, and he was reluctant to comment on geopolitical matters. But he said: \u201cThe situation in Russia is something we are watching very closely. We do have a significant business in Russia.\u201dGM sold 258,000 vehicles in Russia last year \u2014 a decline of 11 percent from 2012 \u2014 out of a total of 9.7 million worldwide.The problems in Russia and Ukraine come as automakers and other companies are confronting the currency market turmoil that is hurting prospects in emerging-market countries like Turkey and South Africa that have been considered sources of growth.The crisis in Crimea \u201cdoesn\u2019t contribute to improving the overall situation, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, the chairman of Ferrari and a director of its parent, Fiat.Russia, which last year had sales of about 2.6 million vehicles, had been approaching Europe\u2019s leader, Germany, with 2.9 million vehicles, in its importance as an auto market. Europe\u2019s overall auto sales count last year, 11.9 million, was the industry\u2019s worst performance since 1995, and behind the United States market, 15.6 million.Many carmakers have treated Russia as part of the European market, and sales growth there had helped to compensate for the slump in Western Europe. And yet the Russian economy had been under strain because of what foreign investors regard as a poor climate for business, including rampant corruption and a dysfunctional judicial system.Bernhard Maier, a member of the management board of Porsche, said that sales in Russia grew 50 percent in 2012 but that the increase would slow to about 5 percent this year. Last year, Porsche sold about 3,790 vehicles in Russia. While that is less than 3 percent of the company\u2019s worldwide total, it is still significant, he said. Porsche has been in the process of expanding its dealer network in Russia from 22 at the end of last year to 32 by the end of 2018.\u201cRussia is a very important market, simply because of its size,\u201d Mr. Maier said in an interview.Statements by President Vladimir V. Putin on Tuesday, in which he said he did not intend to annex Crimea, helped ease tensions. But investors\u2019 confidence in Russia may have already shattered, with consequences that will not be easy to reverse. For example, a slump by the ruble is likely to lead to higher inflation in Russia as the country pays more, in local currency terms, for imported goods. Russia is heavily dependent on imports for many consumer products.If Russians have less buying power, they may not buy as many cars, said J\u00e9r\u00f4me Stoll, head of sales at Renault, the French automaker. It has an 8 percent share of the Russian market, and 16 percent through a joint venture with the Russian carmaker Avtovaz.Renault may be somewhat insulated from currency turbulence because it buys many parts and raw materials locally, Mr. Stoll said in an interview. But that situation may not be enough to offset the negative effects of inflation. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complex situation,\u201d he said.The conflict between Russia and the United States and Europe, with echoes of the Cold War, comes as the European market is finally looking up. Automakers like Ford Motor reported strong sales increases in Europe at the end of 2013 and so far this year. But, after sustaining the worst slump most have ever seen in their careers, managers are wary about predicting a return to solid growth.\u201cThere is a recovery underway,\u201d Stephen T. Odell, president of Ford of Europe, told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ll take a rain check on how much.\u201dWhile nervous, carmakers are hardly about to abandon Russia. For now, they are hoping that the situation will somehow return to normal.\u201cWe take the long view,\u201d Mark Fields, Ford\u2019s chief operating officer, said in the same session as Mr. Odell.Emerging markets like Russia and India \u201care where much of the growth is coming from in the auto industry,\u201d Mr. Fields said, adding, \u201cWe understand at certain points of time there is volatility.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Island Home, 7 Times Reworked", "Date": "2014-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byST. OUEN, Jersey \u2014 The Le Sueur family has owned this house on the Channel Island of Jersey since 1980. But the original structure looked almost nothing like the three-bedroom, two-bath home that stands here today.It was Albert and Frances Le Sueur, both now deceased, who paid 65,000 pounds, or $108,000 at current exchange rates, for what was then a small two-bedroom masonry house with a roof of gray Welsh slate. The home, built in 1882, initially was called Economy Cottage, but it was renamed Mont Matthieu Cottage sometime before the Le Sueurs came along. The family believes it was intended to house farm laborers who worked on a nearby estate.\u201cThis was a small cottage that had been extended with rather unfortunate flat roof extensions and box-dormered windows, ruining the proportions,\u201d said Richard Le Sueur, a son of the Le Sueurs and the architect behind the later changes. \u201cIt was a challenge to make it livable and a family home. It was in quite a state.\u201dIn 1994, another son, Alec, paid the Le Sueurs the nominal sum of \u00a31 for the 1,360-square-foot, or 126-square-meter, home. It stands on a 5,700-square-foot site along St. Ouen\u2019s Bay, on the western side of the island, and has panoramic views of the Atlantic.Alec Le Sueur, a hotel manager, had worked in London, the French resort city of St.-Tropez and the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, before returning to Jersey the year before the transfer.\u201cThe house changed as we lived in it because our life changed. There was just us, and then the kids arrived,\u201d Alec Le Sueur said, referring to his late wife, Conny, and their two children, Hannah, now 17, and Ruben, now 15. \u201cSo we extended and expanded.\u201d The house has been renovated seven times over the years; additional changes involved covering the dormers with Cape Cod-style shingles. It now has 2,323 square feet of living space.\u201cWe have done an extension pretty much every couple of years since 1993, to keep up with a growing family,\u201d said Alec Le Sueur, who now is an author and whose latest book, \u201cBottoms Up in Belgium,\u201d was published in January. The revisions were a collaborative effort. \u201cConny was the creative talent inside, and Richard, outside,\u201d Alec Le Sueur said, pointing out some of the antiques that his wife had found, including the Belgian bluestone sinks in two bathrooms.During the first renovation in 1993, the front wall of the living room was pushed out to create a dining room, increasing the house to 1,687 square feet. The project, which cost around \u00a3120,000, included insulating the house and reconfiguring some of the dormers.In 2002, a conservatory of painted hardwood was added to the kitchen, increasing the house\u2019s living space by roughly another 100 square feet.That \u00a380,000 project included updating the bathrooms, creating a utility room and installing double-pane windows.The largest addition, increasing the house to 2,323 square feet of living space, came in 2006 when a bedroom, study and bathroom were built over the garage. An outdoor swimming pool also was added in the \u00a3310,000 effort. A balcony and an outdoor room overlooking the pool were created in 2009, providing a further 458 square feet of space, for about \u00a350,000.Today, a visitor enters the house through the living room, which runs the length of what was the original cottage. In the center of the room are stairs of maple and cherry wood made by a local artisan.The ground level also includes the kitchen, a guest room and access to the outdoor terrace and garden.Upstairs there are three bedrooms, an office, an area that the family uses as a reading nook and a deck with broad views of the surrounding area.The house\u2019s location was not an advantage during World War II, when the Channel Islands were the only part of Britain held by the Germans.\u201cAs we have a commanding position of the bay, the home was occupied by the Germans from 1940 until 1945,\u201d Alec Le Sueur said.\u201cThey left behind a bunker in the garden and others scattered all over the headlands.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "When the Scientist Is Also a Philosopher", "Date": "2014-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewDo you want to know a dirty little secret of economists who give policy advice? When we do so, we are often speaking not just as economic scientists, but also as political philosophers. Our recommendations are based not only on our understanding of how the world works, but also on our judgments about what makes a good society.The necessity of political philosophy arises because most policies are good for some people and bad for others. For example, an increase in the minimum wage, as proposed by President Obama, may raise incomes for some low-wage workers, but it will cause some businesses to make smaller profits, some customers to pay more and some workers to lose their jobs.Similarly, the Affordable Care Act has provided greater opportunity for some people to get health insurance, but it also caused cancellations for others who were previously happy with their insurance. Evaluating the overall effect of these policies requires balancing competing interests.If, like a true utilitarian, you have no trouble sacrificing the fat man, try another scenario. You are a doctor with four dying patients. One needs a new liver, one needs a new heart, and two need a new kidney. A perfectly healthy patient walks into your office for his annual checkup. Are you still willing to pursue the utilitarian course of action? At this point, almost everyone balks. Sometimes, respecting natural rights trumps maximizing utility.Another problem with the utilitarian approach is that there is no objective way to compare one person\u2019s happiness with another\u2019s, especially when people have different preferences. Peter may work long hours at a dreary job to earn a high income because he gets a lot of utility from money. Paul may be forgoing a higher income for a job that requires fewer hours or offers more personal satisfaction because he doesn\u2019t care as much about money. In this case, equalizing incomes by moving a dollar from Peter to Paul could reduce total utility.Perhaps the biggest problem with maximizing a social welfare function like utility is practical: We economists often have only a basic understanding of how most policies work. The economy is complex, and economic science is still a primitive body of knowledge. Because unintended consequences are the norm, what seems like a utility-maximizing policy can often backfire.So, what is the alternative? At the very least, a large dose of humility is in order. When evaluating policies, our elected leaders are wise to seek advice from economists. But if an economist is always confident in his judgments, or if he demonizes those who reach opposite conclusions, you know that he is not to be trusted.This principle suggests that when people have voluntarily agreed upon an economic arrangement to their mutual benefit, that arrangement should be respected. (The main exception is when there are adverse effects on third parties \u2014 what economists call \u201cnegative externalities.\u201d) As a result, when a policy is complex, hard to evaluate and disruptive of private transactions, there is good reason to be skeptical of it.As I see it, the minimum wage and the Affordable Care Act are cases in point. Noble as they are in aspiration, they fail the do-no-harm test. An increase in the minimum wage would disrupt some deals that workers and employers have made voluntarily. The Affordable Care Act has disrupted many insurance arrangements that were acceptable to both the insurance company and the insured; these policies were canceled because they deviated from lawmakers\u2019 notion of the ideal.To be sure, you can find economists favoring a higher minimum wage and the Affordable Care Act. They acknowledge that there are winners and losers but argue that, on the whole, these policies increase social welfare.Perhaps they are right. But keep in mind that in making that judgment, they are relying on forecasts from a far-from-perfect science, as well as a healthy dose of their own political philosophy. N.

{"Headline": "Navigating Ways Around Cyprus's Debt", "Date": "2014-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomySunday was the anniversary of Cyprus\u2019s shock plan to raid the island\u2019s bank deposits. The envisaged tax, backed by the euro zone, covered all banks and all deposits, whether insured or not.Although that unwise program was later rescinded, much damage was done to a country already deep in financial crisis. Instead of the nation\u2019s obtaining revenue from a generalized deposit tax, uninsured deposits at the island\u2019s two large troubled lenders suffered big losses. Meanwhile, capital controls were imposed.These restrictions were supposed to be a short-term measure, not that this ever seemed likely. A year later, the most important controls \u2014 preventing people or companies from taking more than small sums out of the country \u2014 are still in place and depressing the economy.Cyprus bears most of the blame for its predicament. But the euro zone is also to blame, as it connived in the deposit grab idea and went along with other bad decisions too. It should now offer a helping hand, especially by enabling the lifting of capital controls.The good news is that the Cypriot economy shrank only 5.4 percent last year. The troika of big creditors \u2014 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 initially projected a drop of nearly 9 percent. There are three main reasons for the relatively good performance. First, tourism \u2014 especially from Russia \u2014 has held up well.Second, the Cypriot economy is flexible. This has meant that companies have mostly been free to cut wages and survive, said Fiona Mullen of Sapienta Economics, a local consulting firm.Third, domestic consumption has fallen less than expected. This may be because most ordinary people were not hit by the loss on their deposits after it was restricted to accounts larger than 100,000 euros, or $139,000. People have also dipped into savings.However, all is not well. One concern is that the Crimean crisis in Ukraine may have an effect on Cyprus if economic problems in Russia or visa restrictions imposed by the West cut the flow of tourists.But even without worrying about Russia, there are problems closer to home. For a start, investment has collapsed. The I.M.F. forecasts that it will end this year 60 percent below its 2008 peak. Some of the decline is healthy: Cyprus had engaged in a real estate binge. But the drop-off in investment in machinery means the country is not building for its future.Part of the explanation is that companies are loaded up with debt. What is more, they cannot get access to new financing because local banks are themselves burdened by bad debts. Total private-sector debt is nearly 300 percent of gross domestic product, and under a stress scenario by Pimco, the asset management firm, 60 percent of this borrowing could turn sour.The high debt means that both companies and consumers will have to tighten their belts. The I.M.F. says that to get borrowing to a sustainable level, companies will have to cut debt by the equivalent of 45 percent of G.D.P., while households will have to cut by 55 percent. This will be a drag on the economy, which the I.M.F. expects to shrink another 4.8 percent this year.There are two things the euro zone should do to help. First, it should enable Cyprus to lift capital controls. It is easy to understand why this has not happened: The troika is worried that people will rush to take their money abroad. The banks would then run out of cash, unless the E.C.B. was willing to authorize the Cypriot central bank to inject liquidity.While this fear is understandable, there could be imaginative ways round the problem. One, suggested by Marios Zachariadis, a member of the country\u2019s national economic council, would be to lift the controls but at the same time impose a large tax \u2014 say 35 percent \u2014 on capital exports. The government could then say it intended to reduce the tax over time, eventually to zero.The advantage of such a program is that if there was not much capital flight, after a couple of months the tax could be cut to, say, 30 percent. Meanwhile, the prospect of the tax\u2019s coming down over time would mean that depositors would have less incentive to run immediately. There would, of course, still be a risk, which the national central bank and E.C.B. would ultimately have to underwrite. But it would be worth taking.The second way of helping Cyprus would be to create a so-called bad bank to take over the bad loans that are infecting the banking system. Such a program has been deployed successfully in Spain and Ireland.The advantage is twofold. Freed of its bad loans, the banking system could focus on financing healthy companies. Meanwhile, the bad bank could operate like an investor, converting debt into equity when borrowers have viable operations or shutting them down when they do not.The I.M.F. and the E.C.B. normally like bad banks following crises. The snag is that somebody needs to finance them \u2014 and the euro zone doesn\u2019t seem eager to commit more money than it is already lending the country.Cyprus may be small enough to forget about, but it is also small enough to help. It has been virtually a model pupil since it came under the troika\u2019s tutelage. Now it should be rewarded.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Growth at End of 2013 Is Revised Downward", "Date": "2014-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe economy finished 2013 on a weaker footing than first thought, the government said on Friday, heightening concern that the United States is in the midst of another of the periodic slow patches that have dogged the recovery over the last five years. The Commerce Department now estimates the economy grew at an annual pace of 2.4 percent in October, November and December, down from an initial estimate of 3.2 percent. The revised figure also represents a substantial slowing from the pace of growth in the third quarter, which totaled 4.1 percent. The department is scheduled to provide one more estimate of growth during the fourth quarter on March 27.The downward revision comes after new data showing lackluster retail sales, inventory adjustments and a slightly less impressive trade balance late last year. Disappointing reports on job creation in December and January have also prompted fear of continued weakness into the spring of 2014.The burst of growth last summer and initial signs of robust activity during the autumn had convinced some experts that the economy was finally achieving the kind of momentum that would be sustainable for more than a quarter or two. But the updated data on Friday suggest the economy was still performing well short of the so-called breakout speed economists and policy makers have been hoping for. Instead, it continues to muddle along at a steady but disappointing pace.From 2010 to 2013, output expanded at an annual rate of about 2.3 percent, strong enough to lift corporate profits and stabilize many parts of the economy, but not fast enough to push unemployment low enough to lead to meaningful wage increases for most workers. That, in turn, has held back big gains in consumer spending, which is responsible for a large share of overall economic growth. \u201cOriginally, we had really glowing expectations for the fourth quarter, but it\u2019s been gradually beaten down from really good to merely better-than-trend,\u201d said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS Securities. \u201cAnd there are questions now about how much is because of weather and how much is because the economy didn\u2019t take off at the end of 2013 the way everybody expected.\u201dMost experts say they expect the economy to continue to expand at an anemic pace in the first few months of 2014, but they are hopeful that growth will pick up through the remainder of the year. Many economists are looking for growth of less than 2 percent in the first quarter of 2014.Despite the underwhelming report on the economy, the stock market continued to push higher. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 16,321.71, up 49.06 points or 0.3 percent, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s \u2019s 500-stock index rose 5.16 points or 0.28 percent, closing at 1,859.45, a new high. The Nasdaq composite dropped 10.814 points, or 0.25 percent, and closed at 4,308.12. In bond trading, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 3/32 to 100 28/32, while its yield increased to 2.65 percent from 2.64 percent late Thursday. One reason for the current weakness on the growth front is the more rapid pace of inventory gains in the second half of 2013, which tends to pull growth forward and then hold back production as stockpiles at warehouses and store shelves are gradually wound down. Mr. Berger said he expected the economy to expand by 1 percent in the first quarter of 2014, but he warned that unless demand picked up significantly, further inventory adjustments might mean an even weaker performance than that in the current quarter.Some optimistic observers, however, say the cold temperatures and repeated snowstorms in many parts of the country since December may be to blame for much of the apparent slowdown, with any temporary hit quickly lifting in the months to come. That\u2019s one reason traders and investors are focusing on the February jobs report, expected on March 7, for clues about whether something more fundamental than weather is at work.The consensus view of economists is that employers added roughly 150,000 positions in February, well above the 113,000 payroll gain in January, with the unemployment rate remaining stable at 6.6 percent. Despite the questions hanging over the economy, Federal Reserve policy makers are expected to continue to slowly ease back on the central bank\u2019s stimulus efforts as long as the labor market shows signs of life, keeping in place the policy they announced in December. The Fed is tapering purchases of government securities by another $10 billion after each meeting of its policy committee. Besides a smaller contribution from exports and retail sales, growth in the fourth quarter was weighed down by a sharp fall in federal government expenditures, including a 14 percent drop in military spending, because of automatic budget cuts imposed by Congress earlier in 2013 and the government shutdown in October. All told, the plunge in spending by Washington shaved 1.05 percentage points off the rate of growth in the quarter. With that kind of decline in government spending unlikely to persist into 2014, there is one less headwind facing the economy this year. Similarly, the pressure on growth now from last year\u2019s inventory buildup should ease as 2014 progresses.Another hopeful sign is healthier investment by businesses in equipment and software in the fourth quarter of 2013, an indication companies might finally be comfortable enough to start deploying their huge cash hoards for expansion. \u201cIt\u2019s a start,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, \u201cand it\u2019s encouraging that it happened in the quarter where we had the government shutdown.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Reprieve for Bristol Bay", "Date": "2014-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe Obama administration announced on Friday that it was putting the brakes on a massive gold and copper mine proposed for the headwaters of Alaska\u2019s Bristol Bay while it decides whether to prohibit it permanently. This sounds like the death knell for a project, known as the Pebble Mine, that by any measure is an environmental disaster waiting to happen. The mine would gravely threaten one of the richest salmon fisheries in the world and disrupt a delicate marine environment prized by conservationists, native tribes and commercial fishing interests alike.The administration has not made a final decision, and will take comment over the next few months. But construction cannot begin until it issues a permit. And judging by the announcement from Gina McCarthy, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, it would be astonishing if it allowed the project to go forward. \u201cExtensive scientific study,\u201d she said, \u201chas given us ample reason to believe that the Pebble Mine would likely have significant and irreversible negative impacts on the Bristol Bay watershed and its abundant salmon fisheries.\u201d The project was designed by a Canadian-British mining consortium (the British partner has since pulled out). It claimed that the mine would add 1,000 permanent jobs to Alaska\u2019s struggling economy while unearthing $300 billion worth of copper, gold and molybdenum. The project came close to defeat in a 2008 referendum until a push by Gov. Sarah Palin turned the tide in the mine\u2019s favor. Over time, the scientific evidence has turned decisively against the project. In two studies, including an assessment in January, the E.P.A. determined that even a carefully designed mining operation would exact a heavy toll on wildlife during construction, destroying more than 80 miles of spawning streams and extensive wetlands. The mine would also generate huge amounts of highly acidic wastes that, in the event of an accident, would pollute streams and wetlands and greatly harm Bristol Bay. Given the science, this is not the hardest environmental decision the administration has faced or will face. It has yet to devise a legally sound plan to protect endangered salmon runs in the Columbia-Snake River Basin. And it must adjudicate between the needs of the endangered sage grouse and the oil industry, which occupy the same lands in the West. But on Bristol Bay, it is headed in just the right direction.Advertisement"}

Silver, whose appointment is to be announced on Friday, has most recently served as the chief planning and development officer and planning director for Raleigh, N.C. In January, he was reported to be on Mr. de Blasio\u2019s short list of candidates to lead the City Planning Commission, but that post went to Carl Weisbrod.While Mr. Silver has worked in North Carolina since 2005, he has deep roots in New York. He went to high school in Brooklyn and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from Pratt Institute and a master\u2019s degree in urban planning from Hunter College.In the late 1980s he worked in the planning department and then for the Manhattan borough president.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Rapid Growth Hits the Brakes", "Date": "2014-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 New pockets of economic weakness in China emerged on Tuesday, as the collapse of a highly indebted real estate developer and weak home sales pointed to a slowdown in the sprawling property sector.The latest batch of difficulties add to the continuing debate over China\u2019s commitment to economic reforms. While Beijing is pushing through initiatives to reform its economy, the worry is that the country\u2019s slowing economy will prompt it to reverse course. The nation\u2019s growth has decelerated to its slowest pace in more than a decade. The default of the developer, the Zhejiang Xingrun Real Estate Investment Company, is likely to heighten the concerns that growth will remain sluggish, at least by China\u2019s standards.The vast real estate market, which has accounted for a significant portion of the gross domestic product, is an essential piece of the economic puzzle. And recent data has prompted concerns about the health of China\u2019s housing market. In the latest example, growth in new-home sales in several of its biggest cities slowed last month from January, data released on Tuesday by the National Bureau of Statistics showed.As the property market comes under pressure, real estate developers are feeling the pinch, especially those with huge debt.Xingrun, a small developer in the coastal city of Ningbo, was unable to repay more than 3.5 billion renminbi ($566 million) in debt, according to reports in Chinese state-run news media on Tuesday. While it is not unheard-of for Chinese property developers to default on loans or to face bankruptcy, the size of Xingrun\u2019s debt load is particularly notable.The failure of the developer also comes two weeks after China\u2019s 8.5 trillion renminbi domestic bond market experienced its first default in recent history. The Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology Company, a maker of solar cells and panels, defaulted after not making an annual interest payment of 89.8 million renminbi on a bond of one billion renminbi.Beijing indicated last week that more defaults were inevitable, although the government would aim to contain the damage.Xingrun had been in financial difficulty for months after having accumulated debt that included bank loans from 19 institutions. China Construction Bank, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and Agricultural Bank of China were the company\u2019s biggest creditors, according to multiple reports in Chinese news media.\u201cXingrun is not the first developer to default, and for sure it won\u2019t be the last,\u201d said Bei Fu, a director of corporate ratings at Standard & Poor\u2019s who focuses on the real estate sector. \u201cWe expect to see a wave of such small developers running into problems this year, both from a financing and operational perspective.\u201dLaw enforcement officials in the city of Fenghua, which is part of Ningbo, have detained Xingrun\u2019s legal representative and its controlling shareholder, a father and son, on suspicion of illegal fund-raising activities, the state-run China News Service reported on its website on Friday. In addition to the bank loans and other debt, local officials found the developer had tapped China\u2019s ubiquitous, but illegal, informal lending networks, raising about 700 million renminbi from 98 individuals, according to the report.Phone calls to Xingrun\u2019s offices went unanswered on Tuesday. A person who answered the phone at the Fenghua government\u2019s information center said he had no information on the case.Chinese property developers are being challenged by a tighter liquidity environment. Banks and other sources of debt financing, like trust companies, are growing cautious as the risk increases that borrowers will be unable to repay loans and interest.At the same time, home prices have been increasing at a slower pace in recent months. The figures released on Tuesday, covering the property markets in the 70 biggest mainland cities, showed that the average price of a newly built home in Beijing rose 0.2 percent in February from January. That compares with an increase of 0.4 percent in January from December. In Shanghai, new-home prices rose 0.4 percent in February, down from a 0.5 percent increase a month earlier.Any slowdown in China\u2019s property market can affect the broader economy, from rattling the balance sheets of the banking system to curbing growth in household consumption. Some analysts have expressed concerns that given the building boom in recent years, China\u2019s residential property market might eventually find itself dealing with significant oversupply.Zhiwei Zhang, the chief China economist at Nomura, described real estate as \u201ca pillar of growth for China\u201d that makes up 16 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, accounts for 26 percent of new loans and contributes 39 percent of government revenue, based on 2013 data. \u201cThe local government debt problem and the shadow banking issue have caught investors\u2019 attention, but alone they are unlikely to cause a systemic crisis in 2014, as the government can bail out troubled trust products and roll over debt,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.\u201cIf property investment slows sharply, policy easing may not be effective, as fundamentally the sector faces a structural oversupply problem.\u201dBettina Wassener contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

By funding securities derived from diced-up mortgages, they argued, they pumped money into the markets and financed dreams. Well, that went well. Now, as the housing market recovers from the crisis they helped to cause, some of these investors are back in the game \u2014 except this time, they\u2019re not financing home buyers. They are bidding against them.From coast to coast, private equity firms, hedge funds and other institutional investors are snapping up houses \u2014 the kind that people actually live in, as opposed to swaps of bundles of slivers of mortgages. A broker in Brooklyn estimated not long ago that 70 percent of local home purchases were by such investors. In a research note last week, Bank of America Merrill Lynch warned that while \u201chome prices have surged,\u201d a \u201chistorically low\u201d share of sales were to first-time buyers. \u201cThe decline in first-time buying has been offset by an increase in demand by investors, including large private equity firms,\u201d the bank said. \u201cThe concern is that demand from investors will fade this year but first-time home buyers won\u2019t be prepared to take back market share as a result of tight credit and years of sluggish income growth.\u201dFrom a buyer\u2019s point of view, the economic history of the last decade reads a lot like this: First Wall Street tried to sell me loans I couldn\u2019t afford. Then it refused to lend me money for what I could afford. Now it is bidding against me.The investors\u2019 binge is fueling anger in American cities. On the website Free Williamsburg, commenters recently bandied about ideas for keeping investors out of Brooklyn, one of the five boroughs of New York City. We could tax them, one suggested. Another proposed tagging investor-owned buildings to \u201clet people know with graffiti and stamps who owns the place.\u201d And there was this, from a user called Rivegauch610: \u201cI would like to see the same fate befall repulsive beings like these as happened to the wealthy in Russia, ca. 1918.\u201dThe fear has to do partly with rising prices, and partly with the loss of character in what were once stable neighborhoods of family-owned homes. The growing role of investors \u2014 who often renovate the houses and rent them out \u2014 also seems to some to augur a return to the majority-renter society that America was before the New Deal and the coming of the Federal Housing Administration in 1934, with its 30-year, government-insured mortgages.There is fear, in short, that homeownership will become once again a capstone of a fruitful life, not a steppingstone to one.Americans wishing to discover what they\u2019re up against need go no further than Juwai.com, a Chinese website offering translated listings of investment properties, including in low-income American neighborhoods. A CNN report last year noted that Chinese buyers alone accounted for nearly one-fifth of all foreign investment in American homes; that they paid a median price of $425,000 for those homes, nearly double the national median; and that 70 percent paid cash.There is sincere disagreement about what to do about this problem \u2014 and about whether it is a problem to begin with. The elusiveness of owning seems to fit into the refrain that \u201caverage is over\u201d among economic observers like Tyler Cowen: The idea that America is entering a new era in which there will be superstars and serfs and not many people in between them. Politicians regularly pledge to build more affordable housing. Others maintain that markets work and that rising prices will encourage new supply.But in cities, where prices are highest, more space isn\u2019t easily made. A more radical approach, suggested by people like Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa, a former mayor of Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, is to reimagine urban land as a kind of public utility. Such a vision holds land to be more like tap water than a classic commodity: bought by the state for use by residents, whether as rental apartments or parks. It is hard to imagine any city in this market-loving nation going that way. But it\u2019s also getting harder to imagine regular people owning regular homes in the urban future that looms.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egyptian General Moves to Formalize Presidential Bid", "Date": "2014-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 Field Marshal Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi edged closer on Tuesday to formalizing his all-but-declared candidacy for president, telling a military academy audience that \u201cprocedures will be finalized over the coming days.\u201d\u201cI cannot turn my back when the majority wants me to run for president,\u201d he said, according to the official news media.Field Marshal Sisi, the defense minister, led the ouster on July 3 of President Mohamed Morsi, Egypt\u2019s first fairly elected head of state and a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. Although he was little known previously, Field Marshal Sisi has ridden a surge of popularity since the takeover and is now universally expected to seek and win the presidency, in elections set to take place this spring.Many Egyptians have embraced him as the embodiment of a promise of stability and progress after three years of turmoil since the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak. But the field marshal has also led a brutal crackdown on his predecessors\u2019 Islamist supporters, and the suppression of dissent has increasingly extended to liberal activists and intellectuals as well.Almost nothing is known of Field Marshal Sisi\u2019s views on any other matters of public policy, including the make-or-break question of how to revive and restructure Egypt\u2019s dysfunctional economy. But so far only one other candidate, Hamdeen Sabahi, who also supported the military takeover, has expressed an intention to run, and Field Marshal Sisi is by far the favorite.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Cool to Idea of Further Retaliation Over Sanctions", "Date": "2014-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Friday formally completed the annexation of Crimea, signing into law bills passed by Parliament reclaiming the contested province from Ukraine.As he cemented Russian control of Crimea, Mr. Putin declared a temporary cease-fire in a tit-for-tat battle of economic and political sanctions between Moscow and the West.Mr. Putin responded to the moves by barring nine American officials and legislators from Moscow. But on Friday he said he did not see the immediate need for further reprisals, while leaving open the door for more later on.With evident sarcasm, he also said in televised remarks that he would open an account at a Russian bank targeted by the American measures, even as the first effects on the country\u2019s economy became clear.Russia\u2019s stock market opened sharply lower on Friday as a second rating agency, Fitch, followed Standard & Poor\u2019s in warning that it would downgrade the country\u2019s credit rating in the wake of the punitive American response to Russia\u2019s move to annex Crimea.Visa and MasterCard ceased operations with Bank Rossiya, the only corporation singled out on Thursday by the new sanctions because it served as a \u201cpersonal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.\u201dMr. Putin, meeting with members of his national security council, suggested in televised remarks that the government was still coming to grips with the impact of the sanctions, aimed at 20 people, including senior government officials and businessmen who have grown rich since Mr. Putin came to power more than 14 years ago.Some of those attending the meeting were among those affected, including Mr. Putin\u2019s chief of staff, Sergei B. Ivanov. \u201cWe should distance ourselves from them,\u201d Mr. Putin joked, his face showing no emotion. \u201cThey compromise us.\u201dWhen Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was prepared to draft unspecified retaliatory measures, however, Mr. Putin demurred. \u201cI think we should refrain from taking steps in response for now,\u201d he said.Mr. Putin was speaking as the upper house of the Russian Parliament, the Federation Council, ratified a treaty signed this week to formally annex Crimea. The lower house, the Duma, took a similar step on Thursday, and Mr. Putin made it final by signing the treaty later on Friday, ending a breathtaking six days of maneuvers that began with a hastily arranged referendum among Crimeans, who voted overwhelmingly in favor of secession on Sunday.The formalities of Crimea\u2019s annexation came after a stealthy, audacious campaign by Russian special forces to take over military installations, effectively forcing the Ukrainian authorities to capitulate by signaling the withdrawal of their 25,000 troops and dependents from Crimea.The European agreement, signed in Brussels by interim Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, was part of an earlier deal abandoned by the Viktor F. Yanukovych, Ukraine\u2019s president at the time, in favor of a bailout by Russia. His action helped precipitate his downfall after weeks of protests in central Kiev.Mr. Yatsenyuk signed the central part of a so-called association agreement with European Union officials and with leaders of the body\u2019s 28 nations on the fringe of their summit meeting in Brussels. While the pact allows the two sides to deepen their economic and political collaboration, more detailed elements of the deal concerning free trade will be signed only after Ukraine\u2019s presidential election, scheduled for May.Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, said the agreement would offer Ukrainians a \u201cEuropean way of life,\u201d and would recognize \u201cthe aspirations of the people of Ukraine to live in a country governed by values, by democracy and the rule of law, where all citizens have a stake in national prosperity.\u201dThe juxtaposition of the two signing ceremonies on Friday in Brussels and Moscow, however, seemed to underscore the powerful forces pulling at Ukraine even as Western leaders seek to dissuade Russia from further advances in Russian-speaking areas in the east of Ukraine.Russia last year put heavy pressure on Mr. Yanukovych to reject the original deal, fearing that it would torpedo efforts by Mr. Putin to form a Moscow-dominated customs union made up of former Soviet lands. Moscow also worried about Ukraine, a former Soviet republic of 46 million people, moving closer to Europe on security and defense, fears that could be heightened by Friday\u2019s political accord, which calls for enhanced cooperation on foreign and security policy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Lawmakers Prepare to Vote on \u2018Net Neutrality\u2019", "Date": "2014-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Vodafone gave Chris Herbert a package deal he found too tempting to turn down.To persuade Mr. Herbert, a 27-year-old conference organizer, to pay 50 percent more for his monthly cellphone contract, the British telecom giant threw in a free subscription to Spotify, the music streaming service.The bundled deal, giving Mr. Herbert access to both a high-speed digital network and consumer content, is the type of packaging at the core of a raging public policy debate in Europe over what types of services will be widely available and how much they will cost.\u201cI talked myself into this,\u201d said Mr. Herbert, a London resident who now pays the equivalent of $75 for his monthly cellphone subscription. In his case, he considers the much higher monthly rate an acceptable trade-off: He canceled his existing Spotify contract that had cost him an additional $16 a month. \u201cWith my new data plan, I\u2019m streaming a lot more music than I ever did before.\u201dThe online habits of customers like Mr. Herbert, and their ability to pay, are the focus of digital policy legislation on which lawmakers from the European Union\u2019s 28 member countries plan to vote Thursday in Brussels. A key part of the legislation is so-called net neutrality. The rules are meant to ensure equitable access to Internet\u2019s pipelines for services like streaming music, on-demand television and cloud computing. The big questions are who pays for them, and how much.The proposed rules have drawn furious lobbying from telecommunications companies like Vodafone, Internet giants like Google and smaller players like Spotify, and advocacy groups on behalf of the European Union\u2019s 500 million consumers.The battle is akin to a struggle playing out in the United States but with its own European twists.The outcome could help determine whether the financial incentives are in place to pay for the multibillion-euro investments needed to upgrade Europe\u2019s patchy mobile and landline Internet infrastructure, which in the absence of Continentwide rules has slipped ever farther behind the more advanced data networks of North America and Asia.Few parties were happy with the set of compromises that a committee of the European Parliament approved in mid-March. And even if the full parliament adopts the legislation this week \u2014 passage is no sure bet \u2014 further wrangling among member countries over how to implement the law would be expected to drag on for months. Because that process would extend past parliamentary elections in May, it would be up to the next parliament, later this year, to either carry forward the current legislation or reopen the debate.The wrangling has pitted some of the biggest companies in Europe against one another.The telecom carriers want to charge content providers like Google, with its YouTube video service, higher rates for premium, high-speed access to the Internet. The carriers say such extra costs are necessary because of the amount of network capacity \u2014 or bandwidth \u2014 such services require.The legislation provides some pricing leeway in that regard. But the carriers say the flexibility is not sufficient, while content providers counter that any premiums at all would be unreasonable. Although the richest players, like Google and the movies-on-demand provider Netflix, might be able to afford premium access, some midsize or smaller players worry that they could be priced out of the Internet fast lines and relegated to network side roads.Consumer advocacy groups, meanwhile, say their main concern is that the new rules would make Internet access unaffordable for many Europeans. And they warn that the network economics could end up favoring American juggernauts like Google, Netflix or Amazon, to the detriment of providers of European content and services.The vote \u201cwill either mark an unprecedented advance toward the protection of our fundamental rights, or mark the final days of the open Internet as we know it,\u201d said F\u00e9lix Tr\u00e9guer, co-founder of the La Quadrature du Net, an advocacy group in Paris.Representatives for Google and Microsoft, like many of the other big American companies, declined to comment, citing the sensitivity of the debate.A similar debate continues in the United States. The Federal Communications Commission is still trying to map out net neutrality rules, after two of the biggest American providers of broadband access, Verizon and Comcast, successfully challenged the commission in court.\u201cNet neutrality is starting to bleed into a bigger debate about whether the Internet has become a public utility,\u201d said Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia University in New York who coined the phrase net neutrality in the early 2000s. \u201cIt has become about who controls access to online content.\u201dUnlike United States regulations, in which mobile Internet services have mostly been excluded from net neutrality policy, the European legislation does not differentiate between mobile and fixed data networks.As people increasingly use smartphones and tablets to access online content, mobile data traffic jumped 57 percent in Western Europe and 77 percent in North America in 2013 compared with the previous year, according to the network equipment company Cisco Systems. Internet usage on cable networks has had similar increases over the same period.To keep pace with that demand, European telecom companies are gearing up to spend billions of dollars to upgrade their networks.Vodafone, for example, has announced plans to invest almost $12 billion in network improvements. Telef\u00f3nica of Spain has agreed to buy E-Plus, a German carrier, for $10.7 billion to expand Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s operations in Europe\u2019s largest economy.To justify such outlays, many European carriers say they should be able to charge companies extra for transporting data-intensive services like Internet TV.\u201cData volumes are growing exponentially,\u201d said Tom Phillips, chief regulatory officer of GSMA, a telecommunications industry body. \u201cAt a point, someone has to pay for the necessary investments in the network.\u201dNot surprisingly, Internet giants like Google and European content providers like Spotify and Rovio, the Finnish gaming company behind the Angry Birds franchise, don\u2019t agree. Many companies argue that Internet access providers are simply trying to greedily exploit the rising consumer demand for online media.The Finnish national broadcaster YLE, for example, says it has had a threefold increase in monthly visits, to 14.5 million, for its online TV and radio services since 2010.The growth has been fueled by major events like the recent Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. During the games, 8 percent of the Finnish population, or around 420,000 viewers, downloaded the broadcaster\u2019s mobile application to watch live sports on their smartphones and tablets.While YLE\u2019s on-demand and streaming services have yet to put significant strain on Finland\u2019s data networks, Lauri Kivinen, the broadcaster\u2019s chief executive, worries that carriers will eventually give priority to content providers willing to pay for premium access to broadband networks.\u201cThe tollkeeper shouldn\u2019t be able to define what content is available,\u201d Mr. Kivinen said.Others worry that the European legislation would allow telecom companies to discriminate against services like Internet messaging and video streaming that compete with the carriers\u2019 own offerings.A few years ago Dutch lawmakers opposed efforts by the country\u2019s big telecom company KPN and the local units of Vodafone and T-Mobile to block, or charge extra for, Internet communication services like Skype and WhatsApp. In response, in 2011 the Netherlands became the first European country to enshrine the concept of net neutrality into national law.And a German court overturned efforts by Deutsche Telekom last year to reduce the speed of consumers\u2019 Internet services after they reached certain download limits. The company\u2019s opponents, noting that the limits did not apply to Deutsche Telekom\u2019s own online content, argued that the approach would have given the carrier an advantage over other Internet companies looking to offer rival online services like video on demand.Even as such arguments continue to be made during the debate over the European Parliament\u2019s legislation, some carriers and content providers are hashing out their own deals.To woo prospective customers as Vodafone did with Mr. Herbert, many of Europe\u2019s telecom companies are starting to forge agreements with Spotify, Facebook and other content providers to give consumers unlimited access to the services as part of their monthly contracts.Such arrangements enable carriers to distinguish themselves from their rivals. And for content providers, particularly small start-ups in search of customers, a packaging deal with one of Europe\u2019s telecom giants could be crucial to staying in business.\u201cInterest is high for partnerships,\u201d said Mattias Hjelmstedt, founder of Magine, a Swedish online TV start-up that is working on deals with a number of European mobile and Internet service providers. \u201cInstead of making it a war, make it about working together.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He\u2019s laid back, not one of those intense helicopter parents, and soon you\u2019re shooting the breeze, talking idly about when your kid started to walk, or how many words he has. Cool Dad is nodding, and then suddenly he\u2019s telling you about this weird thing he and his partner did that involved green tea and cloth diapers, and now their little guy is getting his postdoc at M.I.T., but hey, that\u2019s awesome that your little Lysander can roll over already! Yeah. That guy has written a book on parenting. His name is Dalton Conley, and he\u2019s a sociologist at New York University who\u2019s taken his own fatherhood, put it in the blender with his professional interest in scientific inquiry, and produced \u201cParentology.\u201d He characterizes his technique as the opposite of everything uptight, including \u201cold-world parenting; traditional parenting; textbook parenting; tiger mothering; bringing up b\u00e9b\u00e9.\u201d He\u2019s not into that ponderous, prescriptive stuff. His brand, he says, is more like \u201cjazz parenting,\u201d an \u201cimprovisational approach.\u201dConley describes himself as a \u201cfreak\u201d whose parenting decisions are based on \u201cflexibility and fluidity, attention to (often counterintuitive, myth-busting) research. . . . Trial and error. Hypothesis revision and more experimentation about what works. In other words, the scientific method.\u201d He lets his children curse at him; he tells them they\u2019re in special education classes because of the better student-\u00adteacher ratio; they camp out around a hot plate while their apartment is renovated. He is a wild and crazy guy. Except that he has also spent his career \u201cstudying traditional measures of socioeconomic success\u201d and is therefore not interested in any \u201chippy-dippy perspective where all I want for them is to be quote-unquote \u2018happy.\u2019 \u201d Conley has \u201clong been obsessed with societal \u2018merit badges\u2019 . . . little markers that I was on the right path to please my elders. And my hopes for my kids were no different.\u201d Research suggests that \u201chaving a weird name makes you more likely to have impulse control,\u201d and that impulse control is \u201ceven more important than I.Q. in predicting socioeconomic success, marital stability, and even staying out of prison.\u201d So Conley names his firstborn daughter E and his younger son Yo Xing Heyno Augustus Eisner Alexander Weiser Knuckles. When Conley and his wife tackle the question of whether to put their baby girl in her own crib or a family bed, they decide to co-sleep: \u201cLuckily, we had a significant body of science on our side.\u201d Conley explains how stress in infants whose needs are unreliably met or who experience \u201cparental abuse or trauma\u201d leads to long-term physical and psychological consequences deep into life. \u201cThe goal,\u201d he writes, \u201cis not to have a baby who quiets herself down. . . . It\u2019s to have a well-\u00adadjusted adult in 20 years. We were going to just keep cuddling E on our air mattress, lowering her cortisol levels, no matter what anyone else said.\u201d Hey, whoa there, Cool Scientist Dad! Where did you learn that a baby who sleeps in a crib is suffering stress equivalent to \u201cparental abuse or trauma,\u201d or that a baby who quiets herself won\u2019t be well-adjusted in 20 years? That doesn\u2019t sound improvisational, and it sure doesn\u2019t sound scientific. \u201cParentology,\u201d a hybrid that often leans more toward memoir than research, has another structural problem at its core: Conley and his kids are so far from typical that it\u2019s impossible to imagine readers drawing much relatable insight from them. Those unusual names land the family in The New York Times, as well as in the best-selling book \u201cFreakonomics\u201d and on Anderson Cooper\u2019s talk show. A parent at their private school, the model and \u00admaternal-health advocate Christy Turlington Burns, takes a shine to E. The family travels the world, and it will be hard for many to chuckle knowingly at Conley\u2019s concession, in his chapter on the anti-\u00adallergenic benefits of pets, that \u201cmaybe we went a bit too far when we went to the animal markets in Jakarta in the midst of the bird flu scare and purchased a pet monkey, snake and fruit bats (which we later set free upon leaving the island of Java).\u201dMuch of Conley\u2019s professional research has focused on poverty, but he has a tin ear when it comes to class, confessing at one point, as if readers will be scandalized, \u201cYes, I had married a high school dropout.\u201d In another passage, he reassures his kids that \u201clife is a marathon\u201d and even though he wasn\u2019t at the top of his class back in fifth grade, \u201cone of the smartest kids . . . was now unemployed and in dire straits. Noncognitive skills strike again.\u201d Take that, person who was smarter than Dalton Conley in fifth grade and is now unemployed! Conley is surely attempting to be tongue in cheek in his description of a \u201cdisturbing encounter,\u201d when his kids were in elementary school, with the young son of some economist friends who \u201ccould do cube roots and figure out large number divisions in his head.\u201d When Giovanni, the economists\u2019 child, \u201crattled off the formula for the area of a triangle, I got mad. Real mad,\u201d Conley writes. \u201cPanicked that my kids were being left behind in the knowledge economy, I assuaged my anxiety by posing logic riddles to humiliate Giovanni and show off my kids\u2019 talents.\u201d Conley then signed his own children up for a pricey online math course offered by Stanford.It\u2019s just one of the moments in \u201cParentology\u201d that read like some Internet parody: your worst humble-bragging-undermining-Park-Slope-Parenting nightmares made manifest. Another comes when Conley explains that he and his kids read so many books about prehistoric sharks that the word \u201c \u2018megalodon\u2019 became slang for \u2018huge\u2019 in our household.\u201d\u201cImagine my joy,\u201d Conley writes of his son\u2019s steadily improving reading scores, \u201cwhen, on the fourth-grade high-stakes test, Yo scored at the top of his class on the English Language Arts statewide exam. By the end of fifth grade we had, at home, read the \u201cIliad\u201d and the \u201cOdyssey\u201d . . . Coleridge; Twain; Hemingway; the complete works of Rudyard Kipling. . . .\u201d\u201cParentology\u201d finds some ballast in its final third, when \u2014 sadly enough \u2014 Conley\u2019s carefully calibrated (but totally improvisational) approach to family falls apart: He and his wife divorce; Yo is given a diagnosis of attention-deficit disorder and is put on medication. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that these events are gratifying \u2014 merely that they force Conley to calm down a bit, to acknowledge the possibility that nature may have played just as much of a role as his social science experiments. \u201cIf my kids\u2019 chances in life are largely determined by the DNA that their mother and I have passed on, all my math drilling and insistence on reading may have been of little added value,\u201d he writes, comforting himself by noting, \u201cOn the other hand, all the things I did to mess them up probably won\u2019t actually matter all that much in the end either.\u201d And even in the familial upheaval, he assures us, the now-adolescent E has begun a novel, and \u201cshe\u2019ll have a lot better chance getting it published since winning the National Scholastic Art and Writing Awards Scholarship for her mini-memoir about her parents\u2019 divorce.\u201d\u201cParentology,\u201d like Cool Dad from the park, leaves a reader slightly stunned, groping for the proper response: Do you brag back? Congratulate him? Or do you just smile and think, Well, look, the guy really loves his kids. Because in the end, as Dalton Conley would tell you, that\u2019s the most important thing. He has the research to back it up.

{"Headline": "The Unhealthy Meat Market", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhere does our food come from? Often the answer is Tyson Foods, America\u2019s meat factory.Leonard\u2019s book argues that a handful of companies, led by Tyson, control our meat industry in ways that raise concerns about the impact on animals and humans alike, while tearing at the fabric of rural America. Many chicken farmers don\u2019t even own the chickens they raise or know what\u2019s in the feed. They just raise the poultry on contract for Tyson, and many struggle to make a living.Concerned by the meat oligopoly\u2019s dominance of rural America, President Obama undertook a push beginning in 2010 to strengthen antitrust oversight of the meat industry and make it easier for farmers to sue meatpackers. The aim was grand: to create a \u201cnew rural economy\u201d to empower individual farmers.Big Meat\u2019s lobbyists used its friends in Congress to crush the Obama administration\u2019s regulatory effort, which collapsed in \u201cspectacular failure,\u201d Leonard writes.Costs came down partly because scientific breeding reduced the length of time needed to raise a chicken to slaughter by more than half since 1925, even as a chicken\u2019s weight doubled. The amount of feed required to produce a pound of chicken has also dropped sharply.And yet.This industrial agriculture system also has imposed enormous costs of three kinds.First, it has been a catastrophe for animals. Chickens are bred to grow huge breasts so that as adults they topple forward and can barely breathe or stand.Second, factory farming endangers our health. Robert Martin of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health notes that a farm with 10,000 hogs produces as much fecal waste as a small city with 40,000 people, but the hog operation won\u2019t have a waste treatment plant. Indeed, the hogs in a single county in North Carolina produce half as much waste as all the people in New York City, Martin says. Third, this industrial model has led to a hollowing out of rural America. The heartland is left with a few tycoons and a large number of people struggling at the margins.Leonard writes in his book that in 68 percent of the counties where Tyson operates, per capita income has grown more slowly over the last four decades than the average in that state. We may think of rural America as a halcyon pastoral of red barns and the Waltons, but today it\u2019s also a land of unemployment, poverty, despair and methamphetamines.But a starting point is to recognize bluntly that our industrial food system is unhealthy. It privatizes gains but socializes the health and environmental costs. It rewards shareholders \u2014 Tyson\u2019s stock price has quadrupled since early 2009 \u2014 but can be ghastly for the animals and humans it touches. Industrial meat has an acrid aftertaste.

Have the Clintons changed, or has Brown changed?He crosses his arms and gives me a flinty look, finally observing: \u201cIn retrospect, after we see all the other presidents that came afterwards, certainly, Clinton handled his job with a level of skill that hasn\u2019t been met since.\u201dTake that, President Obama.And could he see his old nemesis Bill, who endorsed Gavin Newsom for governor instead of Brown in 2009, as First Lad? \u201cWherever he is, he will fill up the room, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he replies. \u201cHe has a lot of political energy.\u201d It\u2019s an astonishing thing, but the prickly Jerry Brown has, at long last, become something of a diplomat. He\u2019s 75, balding and gray. But he\u2019s still slender and fit, and remains an eclectic party of one.Two weeks ago Brown ended up on the opposite side of two key planks in the California Democrats\u2019 platform \u2014 banning fracking and legalizing pot.Like Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and California Senator Dianne Feinstein, Brown is wary about legalized pot and wants to chart the evolution of the revolution. As he said on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d \u201cHow many people can get stoned and still have a great state or a great nation?\u201dI ask the man formerly known as Governor Moonbeam if he ever smoked pot. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with the seventh largest economy in the world and I\u2019m not going to deal with these marginal issues,\u201d he said primly. Actually, it\u2019s the eighth, but maybe he is anticipating a move up.His lieutenant, Gavin Newsom, told Ronan Farrow on MSNBC that Brown was wrong on the pot issue and should not use words like \u201cpotheads,\u201d \u201cstoners\u201d and \u201chippies.\u201d But Brown says that his remarks to David Gregory were \u201cmore of a wry comment\u201d than \u201ca policy pronouncement.\u201dI asked the governor if he had read Linda Ronstadt\u2019s memoir, in which she praised her former beau as \u201csmart and funny, not interested in drinking or drugs.\u201d She made note of his famous frugality, recalling that once, when they were going to dinner at Rosemary Clooney\u2019s, Jerry wanted to take a box of roses that had been sent to Ronstadt, remove the card and give it to Clooney.At first Brown clams up, but then he relents. \u201cI visit her at Christmastime\u201d sometimes, he said. \u201cShe\u2019s thoughtful and has a lot to say.\u201dAs he raises a ton of money to run for an unprecedented fourth term, which he first announced in a casual tweet, the famous rebel seems strangely content.He\u2019s never seen \u201cChinatown,\u201d but he\u2019s trying to deal with the drought by fixing the state\u2019s unsustainable water transport system, which his dad helped put in place and he himself tried to fix 30 years ago. And he\u2019s still fighting for his dream of a high-speed train from Sacramento to San Diego, a project bogged down in lawsuits. He takes a white model of the train from the window and lovingly places it in the middle of a big picnic table, noting that he has liked trains since he was a kid.He said he wasn\u2019t upset when Newsom joined the opposition last month. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has repeated the comment, do you?\u201d he asked an aide.His office is full of black-and-white pictures of his father, the former governor of California \u2014 two with a stunningly young-looking J.F.K. just before he became president. The onetime Jesuit seminarian is low-key about his role in bringing California back from $27 billion in the red three years ago to a budget surplus of several billion. \u201cI had a good hand,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cand I played it reasonably well.\u201d He says he thinks his dad would have \u201cenjoyed\u201d seeing his son\u2019s success, achieved partly by belatedly adopting some of Pat Brown\u2019s more social ways with lawmakers.I ask Brown what he thinks about the young Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who have complained that the homeless are ruining the aesthetic of San Francisco.\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of people who like homeless on the street,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t tie that to Silicon Valley.\u201dWe\u2019re meeting the same day that Rand Paul is making a speech at Berkeley warning about the N.S.A.\u2019s \u201cassault\u201d on privacy, and Brown says he also worries about that. \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency to totalism, total information, and once you have total information you\u2019re making it easier for total control,\u201d he said. He also finds Tea Party obstructionism \u201cextremely ominous and dangerous.\u201dAsked what he has done for fun lately, the looser Governor Brown replies that he helped his wife and adviser, Anne Gust Brown, pick out some clothes, noting: \u201cI like elegance, more classic, not too flamboyant with colors.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Left Fares Poorly in First Round of France\u2019s Municipal Elections", "Date": "2014-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The lowest turnout in 50 years in the first round of municipal elections appeared to help the far right to a strong showing and hurt the governing Socialist Party in the country\u2019s first major balloting since the election of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in 2012.Just under 64 percent of registered voters went to the polls in the first round of elections, which were seen as a barometer of voters\u2019 displeasure with France\u2019s moribund economy and dissatisfaction with the two main parties, the Socialists in particular.It was unclear whether the far-right National Front, which received less than 5 percent of the vote nationwide, would win control of more than a handful of cities, though that would still be a gain because it currently does not control any. Over all, parties on the political right received 46.5 percent of the vote, according to results released Monday. Left-leaning parties, including Mr. Hollande\u2019s Socialists, received 37.7 percent, according to the Interior Ministry.Mr. Hollande is the most unpopular president in modern French history, while the main opposition, the conservative Union for a Popular Movement, has competing factions, and several leaders, including former President Nicolas Sarkozy, are embroiled in scandals. The National Front benefited from voters\u2019 disaffection in part because its core supporters tend to be more dedicated and because it offered itself as the only true alternative to the mainstream parties.In the mayoral race in Paris, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, who represents the U.M.P. and two smaller parties, had a narrow lead on Monday, with 35.6 percent of the vote, over Anne Hidalgo, the Socialist candidate and current first deputy mayor, at 34.4 percent.However, Ms. Hidalgo was the favorite to win an expected runoff next Sunday because several left-leaning parties will most likely throw their support to her.Nationally, the Socialists are in danger of losing some medium-size cities in the runoffs, and in the first round of voting they failed to post a strong showing in the few races, including Marseilles, where they had hoped to oust a U.M.P. incumbent.Overall the U.M.P. held its own or gained ground, but in some cities it is facing serious competition from the National Front.Under France\u2019s election system, a second round will be held next Sunday in any race in which no candidate received a majority, including mayoral races in Paris, Lyon and Marseille, the country\u2019s most populous cities.The Socialists and the U.M.P. were discussing whether to join forces to defeat National Front candidates in the runoffs.The National Front pursued an election strategy of focusing on just 596 municipal elections out of 36,682 nationwide. Notably, the party won one outright, in H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, a city of about 25,000 people in northern France, where unemployment is high, and which the National Front leader, Marine Le Pen, has made her home.In television interviews Ms. Le Pen said the results signaled \u201cthe end of the two-party nature of politics in France.\u201d The National Front, she said \u201cwas emerging as a great autonomous force, not just nationally but locally.\u201dSocialist Party leaders were meeting on Monday to discuss how to regroup. There were reports in the French news media of internal upheaval, but it was unlikely that a change in ministers or even the prime minister could quickly alter the public perception of Mr. Hollande, who has a 20 percent approval rating. His biggest problem is that he has been unable to create a package of policies to help France\u2019s troubled economy. Unemployment has remained around 11 percent, and growth has hovered between zero and one percent for more than two years.Lilia Blaise contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Years of Strife and Cruelty Puts Syria in Free Fall", "Date": "2014-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT \u2014 Day after day, the Syrian civil war has ground down a cultural and political center of the Middle East, turning it into a stage for disaster and cruelty on a nearly incomprehensible scale. Families are brutalized by their government and by jihadists claiming to be their saviors as nearly half of Syrians \u2014 many of them children \u2014 have been driven from their homes. At the start of the fourth year since Syrians rose up in a peaceful movement that turned to arms after violent repression, a snapshot of the country presents the harsh truth that Syria\u2019s descent is only accelerating, with nothing to check it.The government bombards neighborhoods with explosive barrels, missiles, heavy artillery and, the United States says, chemical weapons, then it sends in its allies in Hezbollah and other militias to wage street warfare. It jails and tortures peaceful activists, and uses starvation as a weapon, blockading opposition areas where trapped children shrivel and die.The opposition is now functionally dominated by foreign-led jihadists who commit their own abuses in the name of their extremist ideology, just last week shooting a 7-year-old boy for what they claimed was apostasy. And some of those fighters, too, have targeted civilians and used siege tactics.It is not as if the world has no evidence of Syria\u2019s ordeal, which has killed an estimated 150,000 people. Syrians have issued a sustained, collective cry for help from what is now probably history\u2019s most-documented manmade disaster. They capture appalling suffering on video and beam the images out to the world: skeletal infants, body parts pulled from the rubble of homes, faces stretched by despair, over and over.Despite that, to the bitterness of Syrians, the world\u2019s diplomatic attention is drifting. Even as Syria\u2019s epic suffering is remaking the human geography of the Middle East and beyond, initiatives to ease the crisis have sputtered and failed to offer effective help. Already tenuous hopes for an internationally brokered peace settlement have further faded as Russian-American relations worsen.Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the head of the United Nations refugee agency, said that is in part because there is no obvious path to a coherent global response. Given the world\u2019s growing unpredictability, and competing priorities, \u201ccrises are multiplying and more and more difficult to solve,\u201d he said. \u201cAfghanistan is not finished. Somalia is not finished. It\u2019s overwhelming.\u201dAll the while, Syria is falling apart.The country is threatened with de facto partition among the government, Kurdish militias and a patchwork of insurgent groups, some seeking to impose extremist Islamist rule. Criminal gangs profit from chaos, and pro-government militias increasingly threaten to slip from state control. A regional proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran further polarizes the conflict and fuels its sectarian dimension.Adding to the urgency is the growing scale of regional destabilization. With nine million Syrians driven from their homes, according to the United Nations, 2.5 million of them into nearby countries, the Syrian displacement dwarfs the exodus from British-mandate Palestine during the war over Israel\u2019s founding in 1948, a flight of 750,000 people that fuels conflict and hardship to this day. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a humanitarian issue, a need to feed people,\u201d Dr. Fouad M. Fouad, a Syrian doctor who studies the impact of the conflict, told a conference at the American University of Beirut last week. \u201cIt\u2019s a historical, geopolitical issue.\u201dAid workers are scrambling to refocus public attention on Syria. Most urgent is ending the conflict, they say; all else at best mitigates the disaster. At the same time, they fear that governments \u2014 including the United States, the United Nations\u2019 largest donor \u2014 could lose interest in financing the organization\u2019s largest aid appeal in history, $4.4 billion for Syria in 2013 alone.Private donations for Syrians have lagged far behind those for other emergencies, like the recent typhoon in the Philippines, international aid groups say.Yet on Syria\u2019s borders, no one can miss the flood of refugees, or the inadequacy of the international response. The crisis is spreading disease, upending neighboring economies and creating a \u201clost generation\u201d of Syrian children, who before the war almost universally attended elementary school. Now fewer than half are in school; among refugees in neighboring Lebanon, the figure is 12 percent.Analysts say that 42 percent of all Syrians, more than New York City\u2019s population, have fled their homes. An equivalent catastrophe in the United States would mean 131 million Americans on the move.In Lebanon, an unstable country smaller than Connecticut, the United Nations has documented 962,000 Syrians registered for aid or awaiting registration. Lebanon hosts more refugees per capita than any country since famine-stricken Ethiopians flooded Somalia 34 years ago.Just as staggering is the transformation of life inside Syria, previously what is known in development parlance as a \u201cmiddle-income country,\u201d with functioning services and a sizeable middle class by regional standards.Now, about 700,000 homes are damaged or destroyed, railways idle, factories closed. The Damascus-based Syrian Center for Policy Research puts unemployment at 50 percent. With half of Syria\u2019s hospitals destroyed, thousands have died from preventable causes. Several hundred, at least, have died of malnutrition-related causes.The Syrian refugee crisis, meanwhile, has not peaked. Unicef says 5.5 million children need aid, a number that has more than doubled in a year. Child refugees quintupled to 1.2 million, 425,000 of them younger than 5, and one in five Syrian girls in Jordan is forced into early marriage. Unable to pay for medical care abroad, Syrians routinely venture back to the war zone to give birth, have surgery or get cancer treatment.The majority of Syrian refugees surveyed by the aid group Oxfam say they never expect to go home, a measure of their despair, and of the likelihood that their displacement is permanent.Syria\u2019s collapse has other effects. Poor Lebanese suffer from the loss of affordable medicines and health care they once got by crossing into Syria. Regional trade is gutted. In Jordan, increased water usage is depleting the supply, according to Mercy Corps, as the Zaatari refugee camp has grown into the world\u2019s second-largest.Last week in Shatila, an impoverished Beirut district now brimming with Syrians, Inas, 16, groaned as a neighbor slung her over her shoulder like a sack and carried her upstairs. Burned over 40 percent of her body when a shell struck her home in northern Syria, Inas cannot walk or bend. Treatment is not fully covered by United Nations refugee benefits, and she has spent weeks on journeys from hospital to hospital seeking an affordable discount.She displayed her scaly, swollen feet, weeping as she recalled telling her fianc\u00e9, \u201cForget me, I don\u2019t want you to marry me out of sympathy.\u201dThe woman who carried her, Umm Joumaa, 37, had lost her four youngest daughters to shelling. Three survived, scarred, like Inas, with painful burns.\u201cRather than throw myself from a window,\u201d the mother said, \u201cI should raise those beautiful girls.\u201dMohammad Ghannam contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Plot to Cut Food Stamps, Foiled", "Date": "2014-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe Republican Party has spent years stigmatizing the food stamp program while trying to cut benefits or make them harder to get. In last month\u2019s farm bill, conservative lawmakers thought they had imposed an $8 billion cut in the program. In the last few weeks, though, it has become clear that that cut isn\u2019t going to materialize, thanks to a few states more generous than Congress. And this has infuriated a party that doesn\u2019t believe that poor families should get public assistance in buying groceries.The cut involved the so-called heat-and-eat program, in which food stamp benefits are increased for those who qualify for a small amount of state heating assistance so that they do not have to choose between heat and food. Several states were providing only a token amount of fuel aid, as little as $1 a year, to prompt the extra benefits of $90 or so a month, and many lawmakers saw that as gaming the system.So negotiators on the farm bill agreed that states would have to pay a minimum of $20 a year in fuel aid to prompt the benefits. Republicans thought this would save more than $8 billion over a decade, because they assumed the states wouldn\u2019t want to pay $20. Democrats went along because it was better than the original Republican plan to cut $40 billion from food stamps.This provoked an outburst from the House speaker, John Boehner. \u201cSince the passage of the farm bill, states have found ways to cheat once again on signing up people for food stamps,\u201d he said last week. \u201cAnd so I would hope that the House would act to try to stop this cheating and this fraud from continuing.\u201d Cheating? The states are doing exactly what the farm bill \u2014 which Mr. Boehner supported \u2014 encouraged them to do: pay more to some of the poorest families in America so they neither freeze nor starve during a brutal winter. Mr. Boehner seems unaware of it, but millions of families have never recovered from the recession, and his chamber has not only refused to help them by stimulating the economy but is trying to push them through the safety net.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Who Fled Cuba Are Returning to Help", "Date": "2014-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAVANA \u2014 The business ideas have ranged from a bikini franchise to a peanut farm, restaurants, and design firms for software and home interiors. But even more novel than the pitches \u2014 in a country where entrepreneurship used to be illegal \u2014 is the financial muscle behind them: Cuban-Americans whose families lost their previous ventures to Cuba\u2019s Communist government.\u201cIt\u2019s all about people not losing hope and seeing that starting a business is a way to improve their lives,\u201d said Eduardo Mestre, 65, a Wall Street banker who returned to Cuba last year for the first time since 1960 to see the start-up training he helps finance. \u201cEmotionally, it\u2019s very hard not to connect with people who have all this ambition in a place where maintaining hope is very hard to do.\u201dMany of the first Cubans to leave after Fidel Castro took over are beginning to come back, reuniting with the island they left in bitterness and anger, overcoming decades of heated opposition to its leaders, and partnering with Cubans in direct, new ways.It has been a shocking reversal for a community of exiles that has long represented a pillar of support for the American embargo against Cuba. And though the activity is legal through humanitarian or other licensed exceptions to the sanctions, some Cuban-American lawmakers have responded with outrage. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, a Republican from Miami, called Mr. Fanjul\u2019s trips a betrayal.\u201cThe question is how can we better help the Cuban people free themselves from this regime that has been there for over half a century,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the best way to do that is to deny funds to the regime in any way we can.\u201dBut what has emerged in Miami, New York and elsewhere over the past two years, as President Ra\u00fal Castro has opened the economy, just a crack, is an alternative approach that emphasizes grass-roots engagement, often through churches, as a tool for giving Cubans skills and independence from the state. Among many Cuban-Americans who now describe themselves as a part of a diaspora, rather than exiles, a new sense of responsibility \u2014 to Cubans on the island, not to the property they lost or to fighting the Castros \u2014 has gathered strength.\u201cWe think engagement, dialogue and interaction \u2014 lowering the barriers \u2014 is the best way to develop civil society,\u201d Mr. Mestre said, \u201cbut also some of us who feel some respect for the 11 million people stuck there, we just really feel that\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d He added that he sought a relationship with Cuba, despite the loss of his family\u2019s homes and businesses, including what was once Cuba\u2019s largest television and radio network, because \u201cthe loss of our property and wealth is kind of secondary to the feeling about what happened to the country and its people.\u201dThe expanding exchange of people, ideas and money is a result of policy changes over the past few years in Washington and Havana that have opened up travel and giving for Cubans and Cuban-Americans. After decades of being cut off by politics, the airport here is always crammed with Cuban-Americans coming to see family and lugging in gifts, just as it is now more common to see Cuban artists, academics and dissidents in Florida or New York, often mingling with the established Cuban-American elite.\u201cThe broad trend is Cubans\u2019, regardless of their politics or ideology, coming here to visit, live and work, and go back and forth,\u201d said Julia E. Sweig, the director for Latin American studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIt\u2019s an organic dynamic in which the elite are participating.\u201dFor many families, the transition from keeping Cuba at a distance to pulling it close has taken time and multigenerational discussion. When Kevin O\u2019Brien and some of his cousins decided a few years ago to take charge of the long-dormant Bacardi Family Foundation, they agreed to focus much of their support on Cuba, returning to a version of an old family custom: Relatives pool money together and distribute it to a chosen cause or person.Cuban officials seem tolerant, to a point. Eager to improve their weak economy, they welcome the money but fear its power, said one artist supported by the foundation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals. He added that while Cuba\u2019s leaders had become more welcoming \u2014 no longer calling exiles gusanos, or worms \u2014 they were still distrustful, determined to keep Cuban-American influence from becoming an immediate challenge to the state.Board members say that Cuban officials suggest that Cuba Emprende must be part of a covert Washington plot. A Cuban instructor in Havana, who spoke anonymously to protect the program, said the pressure had increased as Cuba Emprende grew; by mid-March, 731 graduates will have completed the 80-hour course, run through the church in an old seminary here and at a rectory in Camaguey.Cuban-American lawmakers who back the embargo also seem displeased with the increased engagement, even though Cuba Emprende and other groups in Cuba emphasize that their work does not violate the embargo. Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the Cuban-American Democrat often described by administration officials as Washington\u2019s main impediment to broader changes in Cuba policy, said it was simply ineffective. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing this engagement produce the results they say it would,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe regime hasn\u2019t become more open,\u201d even as Europeans travel and invest in Cuba, unfettered.Mr. Mestre contends Mr. Menendez and other embargo supporters in Congress are counterproductive. \u201cWith that attitude,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re just hurting the people you\u2019re trying to help.\u201dIncreasingly, many Cubans and Cuban-Americans are building their own ties, reveling in the surprise of a rediscovered connection. \u201cCubans are Cubans,\u201d said Niuris Higueras Mart\u00ednez, 39, one of Cuban Emprende\u2019s first graduates, in 2012. \u201cWe find ways to work together.\u201dThat bond is now evolving alongside, or within, Mr. Castro\u2019s limited opening to market ideas. Ms. Higueras, a whirlwind who had always dreamed of opening a restaurant, now owns Atelier, one of Havana\u2019s most popular eateries. Cuba Emprende played a major role in making it happen.\u201cEverything in that course was important,\u201d she said, including how to calculate her books or change her menu for the slow season. She said she also benefited from the sense of a shared mission with her classmates and the accountants and other professionals Cuba Emprende relies on for help in Cuba. \u201cThere was just such chemistry,\u201d she said.Now, in her business and others, there is a demand for more opportunity, more possibility \u2014 but also the usual barriers. Cuban law and the American embargo prohibit Cuba Emprende from bankrolling its students\u2019 ideas as it would like to. Without enough capital for bigger ventures, including Ms. Higuera\u2019s dream of a cooking school, some ambitions are just visions.During the dinner rush at Atelier, however, with foreigners and Cubans enjoying food and service that had disappeared from Havana for decades, Ms. Higueras was more interested in focusing on how far she had come. \u201cIf you have 15 employees, you have at least 10 families whose troubles are suddenly resolved,\u201d she said, wiping a few drops of chocolate from the corner of a plate on its way out of the kitchen. \u201cIf you open a little, you get a lot.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Democrats\u2019 All-Nighter Flags Climate Change", "Date": "2014-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In the summer of 2010, it was Harry Reid, the Senate\u2019s Democratic leader, who squelched his party\u2019s efforts to pass a climate change bill, declaring it could never attract enough votes to pass. In the years since, he has rarely spoken publicly about the issue.But on Monday night, an impassioned Mr. Reid took to the Senate floor to kick off a nearly 15-hour climate-change talkathon by about 30 Senate Democrats, part of a campaign by a new Senate \u201cclimate caucus\u201d to make it a politically urgent issue. \u201cClimate change is real. It\u2019s here,\u201d Mr. Reid said, adding that it was time to stop acting as if those who ignore it \u201chave a valid point of view.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t,\u201d he said. The all-night session was the latest effort by the group, which is working with a parallel House caucus, to elevate the issue of global warming. The members know that serious climate change legislation stands no chance of passage in this divided Congress, where many lawmakers in the Republican-majority House deny the science of human-caused global warming.Climate caucus members say their objective is to raise the urgency of global warming and build toward a time when the political landscape may have shifted enough that a bill could pass. They argue that there are signs that the political winds may already be changing.\u201cIt\u2019s aimed toward the day when something more concrete can be legislated,\u201d said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, a veteran of climate and clean-energy policy battles.In addition to Monday\u2019s overnight session, members of the group give regular speeches on the floor of the House and the Senate about the urgency of fighting climate change. They hold weekly meetings with environmentalists, lobbyists and some corporate leaders who support their policies. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and a leading member of the caucus, is planning a trip to Iowa centered on events related to climate change, in the hope of elevating the issue before the 2016 presidential caucuses.\u201cClimate change is the defining issue of our generation,\u201d Mr. Steyer said in a statement praising the senators who were planning to talk all night.David Axelrod, a former political adviser to President Obama and part of a team that had advised him to keep quiet on climate change during the 2012 campaign, said it was gaining momentum as a political issue because of donors like Mr. Steyer. The frequency of extreme weather events is also a factor, he said.Other Democrats are also talking more about the issue. Mr. Obama has given a series of speeches on the topic and plans to issue a set of climate change regulations through the Environmental Protection Agency. A rising class of younger senators has also begun embracing climate change as an issue, among them Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Brian Schatz of Hawaii, both Democrats.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to rest until there is action on the most pressing issue of our time, which is climate change,\u201d Mr. Schatz said. He played a central role in organizing Monday night\u2019s event. Operating out of a war room near Mr. Reid\u2019s offices, Mr. Schatz and his staff helped ensure that the senators had everything they needed to make it through the long night. Included were thick binders of talking points, as well as plenty of charts, graphs and visual aids, like Senator Mark Udall\u2019s poster of raging wildfires in his home state, Colorado. There was a detailed schedule, with Mr. Schatz planning to speak in 30-minute blocks spread throughout the night and totaling five hours. He brought Hawaiian Kona coffee and macadamia nut chocolates to help fuel his colleagues\u2019 overnight slog. Still, no legislation will pass without Republican support, or enough support from moderate Democrats in states where fossil fuels are a vital part of the economy. None of the four most vulnerable Democratic incumbent senators in the midterm elections \u2014 Mark Begich of Alaska, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas \u2014 were to take part in Monday night\u2019s event. Mr. Begich, Ms. Landrieu and Mr. Pryor are from states where oil or gas production is a major part of the economy.The fact remains that any major climate law will probably curb production of fossil fuels that produce greenhouse gases, particularly coal.

{"Headline": "Euro Zone\u2019s Economy Is Still Ailing, but Improving ", "Date": "2014-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsTHE euro zone\u2019s back-to-back recessions may be over. Most economies are growing, and employment totals have begun to inch upward. New-auto sales, which plunged in 2011 and 2012 as the second recession gathered strength, have risen in Europe in each of the last six months.The accompanying charts illustrate the overall double-dip, which was visible in many European countries \u2014 though not Germany, whose results have been considerably better than those of most other countries. The charts show how car sales, employment and gross domestic product compare with 2007 figures, before the Great Recession began in the United States and spread around the world.The postrecession recovery has been steady, if slow, in the United States. But as the euro zone crisis erupted, with Greece, Ireland and Portugal needing European bailouts, the second recession began.That can be seen most clearly in the G.D.P. figures for the euro zone countries other than Germany. The second downturn began in late 2011 and appears to have hit bottom in the first quarter of 2013. Now, economies have begun to grow again in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. But in Greece, the best that can be said is that its economy is going down at a slower pace than it did before. In Italy, the figures continue to decline, and while the French economy is growing, the number of people with jobs is not increasing. France was also alone among major European countries in reporting fewer new-car registrations in February than in the same month of 2013.Elsewhere, employment is generally going up, albeit from low levels, and the Greek fourth-quarter increase, of 6,900 employees, or 0.2 percent, was hardly proof of a turnaround. The European Union\u2019s statistical agency, Eurostat, released the fourth-quarter figures last week after making sure the methodology was constant in all countries.Even with the fourth-quarter improvement, the number of people working in most euro zone countries is well below the level of late 2007. Many of those countries have suffered from a loss of competitiveness relative to Germany, a loss that cannot be offset by currency depreciation since all use the same currency. Germany, where employment is almost 5 percent higher than it was in 2007, has been helped by the fact that the euro is probably weaker than a stand-alone German currency would be.In Britain, the only non-euro European country shown, the number of jobs is nearly 3 percent higher than it was in 2007. In the United States, the decline has been almost entirely erased.New-car sales can provide a revealing indicator of economic health. Car purchases can be deferred when the economy is weak, and then surge when conditions improve. But if the weakness persists, customers can avoid new-car purchases altogether, buying used vehicles if a purchase is necessary.Nowhere is that clearer than in Greece. Even with a slight pickup in late 2013 and in the first two months of this year, Greek car sales for the last 12 months are nearly 79 percent below the level of 2007.

{"Headline": "What Comes After Rich Baby Boomers? Kids With a Big Inheritance", "Date": "2014-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyThe Waltons might be the closest thing we have to the Carnegies or Rockefellers today. The heirs to the Walmart fortune occupy six slots on the most recent Forbes 400 list, and just those six Waltons \u2014 not counting their lucky progeny \u2014 are worth $145 billion. But the Waltons are in the distinct minority on the Forbes list. In this new Gilded Age, rich Americans are more likely to have made their own fortunes than to have inherited them.Rich families today are holding onto a big piece of the pie. The top 1 percent of households owns about 35 percent of American wealth, more than the entire bottom 90 percent does. But at least at the moment, growing inequality has not resulted in a big boom in inheritances. Since the 1980s, the value of inherited wealth has only drifted upward slightly. In fact, wealth transfers as a proportion of net worth have fallen, to 19 percent in 2007 from 29 percent in 1989.But the baby boomers are only now retiring. Once that process accelerates and reaches its inevitable conclusion, get ready for a flood of princelings \u2014 and some potentially worrisome consequences for social mobility in the United States, as the immense earnings of an already stratified economy are entrusted to a new generation. The inheritance boom will come, eventually. What\u2019s unclear is what the country will look like afterward.For one, the wealthy tend to give away a big chunk of their money, leaving less for their heirs, Wolff says. Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Mark Zuckerberg and many others, for instance, have signed onto the \u201cgiving pledge,\u201d promising the bulk of their estates to charity. The government takes out another sizable tranche (even though that 55 percent inheritance tax never did come into effect.) Moreover, he says, inheritors tend to be less well off than their parents, meaning that inheritances serve to spread the wealth thin rather than concentrating it.It is a dissatisfying form of redistribution when one very rich Walton bequeaths to a less-rich Walton, of course, but from an economic perspective, it is redistribution all the same. Paul Schervish, the director of the Center on Wealth and Philanthropy at Boston College, says that about 7 percent of inheritors get two-thirds of all wealth transfers. But although inherited wealth concentrates in a small population, the money dissipates within it. \u201cSome might go to the kids who took over the family business, some goes to one who ended up a schoolteacher, some goes to a bum like I am,\u201d he says.Those mitigating factors probably won\u2019t be enough to defray the impact of the inheritance boom when it comes.\u201cWe have more income inequality, and that means that down the road, we are bound to have more wealth inequality and more inequality of inherited wealth,\u201d says Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics, a pre-eminent researcher of the haves and have-nots. \u201cThat is, unless the wealthy consume their wealth before they die,\u201d he added. \u201cBut when you\u2019re really rich, you want to transmit at least part of that to your children.\u201dSome will be frittered away. \u201cA lot of these ultra-high-net-worth individuals are men aged 60 to 70,\u201d David Friedman, president of the research firm Wealth-X, says. \u201cThey\u2019re sensing their mortality now. And there\u2019s a growing wave of liquidity that\u2019s going to fuel luxury and fuel philanthropy in a way that the market\u2019s never seen.\u201d Extravagant bucket-list items will be crossed out (with so many engraved Montblancs), but a great deal more will be left to children in the form of family businesses, estates, real estate and so on.When that process is underway, 10 percent of the country\u2019s total wealth will change hands every five years through inheritances, estates, gifts and the like. And as income and wealth have become distributed less evenly, the inherited spoils will be distributed unevenly, too. Households with less than $500,000 in net worth will transfer about $3 trillion to their heirs. Ones with more than $500,000 will transfer four times that much wealth.That money will flow into the bank accounts of the by-then-over-the-hill members of Generation X and Generation Y, and the United States might look a little more like aristocratic Europe, with its Downton Abbeys and super-hyphenated names \u2014 maybe with a few more tattoos. Lists like the Forbes 400 might be filled less with financiers and technology entrepreneurs and more with third-generation Waltons and second-generation Zuckerbergs and Bezoses or, perhaps, first-generation Walton-Zuckerberg von Bezoses.If income inequality continues its upward trend, a new generation of the superwealthy could come to crowd out those inheritors. Not only does family money get chopped apart as it passes from generation to generation, it has great potential for self-destruction. The same story plays out a thousand different ways: Hardscrabble grandfather makes the money, Junior sustains the business while living well all his days and then the Third, softened by a charmed life, fails in his duties as scion. \u201cThere\u2019s a phrase: \u2018Shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations,\u2019 \u201d says John Davis of Harvard Business School, who studies family wealth. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with families in 60 countries. They\u2019ve all got some version of the same saying.\u201dBut it does not seem to matter too much one way or another. Inheritances are just one way that wealthy families help out their children; and not the most important one, either. So-called \u201cinter vivos\u201d gifts help ossify a given child\u2019s social, educational and professional status long before inheritances kick in. Miles Corak, an economist at the University of Ottawa, says the children of the rich benefit from birth: less-stressful home lives as toddlers, expensive education throughout their lives, well-timed donations to alma maters, full Rolodexes on graduation, help with that first down payment, and so on.That might be one reason that American social mobility seems so stuck, with the odds of escaping poverty half what they are in countries like Denmark. But recent research has suggested that, contrary to conventional wisdom, rates of mobility have not actually declined as inequality has increased. Once that big wave of money hits in 2031, reality could bend more toward expectation.Annie Lowrey is an economics reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Learning From Legos", "Date": "2014-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionWHEN I was a boy, my father, an architect, attempted a no-toy policy, with the significant exception that he\u2019d buy my brother and me almost anything \u2014 any birthday, holiday or restless rainy Saturday \u2014 as long as it was Lego.And so, if I needed a gun, I made it with Legos. The same with a walkie-talkie. And a lie detector. And all the life-size artifacts \u2014 let\u2019s face it, mostly weapons \u2014 that were then my heart\u2019s desire. Plus every scale-model spaceship, supertruck, planetary fortress, recombinant Tyrannosaurus and transforming robot. These days Lego \u2014 with its namesake movie\u2019s opening weekend box office of $69 million, and with global sales revenue tripling, recession-proof, between 2007 and 2012 \u2014 appears to be something more than just a Danish construction toy based on snap-together plastic bricks. Some of the film\u2019s success comes from the charm of its intrepid construction worker hero and goth-ninja heroine, both remarkably expressive despite the limitations of Lego figurines\u2019 cylindrical heads and hands. But the film\u2019s celebration of adaptive improvisation and spontaneous mythmaking also resonates deeply with our current moment of so-called maker culture. Thanks to new rapid-prototyping technologies like computer numerical control milling and 3-D printing, we\u2019ve seen a convergence between hacker and hipster, between high-tech coding and the low-tech artisanal craft behind everything from Etsy to Burning Man. Whether it\u2019s Google\u2019s first server rack having been made of Lego-like bricks (pragmatically cheap, heat-resistant and reconfigurable) at Stanford in 1996, or the programmable Lego bricks developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Architecture Machine Group (later the Media Lab where, no coincidence, my father worked), Lego is literally built into the computational and architectural history of maker culture.\u201cThe smooth shapely maple blocks with which to build, the sense of which never afterward leaves the fingers; so form became feeling. These primary forms were the secret of all effects,\u201d Wright recalled, \u201cwhich were ever got into the architecture of the world.\u201d Wright\u2019s son John would complete the circle, inventing in 1916 the construction toy that came to be known as Lincoln Logs.Architectural historians have sought origins for Wright\u2019s innovative organic architecture \u2014 his long horizontals and pinwheel plans \u2014 in the geometries of his toys, even reconstructing his early house designs using the Froebel Blocks themselves. I suspect that the connection isn\u2019t that literal. But it is certainly primal, and visceral, to do with the idea of making and unmaking, and the complex relationships of parts to wholes, and brokenness to wholeness. Once, detouring through a parking-lot flea market, I stumbled across some Froebel Blocks from Wright\u2019s era, stacked as tightly and delicately as the dovetail joints of their original wooden box. Froebel Blocks are collectible antiques, but these were flea-market finds and not auctioneers\u2019 goods because they had been methodically defaced by years of scribbled arabesques in Magic Marker, in a child\u2019s hand. I discovered that these lines traveled continuously from block to block, and that by carefully aligning the distinctly colored arcs and loops of the markings, I could reconstruct all the arrangements into which the blocks had been built \u2014 those magic marks the inadvertent blueprints for a forgotten memory palace. I remember the fugue of that reconstruction, low on the ground below a flea market table. I remember the astonishing intimacy of visiting a stranger\u2019s childhood, and how that intimacy somehow caused me to delay actually buying this treasure. I circled the flea market, and returned to find it gone.Maker culture, like Lego, is about loss. All building-block toys are about appearance and disappearance, demolition and reconstruction. Maker culture, for all its love of stuff, is similarly a culture of resourcefulness in an era of economic scarcity: relentless in its iterative prototyping, its radically adaptive reuse of ready-made objects, its tendency to unmake one thing to make another \u2014 all in a new ecology of economy. When my brother and I wanted a new toy, we cannibalized whatever we\u2019d made before, which had been made of all the things we\u2019d ever made before that. So of all those years of guns and starships, I have only that Wrightian feeling for form in the fingertips \u2014 and the sound, somewhere between rustling and clinking, of a thousand plastic pieces tumbling from an overturned bucket into a disorderly pile, rippling away from a seeking hand.I remember the last thing I ever made of Lego, far later into adolescence than I should admit. It was a robot that, thanks to double-jointed hinges, could continually reconfigure itself without being disassembled. And in this sense it was anti-Lego, capable of being remade without being unmade. I knew that it was the most I could ever do in the medium, and the end of an era. It drifted back into that bucket.A quarter-century later I saw the same bucket opened and overturned by a young nephew. And there, like a time traveler, was this same robot. Mostly just its legs, standing Ozymandias-like in a pile of bricks. I reached for it, but not faster than my nephew, who, recognizing an accretion of especially useful pieces, instantly dissolved it with his hands. One of Wright\u2019s secrets of all effects must be this: Because nothing comes from nothing, and nothing goes entirely out of the world, you have to take things apart if you seek to put everything together.An architect who is writing a book about trucks, forts and dinosaurs.

{"Headline": "Spanish Consumer Prices Fall, Fueling Deflation Concerns", "Date": "2014-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID, March 28 (Reuters) - Spanish national consumer prices fell at their fastest annual pace in almost four-and-a-half years in March, preliminary data showed on Friday, fueling concerns of deflation in the euro zone.Spanish prices fell 0.2 percent in March from a year earlier, largely due to a drop in food and drink costs and after March 2013 included the busy Easter period, National Statistics Institute INE said.That was the lowest reading since October 2009.Yields on Spain\u2019s benchmark 10-year bond fell to their lowest point in eight years on the secondary market following the data, which also sent the euro lower.Separately, Spanish retail sales fell 0.5 percent in February, other INE data showed, as consumers continue to shun the high street while the country\u2019s economy struggles to return to solid growth after more than a five-year slump.The European Central Bank says there is no threat of deflation in the currency bloc although the euro zone number has been in its \u201cdanger zone\u201d below 1 percent for five months now.The bank is not expected to cut interest rates at its next meeting on April 3.But strong recent rhetoric from policymakers about the euro\u2019s strength - in tandem with concerns about falling inflation - have increased expectations the bank will take other steps to ease monetary policy.One economist noted that, with one-time price pressures such as energy and the Easter holiday hitting the March data, the ECB will need to see a proper breakdown of prices before making a decision on whether to act.\u201cThere\u2019s been a decent fall in petrol prices in the euro zone in March, which will affect overall energy prices, so if you take the view that\u2019s a one-off, there\u2019s less of a reason to be worried,\u201d economist at Capital Economics Ben May said.\u201cBefore any knee-jerk reactions, the ECB will want to see a breakdown. If the drop is due to energy and hotel rooms, then they\u2019ll take these figures with a pinch of salt rather than as a sign of a broad-based slowdown.\u201dInflation across the euro zone as a whole is expected to ease to 0.6 percent in March from 0.7 percent a month earlier when preliminary figures are published March 31. Germany reports flash prices later on Friday.INE data also showed Spain\u2019s EU-harmonised consumer price index fell by 0.2 percent in March on an annual basis, below a previous reading in February, and a forecast by analysts polled by Reuters, of a rise of 0.1 percent.Spain reports final price data on April 11.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warily Leading Japan\u2019s Nuclear Reawakening", "Date": "2014-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIkata JournalIKATA, Japan \u2014 To power his plans for Japan\u2019s economic revival, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe could soon return his nation to nuclear power for the first time since the Fukushima accident three years ago. But before he can, he will need the consent of the remote towns like this one that host Japan\u2019s idled nuclear plants.All signs are that he will get it. In Japan\u2019s political world, local consent means getting the approval of the host communities\u2019 mayors, many of whom say they have suffered from loss of plant-related tax revenue and jobs that lifted living standards in their once-impoverished rural towns and villages. Ikata\u2019s mayor says local businesses are clamoring for a restart of their local plant, the Ikata Nuclear Power Station, built in 1977 on a narrow peninsula facing Japan\u2019s Inland Sea.The mayor, Kazuhiko Yamashita, said in an interview that he would accept the plant\u2019s resuming operations if central government regulators proclaimed it safe. Political analysts say such a cooperative attitude has made Ikata likely to be near the front of the line when Mr. Abe\u2019s government turns on the first of Japan\u2019s 48 idled reactors, which could come as early as this summer.But that does not mean all of Ikata\u2019s 10,700 residents are happy about leading their nation back into the atomic power age. Many confess to feeling deeply conflicted about the plant, located a few miles north of the town center over a row of mountains covered with mandarin orange groves, Ikata\u2019s other economic mainstay.While most were reluctant to say so publicly, many quietly expressed a mixture of resignation and dread about the prospect of restarting the plant. They said that while they know the town depends on it economically, they fear living with a new nightmare, of suffering the same fate as residents from the evacuated towns around the Fukushima Daiichi plant.\u201cThe restart question gives us complex feelings,\u201d said Akihito Sakamoto, a town employee. \u201cWe feel frightened by the plant, but we also know we need it.\u201dThe town\u2019s angst is a microcosm for the indecision that has gripped Japan as a whole. Though it has idled its undamaged reactors because of post-Fukushima safety fears, it also frets about losing a vital source of energy for this resource-poor nation. Mr. Abe and his governing Liberal Democratic Party, which has close ties to Japan\u2019s powerful nuclear industry, have vowed to break through the logjam by restarting at least some reactors to provide low-cost electricity in hopes of keeping more factories and jobs in Japan.This has led to growing political pressure on the newly created nuclear monitoring agency to speed through safety reviews of the 17 most modern Japanese reactors, including the newest of the three reactors at the Ikata power station, as a step toward turning them back on. Analysts and industry executives say the first approvals could come in May or June, possibly in time for peak summer use.It would then fall on the host towns to give final approvals before Mr. Abe\u2019s government could restart the plants. Politicians and analysts say this will place intense pressure on local residents, including mayors, to swallow whatever misgivings they might have and say yes.\u201cThe lack of a national consensus on nuclear power shifts the burden of decision to these local communities,\u201d said Motohisa Furukawa, a former minister in charge of economic and energy strategy. \u201cTowns will feel bound to serve the national interest.\u201dIkata, on the western edge of Shikoku, the smallest of Japan\u2019s four main islands, is already feeling the pressure in a different form, the enormous financial losses caused by the idling of its plant.Town officials say Ikata\u2019s overall annual tax revenue has plummeted by a third, or about $35 million, since the last of the plant\u2019s three reactors went offline two years ago. The biggest reason, officials said, is the disappearance of revenue from a tax that host communities are allowed to place on all new nuclear fuel brought into the plants. Those shipments have stopped since the reactors have been turned off.Since then, the mayor, Mr. Yamashita, has called for reducing Ikata\u2019s dependence on the plant by attracting more tourists to pick oranges, or fish in the Inland Sea. However, he also admits that it is impossible to replace the plant as the basis of the town\u2019s economic well-being.\u201cWe know the plant has risk, but so does riding in an airplane or a car,\u201d Mr. Yamashita said. \u201cWe want the national government to convince us that they are taking every measure to reduce that risk as much as possible.\u201dNowhere is his town\u2019s economic dependence on the plant more evident than in the appearance of the town hall, much of it funded by plant-related income. The oversize seven-story structure dwarfs every building around it \u2014 except for an equally imposing one next door that houses the museum-style promotional center for the Ikata nuclear plant.The two buildings are linked by an umbilical cord-like elevated walkway.As is often the case in Japan\u2019s close-knit rural areas, many Ikata residents were reluctant to express opinions that could anger fellow townspeople, in this case by criticizing the plant that neighbors depend on for their livelihoods. Most offered only glimpses of their fears, and then only if assured they would not be identified by name.Still, there has been an appearance of open, if limited, opposition to the plant, evident in the bright yellow hand-painted signs outside its gates that proclaim \u201cAbsolutely No Nukes!\u201d A few townspeople also joined a lawsuit to shut it down permanently, though most of the 1,002 plaintiffs are from neighboring towns. The case, which was filed after the March 2011 Fukushima accident, is still in court.\u201cI think there is a deep layer of opposition to the nuclear plant, but those with money are using fear-mongering about damage to the economy to suppress it,\u201d said one of the lawsuit\u2019s leaders, Hideto Matsuura, 68, a retired manager at a machinery manufacturer who lives in a nearby city.The plant\u2019s operator, the Shikoku Electric Power Company, has tried to allay these fears by spending $840 million on a four-year plan to bring the plant in line with tougher new safety standards. This has included assembling a small fleet of trucks carrying backup generators and water pumps on high ground, out of reach of large tsunamis like the one that ruined power and water-cooling systems at the Fukushima plant.The company says it has posted annual losses every year since the plant was idled because of the $70 million monthly cost of importing extra fuel for its overworked coal-fired plants.\u201cWhen the central government cannot make up its mind,\u201d said Akifumi Nishizaki, a Shikoku Electric spokesman, \u201cthe local economies suffer the consequences.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Just Right Inequality", "Date": "2014-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf we can\u2019t have (and don\u2019t actually want) total equality or total inequality, what is the right amount of inequality?Freeman argues that the costs of excessive inequality are high: \u201cInequality that results from monopoly power, rent-seeking or activities with negative externalities that enrich their owners while lowering societal income (think pollution or crime), adversely affect economic performance. High inequality reinforces corruption by allowing a few \u2018crony capitalists\u2019 to lobby politicians or regulators to protect their economic advantages. When national income goes mostly to those at the top, there is little left to motivate people lower down. The 2007 collapse of Wall Street and bailout of banks-too-big-to-fail showed that inequality in income and power can threaten economic stability and give the few a stranglehold on the economy.\u201dConservative economists look at the issue of equality from the opposite vantage point: When do government efforts to remedy inequality and to redistribute income worsen conditions by serving as a deterrent to work and productive activity?The explicit intent of Mulligan\u2019s book is to show \u201cthat actual safety net expansions and minimum wage hikes were, in combination, enough to explain the reduction in labor hours since 2007, and many of the other changes in the major economic variables.\u201dIn other words, government enhancement of \u201cpayments to people who do not work\u201d prompted, in Mulligan\u2019s view, \u201ca few million people to do what the government paid them to do: not work.\u201dWritten by three I.M.F. economists \u2014 Jonathan D. Ostry, Andrew Berg and Charalambos G. Tsangarides \u2014 the study found that \u201clower net inequality is robustly correlated with faster and more durable growth, for a given level of redistribution.\u201dAnd, most significantly from a policy perspective, the three I.M.F. economists argue that \u201credistribution appears generally benign in terms of its impact on growth; only in extreme cases is there some evidence that it may have direct negative effects on growth. Thus the combined direct and indirect effects of redistribution \u2014 including the growth effects of the resulting lower inequality \u2014 are on average pro-growth.\u201dThese economists suggest that instead of making blanket statements about the pluses and minuses of redistributive policies, analysts should focus on the very different effects of specific policies.High tax rates and large subsidies to the nonworking poor can \u201cdampen incentives to work and invest,\u201d they write. But other steps can be highly beneficial: \u201cRedistribution need not be inherently detrimental to growth, to the degree that it involves reducing tax expenditures or loopholes that benefit the rich or as part of broader tax reforms (such as higher inheritance taxes offset by lower taxes on labor income). More broadly, redistribution can also occur when progressive taxes finance public investment, when social insurance spending enhances the welfare of the poor and risk taking, or when higher health and education spending benefits the poor, helping to offset labor and capital market imperfections. In such cases, redistributive policies could increase both equality and growth.\u201dLawrence Katz, also a Harvard economist, basically agrees. In response to my emailed inquiry, he wrote, \u201ctoo low a level of inequality from low returns to investment, entrepreneurial activity, and investment in education/skills could certainly harm growth and productivity by reducing incentives for innovation, productive investments, and labor supply, and by harming the health and well-being of the non-elite.\u201dAt the same time, Katz suggested, \u201cinequality that is too high could harm growth and inequality through capital market constraints that prevent many talented individuals from non-elite backgrounds from investing in human capital, through rent seeking behavior driving out productive activity, from the elites/incumbent firms investing in entry barrier rather than innovation, and from political instability.\u201dFor C.E.O.'s, in this analysis, the value of a pay raise grows in direct proportion to the lowering of the top tax rate. For an executive making $10 million annually, getting a raise of $2 million has an after-tax value of $1.3 million if the top rate is 35 percent. If the top rate is 70 percent, the raise has an after-tax value of $600,000.Lowering the top rate creates a powerful incentive for C.E.O.'s to press sympathetic boards of directors for a larger pay hike than company performance justifies.Katz, explaining the complex formulas and statistical measurement techniques used by Piketty and his colleagues, says that their findings suggest that a 10 percent cut in the top tax rate increases the income of the top 1 percent 2.6 percent.This shift in the share of national income going to the top 1 percent produces no increase in G.D.P. growth, according to Piketty et al. It does, however, reduce the share of national income going to the bottom 99 percent by just under 1 percent.Katz is far less sanguine. In a series of email exchanges, he warned that \u201cthere are reasons to worry that tax avoidance and international migration and capital flows of the rich could be more important today than in the historical variation they examine. I would certainly be nervous going up to marginal tax rates as high as they suggest and I think even they believe one would need international coordination to do so.\u201dMore conservative economists have examined the issue of inequality and growth and come to very different conclusions from their counterparts on the left.What, then, should government do?Mankiw\u2019s answer: nothing: \u201cIn the end, I am led to conclude that concern about income inequality, and especially growth in incomes of the top 1 percent, cannot be founded primarily on concern about inefficiency and inequality of opportunity.\u201dMankiw mocks liberal thinking on redistribution: \u201cThe rich earn higher incomes because they contribute more to society than others do. However, because of diminishing marginal utility, they don\u2019t get much value from their last few dollars of consumption. So we should take some of their income away and give it to less-productive members of society. While this policy would cause the most productive members to work less, shrinking the size of the economic pie, that is a cost we should bear, to some degree, to increase utility for society\u2019s less-productive citizens.\u201dEconomists are deeply polarized on the issue of \u201coptimal inequality,\u201d as well as on optimal top tax rates.Insofar as there is any resolution, it will be determined by a political power struggle.On the other hand, the steady increase in the number of minority voters \u2013 black, Hispanic and Asian \u2013 will strengthen the hand of liberal critics of inequality.However, this leftward ideological and demographic shift is taking place largely within the Democratic electorate and much less so among the public at large.With recent history as a guide, the smart handicapper will take the safe bet on the power of money over demographics. For the moment, the political reality is that the Democratic Party does not have the stomach to seriously engage the issue of inequality, and remains far too conflicted to take on the concentration of power and income at the top. Those benefiting most from the system as it is will continue to determine the operative definition of optimal inequality.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rose-Colored Words, but Gray Outcomes", "Date": "2014-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApplied ScienceWhen all the words you hear about the economy are bullish, you may want to run in the other direction. This counterintuitive finding \u2014 that positive visions of the future precede downturns \u2014 appears to be the case both for people and the economy as a whole.\u201cA cultural climate of positive thinking about the future, may have contributed to low economic achievement,\u201d the article concludes.The paper, by scholars from New York University and the University of Hamburg, speculates that widespread optimism could cause people to discount the risk of trouble ahead, make unwise investments, be less entrepreneurial and thus exacerbate or even create economic weakness.The research examined 99 articles that focused on business and economic conditions and were published on the front page of the Money section of USA Today from August 2007 to June 2009. More positive or optimistic language in the articles, which were chosen at random, correlated with relatively poor performance of the Dow Jones industrial average the following week and one month later. In a second measure, the scholars studied language used in 21 presidential inaugural addresses from 1933 to 2009. The more exuberant the speeches, the less prosperous the economic development in the subsequent term, as measured by gross domestic product and the unemployment rate. Those readers with a cynical outlook, or even just a realistic one, could fairly say: Come on, there must be a lot of explanations for this data. Absolutely. The finding is a correlation, not causation, meaning it doesn\u2019t show that optimistic language causes downturns. And it is fair to ask whether articles from a single publication or presidential speeches are a fair proxy for the national mood. They might even be at odds with it, given that a president, for example, might try to sound excited as a way to rally dispirited citizens.But, broadly, a body of research supports the study\u2019s hypotheses. Previous research has found that people with elaborate fantasies not tempered by a realistic assessment of challenges are less likely to get results than are people with more modest visions.One study found that college graduates with positive visions of their futures wound up having fewer job offers and lower salaries than graduates with more negative views. Other studies showed that the more a person trying to lose weight fantasized about his success, the less likely he was to lose those pounds. \u201cThe proposition in self-help literature is: Dream it and then you\u2019ll do it,\u201d she said. The research doesn\u2019t support that idea. Rather, to succeed, \u201cyou need to have a dream, but at the same time you need to understand what is it in you that stands in the way of fulfilling that dream.\u201dIn the current research, Dr. Oettingen said, \u201cthe economy basically reflected the same ideas we have found repeatedly on an individual level.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Buyer\u2019s Market, Colleges Become Fluent in the Language of Business", "Date": "2014-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisThe ruling this week that Northwestern University must treat scholarship football players as employees defies the way colleges view themselves, and has administrators nationwide wondering if this is the first step toward turning college sports into something unrecognizable.But in one key sense, the decision by an official of the National Labor Relations Board, which will allow the players to form a union and bargain collectively, fits into a long and familiar trend: Higher education is today less a rite of passage in which institutions serve in loco parentis, and more a commercial transaction between school and student.Graduate students are forming unions, or trying to, at a growing number of universities. The new vogue in college ratings compares them by graduates\u2019 incomes, and publications are full of debate about the price and value of college. Bookstores carry shelves of volumes on wringing more aid from schools and maximizing return on investment.\u201cWe\u2019ve had decades of rising supercompetitiveness among colleges and universities \u2014 competitiveness in research, in athletics, for students, for money \u2014 and it produces a loss of innocence,\u201d said Robert Zemsky, a professor at the Graduate School of Education of the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIt has crystallized the understanding that higher education is a market,\u201d and in a market, the goal is to beat the competition.The Northwestern ruling faces several potential legal challenges, and may never take effect. But either way, it is a jarring reminder how things have changed from half a century ago, when far fewer people went to college, student behavior and even dress were regulated as part of a broader definition of education, and students were more privileged and less free to chart their own educational courses.Traditional nonprofit colleges and universities like to think of themselves as producing not just workers but citizens, rounded contributors to society, and students think that way, too, said M. Peter McPherson, president of the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities. When he was president of Michigan State University, he noted \u201chow many people who are graduates of Michigan State are on city councils, how many are principals of schools,\u201d Mr. McPherson said. \u201cI think there has been some movement away from the public good to the private value, but I just hate the idea of thinking of college as transactional.\u201dHunter R. Rawlings III, a former president of the University of Iowa and Cornell University, and now president of the Association of American Universities, agreed. \u201cWe\u2019re a lot less sentimental about college than we used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cMuch more than before, society tends to look at a college education as primarily a steppingstone to a job and prosperity, and there are things going on in the economy that have fueled this view.\u201dCareers require more education than in the past, the income disparity between those with and without a degree has widened, and the rising cost of college has sharpened families\u2019 focus on the bottom line. When politicians talk about promoting education, it is couched in terms of meeting the demands of a more sophisticated job market and competing economically with other nations.The rapid expansion of for-profit colleges in the last generation has drawn attention to schools that freely admit to being commercial enterprises, without the gauzy images of neo-Gothic architecture and ivy-covered dorms. At the same time, a growing number of college students come from low-income families that have more reason than their privileged peers to take a utilitarian view of education.\u201cIt makes a certain amount of sense for those families, especially, to think about return on investment, but I would hope that they would see other values, as well,\u201d Mr. Rawlings said. He disparaged evaluations of alumni earnings by college and major, \u201cbut let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s really part of American culture, because we evaluate practically everything monetarily.\u201dAnd even he could not help shifting to an argument that is, at its core, economic. \u201cMost people are going to have many jobs in their lives, so training for a specific field is less important than learning how to think and adapt,\u201d he said.Reports on the amount of money poured into higher education, high salaries for administrators and competition among schools invite comparisons to big business, with major college sports looking like an industry within that industry. And it is hard not to think of education as a commodity for sale in an era when colleges vie for students with promises not about the caliber of their academics, but also about the comfort of their dorms, the quality of their food and the amount of financial aid they can offer.\u201cStudents everywhere are being treated more and more as clients and customers,\u201d said Andrew Delbanco, a professor at Columbia University and the author of \u201cCollege: What It Was, Is, and Should Be.\u201d \u201cSometimes they\u2019re coddled, sometimes exploited \u2014 usually some of both.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Iran, Hopes Fade for Surge in the Economy", "Date": "2014-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith the start of the Iranian new year, on Friday, the government will begin phasing out subsidies on energy, the start of a process that will send the prices of gasoline and electricity, and other utilities, soaring by nearly 90 percent, economists say.The shortage of funds is also forcing the government to wind down a system of $12 monthly payments to nearly 60 million Iranians, with only the poorest eligible to reapply.In return, Mr. Rouhani\u2019s government can promise only a reduction in the inflation rate to 25 percent next year, from 42 percent last year and 32 percent currently.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.That was hardly the payoff that Farshid Farshi, a sketch artist, was expecting when he voted for Mr. Rouhani in June. Mr. Farshi and his wife, a hairdresser, gathered up the head scarves they were selling illegally in one of Tehran\u2019s central squares, Haft-e-Tir, recently, having spied the police up the road.Business was bad anyway, he complained, tying up his merchandise in a bundle on the back of their motorcycle. The couple\u2019s only daughter was hoping for a piano for her birthday, Mr. Farshi said. \u201cBut for now I only work more and more and have less and less. This seems to be our fate.\u201dMost people fear that prices will shoot up when subsidies are cut in the new year. \u201cAlready nobody is coming to the beauty salon\u201d where she used to work, Mr. Farshi\u2019s wife said, adding that she had been unemployed for the past year. \u201cThey are blow-drying their hair at home because they can\u2019t afford to pay for it any longer.\u201dClose to the Farshis sat a farmer from eastern Iran, selling Tupperware containers, and a nurse selling electronic cigarettes and hair glitter. \u201cNormally, we wouldn\u2019t sell things on the streets, but we all have to make extra money,\u201d said Mr. Farshi, adding that he also earns some money making black-and-white sketches of international celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and Albert Einstein.Iran\u2019s stock market, which rode high on optimism injected by the new government and the temporary nuclear deal, has been in decline, losing 14 percent since its peak in December. The national currency, the rial, after months of stability, has dropped about 4 percent against the dollar in the last month, to just over 30,000 rials to the dollar on the black market.For the first time since the elections, the government was forced to sell dollars on the open market this month to support the rial, insiders say. Government spokesmen, trying to play down the significance of the rial\u2019s fall, say the decline in the currency\u2019s value is the result of a seasonal rise in demand for foreign currency tied to the New Year holiday.Others are saying the markets are losing faith in the government\u2019s ability to get the economy going. \u201cWe are once again witnessing investors taking their money out of stocks and instead speculating on gold and foreign currency,\u201d one stock market expert, Hamid Mirmouni, told the Fararu website recently. \u201cThe government continues to waste time and money, investors are losing hope.\u201dEven those close to the Rouhani administration are saying they are hoping for a \u201cmiracle\u201d to avoid the political damage from the cuts. \u201cWe are facing a black spring in Iran,\u201d said Saeed Laylaz, an economist who advises Mr. Rouhani. He said he feared the government, like the Ahmadinejad administration, would resort to printing money to paper over the budget deficit, threatening a rise in inflation. \u201cI am worried we might witness turmoil,\u201d he said.Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, echoed such worries in a speech Tuesday to dozens of the country\u2019s most influential leaders, politicians, clerics and military commanders. He urged the government to pay attention to the poor, calling for social justice, meaning an equal distribution of wealth.\u201cThe Islamic system does not accept economic growth without social justice,\u201d Ayatollah Khamenei said. \u201cAny progress in the country\u2019s economy must improve the situation of the, in the true sense of the word, deprived sectors of the population.\u201dWhile Mr. Rouhani is counting on improved international relations and the trade that might come of it to lift the economy, Ayatollah Khamenei has designed a parallel economic plan based mainly on self-sufficiency. In what he calls a \u201cresistance economy,\u201d the country would mostly rely on itself, striving for near self-sufficiency in \u201cstrategic and primary items,\u201d the supreme leader said this week.Dismissing skeptics, the ayatollah said, \u201cThe resistance economy will lead to welfare and improving the condition of the life of all of the people, especially the poor.\u201dOne Tehran-based analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the economic problems openly, said that over the past decades many different governments had tried to fix the economy, but all had found it politically difficult, if not impossible.\u201cMany of our problems are systemic,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no real solution other than muddling on.\u201dBack at the Haft-e-Tir square in central Tehran, the street vendors complained that nobody was buying. \u201cI work as a nurse,\u201d said a 27-year-old woman who would give only her first name, Fatima. \u201cI\u2019d rather make my money in a hospital, but it\u2019s not enough,\u201d she said, looking left and right for plainclothes police officers.Mr. Laylaz, the economist, said that all the promises made by Mr. Rouhani were realistic, but that \u201creal action\u201d was needed. \u201cWe should completely liberalize our economy; there is no other choice,\u201d he argued. \u201cWe need to attract investors at any costs.

{"Headline": "For First Time in Years, a Raise for Many Japanese Workers", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s bid to revive its economy got much-needed backing Wednesday after a group of major exporters said they would raise wages for the first time in years. Still, union leaders warned that a wider recovery hinged on the fate of low-wage, informal workers who make up a growing part of the country\u2019s labor force.Toyota Motor said it would raise the average monthly base pay for union workers by 2,700 yen, or about $26, amounting to 0.8 percent of total monthly pay. It is Toyota\u2019s first such wage increase since 2008. The electronics maker Panasonic said its average base pay would rise by \u00a52,000. Other large manufacturers announced similar wage raises that will go into effect at the start of the new fiscal year, in April.These exporters, the biggest beneficiaries so far of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s economic growth strategy, have come under pressure from labor unions to share more of their wealth. Mr. Abe himself has said that wage growth is critical in the government\u2019s fight against deflation, the fall in prices that has long stifled Japan\u2019s economy.With the government\u2019s blessing, unions bargained hard during this year\u2019s \u201cspring labor offensive,\u201d the coordinated wage negotiations between Japan\u2019s biggest employers and their union workers that have determined salaries since the 1950s.As of midafternoon Wednesday, the majority of Japan\u2019s 52 largest manufacturers had agreed to raise their base pay, though not necessarily at the rates demanded by union representatives, according to a tally by the Japan Council of Metalworkers\u2019 Unions, a cross-industry union group. At Toyota, union workers had demanded a \u00a54,000 monthly pay rise but got only two-thirds of that.\u201cThe results do not meet all of our demands, but do go some way toward fighting deflation and bringing about economic growth,\u201d Koichiro Nishihara, head of the metalworkers\u2019 union group, said in a statement.Still, for economic recovery to take hold, pay must rise for workers at the thousands of companies below Japan\u2019s top corporate tier, trade union officials say.Wage growth could be especially slow, they warn, for the almost 40 percent of Japanese who work informal jobs. These workers already earn far less than regular employees and are typically accorded none of their job protections and benefits.\u201cThis is just a start,\u201d said Rikio Kozu, secretary-general of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation. \u201cWe must also work to bring wage increases to all workers, including those who toil at irregular jobs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... the Italian Piedmont", "Date": "2014-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real EstateThis three-bedroom house halfway between Turin and Asti, Italy, was built in 1908 and renovated over the last five years.A VILLA IN THE MONFERRATO REGION $1.36 MILLION (\u20ac990,000)This 1908 villa sits at 1,600 feet above sea level, affording southerly views over the countryside between Turin and Asti. The house, which has about 3,200 square feet of living space, and the property have been renovated over the last five years. A brickwork courtyard leads to the porticoed entrance. The first floor has an open living-dining area with a wood-burning fireplace, exposed ceiling beams, plaster walls and a tiled floor. There is also an eat-in kitchen with a gas cooktop, cabinets made by a local company, and an American-style refrigerator by Electrolux.Three bedrooms are on the second floor; one, the\u00a0master suite, has a dressing area and a bathroom. Several of the rooms open to a south-facing terrace that overlooks the garden. The basement includes a small wine cellar that is original to the house.Stairs from the courtyard lead to a 40-by-20-foot swimming pool with an outdoor shower and a changing room. The manicured garden includes a small Barbera d\u2019Asti vineyard, palm trees and olive trees that produce about 40 bottles of oil a year. The gardens and vineyard are tended by a neighbor.Security features include a motorized gate and a webcam security system that can be monitored remotely. The 0.6-acre property is equidistant from Turin and Asti; each is about 15 miles away. Turin\u2019s airport is a 40-minute drive; for trans-Atlantic flights, Milan\u2019s airport is about an hour and a half away. MARKET OVERVIEWThe southern Piedmont market is focused on the towns of Asti, Alba and Acqui Terme, which form a rough triangle about 50 miles southeast of Turin, with the Alps as a backdrop to the north. The list of wines produced in the Langhe and Monferrato regions of the province reads like a greatest hits of Italy: Barolo, Barbaresco, Barbera, Dolcetto. Many prospective buyers cross-shop in Tuscany, Umbria and Liguria, as well as the South of France, but, as Ms. Smith-Aichbichler said: \u201cThey look and see what they get for their money: not a lot. Then they end up on our doorstep.\u201dAt the lower end of the market, buyers can find an unrestored cascina, or farmhouse, for under $200,000; and attached village houses in move-in condition for about $350,000 and up.The sweet spot of the market right now is the middle range, agents said, defining that as ranging from about $500,000 to $1.1 million. Prospective buyers in that range can get a freestanding stone house, perhaps with an acre or two of vineyards, and great views.As in much of Europe, prices have fallen in the last several years by as much as 20 or 30 percent, although the best properties have held their value, agents said.Mr. Edwards said the market had revived considerably in the past year. \u201cIn 2009 we closed down because it just didn\u2019t seem worth operating,\u201d he said. \u201cWe opened again because we saw the market was coming alive. Things have really picked up. Last year was the best year we\u2019ve had since 2008.\u201dWHO BUYS IN PIEDMONTThe Piedmont has long been a popular second-home location for Swiss buyers, who are within a few hours\u2019 drive. \u201cThe Swiss love it here,\u201d Ms. Smith-Aichbichler said. \u201cThey are probably the very first ones who bought in the area.\u201d Buyers from Scandinavian and German-speaking countries have come on strong in recent years, as their currencies and economies have held up through the European economic crisis, agents said. \u201cBritish buyers were the majority up to 2008,\u201d Ms. Smith-Aichbichler said. \u201cNow the clients come mostly from Germany, Switzerland, Norway, even Finland.\u201d The socioeconomic profile of buyers has changed, too, Mr. Edwards said, as the credit crisis has made financing more difficult and the fall in prices has eliminated speculators.\u201cAt the moment we\u2019re seeing more people closer to retirement age,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore it was typically upper-working-class people, not necessarily wealthy, but they had a bit of expendable income.\u201d \u201cBut that market\u2019s gone,\u201d he added. Now, \u201cit\u2019s mostly people who have the money to spend,\u201d meaning buyers who can afford to pay cash and hold onto the property for a long time. Ms. Langen concurred, saying her typical buyers were 40 to 55 years old, and looking to retire to the Piedmont in 10 or 15 years, perhaps to run a guesthouse or try their hands at winemaking. BUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreign buyers in Italy. All transactions go through a notary, who handles contracts, does background checks on the property and ensures that taxes are paid. Foreign buyers are well protected by Italian law, Ms. Langen said; there is no need to hire a lawyer. \u201cYou are actually quite safe all the way through,\u201d she said. \u201cThe real estate register is quite good. You know what you are buying.\u201dTotal transaction costs for buyers are around 10 percent, agents said. That amount includes the notary\u2019s fee, generally around 1 percent of the sale price; property tax, which is based on the assessed value of the home; and half of the selling agent\u2019s fee, normally 3 percent of the selling price. Financing is hard to come by, Ms. Smith-Aichbichler said. \u201cPeople are much better off when they are able to purchase a property with a smaller mortgage. More than 30 percent mortgage for people with no income in Italy is very difficult.\u201d WEBSITESLANGUAGE AND CURRENCYItalian; euro (\u20ac1 = $1.37)TAXESAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Defiance Is Seen as a Confidence Builder for Syria\u2019s Government", "Date": "2014-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAMASCUS, Syria \u2014 Russia\u2019s growing rift with the West over the crisis in Ukraine has bolstered the confidence of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, pro-government analysts here say, emboldening him to press ahead with plans for re-election despite a three-year insurgency and making Syrian officials doubt that Russia will pressure him to compromise anytime soon.The Syrian government is acting with new assurance as its ally Russia moves to take over the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, dismissing American objections and signaling growing assertiveness against the West. Russia has been the Syrian government\u2019s most powerful backer, vetoing measures against Mr. Assad that the United States has supported in the United Nations Security Council. And now, Syrian analysts close to the government say, that seems less and less likely to change.The prospect of a compromise brokered by Russian and American officials to end the Syrian war seems increasingly remote, with no date set for the resumption of talks in Geneva. Instead, bonds are deepening, on both official and grass-roots levels, between Moscow and Damascus, Cold War allies that now see themselves standing together against Western aggression.The strong relationship with Russia, combined with recent battlefield victories for the government, like its seizure of the hilltop Crusader castle Krak des Chevaliers on Thursday along a strategic highway, are reinforcing a sense here and abroad that Mr. Assad will stay in power at least for the medium term. A pro-government Syrian journalist assessed official views this way: \u201cFrankly, their attitude is, \u2018We don\u2019t need Geneva.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Perhaps having tested the political wind, shopkeepers across Damascus have painted the Syrian flag on the corrugated metal gates of their shops, a statement against opposition groups that adopted a pre-Assad Syrian banner as their symbol. (Some of the shopkeepers say they did so out of conviction; others, because they feared they would face trouble if they did not.)To Russian and Syrian officials and their supporters, the Syrian war and the standoff over the Crimean Peninsula are essentially part of a single, larger battle, against post-Cold War American unilateralism. They see themselves as resisting Western conspiracies to topple inconvenient but legitimate presidents, Mr. Assad in Syria, and in Ukraine, the pro-Russian leader Viktor F. Yanukovych, whose flight in the face of street protests led to Russia\u2019s actions in Crimea.\u201cCrimea is the next Syria,\u201d said a Russian academic, leading a delegation of students in Damascus this week to explore opening a branch of a Russian institute here.His group \u2014 rare foreign visitors to the Syrian capital \u2014 ventured out one recent night from the Dama Rose hotel, undeterred by the concrete blast barriers. They packed a nearby restaurant, wearing sweatshirts printed with Russian and Syrian flags. Several days later, two of the students, guarded by several Syrians with pistols, painted a \u201cpeace mural\u201d featuring the two countries\u2019 flags on a university building.Accompanying them were Syrian escorts delegated by the foreign ministry to take them to tourist sites, nightclubs and meetings. Either out of an overabundance of caution or a sense that the visit had strategic importance, the escorts forbade longer interviews without official permission.Russia\u2019s stance has fostered a new Russophilia among a new generation of government supporters here, who, much as their elders flocked to Moscow to study in the Soviet Union\u2019s heyday, applaud plans for new Russian classes in Syrian schools.And it has brought displays of long-distance camaraderie between the two governments\u2019 supporters \u2014 and their detractors, who see their own, different parallels between Ukraine and Syria. They see Moscow and Damascus as too quick to sanction the use of force against popular protests that the governments dismiss as the work of terrorists and conspirators. Anti-Russian protesters in Ukraine and opposition activists in Syria have hoisted one another\u2019s flags, as have pro-government demonstrators in Moscow and Damascus.The Syrian government, not unlike President Obama\u2019s critics in Washington, sees the recent events as part of a decline in America\u2019s influence and a rise in Russia\u2019s. By meddling in the affairs of other countries, from Iraq to the former Soviet countries, said one prominent businessman and political observer in Syria, the United States provoked the world and squandered its position as the sole global power after the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse.\u201cNow there is Russia, China, and tomorrow God knows who else,\u201d said the businessman, E. Ali Al-Ahmad, the general secretary of the chamber of industry in the city of Homs, emphasizing that he was offering his personal political analysis. \u201cAmerica is forcing the world to oppose it. Even a small country like Syria is standing up to the United States.\u201dThe American system contributed much to the world by fostering creativity, he said, waving his iPhone to demonstrate. \u201cBut now,\u201d he said, \u201cthat system is destroying itself from within.\u201dDuring the Cold War, Syria, led by Mr. Assad\u2019s father, President Hafez al-Assad, was squarely in the Soviet orbit, with a planned economy like Moscow\u2019s. Soviet engineers built dams on the Euphrates River. Apartment blocks much like Moscow\u2019s sprouted around Damascus.Studying in Moscow was a coveted privilege, and thousands of Syrians brought back Russian wives, many still here despite the war. Half of the university professors here were educated in Russia. Among Syria\u2019s government and opposition alike are Soviet-era alumni who speak Russian fluently and fondly remember their days as students in Moscow.After the Soviet collapse in 1991, Russia kept its naval base on the Syrian coast. But when the London-educated Bashar al-Assad became president in 2000, he turned westward, at least in a commercial sense, opening Syria to Western companies. English, not Russian, became de rigueur among the elite.Then came the Syrian revolt. Opposing Western support for it was a natural extension of Russia\u2019s long-stated aversion to international interference on human rights issues. With Iran and China, Moscow sustained the Assad government financially, and kept fulfilling arms contracts even as Syria\u2019s Russian-made fighter jets bombed civilians.Most crucially, after chemical attacks last August, Russia helped avert an American military strike by brokering a deal to remove Syria\u2019s toxic arms. \u201cThank you, Russia,\u201d read fliers in Russian and Arabic taped to downtown Damascus walls.Later, the Syrian government announced that next year, Syrian children could study Russian instead of French, in addition to required English. The goals, the education minister told Hezbollah\u2019s Al Manar television channel, was to renew Soviet-era ties and build cultural bonds with \u201cpeoples who want to cooperate based on mutual respect and common interests.\u201dIn the Damascus suburb of Sayeda Zeinab on Thursday, Senaa al-Kadoura, a government supporter who fled her insurgent-blockaded home in the northern Syrian village of Zahra, said she wanted her 2-year-old son to learn Russian.\u201cOf course, we want to learn their language, because they are the ones helping us,\u201d she said, issuing a general invitation for Russians to visit her home someday.\u201cWe send them our thanks,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to see them in Zahra.\u201dWhen tensions rose in Crimea, Mr. Assad returned the political favor with an official missive praising President Vladimir V.

{"Headline": "Catching Perth\u2019s Wave in Western Australia", "Date": "2014-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNext Stop Conjure up a city embodying all things right about cities. Assuming you lean toward the progressive, I\u2019ll wager your rendering includes the following: multiple parks and waterfronts; spotless subways and free public buses; restaurant menus with organic, locally sourced food and wine; cool bars in heritage buildings; and pop-up everything, from farmers\u2019 markets to cinema and yoga.Welcome to Perth.The capital of Western Australia, where some 1.8 of the state\u2019s two million residents live, left this New Yorker mesmerized: Could a city really be so easy, breezy, green and pristine \u2014 so positively livable? I\u2019d thought Williamsburg was hipster heaven; it pales beside Perth. In truth, such a conjuring of the city has, in the last seven years or so, become a reality. Since the 1880s, when Western Australia\u2019s gold rushes began, Perth has had a boom-and-bust economy, but the past decade was mostly boom, with an emphasis on natural resources like uranium, iron, zinc and natural gas. Perth\u2019s style of growth, though, eschews big-and-bling for eco-fabulous \u2014 the anti-Dubai. Still, cranes are a fixture of the skyline as grand, thoughtful urban developments keep on coming. A state investment program pours millions into new infrastructure and big projects, including a 15,500-seat futuristic arena that opened in 2012; a $750 million airport terminal is also now in the works. Australians once joked that \u201cWA\u201d stood not for \u201cWestern Australia\u201d but \u201cwait awhile\u201d \u2014 a jab at the laid-back west-coast lifestyle, not as up-to-the-minute as Melbourne or Sydney \u2014 but that now has a new connotation: If you think Perth is getting trendy, wait till you see what it\u2019s becoming. In January, I checked into the Terrace, a new boutique hotel in a house that dates back to the late 19th century, decked out in oak paneling, four-poster beds and sexy Art Deco-style paintings. The hotel, in the ultrahip Central Business District, embodies the Perth paradox: hot new openings, mostly in historic sites, go to great lengths to evoke \u201cold.\u201d In Australia, of course, \u201cold\u201d is fairly young \u2014 Perth became a colony in 1829 \u2014 but the result makes for rich juxtapositions: Step from a concrete office complex into a restaurant pretending to be a 1920s speakeasy.I ate a divine organic breakfast at the hotel \u2014 eggs and smoked salmon on homemade rye, accompanied by portobello mushrooms and what tasted like the freshest coffee ever ground. Australian coffee culture is serious, doctrinal business, complete with lexicon: Know thy \u201clong black\u201d from thy \u201cflat white.\u201dEvery day of my 13-day stay was sunny, and I mean not-a-cloud-in-the-sky sunny, almost synthetically sunny.Jamming flier after flier into my purse \u2014 comedy series? film festival? eco-market? \u2014 I strolled to the Central Business District. Northbridge and the district will soon be more attractively connected; the Perth City Link project is currently sinking the railway that divides them underground, just as the Elizabeth Quay project \u2014 set to include pedestrian areas, a luxury hotel and perhaps an Aboriginal art center \u2014 is extending the Central Business District down to the Swan River. I marveled at the district\u2019s contrasts: In a four-block radius you\u2019ll find tony King Street, home to Louis Vuitton and Chanel, generic strip malls and office complexes. You\u2019ll also find Uncle Joe\u2019s Mess Hall, a retro-hipster wonderland where you can get an old-school trim at the barber shop and then eat vegan spirulina balls. The British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver just opened an Italian restaurant in the business district, but the most stylish hangouts, located in alleyways once used for garbage, emphasize urbane grit. They bear names like Bob\u00e8che and Toastface Grillah, and devote page after page to elaborate cocktails. Ever since the city created a special liquor license for them in 2005, small bars \u2014 usually also peddling small bites \u2014 have proliferated; you can spend practically every night in a different bar that, a century ago, was something else: a technical school (Bar Lafayette), a rag factory (1907), a cottage (the Old Crow), a residence and stable (the Stables Bar).I dined at Print Hall, one of the city\u2019s most celebrated new restaurants, set in an old printing press building and featuring soaring ceilings and a bright white atrium. The lower level is a coffee emporium, where you can find coffee roasted in-house, and the main floor is devoted to locally sourced fine dining and live oyster shucking. On the sweeping rooftop bar, ogle the view and sip a Bloody American \u2014 a Campari and blood orange concoction \u2014 or a New York Bee-Sting, a combination of rye, Cognac and honey. The mezzanine, wallpapered in Chinese newspaper, is the Apple Daily Bar and Eating House, serving Hong Kong-style yum cha. There, my glass of sauvignon-semillon and steamed scallops with soy rice wine dressing were served by a waitress with piercings and electric-pink lipstick. It seemed as if everyone in Perth was under the age of 30.Changing hotels allowed me to experience the other face of the new Perth. Fraser Suites is a gleaming 19-story high-rise with floor-to-ceiling windows, opened in 2012 in the up-and-coming Queens Riverside area. New restaurants and bars are on the way in the neighborhood; there\u2019s even a beach being constructed. After settling in my sky-high room, I tackled more neighborhoods, relishing rides on free buses or subways so immaculate they felt like toys. A fast ferry carried me to South Perth to wander along the Swan River, where black swans glide. I went north to the Subiaco neighborhood, known for its funky Sunday market. Several short subway stops away was Mount Lawley, where I found a community radio station, vintage shops and a popular comedy night at the Brisbane Hotel, exuding East Los Angeles-style cool. The nearby town of Fremantle, meanwhile, felt like an Australian version of South Street Seaport. It is packed with 19th-century buildings, organic restaurants and coffee shops. At the Fremantle Prison, built in the 1850s and now a fascinating museum, I was stunned by the Aboriginal art gallery, with its vibrant paintings and murals, many depicting the racist legacy of Australia\u2019s criminal justice system. Later I watched the sun set while listening to a jazz trio at Little Creatures, a warehouse of a microbrewery where, amid the nooks and crannies, there\u2019s a sandy beer garden and magnificent outdoor terrace. Before leaving, I took two short day trips to Perth\u2019s neighboring mini-worlds. Historic Swan Valley \u2014 not in fact a valley but a charming 20-mile loop \u2014 is the closest wine district to any Australian capital. There are century-old heritage buildings, along with worthy Aboriginal sites, but the primary attraction is worth signing onto a bus tour for: 41 boutique wineries, five microbreweries, two distilleries, even two chocolate factories, good for staving off a hangover. The newly refurbished Crown Perth complex is in the city itself but might as well be its own sumptuous planet: casino, high-end retail, two luxury hotels and a third \u2014 soon to be the city\u2019s largest and what\u2019s being called its only \u201csix-star\u201d property \u2014 on the way. There\u2019s a 2,300-seat theater staging shows like \u201cJersey Boys\u201d and 32 restaurants and bars, including La Vie Champagne lounge and one of two Nobus in Australia. Settling into a cobalt blue cabana alongside the serpentine pool crowded with gleefully tipsy vacationers, I spied the roped-off \u201cenclave\u201d section reserved for high-rollers and watched hungry masses line up for the lavish buffet. I could have been in Vegas or Dubai, really, but I didn\u2019t mind. In the context of the progressive, user-friendly, oh-so-funky city that Perth has become, this little pocket of what it might have been beckoned with just the right dose of urban excess.

{"Headline": "Russia Is Ousted From Group of 8 by U.S. and Allies", "Date": "2014-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE HAGUE \u2014 The United States and its closest allies on Monday cast Russia out of the Group of 8 industrialized democracies, their most exclusive club, to punish President Vladimir V. Putin for his lightning annexation of Crimea, while threatening tougher sanctions if he escalates aggression against Ukraine.President Obama and the leaders of Canada, Japan and Europe\u2019s four strongest economies gathered for the first time since the Ukraine crisis erupted last month, using a closed two-hour meeting on the sidelines of a summit meeting about nuclear security to project a united front against Moscow.But they stopped short, at least for now, of imposing sanctions against what a senior Obama administration official called vital sectors of the Russian economy: energy, banking and finance, engineering and the arms industry. Only further aggression by Mr. Putin \u2014 like rolling his forces into the Ukrainian mainland \u2014 would prompt that much-harsher punishment, the countries indicated in their joint statement, called the Hague Declaration.\u201cThe biggest hammer that can drop is sectoral sanctions, and the clearest trigger for those is eastern and southern Ukraine,\u201d the senior administration official said.Some critics of the administration said the suspension of Russia from the G-8, which administration officials acknowledged was largely symbolic, showed a lack of resolve among the allies to take tougher steps to undo Mr. Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea.But it signified a firming of Western resolve compared with the early days of the Crimea crisis, when Germany and some other allies said it was premature to consider excluding Russia from the club of industrial democracies. Having Russia as part of that group since 1998 was meant to signal cooperation between East and West, and its exclusion inevitably raises new echoes of Cold War-style rivalry.Announcing that they would boycott a Group of 8 meeting planned for Sochi \u2014 Mr. Putin\u2019s Black Sea showcase for the recent Winter Olympics \u2014 the seven countries who met here said they would instead gather by themselves in June in Brussels, headquarters of NATO and the European Union.\u201cWe will suspend our participation in the G-8 until Russia changes course,\u201d the seven countries declared in what constituted a subtle appeal to Russian leaders outside Mr. Putin\u2019s circle to press for a switch in direction.After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russia eagerly sought to join the tight circle of the world\u2019s top economies, eventually gaining entry in 1998. For all that Mr. Putin shrugged off the threat of canceling the Sochi summit this month \u2014 a shoulder shrug imitated here by his foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, on Monday \u2014 it is a blow to the Kremlin\u2019s search for prestige.Mr. Putin took membership in the group so seriously that he went all out when it came time for Russia to host the annual meeting for the first time. He rebuilt a broken-down czarist-era palace outside his hometown, St. Petersburg, in part with the summit in mind, adding a series of new mansions to the grounds for each leader to stay in. The Kremlin hired a Western public relations agency to promote its status as host.\u201cObviously, it\u2019s mostly symbolic, but symbols do matter,\u201d said Michael A. McFaul, the just-departed American ambassador to Moscow. \u201cThe G-8 was something they wanted to be part of. This for them was a symbol of being part of the big-boy club, the great power club \u2014 and the club of democracies, I might add.\u201dThe Obama administration voiced satisfaction that the West was united in punishing Russia, both now and in future, if it does not reverse course. \u201cThere really wasn\u2019t much disagreement\u201d at the meeting either about Russia or the need to swiftly aid Ukraine, the senior administration official said.Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, who with her foreign minister has had the most contact with Mr. Putin and other Russian officials during this crisis, has been among the most forthright in rejecting Mr. Putin\u2019s actions, despite the potential costs to Germany\u2019s economy.German businesses sold almost 40 billion euros of goods to Russia last year, and bought Russian imports of the same value, almost exclusively oil and natural gas supplies that meet about one-third of Germany\u2019s energy needs.But Ms. Merkel has strengthened Germany\u2019s response over the past two weeks after she perceived Mr. Putin as violating promises by annexing Crimea and opting for old-fashioned nationalism and the use of military force over the talk of cooperation and respect for borders that have governed East-West relations in recent decades.The support of Germany, the largest economy in Europe and a longtime bellwether on Russian relations, is viewed as crucial to enforcing tougher sanctions if they become necessary down the road. The administration official said that any such sanctions would have \u201cconsequences for the global economy and individual countries.\u201d\u201cThe cost is far greater for the Russians, who stand much more to lose,\u201d the official added.Russia argues that Crimea has effectively been Russian territory since the 18th century and was put under Ukrainian sovereignty only by the Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev in 1954 as a gesture of good will inside the Soviet Union. It says its military intervention was meant to protect Russian speakers from Ukrainian nationalists who helped topple the previous, more pro-Russian government.But Western leaders have condemned the military incursion as a violation of both international law and specific Russian agreements with Ukraine and the outside world, and disputed Russian claims that ethnic Russians faced threats to their safety.The leaders met on the sidelines of a nuclear security summit arranged in advance of the Ukraine crisis. Ms. Merkel, speaking to German reporters, noted that the two issues were deeply linked. Ukraine, she recalled, renounced its Soviet-era nuclear weapons in 1994 by concluding the Budapest Memorandum, an agreement with the United States, Britain and Russia to guarantee the integrity of Ukraine.That accord \u201chas been flagrantly violated,\u201d she noted.Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general of the United Nations, stressed in a speech to the full summit meeting that he worried some current or future nuclear powers could view the weapons as crucial to protect themselves against invasion, undermining hopes of reducing their spread.\u201cNuclear weapons should be seen as a liability and not an asset,\u201d he said.Also on the sidelines of the nuclear summit meeting, Mr. Lavrov held talks with his Ukrainian counterpart, Andriy Deshchytsia, for the first time since Russia\u2019s move into Crimea. The two defense ministers spoke by telephone last week, but the meeting \u2014 about which little was revealed \u2014 was the first such face-to-face encounter between members of the current governments in Moscow and Kiev.There was no mention in the Monday declaration of how much assistance the West will now give Ukraine, either in cash or in bolstering a relatively weak acting government until elections scheduled for May 25.Ukraine has said it needs \u20ac1 billion in immediate assistance, and the European Union is readying a further \u20ac11 billion, or about $15 billion, for this year, mostly through lending by European institutions. The declaration emphasized instead the \u201ccentral role\u201d of the International Monetary Fund in \u201clessening Ukraine\u2019s economic vulnerabilities, and better integrating the country as a market economy in the multilateral system.\u201d\u201cWe remain united in our commitment to provide strong financial backing to Ukraine,\u201d The Hague Declaration said, specifying that it would bolster trade and strengthen security in the key field of energy.European powers that depend heavily on Russia for natural gas also indicated that they would pursue a strategy to reduce dependence on Russian energy by June, though any effort to shift suppliers is likely to take many months or years.An article on Tuesday about Russia\u2019s ouster from the Group of 8 at a meeting in The Hague misidentified, at one point, the geographical area Russia has annexed. It is the Crimean region, not the nation of Ukraine. Because of an editing error, a picture caption with the article referred incorrectly, in some editions, to the leaders President Obama met in The Hague. Most are heads of government, not heads of state.Alan Cowell contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 Ukrainian Mayors Play Different Hands in Crisis", "Date": "2014-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDONETSK, Ukraine \u2014 The silver-haired mayor of this raw mining city in eastern Ukraine had just delivered a pep talk to about 100 uniformed police officers, beseeching them to ensure law and order in these turbulent times of revolution, when a bearded man in dark glasses took the microphone.\u201cIf we want peace,\u201d the man proclaimed, \u201cwe have to get ready for war!\u201dThe mayor, Alexander Lukyanchenko, 67, shot back: \u201cAnd tell me, just who are you planning to fight?\u201dThe answer was muddled talk laced with nostalgia for Soviet days and the supposed specter of nationalists from western Ukraine ready to crush the Russian-speaking east.But the exchange between the third-term mayor, dapper in a fine dark blue suit, and the rugged speaker, who identified himself as commander of a previously unknown group, the Eastern Front, exposed the jangled nerves in this city of one million and the tough task facing leaders who know they must keep workers\u2019 pay, pensions and supplies flowing even as they feel their hold on power waning.Hundreds of miles to the west, the mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovy, has the same worries as Mr. Lukyanchenko: keeping things calm when the political system has all but crumbled and the police are widely hated after 82 people, most of them protesters apparently shot by police snipers, were killed in Kiev last week.But of the two cities\u2019 mayors, Mr. Sadovy, 45, a political independent elected twice since 2006, seems to hold the better cards.He certainly seems to be enjoying his moment in the sun \u2014 with a young, English-speaking news team posting his near-daily briefings on YouTube \u2014 and perhaps ogling national office.He apparently has had no trouble in uniting those police officers who are still on the job with civilian volunteers to form a force of about 2,000 people who patrol the streets at night and handle traffic.And Mr. Sadovy made time to mourn at least one of the 13 protesters from the Lviv region who were killed in Kiev, placing three red roses on the open coffin of a 28-year-old history lecturer at a memorial last weekend.This week, Mr. Sadovy acted swiftly to proclaim Russian-language days in Lviv after the Ukrainian Parliament passed a widely criticized law that stripped Russian of its official status, infuriating Russian speakers in Ukraine. Slightly stooped, speaking Russian, Ukrainian and some English, the bespectacled Mr. Sadovy, a father of four sons, dispenses books showing the centuries of history in Lviv, a maze of cobbled streets, Baroque-era churches, palaces and fierce nationalism.He is proud of his city\u2019s cooperation with European groups, and like many residents looks to now-gleaming Krakow, in nearby Poland, as the model for Lviv, where barely five decades of Soviet rule are still felt in the dilapidation of once-splendid Hapsburg facades, or the barracks-like apartment blocks on the outskirts.When Mr. Sadovy and his fellow western Ukrainians learned in November that their now fugitive president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, had spurned an association agreement with the European Union, which they had watched inject funds into Poland that helped spur its renewal, they exploded in revolt. By late January, they had declared Lviv independent of central authority \u2014 \u201cFree City of a Free People,\u201d as the slogan reads on the huge Ukrainian flag now hanging on the ancient Town Hall.With Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s flight from Ukraine last weekend, the revolt succeeded in disposing of the man most people \u2014 even here in his hometown, Donetsk \u2014 denounce as murderous and extremely corrupt. But Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s departure has left a power vacuum, with quarreling leaders in Kiev taking power on a tidal wave of hurriedly passed laws and an economy reportedly edging closer to bankruptcy.\u201cMore economics, less politics\u201d was the only policy offered by Mr. Lukyanchenko in Donetsk on Tuesday after his session with the police.While he asked the news media not to play up the appearance of the professed Eastern Front commander, a day earlier, the mayor had appeared at a meeting that featured hundreds of masked and menacing men armed with clubs. A fellow Yanukovych acolyte, the governor of the Donetsk region, Andrei V. Shishatsky, had been filmed earlier inviting the crowd to celebrate what in Lviv is certainly a reviled, long-forgotten feast: the Day of the Soviet Army.The contrast in the two cities lies not just in the present, but in their pasts. Lviv \u2014 Lvov in Russian, Lemberg in German \u2014 pitched for centuries between Polish, Hapsburg, Czarist, Nazi and Soviet rule before the Soviet Union collapsed and Ukraine, a country of 46 million, became independent in 1991. The Soviet Union was, in effect, an interlude, with the last nationalist fighters quashed only in the 1950s.Donetsk, by contrast, was founded only in 1869 and is just an hour\u2019s drive from Russia. It was set up under the czars and reputedly populated with thousands of prisoners released from Siberia to dig coal shafts here.Its architecture is profoundly Soviet; a huge Lenin statue is now a rallying point for fuming residents, mostly older men, who vent about what they call fascists from western Ukraine. Streets still bear names like \u201c50 Years of the U.S.S.R.,\u201d which would count as a relic even in Moscow.Donetsk, however, provides about 25 percent of Ukraine\u2019s hard currency earnings, according to Nikolai Zagoruyko, a local leader in Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions. And the city can point to at least one moment of recent revolt: 1989 and 1990, when hundreds of thousands of mineworkers went on strike and took to the streets.\u201cThe miners then were the biggest force which moved the country,\u201d said Natalya Kuchar, 38, who works for the local independent trade union and whose father was one of the miners\u2019 leaders.After the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse in 1991, several of Donetsk's coal mines faltered, or were sold off \u2014 according to the workers, too cheaply \u2014 enriching a few and scaring miners who did keep jobs to accept wages that sank as low as $100 a month, according to Denys Kazansky, a local journalist.One man who benefited from the strike was Rinat Akhmetov, a billionaire who has bought Donetsk a fine soccer team, built a splendid stadium that was a site for the European soccer championship in 2012 and, unlike Mr. Yanukovych, whose campaigns he has supported, has stayed on the job. Indeed, he is so busy, said a spokeswoman, that he had no time to meet foreign reporters making rare trips to Donetsk.On Wednesday, Mr. Akhmetov sent a letter to the employees of his company, System Capital Management, said to number 300,000. Mr. Akhmetov, who appeared to back away from Mr. Yanukovych in recent weeks, wrote that \u201cwe, like all Ukrainians, are trying to found a new country in which democracy and the supremacy of law will be established, and the protection of property, free competition and social welfare provided.\u201d For that, according to a copy of the letter obtained by the newspaper Donskiye Novosti, extensive overhauls are required.How those changes are introduced is perhaps one secret Mr. Akhmetov is so far keeping to himself. Neither the fretting mayor, Mr. Lukyanchenko, nor the governor, Mr. Shishatsky, have offered much of a clue. Both have declared their loyalty to the still functioning Parliament in Kiev, and reiterated that Ukraine must hold together.With rival television channels in Russian and Ukrainian offering up wildly divergent versions of events, however, a split seems not unlikely. Ms. Kuchar, the union worker, said that her in-laws understood only the Russian broadcasts, and that when she and her husband gave their view of events, \u201cthey say things that make your hair stand on end.\u201dAs a result, she said, despite the couple\u2019s relief at Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s ouster, \u201cwe are very careful about being happy.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Car Sales Extend Fragile Recovery", "Date": "2014-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Sales of European passenger cars continued their feeble recovery in February for the sixth straight month, according to an industry report on Tuesday.The European economy has been slowly recovering since the first half of last year, but the car market has been moribund since the onset of the global credit crisis in 2008. As millions of jobs in the European Union depend on car sales directly or indirectly, economists watch the data for hints about the trajectory of growth and the prospects for the region\u2019s more than 26 million unemployed people.While sales have risen steadily since bottoming out in August, the total of 861,058 vehicles registered last month was still the second-lowest on record for a February, the association said. In a data series that goes back to 2003, when the European Union had fewer members, only the figure for February 2013 was lower.Analysts say that the tepid pace of economic recovery and cultural changes have delayed both the ages at which young people get their licenses and even whether they choose to buy cars. As a result, they said, sales might not return to precrisis levels before the end of the decade, at the earliest.With the exception of the French market, which contracted 1.4 percent, all major European Union markets posted growth in new-car sales, the association said, with sales in Germany, the largest market in Europe, up 4.3 percent. Britain, Italy and Spain also improved. The data Tuesday applied to 27 of the 28 European Union member states; figures for Malta were not available.Philippe Houchois, the head of European auto industry research at UBS in London, said the February figure was \u201cgood news, but it\u2019s still at very low levels.\u201dHe added that many analysts viewed sales as being artificially supported by discounting in countries like Germany. \u201cThat\u2019s bad for profitability,\u201d he said.Mr. Houchois noted that sales in the French market remained about 20 percent lower than at their peak in 2009, while Germany\u2019s was down 16 percent. In contrast, the Spanish market, which is racked by depression-level unemployment, is about 70 percent below its precrisis peak, he said, and Italy\u2019s is 48 percent lower.While those figures suggest the potential for a big rebound, Mr. Houchois said there was nothing in the data to suggest that such a comeback was happening anytime soon. He said he had not changed his forecast for European Union sales growth of 2.5 to 3 percent this year. Sales fell 1.7 percent last year.The largest European automaker, Volkswagen Group, which includes the Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda brands, posted an 8 percent sales gain from a year earlier.The No. 2 automaker, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, posted a 3.6 percent gain. Its sales were eclipsed by those of its French rival Renault, which posted an 11.7 percent rise in sales, led by the continuing success of its low-cost Dacia brand, whose sales rose more than 34 percent from a year earlier.General Motors and Ford Motor both showed increases of more than 12 percent in February sales, and Fiat Chrysler\u2019s sales rose 5.6 percent. Among major automakers, only Hyundai Motor and Honda Motor had lower sales than in February 2013.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Ottoman Revival Is Over", "Date": "2014-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorNEW YORK \u2014 For Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey\u2019s embattled prime minister, a win in Sunday\u2019s local elections will be a Pyrrhic victory. While his Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., will likely retain a majority of municipalities, Turkey as a whole, particularly as an international player, has lost. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s decade-plus grip on power has been weakened by anti-government protests, corruption allegations, and an ugly confrontation with the powerful and admired Muslim religious leader Fethullah Gulen. In a desperate effort to prevent any further hemorrhaging of his power, Mr. Erdogan has abandoned the ambitious foreign policy that was the basis for Turkey\u2019s regional resurgence in recent years and has resorted to attacking his enemies. The prime minister is now so fixated on his own political survival that he recently attempted, in vain, to shut down Twitter across the country. It\u2019s a far cry from 2003, when Mr. Erdogan ascended to the premiership and announced a determined and democratic agenda to strengthen Turkey\u2019s economic and global standing. I visited him soon afterward in Turkey\u2019s capital, Ankara. He told me then, \u201cThere are approximately 72 million people in this country \u2014 and I represent each and every one.\u201d To represent everyone, he pushed for the passage of laws that granted increased freedoms to Turkey\u2019s minorities, particularly the Kurds. He implemented economic policies to increase foreign investment. He reached out to far-flung capitals in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, opening more than a dozen embassies and many new markets. He even secured a rotating seat for Turkey on the United Nations Security Council in 2009 and made contributions to Washington\u2019s \u201cwar on terror.\u201d Nearly every road that has been fixed, public transportation project approved, school built and reform passed has been done so with an eye to extending Turkey\u2019s regional and global influence. In 2009, Mr. Erdogan began to advance a \u201czero problems\u201d foreign policy. The brainchild of his foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, the policy was predicated on the idea that Turkey isn\u2019t merely a \u201cbridge\u201d or \u201ccrossroads\u201d between East and West, but an integral player in international diplomacy, security and trade. Turkey sought closer relations with neighbors in the Balkans, Russia, and especially the Middle East. \u201cZero problems,\u201d guided Mr. Erdogan to deepen ties with Turkey\u2019s southern and eastern neighbors, including Iran and Syria. Both became major trading partners and, in Iran\u2019s case, a vital source for Turkish energy. Some have called it \u201cneo-Ottomanism\u201d \u2014 an attempt to restore the former Ottoman Empire and its vanished regional glory. Whatever the label, Turkey managed to become a key foreign policy player in the eyes of American and European leaders.President Obama traveled to Turkey in 2009 and spoke about the country\u2019s strategic importance and increasing global role. During the Arab Spring, Western leaders held Turkey up as a progressive and prosperous democratic model for other Muslim-majority nations. Mr. Erdogan even took Turkey further toward European Union accession than any leader before him. That model has now crumbled and the bold foreign policy agenda that made Turkey the world\u2019s 16th-largest economy has disappeared. The once dynamic economy has weakened, consumer confidence has declined and the Turkish lira has depreciated nearly 20 percent since May 2013.Beset by domestic crises, Mr. Erdogan has turned his focus toward his core constituency, a largely conservative, anti-Western population in the heartland. In doing so he has reverted to a tactic that has resonated with them: aggression. Frantic to recreate the enthusiasm he garnered after storming off a panel with Israel\u2019s president, Shimon Peres, in Davos in 2009 and his decision to cut ties with Israel after Israel attacked a Turkish flotilla in 2010, Mr. Erdogan has ramped up hostile rhetoric against his opponents \u2014 abroad and at home. He has attacked what he calls the \u201cinterest rate lobby,\u201d called last summer\u2019s protests a \u201cdirty plot by foreign-backed elements,\u201d and blamed the \u201cprovocative actions\u201d of \u201cforeign diplomats\u201d for concocting corruption allegations. Recently, he slammed Mr. Gulen and his followers as a \u201cspy ring\u201d seeking to overthrow the government.Moreover, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s current governance strategy has gutted the country\u2019s foreign policy. Nearby Crimea, a former Ottoman stronghold and the native land of the Tatars, an ethnic Turkic people, is a case in point. When Russia invaded and annexed the Black Sea peninsula, Mr. Erdogan failed to come to the defense of his cultural and religious brethren, as he did in Egypt. Indeed, after the Egyptian military ousted Mohamed Morsi in July, Mr. Erdogan dismissed their actions as \u201cillegal,\u201d refused to recognize the new government and recalled Turkey\u2019s ambassador to Cairo. On Crimea, the Turkish prime minister has restricted himself to grunts of disapproval despite the fears of the Tatars who will now fall under Russian control just 70 years after Stalin deported hundreds of thousands of Tatars to Siberia. Mr. Erdogan may believe that his tactics have worked. But in the long run, he\u2019ll have to accept that his increased belligerence has isolated his country. When it comes to regional issues like Egypt, Iran and Iraq, the United States has now largely marginalized Turkey.Not too long ago, the common question posed in Western capitals was \u201cWho lost Turkey?\u201d Many fingers pointed at Brussels and Washington. But today, as the prime minister steers Turkey away from its path of prosperity and international relevance toward antagonism and repression, the answer seems to be Mr. Erdogan himself.

{"Headline": "Obama Has Made America Look Weak", "Date": "2014-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorShould Russia\u2019s invasion and looming annexation of Crimea be blamed on President Barack Obama? Of course not, just as it should not be blamed on NATO expansion, the Iraq war or Western interventions to stop mass atrocities in the Balkans and Libya. The blame lies squarely with Vladimir V. Putin, an unreconstructed Russian imperialist and K.G.B. apparatchik.But in a broader sense, Crimea has exposed the disturbing lack of realism that has characterized our foreign policy under President Obama. It is this worldview, or lack of one, that must change.For five years, Americans have been told that \u201cthe tide of war is receding,\u201d that we can pull back from the world at little cost to our interests and values. This has fed a perception that the United States is weak, and to people like Mr. Putin, weakness is provocative. That is how Mr. Putin viewed the \u201creset\u201d policy. United States missile defense plans were scaled back. Allies in Eastern Europe and Georgia were undercut. NATO enlargement was tabled. A new strategic arms reduction treaty required significant cuts by America, but not Russia. Mr. Putin gave little. Mr. Obama promised \u201cmore flexibility.\u201dMr. Putin also saw a lack of resolve in President Obama\u2019s actions beyond Europe. In Afghanistan and Iraq, military decisions have appeared driven more by a desire to withdraw than to succeed. Defense budgets have been slashed based on hope, not strategy. Iran and China have bullied America\u2019s allies at no discernible cost. Perhaps worst of all, Bashar al-Assad crossed President Obama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d by using chemical weapons in Syria, and nothing happened to him. For Mr. Putin, vacillation invites aggression. His world is a brutish, cynical place, where power is worshiped, weakness is despised, and all rivalries are zero-sum. He sees the fall of the Soviet Union as the \u201cgreatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.\u201d He does not accept that Russia\u2019s neighbors, least of all Ukraine, are independent countries. To him, they are Russia\u2019s \u201cnear abroad\u201d and must be brought back under Moscow\u2019s dominion by any means necessary.What is most troubling about Mr. Putin\u2019s aggression in Crimea is that it reflects a growing disregard for America\u2019s credibility in the world. That has emboldened other aggressive actors \u2014 from Chinese nationalists to Al Qaeda terrorists and Iranian theocrats. Crimea must be the place where President Obama recognizes this reality and begins to restore the credibility of the United States as a world leader. This will require two different kinds of responses.The first, and most urgent, is crisis management. We need to work with our allies to shore up Ukraine, reassure shaken friends in Eastern Europe and the Baltic States, show Mr. Putin a strong, united front, and prevent the crisis from getting worse. This does not mean military action against Russia. But it should mean sanctioning Russian officials, isolating Russia internationally, and increasing NATO\u2019s military presence and exercises on its eastern frontier. It should mean boycotting the Group of 8 summit meeting in Sochi and convening the Group of 7 elsewhere. It should also mean making every effort to support and resupply Ukrainian patriots, both soldiers and civilians, who are standing their ground in government facilities across Crimea. They refuse to accept the dismemberment of their country. So should we.Crimea may be falling under Russian control, but Ukraine has another chance for freedom, rule of law and a European future. To seize that opportunity, Ukrainian leaders must unify the nation and commit to reform, and the West must provide significant financial and other assistance. Bipartisan legislation now before Congress would contribute to this effort.More broadly, we must rearm ourselves morally and intellectually to prevent the darkness of Mr. Putin\u2019s world from befalling more of humanity. We may wish to believe, as President Obama has said, that we are not \u201cin competition with Russia.\u201d But Mr. Putin believes Russia is in competition with us, and pretending otherwise is an unrealistic basis for a great nation\u2019s foreign policy.Three American presidents have sought to cooperate with Mr. Putin where our interests converge. What should be clear now, and should have been clear the last time he tore apart a country, is that our interests do not converge much. He will always insist on being our rival.The United States must look beyond Mr. Putin. His regime may appear imposing, but it is rotting inside. His Russia is not a great power on par with America. It is a gas station run by a corrupt, autocratic regime. And eventually, Russians will come for Mr. Putin in the same way and for the same reasons that Ukrainians came for Viktor F. Yanukovych.We must prepare for that day now. We should show the Russian people that we support their human rights by expanding the Magnitsky Act to impose more sanctions on those who abuse them. We should stop allowing their country\u2019s most corrupt officials to park ill-gotten proceeds in Western economies. We should prove that countries like Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova have a future in the Euro-Atlantic community, and Russia can, too.We must do all we can to demonstrate that the tide of history is with Ukraine \u2014 that the political values of the West, and not those of an imperial kleptocracy, are the hope of all nations. If Ukraine can emerge from this crisis independent, prosperous and anchored firmly in Europe, how long before Russians begin to ask, \u201cWhy not us?\u201d That would not just spell the end of Mr. Putin\u2019s imperial dreams; it would strip away the lies that sustain his rule over Russia itself.America\u2019s greatest strength has always been its hopeful vision of human progress. But hopes do not advance themselves, and the darkness that threatens them will not be checked by an America in denial about the world as it is. It requires realism, strength and leadership. If Crimea does not awaken us to this fact, I am afraid to think what will.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dispute on Sri Lanka War Crimes Escalates", "Date": "2014-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 About 100 government supporters marched to the American Embassy in Colombo, Sri Lanka, last week and smashed coconuts on the embassy\u2019s doorstep in a Hindu ritual meant to curse an enemy. \u201cWe will not let them take our president to the electric chair!\u201d the protesters shouted. \u201cIt is disturbing that the government of Sri Lanka has taken punitive measures against its own brave citizens who have devoted their careers and lives to investigating alleged human rights abuses by both sides during Sri Lanka\u2019s long and brutal civil conflict,\u201d Ms. Psaki\u2019s release stated. The dueling rites were part of an escalating conflict between the United States and Sri Lanka that is expected to rise to another level this week with a crucial vote at the United Nations Human Rights Council on whether the international body will start its own investigation into possible war crimes committed by government forces and separatists during Sri Lanka\u2019s 26-year civil war.On Tuesday, the Sri Lankan police released Ruki Fernando, one of Sri Lanka\u2019s most prominent human rights activists, along with the Rev. Praveen Mahesan, a Roman Catholic priest and the former director of the Center for Peace and Reconciliation, based in Jaffna. But the two, who had been in custody for three days, were barred from speaking to foreign reporters and ordered to surrender their computers and cellphone memory chips.Jeyakumari Balendran, an activist working on behalf of families still searching for loved ones who disappeared in government custody, remained in an infamous government detention camp. All three were detained because of their links with a militant, K. P. Selvanayagam, who escaped from government custody and then established an undercover rebel base in Norway, the Sri Lankan government said. Also last week, Sri Lanka\u2019s former president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, filed a complaint saying that state intelligence services had placed her under surveillance and were harassing her friends and acquaintances.\u201cIs the government trying to prove the case against it?\u201d he asked in a recent interview.The government sent a diplomatic note to other nations explaining that the police actions \u201care well within the existing legal framework and following due process.\u201dFive years after the end of a civil war in which government forces battled Tamil Tiger insurgents, the Sri Lankan government has shown little appetite for any robust investigation into possible war crimes. About 40,000 people, many of them civilians, are estimated to have been killed in the war\u2019s final stages in 2009.Fearing that a failure to investigate the past could rekindle a violent insurgency, the United States and other nations have lost patience with the Sri Lankan government and are now pressing for an outside investigation. President Mahinda Rajapaksa is popular in Sri Lanka because he ended the insurgency, and the country\u2019s economy has revived since the war\u2019s end, but an independent investigation of conduct during the war would be risky for him and at least one of his brothers, Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who led the government\u2019s military campaign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Punish Putin", "Date": "2014-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn September, I ran for mayor of Moscow as a pro-reform, pro-democracy opposition candidate and received almost a third of the vote despite having no access to state media. Today, my blog, which was until recently visited by over two million readers per month, has been blocked as \u201cextremist\u201d after I called for friendly ties with Ukraine and compliance with international law.For years, I have been telling journalists that President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s approval rating would soon peak and then tumble. Russia\u2019s economy is stagnant, I said, and the Russian people would soon weary of the president\u2019s empty promises. Even a rally-round-the-flag military adventure \u2014 a \u201clittle war,\u201d as it\u2019s known in Russia \u2014 would be impossible, I believed. Russia no longer had enemies.Then, on Feb. 28, Russia sent troops to Ukraine in precisely such a \u201clittle war.\u201d I admit that I underestimated Mr. Putin\u2019s talent for finding enemies, as well as his dedication to ruling as \u201cpresident for life,\u201d with powers on par with the czars\u2019.As a citizen and patriot, I cannot support actions against Russia that would worsen conditions for our people. Still, I recommend two options that, if successfully implemented, I believe would be welcomed by most Russians.First, although Mr. Putin\u2019s invasion has already prompted the European Union to impose sanctions on 21 officials, and the United States on seven, most of these government figures cannot be considered influential. They do not have major assets outside Russia and are irrelevant to Mr. Putin; sanctioning them will not change Russia\u2019s policy. After all the tough talk from Western politicians, this action is mocked in Russia and even seen as a tacit encouragement to Mr. Putin and his entourage, who seem to possess some magical immunity.Instead, Western nations could deliver a serious blow to the luxurious lifestyles enjoyed by the Kremlin\u2019s cronies who shuttle between Russia and the West. This means freezing the oligarchs\u2019 financial assets and seizing their property.Such sanctions should primarily target Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle, the Kremlin mafia who pillage the nation\u2019s wealth, including Gennady N. Timchenko, head of the Volga Group; Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, influential businessmen and former judo sparring partners of Mr. Putin; Yuri V. Kovalchuk, a financier believed to be Mr. Putin\u2019s banker; Vladimir I. Yakunin, president of Russian Railways; the oligarchs Roman A. Abramovich and Alisher B. Usmanov; and Igor I. Sechin and Aleksei B. Miller, the heads of Rosneft and Gazprom, respectively.The sanctions must also hit the oligarchs whose media outlets parrot the regime lines, and target Mr. Putin\u2019s entire \u201cwar cabinet\u201d: the TV spin doctors, compliant Duma members and apparatchiks of Mr. Putin\u2019s United Russia Party.The invasion of Ukraine has polarized members of Russia\u2019s elite, many of whom view it as reckless. Real sanctions, such as blocking access to their plush London apartments, will show that Mr. Putin\u2019s folly comes with serious costs.Second, Western authorities must investigate ill-gotten gains from Russia within their jurisdictions. The Anti-Corruption Foundation, which I established in 2011, has revealed dozens of major cases of graft. In 90 percent of those cases, Russian money was laundered in the West. Sadly, American, European Union and British law enforcement agencies have stymied our efforts to investigate such criminal plunder.\u201cCrimea has always been an integral part of Russia in the hearts and minds of people,\u201d Mr. Putin claimed this week. But even among the most nationalist and pro-Soviet of our people, a longing to restore Crimea to Russian rule faded years ago.Yet Mr. Putin has cynically raised nationalist fervor to a fever pitch; imperialist annexation is a strategic choice to bolster his regime\u2019s survival. Mobilizing the masses by distracting them from real problems like corruption and economic stagnation can take place only beneath the banner of fighting external enemies.What is truly alarming in Mr. Putin\u2019s rash behavior is that he is motivated by the desire for revenge against the Ukrainian people for revolting against a Kremlin-friendly government. A rational actor would know that the precedent of holding a local referendum to determine sovereignty is risky for Russia \u2014 a federation of more than 80 disparate regions, including more than 160 ethnic groups and at least 100 languages.It is true that the consensus in both Russia and Crimea is that the peninsula has historically been closer to Moscow than to Kiev. But the notion that this reunification should be achieved at the end of the barrel of a gun is supported only by Mr. Putin\u2019s hard-core base. The opposition has spoken clearly. The antiwar protest held in Moscow over the weekend was the largest in two years, and it exceeded any counterdemonstration mustered by pro-Kremlin movements.There is a common delusion among the international community that although Mr. Putin is corrupt, his leadership is necessary because his regime subdues the dark, nationalist forces that otherwise would seize power in Russia. The West should admit that it, too, has underestimated Mr. Putin\u2019s malign intent. It is time to end the dangerous delusion that enables him. Alexey A.

{"Headline": "With Russia, as With China, Unnerved U.S. Allies Seek Reassurances", "Date": "2014-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byListening PostVILNIUS, Lithuania \u2014 Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. found himself in a fraught but familiar place this week: holding the hands of American allies fearful of being bullied by a larger, aggressive neighbor.The cases differ in obvious respects: The tensions in Asia have eased somewhat after the Chinese government showed prudence in policing its air defense zone, while in Europe, the confrontation with Russia over Crimea seems to be only escalating.But there are also striking parallels: Russia and China are both ambitious powers, riding a tide of nationalism and nursing grievances over historical slights at the hands of the West. Both may be exploiting a belief that the United States is turning inward, exhausted by years of war and reluctant to get drawn into costly foreign entanglements.And both are led by self-confident strongmen \u2014 Vladimir V. Putin and Xi Jinping \u2014 though the popularly elected Mr. Putin may have a tighter grip on his society than the Communist Party boss, Mr. Xi, who must contend with an independent-minded military.For President Obama, deciphering the motives, means and next moves of these suspicious giants will require a mix of psychology and geopolitics. Kremlinology and Sinology may end up as the major foreign policy preoccupations of the remainder of his presidency.\u201cAs long as Russia continues on this dark path, they will face increasing economic and political isolation,\u201d he said.For now, administration officials say, Russia presents a harder case than China. Mr. Putin has been brazen in his takeover of Crimea and troubling in his assertion that Russia will protect Russian-speaking populations in the nations that ring his country, while Mr. Xi has only inched forward with Beijing\u2019s territorial claims in the South and East China Seas.Russia has shrugged off European and American sanctions and ridiculed assertions that it is flouting international law, while China appeared to heed widespread condemnation and Mr. Biden\u2019s show of solidarity with American allies after it imposed its air defense zone.China has yet to impose a second such zone over the South China Sea, as many in the region had predicted it would. American military commanders say the Chinese Air Force has been prudent in patrolling the zone, allaying fears of a miscalculation if Chinese fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a Japanese plane flying through it.American officials still live in fear that China will land troops on the Senkaku Islands, which it claims under the name Diaoyu Islands, but which are controlled by Japan. The United States would be obligated by treaty terms to defend Japan in a military clash with China. And the concerns about China\u2019s muscle-flexing are not limited to these islands.\u201cChina\u2019s military is expanding dramatically, creating concern for a host of American allies,\u201d said Ian Bremmer, founder of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. He said he viewed China as a greater threat than Russia, \u201cand by a very large margin.\u201dThe United States can draw comfort from the fact that Mr. Xi\u2019s overriding goal, experts say, is to maintain stability outside China\u2019s borders so he can manage a host of problems at home, including a slowing economy and tensions over official corruption.For all of Mr. Putin\u2019s bluster, some experts doubt that he would risk a wider conflict. \u201cPutin is also rational and respects U.S. power,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, a former under secretary of state who teaches at Harvard. \u201cIt is very unlikely he would threaten a NATO ally such as Estonia, Latvia or Poland due to NATO\u2019s security guarantee.\u201dMr. Burns said the president should draw clear red lines with Russia and China and show that the United States is prepared to defend its treaty obligations. That was the main purpose of Mr. Biden\u2019s visit this week, with his mantra-like repetition of Article V, the clause of the NATO treaty that commits members to regard an armed attack on any one of them to be an attack on all.It is also worth remembering, Mr. Bremmer said, that Russia has been losing influence steadily for 20 years, \u201cdemographically, diplomatically, economically and militarily.\u201d Mr. Putin\u2019s actions, he said, are evidence more of insecurity than of strength.Robert Danin, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said: \u201cRussia is a traditional military power sitting atop a declining economic and industrial base. In contrast, China is a military power rooted in a strong and growing economic foundation.\u201dThat may explain why Mr. Obama, after meeting with European allies in Brussels next week, will travel a month later to Asia. There, he will follow in Mr. Biden\u2019s footsteps with a tour of China\u2019s anxious neighbors: Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Its Growth Targets Elusive, China Focuses on Jobs and Quality of Life", "Date": "2014-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s growth engine continued to show signs of weakness on Thursday, underlining the tricky balancing act that Beijing faces as it tries to reform its economy.Retail, manufacturing and investment all slowed in the beginning of the year, a situation that raises questions about China\u2019s ability to achieve its growth targets. But China\u2019s premier reiterated that the goals were flexible, as the government focuses on a host of economic issues.Speaking at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday, Premier Li Keqiang said that job growth and quality-of-life issues like the battle to reduce air pollution took precedence over the headline growth figure. China needs to create 10 million jobs, he added. He also said that further bond defaults were inevitable, as China remakes its financial system and rules. But he added that the government would do its best to ensure that bad debt did not roil the broader system. \u201cWe are not preoccupied\u201d with the gross domestic product growth, said Mr. Li, whose comments came at the end of the annual meeting of the Chinese legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress. \u201cThe G.D.P. growth we want is one that brings real benefits to our people, helps raise the quality and efficiency of economic development and contributes to energy conservation and environmental protection.\u201dLast week, Beijing set its goal for economic growth this year at 7.5 percent, a slight slowdown from the 7.7 percent achieved in 2013 and a big deceleration from the frequent double-digit growth rates of the last three decades. But it would generate the job growth needed to secure social stability, which is crucial for Chinese policy makers.The data released Thursday suggested that the target might be hard to achieve. Industrial output, retail sales and investment in January and February all grew far less energetically than analysts had expected, according to figures released by the national statistics office.For industrial output, the expansion of 8.6 percent for the two months, compared with the same period last year, was the weakest since April 2009. Retail sales growth, at 11.8 percent, was the weakest since early 2011. Investment in fixed assets rose 17.9 percent, the weakest pace in more than a decade. The January and February figures were grouped together to reduce distortions from the Lunar New Year holiday, which moves from year to year and can fall in either month.To some extent, the slowdown in China\u2019s growth is the result of deliberate engineering by policy makers. Beijing realizes that the economy must shift away from exports and heavy manufacturing, and toward consumption-led growth,.At the same time, it is trying to rein in the sometimes-inefficient lending that has taken place during the last few years. Analysts widely welcome this approach, but it has also weighed on business activity by making it harder or more expensive for companies to obtain credit.Many analysts now say they believe that the government may once again increase its efforts to prop up the economy \u2014 for example by removing some constraints on bank lending \u2014 if growth slows too much. \u201cIf pressures on growth persist, we expect the government to look for ways to support growth, which would likely include easing up on the monetary stance,\u201d Louis Kuijs, chief China economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong, wrote in a research note.Although Mr. Kuijs does not see risks of systemic problems or instability anytime soon, he said, \u201cFinancial markets would continue to remain anxious and nervous about financial risks in China, thus keeping financial asset prices subdued and sentiment bearish.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

On the economic front, the Consumer Price Index rose 0.1 percent in February, matching January\u2019s increase, the Labor Department said. In the last 12 months, prices have risen just 1.1 percent, the smallest yearly gain in five months.Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 0.1 percent last month and 1.6 percent in the last year.\u201cThere isn\u2019t much in this report to suggest inflation is about to make a move to the upside or downside,\u201d said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase. Mr. Feroli pointed out that core inflation had been below the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2 percent target for the last year.The Fed\u2019s policy makers will conclude their two-day meeting on Wednesday, and the benign report on consumer prices means the central bank can continue to focus on reducing unemployment and increasing economic growth without having to worry that its policies are stoking inflation. Most analysts do expect the Fed to continue to reduce its economic stimulus by cutting back on its bond purchases.Separately, home construction fell for a third month in February, but applications for building permits reached their highest level in four months.Builders started work on 907,000 homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in February, the Commerce Department said. That was down a slight 0.2 percent from January, when construction had fallen 11.2 percent. The declines have been blamed in large part on severe winter weather in much of the country.Applications for permits to build homes, considered a gauge of future activity, rose a solid 7.7 percent in February to 1.02 million units. Analysts expect housing sales and construction to show further gains this year, helped by a stronger economy.Shares of home builders rose. Beazer Homes USA gained 52 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $20.57 and the Ryland Group picked up $1.23, or 3.1 percent, to $41.40.

But new thinking from German and French groups advocating closer integration of the 18-nation single currency area may now gain traction in Berlin, Paris and Brussels.Their ambitious ideas contrast with the bland manifestos of the main parties for European Parliament elections in May, offered by politicians eager to reassure voters that the euro zone crisis is behind them and fearful of a euro-skeptical backlash.Both the Glienicker Group of Germany and the Eiffel Group of France warn that the crisis, though temporarily stabilized, is far from over. Stagnant economies, mass unemployment and mountains of debt pose big risks.Their initiative began in August, when the labor economist Jakob von Weizs\u00e4cker brought together a group of 11 economists, constitutional lawyers and political scientists in a Berlin suburb to thrash out their differences on Europe.Meeting close to the Glienicke Bridge, the setting for Cold War spy exchanges, they explored ways of building a stronger political and economic Europe compatible with German insistence that states remain liable for their own debts.\u201cWe wanted to have an impact on the German debate because that\u2019s where most of the problems are,\u201d said Daniela Schwarzer, director of the Europe program at the German Marshall Fund. \u201cThe starting point was accepting the very German principle of the \u2018no bailout\u2019 clause, which Germans will not give up for legal and political reasons.\u201dTheir key proposal is that the euro zone creates a central fund providing common unemployment benefits to act as an economic stabilizer in downturns and to complement national insurance systems in states that reform their labor markets. The fund would be financed by a membership fee of about 0.5 percent of member states\u2019 national output.A separate treaty would establish a \u201cEuro Union,\u201d with an economic government, elected and overseen by a Euro-parliament, and empowered to override the budgets of member states that breach agreed-upon fiscal rules.The authors acknowledge that in Germany, where hostility to a \u201ctransfer union\u201d runs deep and attachment to the Bundestag\u2019s fiscal sovereignty is strong, it may be necessary to amend the German Constitution. But they argue that it is in Germany\u2019s economic and political interest to stabilize the currency area, the foundation of prosperity for Europe\u2019s biggest economy.Past German overtures for closer integration have fallen on deaf ears in France, Berlin\u2019s chief partner in the European Union, because a deep rift between pro-Europeans and defenders of national sovereignty runs through all the main French parties.When the Christian Democrats Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and Karl Lamers offered a blueprint for a \u201ccore Europe\u201d in 1994, it foundered in Paris. The same thing happened to then-Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer\u2019s 2000 Humboldt speech, which challenged the French to advance together in European integration.While official Paris has kept silent, Sylvie Goulard, a member of the European Parliament, mobilized a dozen experts from politics, law, business and academia in the Eiffel Group to call for a \u201cEuro community\u201d along similar lines.\u201cEach group tried to break a national taboo,\u201d Ms. Goulard said. \u201cFor the Germans, it was a \u2018transfer union.\u2019 For the French, it was supranational democratic institutions.\u201dThe French group wants the euro community to raise its own revenue independent of national budgets, to stop the European Union\u2019s eternal squabbles over whether member states get a \u201cfair return.\u201d They say it should finance major transport, energy and digital infrastructure projects as well as unemployment insurance.Why do these proposals stand any better chance of not ending in the dustbin than their predecessors? For one thing, many policy makers realize, even if they do not say so publicly, that the euro zone crisis is far from over and the north-south economic gulf it has opened poses a threat to long-term stability.There is also a political reason why the Glienicker and Eiffel initiatives stand a chance: Some leading politicians in Germany and France are in search of a European agenda.President Joachim Gauck, who invited the Glienicker authors to meet him, is urging a more active German foreign policy, taking responsibility in line with Berlin\u2019s economic weight after years of introversion tinged with pacifism.In Paris, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and his Socialist government have avoided big European ideas since he was elected in 2012 because they divide the left. But he recently signaled he wants to revive Franco-German leadership in the euro area.It might send a more positive signal if the proposed euro zone budget funded a pan-European apprenticeship system rather than unemployment benefits.But for once, the thinkers may find open doors and ears for their ideas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.M.F. Prepares $18 Billion in Loans for Ukraine", "Date": "2014-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 After three weeks of urgent negotiations with the interim government of Ukraine and in an atmosphere of great power competition, the International Monetary Fund announced on Thursday an agreement to provide up to $18 billion in loans over two years to prevent the country\u2019s default.The agreement, announced in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, will hinge on the country taking steps to let the value of its currency float downward, to cut corruption and red tape, and, crucially, to reduce huge state subsidies for the consumption of natural gas. The energy subsidies alone represent roughly 8 percent of Ukraine\u2019s gross domestic product, and Russia has said that it intends to raise on April 1 the price of natural gas to Ukraine, which is largely dependent on Russian supplies and which already owes the Russian energy company Gazprom well over $1 billion.The deal, which is subject to the approval of the fund\u2019s board next month, is intended to get the new government over a big hurdle of coming debt obligations when its hard-currency accounts have been sharply diminished by months of unrest that led to the overthrow of former President Viktor F. Yanukovych.The two-year loan package, the I.M.F. said in a statement, is expected to unlock more loans, including from the United States and the European Union, that should bring the total over two years to $27 billion. The loans will be more spread out and less onerous than the $15 billion Russia had promised Mr. Yanukovych before he fled the country.The fund\u2019s mission chief, Nikolay Gueorguiev, declined to say how big the initial tranche of aid would be. He said he expected the board to approve the deal by the end of April.Ukraine\u2019s interim prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, told the Parliament on Thursday that the country was \u201con the brink of economic and financial bankruptcy\u201d and that gross domestic product could drop 10 percent this year unless urgent steps weare taken in conjunction with the fund.The measures could damage the new government\u2019s popularity at a time when it is struggling to establish itself after losing territory to Russian forces and before emergency presidential elections scheduled for May 25.Mr. Yatsenyuk announced new legislation to prevent \u201cfinancial disaster\u201d in Ukraine, including provisions that would freeze the minimum wage and raise taxes on the country\u2019s largest businesses, which in many cases have effective monopolies.Posting later on Twitter, Mr. Yatsenyuk wrote: \u201cThe government will not allow the bankruptcy of Ukraine. The package is very unpopular, complex, hard reforms that have long needed to be done, submitted to Parliament.\u201dSenior Western officials said on Wednesday that the loans from the United States and from the I.M.F. would be structured to get the government through its first few months without undue political upheaval, putting off some of the more difficult changes until after the May election.The West has also chosen not to press for early parliamentary elections, one senior official said, because \u201cthe priority now is stabilization in Kiev and de-escalation with Moscow.\u201dThe fund said in a statement that \u201cthe financial support from the broader international community that the program will unlock amounts to $27 billion over the next two years. Of this, assistance from the I.M.F. will range between $14-18 billion, with the precise amount to be determined once all bilateral and multilateral support is accounted for.\u201dThe new government\u2019s initial estimates of its needs was about $35 billion over two years.\u201cFollowing the intense economic and political turbulence of recent months, Ukraine has achieved some stability, but faces difficult challenges,\u201d the I.M.F. said, adding that foreign currency reserves were at a \u201ccritically low level.\u201dThe fund has made demands of Ukraine in the past, and pulled the plug on a loan arrangement with the previous government. But Mr. Yatsenyuk, an economist himself, has vowed to work with the fund to make any necessary changes.The I.M.F. statement on Thursday was careful in speaking about energy prices, saying that it needed \u201cthe commitment to step-by-step energy reform to move retail gas and heating tariffs to full cost recovery, along with early action towards that goal,\u201d but it did not specify its terms.On Wednesday, Ukraine\u2019s state energy company, Naftogaz, said it would increase domestic heating gas prices by 50 percent on May 1, partly in response to Russian price increases. But Ukraine has sizable gas stores and the arrival of spring will sharply reduce consumption.The United States and the European Union have made a big show of promised aid and loans guarantees, but the American offer of about $1 billion has been held up in Congress in a dispute over funding for the I.M.F. The Europeans are seeking final approval for $1.6 billion and Japan has announced that it will contribute about $1.5 billion.Mr. Carney also said that the White House was working to win congressional approval for an additional loan guarantee of $1 billion.In December, Russia had agreed to provide Ukraine with a $15 billion economic bailout package and, publicly at least, had not imposed any of the conditions that had long been demanded by the fund in exchange for assistance.After purchasing an initial $3 billion in Ukrainian bonds, the Kremlin effectively canceled the aid package in response to the ouster of Mr. Yanukovych, the country\u2019s pro-Russia president.While Western leaders had been eager to provide financial assistance to Ukraine\u2019s new government, especially in light of Russia\u2019s invasion and annexation of Crimea, the Kremlin still has enormous leverage over the Ukrainian economy and, consequently, over Kiev\u2019s ability to repay its loans.Last summer, Russia abruptly began blocking Ukrainian goods at its border by demanding tougher customs inspections, and then threatened even more severe and destabilizing trade sanctions if Ukraine signed sweeping political and trade agreements with the European Union. Mr. Yanukovych, citing those threats, refused to sign the accords, setting off the months of civil unrest that ultimately led to his ouster.In recent days, the United States and its Western allies have shown concern that Russia might undertake further military action by invading eastern Ukraine, which is the base for much of the country\u2019s manufacturing and industrial activity.Russia, however, could easily wreak economic havoc on the region without any military action, simply by imposing the sanctions threatened in the fall.While it is unlikely to dissuade the fund\u2019s board from approving the new assistance package, the previous difficulties in Ukraine nonetheless amount to a reality check. Stabilizing Ukraine\u2019s deeply troubled economy will not be easy, even if Russia does not intervene.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "End of Gulf Ban Allows BP to Expand in Familiar, Lucrative Territory", "Date": "2014-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Even as drilling for new oil in the Gulf of Mexico has made a robust return since the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster in 2010, BP has been in the unusual position of spectator.But that is likely to change next Wednesday, when the federal government auctions off the rights to new oil drilling sites. Analysts said both BP and the United States government needed a deal. BP has been a key player in the American energy industry. Along with Royal Dutch Shell, it had led development of oil and gas drilling in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The gulf and onshore shale fields have transformed the United States from a declining oil and gas producer just a few years ago to a fast-growing one that will be able to cut imports and even export oil and gas for years to come.\u201cThe Gulf of Mexico remains a great frontier and is a critical element in America\u2019s improving energy position,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the oil historian.BP has been important to the regional economy as well, employing, by its own count, about 20,000 people in the United States, including 7,600 in Texas and many in the Houston area. A substantial portion of these employees are highly paid geologists, geophysicists and computer scientists hired to crunch and interpret the data required to find oil and gas deep under the Gulf of Mexico and other bodies of water. The government has held three auctions without BP since the ban was imposed in 2012, after the disaster that killed 11 people and spilled millions of gallons of oil into the gulf.BP officers declined to comment on whether the company would make a bid at the Interior Department auction, saying that was confidential information in a highly competitive business. But having the ability to do so was viewed by energy analysts as an important milestone in the company\u2019s efforts to return to normal after the Deepwater Horizon explosion nearly four years ago.\u201cWith this agreement, it\u2019s realistic to expect that the Gulf of Mexico can be a key asset for BP\u2019s operations not only for this decade but potentially for decades to come,\u201d said Stephen Simko, a Morningstar senior oil equity analyst.The riches BP could acquire from the auction in New Orleans could be significant. The Interior Department says it will try to lease 7,508 blocks covering 39 million acres off the shores of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. The last auction a year ago attracted $1.2 billion in bids, and the government says this new auction could result in additional production of a billion barrels of oil and four trillion cubic feet of natural gas.While BP remained the largest leaseholder in the gulf \u2014 even after selling off some assets there \u2014 the ban on new leases had meant that it had missed three rounds of lease sales, losing ground to rivals like Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron.BP\u2019s production in the gulf has plunged to 190,000 barrels a day \u2014 less than half what it was producing before the spill. Last year, Shell passed BP as the largest producer in the deepwater gulf.Still, like its competitors, BP has been busy drilling on its old leases. The company has 620 lease blocks and four production hubs. In 2013 BP started up an additional three rigs in the gulf, and by the end of the year had 10 rigs in operation. Last December, it announced that it had made a significant oil discovery at its Gila prospect, which it co-owns with ConocoPhillips, in the gulf.BP has committed to spending at least $4 billion in the gulf every year for the next decade.Along with bidding on new exploration tracts, BP will also be able to resume supplying the United States military and other government agencies with fuel, a business which may bring in $2 billion or more a year in revenue but has low profit margins, according to the company.Obtaining new leases is important because an oil company\u2019s resource base inevitably dwindles if it cannot gain access to new oil and gas.\u201cWith each year that passed, BP\u2019s competitive position was in danger of being eroded,\u201d said Neill Morton, an analyst at Investec in London.Under the agreement, BP must comply with specific ethics, corporate governance and safety procedures. There will be risk assessments, a code of conduct for officers and \"zero tolerance\" for retaliation against whistle-blowing employees or contractors.Over five years, an independent auditor approved by the E.P.A. will conduct an annual review and report on BP\u2019s compliance with the agreement. But some environmental groups said the agreement was not stiff enough for a company involved in not only the gulf rig explosion but also a Texas refinery explosion in 2005 that left 15 dead.BP\u2019s chief executive, Robert W. Dudley, an American and the first non-Briton to head the London-based company, was stung by the continued ban, which he called \u201cnot good for the gulf\u201d in an interview this year.The negotiations between BP and the E.P.A. were lengthy and difficult. In imposing its original ban the E.P.A. had cited BP for a \u201clack of business integrity\u201d because of its role in the accident. Last summer BP filed a lawsuit against the E.P.A. in federal court in Texas seeking to have the ban lifted. As part of the deal with the E.P.A., BP will drop this suit.Since the Gulf of Mexico spill, Mr. Dudley has been a big seller of assets in the gulf. His rationale has been to raise money to pay for damage from the spill \u2014 now estimated by BP at $42.7 billion \u2014 and to streamline operations.

{"Headline": "3 Activists Held in Sri Lanka, Raising Fears of Crackdown", "Date": "2014-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Fears of a broad crackdown against rights activists in Sri Lanka have been heightened after the Sri Lankan police recently arrested two prominent human rights advocates and a woman who has made a public campaign of finding her missing son.The arrests took place just as the United Nations Human Rights Council considers starting an inquiry into possible war crimes committed by government forces and separatists during Sri Lanka\u2019s 26-year civil war.Ruki Fernando, one of Sri Lanka\u2019s most prominent human rights activists, and the Rev. Praveen Mahesan, a Roman Catholic priest and the former director of the Jaffna-based Center for Peace and Reconciliation, were detained around 10 p.m. on Sunday by Sri Lanka\u2019s Terrorist Investigation Department in Kilinochchi, a former rebel stronghold.The Sri Lankan police said the two activists were being held under the country\u2019s antiterrorism laws. \u201cThey have been arrested on charges of creating communal disharmony and inciting racial hatred,\u201d said Ajith Rohana, a police spokesman. He said the two would be taken to Colombo, the capital, for further interrogation.On Friday, the government arrested Jeyakumari Balendran, an advocate for efforts to find missing people, on charges of harboring an armed man. Her own son, a child conscript to rebel forces, is still missing after he reportedly surrendered to government forces in 2009 and then was pictured in a government publication about rebel rehabilitation. Ms. Balendran\u2019s 13-year-old daughter was taken into custody on Friday and has since been given to child probation officers, the police said.Military officials denied that Ms. Balendran\u2019s detention was connected to her demonstrations on behalf of missing persons. But the multiple arrests sent a ripple of dread through the country\u2019s human rights groups.\u201cThese are dark days,\u201d wrote Fred Carver of the Sri Lanka Campaign for Peace and Justice in an email.Five years after the end of a decades-long civil war in which government forces battled the Tamil Tigers \u2014 a notoriously brutal insurgent group \u2014 the Sri Lankan government has shown little appetite for any robust investigation into possible war crimes. Some 40,000 people, many of them civilians, are estimated to have been killed in the war\u2019s final stages.Two resolutions pressing the Sri Lankan government to investigate war crimes have already been passed by the Human Rights Council, but Sri Lanka\u2019s failure to heed these resolutions has led some nations to call for an independent inquiry that does not depend on the government.The end of the insurgency has been a boon for Sri Lanka\u2019s economy, as well as for the political fortunes of the family of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Roads have been rebuilt, tourists have returned and the pervading sense of unease that gripped the country for decades has largely evaporated.President Rajapaksa is popular in Sri Lanka because of this turnaround, but an independent investigation of conduct during the war would be risky for him and his brother, Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who led the war effort.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arkansas House Votes to Extend Health Insurance Program", "Date": "2014-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Arkansas House of Representatives voted Tuesday to let the state keep taking federal money for the expansion of Medicaid under President Obama\u2019s health care law and using it to buy private insurance for poor people. The House voted 76 to 24 for the reauthorization. The Senate already narrowly approved the measure, which heads to Gov. Mike Beebe, a Democrat who supports the plan.\u201cThis took a lot of work from a lot of people on a lot of fronts,\u201d said Matt DeCample, a spokesman for Mr. Beebe, who had warned that ending the program would create a big hole in his proposed budget and hurt hospitals that were counting on the new paying patients. \u201cWe still think this will be a big positive for the state and for our economy.\u201dRepresentative Davy Carter, the House speaker, said he and other Republican leaders had spent much of the last few weeks negotiating with members who were on the fence and trying to convince them of the program\u2019s benefits.\u201cWe spent a lot of time answering questions and listening to any other alternatives that were out there,\u201d said Mr. Carter, who, like Mr. Beebe, will leave office at the end of the year because of term limits. \u201cTo me this whole story, starting back last year, is about political courage. This is such a hot-button issue, and for both parties, both chambers, to do what we\u2019ve done in this state, I just think is absolutely remarkable.\u201dIn one concession that helped secure enough votes, language was added to bar the state from using government funds to advertise the program. For states that expand Medicaid under the health care law \u2014 including Arkansas with its private option \u2014 the federal government will pay the full cost of expansion from 2014 to 2016, with its share gradually decreasing to 90 percent by 2020. About half the states, most of them controlled by Democrats, have expanded the program to date. People earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or $15,900 for a single person, are eligible for Medicaid \u2014 or, in Arkansas, for private coverage paid for with Medicaid funds \u2014 under the terms of the expansion. The Obama administration agreed to waive certain provisions of Medicaid law for three years to allow Arkansas to prove the effectiveness of its program. So far, Arkansas officials say, the program has robust enrollment and reasonable costs, about $476 per person, per month. Joan Alker, executive director of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, said that ending the Arkansas program months after it began would have had a chilling effect on efforts to replicate it elsewhere. \u201cIt would have put a spring in the step of those seeking to stop the expansion of Medicaid,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Seeks to Calm Saudis as Paths Split", "Date": "2014-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 Over seven decades, the United States and Saudi Arabia forged a strategic alliance that became a linchpin of the regional order: a liberal democracy and an ultraconservative monarchy united by shared interests in the stability of the Middle East and the continued flow of oil.But with President Obama arriving in Riyadh on Friday, the rulers of Saudi Arabia say they feel increasingly compelled to go their own way, pursuing starkly different strategies from Washington in dealing with Iran, Syria, Egypt and the role of the Muslim Brotherhood in the region.\u201cTheir view of Mr. Obama is that his entire understanding is wrong,\u201d said Mustafa Alani, an analyst at the Geneva-based Gulf Research Center who is close to the Saudi monarchy. \u201cThe trust in him is not very high, so he will not have an easy ride, and a lot of hard questions will be put on the table.\u201dSaudi Arabia\u2019s leaders had historically favored a quiet, backstage approach to international relations. They preferred to use their oil wealth to buy influence from behind the scenes while allies like Egypt and the United States led the way out front. But the United States has scaled back its military role in the region after the war in Iraq, and since the Arab Spring, Egypt has been consumed by its own internal turmoil.Saudi Arabian officials say that has forced them to pursue their own course, to try to contain Iran, oust President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and support the military-backed government that has taken over in Egypt.For Mr. Obama, the disposition of the Saudis is now a main concern as he plots a policy toward both Syria and Iran. A central goal of his visit is to reassure Saudi Arabia that Washington\u2019s commitment to its security will not be compromised by negotiations with Iran about lifting sanctions in exchange for limits on its nuclear program.In Egypt, Saudi Arabia has effectively replaced the United States as Cairo\u2019s chief benefactor, in tandem with the United Arab Emirates. That gives the two monarchies enormous influence in Egypt, which was once Washington\u2019s other key Arab ally. And the Saudis have already used that influence to undercut American policy. Riyadh encouraged the military\u2019s ouster of the Muslim Brotherhood from power and the subsequent crackdown on its supporters, while United States diplomats hustled in vain to avert both moves.Now the Obama administration is hoping to persuade Saudi Arabia to use its greater clout with Cairo to convince the government there to rein in its repression of the opposition and begin to overhaul its economy \u2014 the Western formula for restoring stability.\u201cThe Saudis realize that the interim Egyptian government is overshooting the runway with regards to their crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood,\u201d an administration official said on the condition of anonymity to discuss Mr. Obama\u2019s coming visit. \u201cThe Saudis realize that the Egyptians have crossed the line with the massive crackdown on journalists, secular opposition, foreign embassy employees, etc.\u201dBut after backing the removal of the Brotherhood\u2019s Mohamed Morsi as president of Egypt, the Saudis have now taken the lead in a campaign against the Brotherhood across the region.\u201cIt is a war,\u201d said a former Saudi official with ties to members of the royal family. \u201cThey see the Muslim Brotherhood as an existential threat, and there are some people who think that it is possible to eradicate the Brotherhood throughout the region.\u201dSaudi Arabia and the Emirates, along with Kuwait, have already given more than $15 billion in aid and loans to Egypt. In recent weeks, a construction company linked to the government of the Emirates announced plans for a partnership with the Egyptian military to build more than $40 billion in new housing in Egypt.Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, the general who ousted the elected president and is now planning to succeed him, presented the housing project to the Egyptian public on the eve of declaring his intention to seek the presidency. And the Emirates have sent one of their government\u2019s ministers of state, Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber, to spend much of his time in Cairo to help the Egyptian government with its economy.The Saudis have sometimes financed jihadists abroad when it served their interests, in Afghanistan during the 1980s, for example, and in Syria now. But the Saudi royal family, which draws its legitimacy from an ultraconservative Salafi branch of Islam, has long feared the Muslim Brotherhood because of its rival blend of religion and politics and its effectiveness at political organizing. Saudi officials often quote Prince Nayef bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud, the former long-serving interior minister: \u201cAll our problems come from the Muslim Brotherhood,\u201d he once declared, arguing that the group \u201chas destroyed the Arab world.\u201dBut the country\u2019s open support for the military ouster of the Muslim Brotherhood has risks as well. The takeover and crackdown have elicited stirrings of dissent from Saudi clerics sympathetic to the Brotherhood. And around the region, Saudi Arabia is \u201closing friends left and right,\u201d said Frederic Wehrey, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\u201cThe generals are going to have to show that they can govern more effectively than the Brotherhood did, and it is a great worry for the Saudis that the generals might flame out as well,\u201d said Robert W. Jordan, a former United States ambassador to Saudi Arabia.Saudi journalists say the country\u2019s government-controlled news media has been more protective of Egypt\u2019s new military-backed government than of the royal family. When an Egyptian Army doctor recently announced that the military had discovered a cure for AIDS and hepatitis C, for example, the rest of the Arab world reverberated with ridicule. But Saudi Arabian news outlets all but ignored the fiasco.In the past month, Saudi Arabia criminalized membership in the Muslim Brotherhood and classified it as a terrorist organization on par with Al Qaeda.Its Interior Ministry issued a new law imposing harsh penalties on Saudis who join the fighting in Syria for fear that they might return as hardened militants. And to punish neighboring Qatar for its support of the Brotherhood, King Abdullah led the coordinated withdrawal from Qatar of his own ambassador and the envoys from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt.At a private gathering of Arab security chiefs at the Four Seasons Hotel in Marrakesh, Morocco, two weeks ago, the Saudi interior minister asked every Arab country to outlaw the Muslim Brotherhood, to heated opposition, according to officials from several countries who were briefed on the meeting. Brotherhood-aligned parties are accepted parts of the political establishment in much of the Arab world.Saudi leaders are already vexed at Mr. Obama for failing to throw America\u2019s military might behind their proxy war with Tehran in Syria, where the Saudis are sending money and weapons to back the Sunni-dominated rebels. And the Saudis were flabbergasted last year when Mr. Obama reversed course at the last minute, calling off missile strikes against the Assad government for its use of chemical weapons.Mr. Obama opted instead for a deal for Mr. Assad to surrender the weapons, and then watched as the Syrian government rolled back the rebels using conventional force.Mr. Obama \u201chas got it all wrong when it comes to Iran,\u201d Faisal J. Abbas, a commentator for the Saudi-owned news network Al Arabiya, wrote in a column this week, accusing the president of a \u201cnew fondness\u201d for the Iranians and calling it \u201cthe heart of the problem\u201d in his relations with the Saudis.But the Obama administration still hopes for Saudi help with Egypt. \u201cThe Saudis also don\u2019t have the intent or inclination to float the Egyptian economy forever,\u201d said the administration official, so it will need to restructure its economy. \u201cThe Saudis also get that won\u2019t happen if the current political climate continues.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They fell after the price of oil dropped $1.88, or 1.8 percent, to $101.45 a barrel as tensions eased in Ukraine and the threat of economic sanctions against Russia appeared to recede. Exxon Mobil shares dropped $2.72, or 2.8 percent, to $93.80, making them one of the biggest decliners in the S.&P. 500. The company said it planned to cut capital spending by 6 percent this year, while production would rise 2 percent.Among the stocks on the move, Smith & Wesson jumped $1.94, or 16.4 percent, to $13.74 after the gunmaker\u2019s quarterly results topped expectations. Brown-Forman, the distiller, rose $3.10, or 3.7 percent, to $87.11 after it reported better-than-expected earnings. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged up to 2.71 percent from 2.70 percent late Tuesday, while its price dipped 2/32, to 100 12/32. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Conservative Group Counters Criticism of Ad Against Health Law", "Date": "2014-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Americans for Prosperity, the conservative advocacy group being challenged by Democrats over the content of its ads attacking the health care law, is pushing back with a new commercial that will begin airing Tuesday in Michigan.Lawyers for Representative Gary Peters, a Democrat who is seeking Michigan\u2019s open Senate seat, wrote to television stations asking them to demand verification for the claims in the initial commercial, touching off a wider fight with Republicans over whether Democrats were trying to muzzle Ms. Boonstra.In the new ad, Ms. Boonstra says the attacks on her credibility have been devastating and accuses Mr. Peters of trying to silence her. \u201cAll I want is to be listened to,\u201d she says in the commercial. \u201cThere are thousands of people out there who are hurting because of Obamacare.\u201dSupporters of the law have challenged the details of Ms. Boonstra\u2019s case, as well as those of other individuals profiled in ads by Americans for Prosperity, saying the group is distorting the law\u2019s impact to build opposition to it and to increase the standing of Republican Senate candidates.Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, which is backed by the billionaires David and Charles Koch, said the organization was standing by its ads and would not be deterred by criticism from Democrats like Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, who last week called the first Michigan ad \u201cabsolutely false.\u201d\u201cWe are completely comfortable about the accuracy of every item in our ads,\u201d said Mr. Phillips, who suggested that Mr. Reid was trying to start a political dispute to shift attention from what he called an effective advertising campaign.Haley Morris, a spokeswoman for Mr. Peters, said of the ad and Ms. Boonstra: \u201cThe claims in A.F.P.'s original ad have been discredited by local and national media, and any charge that our campaign tried to silence her is absolutely inaccurate.\u201d She said the campaign asked only for the ad\u2019s claims to be substantiated.Officials at Americans for Prosperity, who have spent more than $30 million on television advertising and other activities in states with competitive Senate races, said they would spend at least $300,000 on the new ad, bringing their total spending in Michigan to about $2 million.The main issue over the initial Michigan commercial was whether Ms. Boonstra would face higher out-of-pocket costs because of co-payments and other requirements before she hit a ceiling on total spending, compared with the costs under her previous policy. Critics said that with the lower premiums on the new policy, Ms. Boonstra could end up spending essentially the same amount because of the cap on overall spending.But Mr. Phillips said that \u201cwe do believe she will end up having more out-of-pocket costs\u201d under the new plan because of limits on medications and treatments. He said the new insurance policy also makes her costs much more unpredictable than the more regular monthly costs she experienced under the old plan.In defending the health care law last week, Mr. Reid delivered a blistering attack on the ads on the Senate floor, saying many Americans are benefiting from the law and getting coverage.\u201cDespite all that good news, there are plenty of horror stories being told,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cAll of them are untrue, but they are being told all over America.\u201dWhile the Michigan race to succeed Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat who is retiring, was not initially considered one of the best opportunities for Republicans to pick up a seat, the party believes that the economy and opposition to the health care law have improved its chances there.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If History Is a Guide, Crimeans\u2019 Celebration May Be Short-Lived", "Date": "2014-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATOTSI, Georgia \u2014 As Crimeans danced in the streets this week, giddy at the prospect of being gathered into Russia, few were watching as closely as the residents of the tiny mountainous enclave of South Ossetia, who, five and a half years ago, were similarly ecstatic.On the day in 2008 when Russia formally recognized the enclave as independent of Georgia, young men hung out of their car windows, waving Russian flags and spraying pedestrians with Champagne. Officials daydreamed about building an economy based on tourism, like that of Monaco or Andorra.That has not happened. These days South Ossetia\u2019s economy is entirely dependent on budgetary funds from Russia. Unemployment is high, and so are prices, since goods must now be shuttled in through the tunnel, long and thin like a drinking straw, that cuts through the Caucasus ridge from Russia.Its political system is controlled by elites loyal to Moscow, suddenly wealthy enough to drive glossy black cars, though many roads are pitted or unpaved. Dozens of homes damaged in the 2008 war with Georgia have never been repaired. Dina Alborova, who heads a nonprofit organization in the South Ossetian capital, Tskhinvali, said her early hopes \u201call got corrected, step by step.\u201d\u201cDuring the first winter, we still thought, \u2018The war just ended,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cBy the second winter, frustration had taken root. When the third winter came, everything was clear.\u201dWhen Russia invaded Georgia, repelling a Georgian attack on South Ossetia and taking control of the separatist enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, it seemed most unlikely that the Kremlin was thinking about long-term consequences.As in Crimea, the war was presented to Russians as a humanitarian effort to protect its citizens, and more broadly as a challenge to encirclement by the United States, which was aligned with Georgia. Television stations gave the intervention blanket coverage, and it was wildly popular in Russia, lifting the approval ratings of Dmitri A. Medvedev to the highest point of his presidency.The aftermath of recognition, however, has presented Russia with a long series of headaches. This week, economists have warned repeatedly that Crimea, if it is absorbed, will prove a serious drag on Russia\u2019s budget, but their arguments have been drowned out in the roar of public support for annexation.Aleksei V. Malashenko, an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center, said Russian officials \u201cwill be shocked\u201d with the challenges they face when trying to manage Crimea \u2014 reviving its economy, distributing money and influence among its ethnic groups, and trying to control the corruption that accompanies all big Russian projects. And, judging from precedent, the public\u2019s euphoria will fade, he said.\u201cI think that in Russia, the majority of the society forgot about Ossetia, and if it weren\u2019t for the Olympics, the majority of the society would also forget about Abkhazia,\u201d Mr. Malashenko said. \u201cOf course, Crimea is not Ossetia. But anyway, the popularity of Crimeans, and the Crimean tragedy, will be forgotten in a year.\u201dSouth Ossetia\u2019s president, Leonid Tibilov, a former K.G.B. officer, was among the first to celebrate Russia\u2019s decision to absorb Crimea on Tuesday, calling it \u201cthe only possible step to grant solid peace to Crimea, which is the main and essential condition for its further prosperity.\u201dHe has some insight into the question: South Ossetia for years lobbied Russia to absorb it, voting for accession as far back as 1992. Russia did not respond until 2008, sending tanks across the Georgian border and recognizing South Ossetia as an independent country.People were delighted to see the Russian soldiers.Separatists here had spent two decades locked in conflict with the Georgian authorities, and had little economy to speak of, apart from apple orchards and the smuggling of drugs, counterfeit money and bootleg vodka through the tunnel into Russia. Georgian forces had shelled Tskhinvali, forcing many residents to cower for days in basements, and when Russia formally recognized South Ossetia, it meant a guarantee of protection.Russia, for its part, was lavishly demonstrating its commitment to South Ossetia; the conductor Valery Gergiev, who has close ties in the Kremlin, flew the entire orchestra of the Mariinsky Theater in to perform a symphony under floodlights near a ruined building.Some measure of that warmth has lasted. Ms. Alborova, director of the Agency for Social, Economic and Cultural Development, still remembers being in her basement with a few family members during the Georgian bombardment, with the \u201csense that these were the very last seconds of my life.\u201d Now, she said, \u201cthank God, we sleep peacefully.\u201dBut within a few months of Russia\u2019s recognition, shivering through the winter behind windows made of plastic sheeting, people began to wonder when the billions of rubles of aid pledged by Russia would reach them. The answer seems to have been that much of it was stolen: Mr. Malashenko said he estimated that 30 percent of the aid pledged by Russia had reached its target.Russia\u2019s federal audit chamber found that six months after the conflict, only $1.4 million had been spent on reconstruction out of a disbursement of $55 million in priority aid. By last year, the chamber estimated that $33 million had been lost or misused. South Ossetia\u2019s government eventually opened 70 cases against former officials, alleging that they stole a total of $22 million.The flows of cash changed South Ossetia, complained an academic from Tskhinvali, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of angering the local authorities. Officials who once lived modestly began to build lavish houses in \u201capricot and pink\u201d and cruise the streets in \u201cblack cars with blacked-out windows,\u201d she said, adding that she had recently paid $6 for a cup of green tea.\u201cIt will be sad if Crimea turns out the same way,\u201d she said. \u201cThis culture of Russian expansion, it means lots of money, but terribly distributed. It destroyed the good ways of a small people.\u201dThough many in South Ossetia had hoped to be absorbed into Russia, the Kremlin has so far refused to consider annexation, most likely because it would prove destabilizing for Russia\u2019s turbulent Caucasus region, Mr. Malashenko said. Despite 15 months of lobbying by Moscow, only four nations followed Russia\u2019s lead in recognizing South Ossetia as an independent country, and two of them were Pacific islands with populations of fewer than 15,000.Moscow has also stumbled in its attempt to maintain political control. When Kremlin \u201cpolitical technologists\u201d tried to engineer a victory for its preferred presidential candidate in 2011 and 2012, they prompted street demonstrations that nearly ended in civil unrest.Varvara Pakhomenko, a researcher with the International Crisis Group, said that the corrupt reconstruction process \u201ccreated a very critical mood\u201d toward Russia, and that South Ossetians had begun to complain about the behavior of Russian soldiers based outside Tskhinvali.\u201cMore and more, you can hear people saying that Russia is actually not interested in the people of South Ossetia, they ignore their opinions, and there is now fear that if the political situation changes, Russia might revoke its recognition or in some way return South Ossetia to Georgia,\u201d she said. Many, she said, pin their hopes on the dream of finally acceding to Russia, which they think will entitle them to higher pensions and salaries. Others have begun to leave the region, she said, \u201cfeeling the impossibility to change the situation.\u201dAs Crimea hurtled toward accession this week, South Ossetia\u2019s isolation deepened. Villagers in Atotsi, in Georgian-controlled territory, watched men in unmarked military uniforms build a five-foot-high barbed-wire fence across a stretch of pasture, part of a 30-mile barrier that officials say will eventually surround the entire enclave. A poster read, \u201cThe state border of the Republic of South Ossetia.\u201dZemfira Plieva, 43, who grew up inside South Ossetia and now lives just outside it, once crossed the boundary several times a week to sell vegetables or visit her sister, and she watched the spiky fence rising with dismay. When her mother died, three years ago, she was so afraid of being arrested that she did not attend the funeral. When asked what would happen if South Ossetia were formally annexed by Russia, she started to cry.\u201cI will never again see anyone from my family,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to think about it.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about problems Crimea may face, judging from those South Ossetia has encountered since Russia declared it independent of the Republic of Georgia in 2008, misstated the middle initial of an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center, who noted Russia may find Crimea hard to manage. He is Aleksei V. Malashenko, not Aleksei A.Olesya Vartanyan reported from Atotsi, and Ellen Barry from Moscow.Advertisement"}

With its aggressive new approach to the region, China has sowed suspicion among its neighbors, who fear not only economic but military dominance. China is engaged in a dangerous dispute with Japan over the sovereignty of islands administered by Japan in the East China Sea, raising fears that frequent movements around the islands by Chinese military patrols and Japanese fishing vessels could spark a conflict. Last November, China stunned Japan, South Korea and the United States by declaring a new air defense zone over parts of that sea. China has also been intimidating Southeast Asian nations that oppose its territorial claims in the South China Sea, with its fisheries and reputed oil and gas reserves. While some experts predict that it could be decades before the Chinese military catches up with the United States, China is investing in new systems, including submarines, surface ships and anti-ship ballistic missiles, that could be used to further intimidate neighbors or deny the United States access to Asian waters to defend its allies. China says the world has nothing to fear, but it could mitigate concerns by explaining why it needs such hefty increases and where the money will be spent, as the United States does. More consultation between the Chinese and American militaries would also be useful. So would a serious effort to resolve the territorial disputes, or at least agree on a code of conduct for managing them.Meanwhile, Congress should resist the impulse to pump up military spending. The better response is to support President Obama\u2019s policy of expanding America\u2019s economic, political and military engagement in Asia while remaining cleareyed about China\u2019s capabilities.Advertisement"}

Before we get there, however, what do we actually know about skills and jobs?Yes, workers with a lot of formal education have lower unemployment than those with less, but that\u2019s always true, in good times and bad. The crucial point is that unemployment remains much higher among workers at all education levels than it was before the financial crisis. The same is true across occupations: workers in every major category are doing worse than they were in 2007. The point is that influential people move in circles in which repeating the skills-gap story \u2014 or, better yet, writing about skill gaps in media outlets like Politico \u2014 is a badge of seriousness, an assertion of tribal identity. And the zombie shambles on.Unfortunately, the skills myth \u2014 like the myth of a looming debt crisis \u2014 is having dire effects on real-world policy. Instead of focusing on the way disastrously wrongheaded fiscal policy and inadequate action by the Federal Reserve have crippled the economy and demanding action, important people piously wring their hands about the failings of American workers. Moreover, by blaming workers for their own plight, the skills myth shifts attention away from the spectacle of soaring profits and bonuses even as employment and wages stagnate. Of course, that may be another reason corporate executives like the myth so much.So we need to kill this zombie, if we can, and stop making excuses for an economy that punishes workers.

{"Headline": "The Price of Slavery", "Date": "2014-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 1862, when Nathaniel Hawthorne headed south from New England to see the Civil War firsthand, he came upon a group of former slaves trudging northward. \u201cThey seemed a kind of creature by themselves, not altogether human,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut perhaps quite as good, and akin to the fauns and rustic deities of olden times.\u201d \u201cWhoever may be benefited by the results of this war,\u201d he added, \u201cit will not be the present generation of negroes.\u201dHawthorne\u2019s stunning comparison of real men and women to half-human creatures, even if kindly intended, gets to the heart of David Brion Davis\u2019s \u201cThe Problem of Slavery in the Age of Emancipation,\u201d the richly textured final volume in his exceptional trilogy about slavery in the Western Hemisphere. \u201cI have long interpreted the problem of slavery,\u201d he writes in his introduction, \u201cas centering on the impossibility of converting humans into the totally compliant, submissive, accepting chattel symbolized by Aristotle\u2019s ideal of the \u2018natural slave.\u2019 \u201dLess a political historian than a moral philosopher, Davis focuses here on 19th-century trans-Atlantic abolitionism and, in particular, the intellectual and theological origins of the antislavery movement in America. Borrowing from Freud and Descartes, he suggests that slaveholders projected onto their chattels the qualities they repressed in themselves. Particularly in America, the black population represented to white people \u201cthe finitude, imperfections, sensuality, self-mockery and depravity of human nature, thereby amplifying the opposite qualities in the white race.\u201d As a consequence, an American dream of freedom and opportunity was inseparable from a white illusion of superiority, bolstered by the subjugation and \u201canimalization\u201d of black people. That is, slaves were considered domesticated savages who would, if given the chance, revert to murder and mayhem. To many whites, particularly pro-slavery Southerners, this seemed the lesson of the violent and ultimately successful Haitian Revolution, which represented, as Davis puts it, \u201cthe unleashing of pure Id.\u201dBut the ironies of history are boundless. Although Haiti\u2019s slaves did win their freedom, a prolonged civil war damaged the country\u2019s economy. Seizing this opportunity, planters elsewhere in the Caribbean and in the American South increased production, which meant they needed to acquire more slaves. In 1803, South Carolina reopened its slave trade, importing 40,000 Africans in the next four years. Yet Great Britain, having lost as many as 50,000 soldiers and seamen in Haiti, responded differently, emancipating 800,000 colonial slaves in 1834 without spilling a drop of blood.After Haiti, many well-meaning American reformers wanted to expunge the black \u201cId\u201d peacefully by recolonizing free blacks in Africa. While Davis\u2019s use of such Freudianism may seem overbearing at times, his analysis of the underpinnings of the American Colonization Society, founded in 1816, is subtle, wide-ranging and consistently judicious. Refusing to dismiss colonization out of hand, he places it within the context of the Exodus narrative of deliverance, which he then persuasively connects to American messianism. He also shows that many supporters of colonization did not consider black people to be inherently inferior. Rather, in the first decades of the 19th century, evangelical reformers argued that slavery and prejudice had so completely dehumanized the African-American that he could never escape what the New England clergyman Leonard Bacon termed \u201cthe abyss of his degradation\u201d without being relocated to a less corrupt environment.But, as Davis cogently observes, not only did the pompous style of many colonization speeches reinforce the \u201cself-\u00adjustificatory power of the myth of America,\u201d the rhetoric was \u201cso abstract and grandiose that it almost precluded serious discussion of capital investment, technological assistance, labor skills and markets.\u201d Without money or training, how were the new colonists to establish a country, much less a prosperous one? What about the commercial networks they would endanger or the native people they would displace? As Davis makes clear, \u201cthe glaring defect in the colonizationist ideology was the refusal to recognize the vital contributions that blacks had made and would continue to make to American civilization.\u201dBlack abolitionists like James Forten, Richard Allen and Samuel Cornish demanded an integrated American society, and by the 1830s the American abolition movement had evolved into an energetic biracial entity. Davis argues that the white abolitionists, however paternalistic, were sincerely inspired by Anglo-American Christianity and by the efforts of religious women. The Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women, which first met in New York in 1837, published several significant pamphlets calling for racial and gender equality without any patronizing blather, although by today\u2019s standards their emphasis on the \u201celevation\u201d of the black population might sound sanctimonious and condescending. That\u2019s part of Davis\u2019s larger argument: Abolitionism was not monolithic in makeup or in motivation. Black emigrationists were not the same as white colonizationists, nor was black nationalism the same as white nationalism.Additionally, as Davis demonstrates, every movement contains nuances and paradoxes. When British reformers linked abolition to their crusade against wage slavery, Frederick Douglass replied that unlike exploited workers, chattel slaves did not even have \u201cthe privilege of saying \u2018myself.\u2019 \u201d Yet a correlation between these forms of bondage, as Davis points out, helps us to extend \u201cthe historically successful moral condemnation of slavery to other forms of coerced labor and exploitation,\u201d from Nazi concentration camps to 21st-century sex trafficking.\u201cMoral progress seems to be historical, cultural and institutional,\u201d Davis concludes, \u201cnot the result of a genetic improvement in human nature.\u201d The passage of the Fugitive Slave Law and the Supreme Court\u2019s Dred Scott decision, as well as the South\u2019s increasing belligerence, suggested to many abolitionists that slavery could not be ended without violence. But although the Civil War was truly catastrophic, the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment could not have been predicted at its start \u2014 or, for that matter, the subsequent end of slavery in Cuba and Brazil, which resulted partly because of Anglo-American abolition. Moral progress may be historical, cultural and institutional, but it isn\u2019t inevitable. All the more reason this superb book should be essential reading for anyone wishing to understand our complex and contradictory past.

{"Headline": "If Your Chauffeur Needs a Snowplow", "Date": "2014-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel | 2014 Bentley Flying Spur14 PhotosDETROIT \u2014 It started with a few innocent flakes. (Doesn\u2019t it always?) And then a snowstorm barreled into town the night after Christmas, frosting rows of parked cars and smothering the Walter P. Reuther Freeway, an unofficial autobahn where traffic tends to stream at 80 to 85 miles per hour. But not tonight. Confidence plummeted in direct proportion to the snowfall. Drivers picked their way along the freeway\u2019s eerie, white-glowing moonscape like nervous skiers on a powder run. At this moment, I\u2019m glad to be driving the latest Bentley Flying Spur, a 2.5-ton holiday goose from England. With a serious all-wheel-drive system, 21-inch wheels and claw-gripping winter tires, the Spur becomes an unstoppable monster in the snow: a 616-horsepower Zamboni that could probably clear a rink and glide around the boards at 120 m.p.h. The Bentley also makes a grand holiday entrance, though if my family was expecting me to hand out Rolexes, they were disappointed. The best I could do was to point to the analog Breitling clock in the Bentley, whose interior is suitable for some Wall Street wolf. There is Chippendale-worthy burr walnut, chrome brightwork and hand-stitched leather from cool-climate herds unmolested by insect bites and blemishes. Such overkill is the point of a Bentley, even for the Chinese nouveau riche who line up for the Spur but may never take the wheel, hiring a chauffeur instead. Those back-seat one-percenters \u2014 or maybe .00001 percenters in China \u2014 can have their folding wood picnic tables, champagne chillers and remote-controlled rear entertainment system. (The $2,135 bottle cooler and $7,300 entertainment system were missing from my Spur, even though the base price is $205,825 and the test car totaled $238,180.) But piloting the Flying Spur is better than riding in the back. It clocks miles so effortlessly that for my trip to Detroit I was happy to trade being groped by a T.S.A. agent \u2014 and a sardine seat in coach class \u2014 for the Bentley\u2019s upper-class accommodations.I knocked out 630 miles from New York to Detroit in nine hours flat, wafted by a twin-turbo 6-liter W12 engine with 590 pound-feet of torque. Compared with Rolls-Royce, the main rival for the vault keys of the rich, Bentley puts more heft in the steering and more starch in its adaptive suspension. That air suspension is just one technology that has trickled up from Volkswagen and Audi since the VW Group bought Bentley in 1999 and built it into the world\u2019s best-selling brand of ultraluxury cars.After enduring a huge dip during the recession, Bentley is going gangbusters again; its global sales last year of more than 10,000 cars represented a 19 percent gain over 2012. Bentley\u2019s explosive revival began in 2003 with the Continental GT Coupe, the boat-tailed showstopper that became a must-have for ballers and brokers, both old money and new.The Continental Flying Spur followed in 2006. That 12-cylinder sedan drove fine, but its appearance was limousine-generic.The reworked Flying Spur drops Continental from its name, and the design allies itself more closely with Bentley\u2019s flagship, the $280,000 Mulsanne. Using the nearly foot-longer Mulsanne as a template, the Spur\u2019s body builds stronger shoulders and adds formal body creases \u2014 superheated aluminum is molded by air pressure into complex shapes \u2014 to display its Bentley heritage.Wide-eyed outer headlamps bookend a smaller inner pair. A full-length lower fascia plays up the car\u2019s wider stance. New vents behind the front wheels flash a \u201cflying B\u201d motif. The rear roof pillars dip into a lower rear end with broad, Mulsanne-style haunches. Horizontal taillamps house LED \u201clight pipes\u201d in the brand\u2019s signature elliptical shape. Aside from its oversize mesh grille, the exterior remains understated, saving the spectacle for the cabin. Bentley claims more than 600 new parts inside. Even the headliner is wrapped in cowhide, with a choice of 17 colors. Bentley also offers seven wood veneers, each requiring about 10 square meters of mirror-polished timber. My Spur test car featured the optional Mulliner Spec package ($10,930), whose goodies include 21-inch alloy wheels, diamond-quilted leather upholstery, a knurled-metal sport shifter, Bentley wings embroidered on the headrests and a metal fuel cap that could double as a paperweight. A $615 wood-and-metal eyeglass case, too precious for drugstore sunglasses, plugs into the center cup holders. More money is burned with cigar lighters and ashtrays ($440); a two-tone, hide-trimmed steering wheel ($2,335); contrasting leather seat piping ($2,335); and a crystalline 1,100-watt Naim audio system ($7,480). In that indulgent vein, the trick for brands like Bentley is to convince people that design, exclusivity and elvish levels of craftsmanship justify paying double the price \u2014 or more \u2014 of cars that offer comparable performance and sometimes superior technology. One easy example is the Bentley\u2019s poorer cousin, the Audi A8. The Flying Spur rides on a modified version of the chassis that underpins the A8, which costs roughly $90,000. For $112,000, the S8 version of the Audi has a 520-horsepower V8 and accelerates faster than the Bentley (3.9 seconds from 0 to 60 miles per hour, versus 4.3 seconds for the Spur, according to the manufacturers). One element of these price disparities might be explained by any hotel valet: One car is an Audi, but the other is a Bentley.And while Bentley continues to rely on \u201cthe help\u201d at Audi for technology, Audi still keeps the newest gizmos for itself, bestowing hand-me-downs when it\u2019s good and ready. Bentley is again denied the latest, greatest version of Audi\u2019s Multi Media Interface and navigation system. The Flying Spur\u2019s screen graphics, processing speed, menus and controls are middling, though they\u2019re significantly better than the VW-based, abacus-level system that Bentley once foisted on its customers. Bentley does impress with its optional rear entertainment and connectivity system. Aside from dual 10-inch screens and DVD players, a Wi-Fi connection streams media or links devices from iPads to laptops. There\u2019s even a USB charger onboard.Bentley has soothed the Spur\u2019s once-crusty ride by softening the springs, bushings and antiroll bars, and by adding standard 19-inch tires with taller sidewalls. Yet the stiffened chassis and adaptive suspension still conjure Bentley magic, allowing the Spur to handle with remarkable poise at a ridiculous pace. Bentley says the Spur has shed 120 pounds, yet the beast still weighs 5,451 pounds when empty, more than the current Range Rover. Even lugging that mass, the Spur\u2019s 14 percent increase in power-to-weight ratio allows a claimed top speed of 200 m.p.h. Smarter electronic controls for this Frankenstein engine \u2014 essentially two Volkswagen V6 engines bolted into a W configuration \u2014 and a new 8-speed ZF automatic transmission bolster the Spur\u2019s aura of invincibility. To reduce drag and increase stability, the body lowers automatically at 121 m.p.h., then drops further at 149 m.p.h. Driving in such magisterial fashion takes a toll on mileage. The Spur\u2019s federal economy rating has risen by 1 m.p.g. in both city and highway use, to 12/20 m.p.g., but that remains low enough to warrant a $2,600 gas-guzzler tax.In 1,600 miles of driving, I was forced to make one unscheduled stop. In Detroit one evening, the bitter cold confused the tire-pressure monitor, which insisted that all four tires had gone low simultaneously \u2014 and then refused to let me shut off the screen\u2019s alert message to access other data. I pulled into a station with a bog-slow air pump and crouched with the hose as my hands went numb. A family in a Jeep Grand Cherokee awaited their turn, clearly entertained by the sight of a Bentley driver getting his hands dirty. Perhaps the Bentley buyers in China are onto something: That\u2019s what chauffeurs are for.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia, Ukraine and the West", "Date": "2014-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersRegarding \u201cUkrainian premier revives E.U. accord\u201d (News, March 22): Andrew Higgins notes that \u201cEuropean leaders were united in their condemnation of the Kremlin\u2019s moves to seize Crimea.\u201d At the same time, President Vladimir V. Putin justified his moves by saying that Russia had done nothing in Crimea but redeem a terra irredenta: \u201cWe seek no other parts of Ukraine. The protests of the West are unjustified.\u201dBy a curious irony, your report appeared in the same week that your \u201cIn Our Pages\u201d column noted a similar event in March 1939, when Hitler crossed his Rubicon. Up to March 1939, German annexations had concerned only territory that was already Germanic (Rhineland, Austria, Sudetenland). Now he was invading the rump of Czechoslovakia.On March 19, 1939, The New York Herald reported that the French and British governments had \u201cprotested vigorously\u201d and proclaimed their refusal to recognize the annexation, \u201cin conformity with\u201d the Stimson Doctrine of 1932. Berlin replied that the protests in Paris and London were \u201cunjustified.\u201d The Stimson Doctrine, named after Secretary of State Henry Stimson, was based on the principle of ex injuria jus non oritur (law cannot be grounded on injustice), and was addressed to Japan in response to its invasion of Manchuria (the true opening of World War II). Hence, territorial changes that were executed by force were not to be recognized by the United States, and in 1940 Washington refused to recognize the Soviet claim to the Baltic states it had invaded.The Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev said little about justification in 1956 when he suppressed the Budapest uprising, apart from calling it a \u201cfascist insurrection\u201d (a phrase we hear again today when Ukraine\u2019s deposed president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, speaks of Kiev.) Budapest was brute force only, but Prague in 1968 was different. Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet leader at the time, took pains to introduce a doctrine that Moscow holds the right to intervene in any Socialist state where the existing order is threatened.To justify his actions in Crimea, Mr. Putin might well voice the standard rebuttal to the Stimson Doctrine, invoking ex factus jus oritur (facts on the ground create their own law), but he won\u2019t do so because the same would apply to the legality of the new government in Kiev.Intervention in the name of protecting the population concerned is now among the biggest problems of our time. Europe\u2019s leaders may be \u201cunited\u201d in their condemnation of Mr. Putin\u2019s actions, but they were also united in 1939 \u2014 and it didn\u2019t help to deter Hitler. Mr. Putin is no Hitler, but he suffers from the same sort of mood swings and remains unpredictable. For the West, the game now becomes a balancing act between passivity and excess of zeal.David Wingeate Pike, ParisThe writer is distinguished professor emeritus of contemporary history and politics at the American University of Paris.\u00a0Russia\u2019s military takeover and annexation of Crimea have drawn so many parallels with events in Europe in the late 1930s that many people have begun to wonder whether this might be a prelude to a new global conflict. At its most basic level, the world is dealing with a wanton act of unprovoked aggression under false pretenses. But behind the scenes, everyone understands that Moscow is sending a message to the West: \u201cWe are willing to tolerate independence of the former Soviet republics only insofar as they strictly follow our agenda. Anything else will be interpreted as hostile and anti-Russian.\u201dIn the case of Ukraine, the ultimate goals are to strip its people of their sovereignty, prevent stronger ties between Ukraine and other European countries, and bring Ukraine back under the Russian control \u2014 or at the very least to ensure that it remains a buffer zone between Russia and the West. That is not exactly the vision the people of Ukraine have of their country\u2019s future.It\u2019s reassuring to see that the international community, led by the United States, is unanimous in its disapproval of Russia\u2019s behavior. But mere words have little effect on Mr. Putin. Only robust, tangible and long-lasting actions can persuade him and his government that the use of tactics \u00e0 la Stalin and Hitler is unacceptable in the 21st century.Mr. Putin is counting on the fact that economic sanctions in a global economy are a double-edge sword, and that the world\u2019s leaders will be reluctant to put their economies at risk. Should this calculation hold, Crimea may well be just the beginning.The people of Ukraine should not be held hostage to their bullying neighbor. Ukraine suffered enormously in the last century, having lost millions of people in the two world wars and millions more in the artificial famine under Soviet rule. Ukrainians don\u2019t want their country to be a piece on the global chessboard.Yuri Fialko, San DiegoThe writer, a Ukrainian citizen, is a professor of geophysics at the University of California at San Diego.\u00a0Regarding \u201cStand up to Russia now\u201d (Opinion, March 26) by Zalmay Khalilzad: While it is true that the United Nations operates most forcefully through the united action of the Security Council, the world body\u2019s current state of disarray is a snapshot of the current state of global affairs. The Soviet Union held a chair at the United Nations and yet the organization was still functional. The issue at hand is the way the system has changed since the collapse of a strong opposition voice to the United States and the West. For decades America has guided the United Nations, much to the chagrin of China and Russia. To ask Russia to simply concede to the Americans now is to ask them to swallow their own beliefs. To declare that Russia must submit is nothing short of arrogance.Jonathan Ha, Brooklyn, N.Y.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Youngest Technorati", "Date": "2014-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRyan Orbuch, 16 years old, rolled a suitcase to the front door of his family\u2019s house in Boulder, Colo., on a Friday morning a year ago. He was headed for the bus stop, then the airport, then Texas.\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d he told his mother. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop me.\u201dStacey Stern, his mother, wondered if he was right. \u201cI briefly thought: Do I have him arrested at the gate?\u201dBut the truth was, she felt conflicted. Should she stop her son from going on his first business trip?Ms. Stern loved her son\u2019s passion, but told him that he could go to Austin only if he finished the schoolwork he\u2019d neglected while building the app. But Ryan didn\u2019t comply, and, like battle-weary parents everywhere, she let him go anyway. Ryan and Louis, who met online in the informal network of young developers, are hanging out this weekend in Austin at South by Southwest. They are also waiting to hear from the colleges to which they applied last fall \u2014 part of the parallel universe they also live in, the traditional one with grades and SATs and teenage responsibilities. But unlike their peers for whom college is the singular focus, they have pondered whether to go at all. It\u2019s a good kind of problem, the kind faced by great high-school athletes or child actors who can try going pro, along with all the risk that entails.Dr. Becker, who studies microeconomics and education, has been telling his grandson: \u201cGo to college. Go to college.\u201d College, he says, is the clear step to economic success. \u201cThe evidence is overwhelming.\u201dThe college-or-not debate neglects other questions that high school students like Ryan and Louis and their families are wrestling with now: Go to class or on a business trip? Do grades still matter? What do you do with $20,000 when you\u2019re 15? And when the money rolls in, what happens to parental control? \u201cThings used to be linear. You went to a good school and you got a good job, and that was the societally acceptable thing to do,\u201d said Ms. Stern, Ryan\u2019s mother, who was a straight-A student and is a graduate of Duke University.Now, she said, \u201cthere is no rule book.\u201dProductive ProcrastinationBut Michael and Ryan shared a goal: \u201cSince middle school,\u201d Michael said, \u201cwe wanted to make an app.\u201dApp making, while hardly child\u2019s play, has become easier. It\u2019s not necessary to know intensive programming language to make a simple one. Apple, as well as other phone makers and tech companies, provide shortcuts, like templates that let you drop in images or automate payment methods. But making a complex app is still a big deal, requiring programming expertise and design and business savvy. And competition is fierce, with a million apps in the iPhone store alone. Ryan was studying for his 10th-grade finals in December 2011 when he thought: I wish there was something that would help me stop procrastinating. So, he procrastinated by sketching a picture of a to-do-list app that would let you clump tasks into three time frames: short term, medium term and long. The idea was to help people prioritize and not feel overwhelmed. He texted the crude picture to Michael. By that March, when both were 15, \u201cwe had our first mock-up,\u201d Ryan said. By June, they were at it hours every day, refining the design, with Michael writing thousands of lines of code using Objective-C, a computer language that he learned from online tutorials. Ryan refined the design and networked. One night that summer, they went to an informal meeting of Boulder entrepreneurs, who asked, mostly in jest: \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite kind of beer?\u201d They drank water. On Jan. 15, 2013, the day before the launch of the app, Ryan pulled his first all-nighter, sending publicity notes to TechCrunch, Forbes and other media outlets. Within days the app, priced at 99 cents, was No. 1, en route to having 50,000 paid downloads. After Apple took its 30 percent, the boys split about $30,000. Ryan\u2019s dedication came at a cost to his grades. The previous spring, he was almost an all-A student; the fall before the launching, busy with business, he earned four Bs and two Cs. At school, he\u2019d break the no-cellphone rule when he saw an incoming call from the 415 or the 408 area code. Silicon Valley, and potential business, calling.Maybe he was making up for lost time. He was 16, and, at least when compared with Louis Harboe, he was playing catch-up.First Job at Age 12As a child, Louis loved drawing, and at age 10, he got into Photoshop. He made a portfolio of designs, like icons to use in place of computer-program icons on your desktop; he shared them on his website and on Twitter, seeking feedback from designers and developers.He didn\u2019t reveal his age; his online profile picture was a smiley face. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to tell anyone you\u2019re 11,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause no one will hire you.\u201dHis first job was to design the look of a puzzle game. It took a week of work. The game maker asked Louis his fee. But he was 12. He had no idea. \u201cUm...,\u201d Louis remembers stalling. \u201c$150?\u201d\u201cHe was like: How about a little more because I really like you?\u201d Louis got $350.Louis got a handful of such gigs, and email inquiries for full-time jobs, including interest from Mozilla and Spotify when he was 14. The next year, an email came from an Apple talent scout. This time, Louis conceded his age and received this response: \u201cYou\u2019re the second high schooler I\u2019ve emailed. What are they teaching you in high school these days?\u201dIn the summer after 10th grade, he was hired by Square, the payment company; he says he heard the predictable \u201cchild labor law jokes.\u201d Lindsay Wiese, a Square spokeswoman, said that its internship program focuses on \u201ctalent, not age,\u201d and that it looks for leaders \u201clike Louis\u201d who provide a diversity of perspective. Young people understand young consumers. For Louis, the money has added up, around $35,000 in all, most of it spent on computers and accessories, some on business trips and some on eating out. Not on the college fund. Along with his own money, he came back from San Francisco with what his father, Frederik Harboe, lovingly describes as a touch of attitude. Louis, his dad said, developed a taste for high-end coffees, and remarked on the lack of sophistication of his father\u2019s \u201cdinner platings\u201d \u2014 the arrangement of food on the plate. At Square, there was free Odwalla orange juice. His family drank Tropicana. He came home after the first summer asking why his parents weren\u2019t matching Silicon Valley\u2019s breakfast-drink brands, recalled his mother, Catherine Becker, who manages a clothing store. \u201cBecause Odwalla fresh-squeezed is very expensive!\u201d she told her son. Last June, Louis attended the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco. A year earlier, Apple lowered its minimum age of admission to the annual conference to 13 from 18, owing to interest from young people. Louis was one of around 150 students to win a free ticket \u2014 ordinarily costing around $1,600 \u2014 to attend; he had previously collaborated on two apps, Mathmaster and iChalkboard. Other student winners, Apple said, have included Puck Meerburg, now 14, from the Netherlands, who has released 10 apps. He gave a TEDx talk at age 11. Lenny Khazan, 15, a ninth grader in Woodmere, N.Y., who started basic programming in fourth grade, has a handful of apps; he says he collaborates with teenagers around the world, including one in Singapore and another in Ohio. Another scholarship winner in 2013 was Larissa Laich, now 18, from Germany, who Apple said has six published apps. Ryan attended the conference, too, and he and Louis shared a room at the Best Western to save money. This was their first meeting in person, and Louis watched Ryan with something like awe. \u201cEvery day he had some meeting with some Apple exec to go to, or he\u2019d say, \u2018I\u2019ve got to go to this Bloomberg thing,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Louis said. \u201cHe\u2019s incredible at networking.\u201dRyan kept his conference admission badge, which shows that he is an award winner. \u201cIt was like gold,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cYou can get a meeting with anyone with one of those,\u201d he paused. \u201cBut you can\u2019t get into the over-21 parties.\u201d The Enablers\u201cI love Ryan\u2019s energy!\u201d Danielle Strachman said. \u201cHe embodies the go-getter.\u201dEven over the phone, Ryan impressed Ms. Strachman so much that she invited him to do an introductory talk at Thiel\u2019s fourth \u201cUnder 20 Summit,\u201d held last November in New York. There were 350 attendees, from ages 9 to 19 \u2014 double the attendance from a year ago. Team Thiel doesn\u2019t say that college is bad for everyone, but rather, that having a degree doesn\u2019t insulate people from economic tumult. Young people with talent and ideas should \u201cstrike while the iron is hot,\u201d as Ms. Strachman put it. Economists who study education largely agree that college matters greatly to future financial gain. In general, college graduates find better jobs and earn higher wages than those with only a high school degree, said Sandy Baum, an education scholar at George Washington University, though she acknowledged the economic uncertainty for many graduates. \u201cBut that\u2019s so much more true of people who did not go to college,\u201d she said, and to suggest otherwise is \u201cmisleading a lot of people.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like he showed up and I said, \u2018You\u2019re just a kid,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Mr. Walk, who knew Ryan\u2019s age. The investor says he benefits from hearing the insights of young people. \u201cThe age gap collapses pretty quickly when you\u2019re talking product and design,\u201d he said.Mr. Walk conceded that there could be a risk of making too much of early tech success. \u201cYou start to ask the same questions you do about child stars in Hollywood,\u201d he said. \u201cDid they peak at 17, and never have another great app?\u201dWaiting for the Future\u201cI\u2019m scared that my parents were right when they wanted me to focus completely on school, but I deeply believe I\u2019ve done the right thing.\u201dRyan wrote that as part of his Thiel Fellowship application, in answer to a question about important truths in his life. He also wrote 11 college applications, including one to Stanford, his dream school. His grades, however, had dropped further; last fall, he received two Ds. His Thiel application was for something he calls \u201cfixschool.org,\u201d a concept for inspiring and motivating students \u201cin ways that were never before possible\u201d with real-world tasks as opposed to homework.It\u2019s not clear what he will do next; it depends, he said, on where he gets in. In the meantime, he and Michael are pushing ahead with Finish. Just last weekend, they relaunched it as a free app \u2014 but with paid add-in functions \u2014 and got more than 50,000 new downloads in just 48 hours. Louis is committed to college, a view that solidified in the fall, partly after bearing witness to the experience of friends in the working world. \u201cTheir Facebook posts are all about work,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir lives don\u2019t seem that interesting.\u201dThere was another reality check. Last summer, after he spent the better part of a year designing a beautiful app to show the changing tides, Apple changed the design specs and Louis had to scrap his project.So, last fall, he took a break from heavy design work \u2014 though he still wants it to be a big part of his life and plans to develop apps in college \u2014 and he picked up his dad\u2019s guitar and taught himself to play. He applied to Carnegie Mellon. He also applied to Georgia Tech, without parental prompting. It wasn\u2019t lost on his father that both schools were far from Silicon Valley.Louis said he wants \u201cthe full college experience.\u201d It\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s been given the gift of seeing an alternate version of his life \u2014 that of a passionate developer who leaps into the tech fray \u2014 and realizes that the real world is a lot of work. \u201cI want to have fun,\u201d he said. \u201cI still feel like a kid \u2014 kind of.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Work Like a German", "Date": "2014-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSOME of our workplace programs, like Unemployment Insurance and Disability Insurance, parts of which date from the 1930s, desperately need updating. The original designers did not envisage such large numbers of people unemployed for long periods of time or living on disability benefits. If we could convert these programs into ladders of upward mobility, they would disproportionately benefit the disadvantaged, as well as strengthen the economy. We need to focus on enabling workers to stay in work \u2014 rather than having to compensate them after they have lost their jobs.We need only turn to Germany to see how much more effective such an approach can be. In 2009, Germany suffered a more precipitous drop in gross domestic product than the United States, but it experienced almost no change in unemployment. Here, it doubled. Today, unemployment in Germany is actually lower than it was pre-crisis, and long-term unemployment is negligible. With America\u2019s unemployment rate stuck above 6.5 percent, the contrast is stark.In the German job-share model (known as \u201cKurzarbeit\u201d), if an employer cuts an employee\u2019s hours so that income is reduced by more than 10 percent, the government compensates workers for a large portion of wages lost. This enables companies to cut costs during downturns without having to lay workers off. And then they\u2019re better placed for a recovery because they\u2019ve been able to preserve their pool of skilled labor. America should have a similar program to enable people to share jobs and to give employers an incentive to cut hours rather than staff.When people lose their jobs but find work at lower wages, the new program could plug the gap by supplementing their income. For the long-term unemployed who take significantly lower-paying jobs (typically, at minimum-wage levels), the unemployment benefits could offer stop-loss insurance to put a floor under their losses. The new program should also subsidize employers to provide paid sick days, family leave and child care support \u2014 measures that are especially important for disadvantaged women in the work force.Today, the unemployed are required only to look for work, but not to do anything to improve their qualifications. At the same time, the proportion of the unemployed who risk exhausting their benefits and facing severe hardship \u2014 as opposed to those who need temporary income support while between jobs \u2014 has grown markedly in recent years. The new program would focus training resources on the group that most needs it, those without skills. Taking another page from the German system \u2014 this time, its apprenticeship program \u2014 training should include both internships and postgraduate job placements.Once workers go on the Disability Insurance rolls, it has proved very hard to get them off; all the while, their skills and contacts in the workplace atrophy. In the fiscal year 2013, the program is estimated to have cost a record $144 billion. Given weak labor markets, employers have no incentive to hire disabled workers, so without reform, the number of people on Disability Insurance will stay stubbornly high. We need to intervene before people enter the program \u2014 and give those in it a better reason to exit. We should also introduce a new category of the partially disabled, so that the program can act as a wage supplement for those who are still able to work, rather than forcing them to make an either-or choice. Disability Insurance should also subsidize the employer\u2019s cost of accommodating and training disabled people. We can fund this through the savings made when people come off disability benefits as they go back to work.Of course, everything proposed here is made easier if we achieve higher economic growth. Many of these reforms would involve new ways to spend existing funds, and others would be self-financing, but there\u2019s no denying that the additional funds needed would be hard to wring out of already stressed public budgets. And there is no substitute for the critically important investments in infrastructure, education and research our country needs. There is a consensus to be won here: Liberals should get behind reforms that incentivize work, and conservatives should back the required government spending. After all, the welfare reform of the 1990s, while not flawless, has been a success, and that was achieved under a divided government. We can get this done, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Cold, Hard Lessons of Mobile Home U.", "Date": "2014-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrank Rolfe, who teaches Mobile Home University, a three-day course in the art of buying and operating mobile-home parks.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t get too hung up on appearances,\u201d Frank Rolfe reminded us as our tour bus made its way to the first of several trailer parks we would visit on a bright Saturday afternoon in Southern California. \u201cRemember, you don\u2019t have to live in these homes.\u201dIt was Day 2 of Mobile Home University, an intensive, three-day course on how to strike it rich in the trailer-park business. Seventy-five or so students had signed up for the class, which Rolfe offers every other month in different places around the country. Most of the enrollees weren\u2019t real estate speculators; they were jittery members of a hard-pressed middle class. They were nervous about retirement. Or they were worried about their jobs moving overseas. Or they were making $100,000 a year, maybe even $200,000, but felt the need to earn more. All of them, though, had somehow come to see the lowly mobile home as their vehicle to financial freedom. \u201cIt\u2019s about self-preservation,\u201d one 42-year-old attendee told me. He had flown down from San Francisco for the seminar because he hated his job selling health care plans.Our first stop was Green Lantern Village in Westminster, a city of 90,000, landlocked between Santa Ana and Huntington Beach. Green Lantern is a giant patch of asphalt crammed with 130 trailers. We gathered in a circle around Rolfe and the lot\u2019s manager and listened as the manager explained that rents at Green Lantern had been bumped up by more than 30 percent over the past three years. The Mobile Home U. students nodded appreciatively: They learned early in the course that one of the best things about investing in trailer parks is that ambitious landlords can raise the rent year after year without losing tenants. The typical resident is more likely to endure the increase than pay a trucking company the $3,000 it can easily cost to move even a single-wide trailer to another park. As Rolfe put it, an \u201cextra $10 or $20 a month isn\u2019t going to bankrupt anyone.\u201d He compared the hikes with cable companies\u2019 annual bump in fees, which get people into \u201cthe habit.\u201d Raising rents by 30 percent might sound steep for trailer-park tenants, who at Green Lantern earn $40,000 on average, but the manager explained why that isn\u2019t the case, as if he were reading from the 500-page instruction manual Rolfe distributed on the first day. For years, Green Lantern rented only to people 55 or older. But these days, the manager told us, a trailer is just as likely to be filled by a two-income family \u201cmaking minimum wage at a Taco Bell.\u201d There was a murmur of approval: Another early lesson was that whereas seniors tend to live on fixed incomes, greatly limiting their ability to absorb rent increases, working parents \u201ccan always pick up extra hours,\u201d as Rolfe put it, even if they\u2019re struggling.Rolfe is a tall, slouchy man with sad blue eyes and a mop of dark hair that has gone gray around the temples. He and his business partner, Dave Reynolds, started buying trailer parks together shortly after the subprime meltdown. Using their own money and millions more from outsider investors \u2014 including many who have been through Mobile Home University \u2014 they have been buying about two dozen parks a year. They now own 100 in 16 states (but none in California). By making what Rolfe calls a \u201ccontrarian bet on a poorer America,\u201d they have posted an annual return of roughly 25 percent, a rate at which they and their investors are doubling their money about every four years. By catering to those living on the economic margins, their parks generated more than $30 million in revenue last year. More than half of that was profit.But the most striking aspect of their business is how happy their tenants seem to be. A few months after completing Rolfe\u2019s course, I traveled to St. Louis to spend some time in a couple of parks that he and Reynolds own. (They let me choose where I wanted to stay.) To a person, the residents I met declared themselves satisfied with their landlords. A few, like Linda Wright, a former Walmart employee who has lived in the Jeffco Estates trailer park in Arnold, Mo., for the past 47 years, gushed about their ownership. Wright, who was the park manager when Rolfe and Reynolds took over early last spring, said the rutted roads in the park flooded every time it rained. Drug use was rampant, as were fights; the flashing lights from police cars routinely lit up the nights. When Rolfe and Reynolds bought the park, they repaved the streets and fixed the drainage system. They removed the most dilapidated trailers. And despite Wright\u2019s being a thorn in the side of the previous owners, the new owners kept her on as a manager, drawn, Rolfe said, by Wright\u2019s my-way-or-the-highway aggressiveness. \u201cYou get with the program in my park,\u201d Wright, a slight, white-haired woman, told me with her arms crossed. \u201cOr you\u2019re out.\u201dCan a business that\u2019s trying to squeeze every dime out of the working poor still offer them a pretty good deal? \u201cWe can\u2019t imagine wanting to live anywhere else,\u201d said Wright, who scoffed when I pointed out she\u2019s on the company payroll. \u201cTrust me,\u201d interjected her husband, John Wright, a retired auto porter. \u201cIf she was unhappy with something, she\u2019d tell you.\u201d To the extent that hers is a genuine and representative sentiment, the people involved with Mobile Home U. \u2014 instructors, enrollees, alumni investors \u2014 may represent the best thing going in affordable housing at a time when the nation\u2019s need for low-cost places to live has never been greater.There are 8.6 million mobile homes in the United States, according to a 2013 U.S. Census Bureau report. Some are a lone trailer on an individual\u2019s property, while others might be parked on Native American reservations, but an estimated 12 million people, Rolfe says, live in an actual trailer park. That number is not likely to grow, we learned in Southern California, given restrictive zoning laws and the prohibitive cost of building a new park in the boonies, meaning supply is static even as demand for cheap places to live is high. \u201cIt\u2019s just an absolutely great time to be in the mobile-home business, with all the people who have been displaced from their homes because of foreclosures or they\u2019ve lost a job or what have you,\u201d says Stu Silver, who runs a rival trailer-park seminar called SAM (\u201cspecial advanced mentoring\u201d) camp.In 2003, Warren Buffett paid $1.7 billion to buy Clayton Homes, one of the country\u2019s largest manufacturers of mobile homes. The industry\u2019s other boldfaced name is Sam Zell, the Chicago-based real estate magnate perhaps best known for his disastrous, debt-heavy takeover of The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and other dailies owned by the Tribune conglomerate. Zell is chairman of Equity LifeStyle Properties, which he took public in the early 1990s, when the company was called Manufactured Home Communities. With nearly 140,000 lots scattered across more than 370 communities, Equity LifeStyle is the mobile-home industry\u2019s largest landlord. Given that at various times Zell has owned more office space, as well as more apartment buildings, than any other entrepreneur in the United States, it\u2019s indicative of the riches to be made on this down-at-the-heels edge of the housing market that a mogul like Zell is so heavily invested in trailer parks. Not that the marketing departments at either Zell\u2019s or Buffett\u2019s company would describe one of its properties as a \u201ctrailer park.\u201d They wouldn\u2019t even use \u201cmobile-home park.\u201d Clayton builds and provides the financing for \u201cmanufactured homes\u201d \u2014 grand things compared with the typical trailer \u2014 that end up in \u201cmanufactured-home communities\u201d like the ones owned and operated by Equity LifeStyle. Its website features a montage of sun-splashed photos filled with tennis courts, swimming pools and lakes, and its properties often include clubhouses. \u201cIf you\u2019ve never experienced the manufactured-home-community way of life, you don\u2019t know really what a nice lifestyle it can be,\u201d Chrissy Jackson, an industry consultant, told me. If nothing else, the look and feel of the communities she was talking about are several notches above the trailer park most of us imagine.Frank Rolfe rolls his eyes when he hears this kind of talk. He tells people he\u2019s in the \u201cmobile home\u201d or \u201ctrailer park\u201d business because that\u2019s how customers talk. As for features like swimming pools? When Rolfe and Reynolds buy a park with a pool, they usually shut it down to rid themselves of the operating expense and the liability. Trees? They don\u2019t cut them down, but they don\u2019t plant many either. In their view, the root systems of trees are a threat to the sewer lines that crisscross any park. \u201cWe don\u2019t like laundry rooms or vending machines,\u201d Rolfe told the class. \u201cWe don\u2019t like amenities of any kind.\u201d They also prefer to buy used trailers to fill empty lots at their parks. That keeps expenses down for those paying both the lot rent, or \u201cdirt rent,\u201d which every resident pays each month, and the rent on their trailer \u2014 half of which can be applied toward purchasing any available unit. A used three-bedroom trailer can cost between $10,000 and $20,000, depending on its age, and take 10 years or so to pay for. The typical tenant who rents from Rolfe and Reynolds pays $250 or $300 a month in lot rent and another $200 or $300 if also renting a trailer. \u201cThe trailer park is people\u2019s last choice,\u201d Rolfe says, \u201cand we recognize that.\u201dThere were 211,000 fewer units of public housing in the United States in 2012 than there were in 1995, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Federal spending on rental assistance programs has remained flat in recent years, according to the center, even as the number of households that the Department of Housing and Urban Development classifies as \u201cworst case\u201d rose by 43 percent between 2007 and 2011. A study by the Center for Housing Policy found that among renters who have a job, one in four was spending at least half of his or her income for an apartment. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make things as cheap as possible,\u201d Rolfe said.While Rolfe, who is 52 and has a degree in economics from Stanford, can come off at times as a caricature of the coldhearted capitalist, during his Mobile Home University courses, he also gives voice to left-wing critiques about the profound fissures in our economy. One in five households, he told the class, lives on less than $20,000 a year. A significant portion of the 10,000 Americans who turn 65 every day are facing life on a fixed monthly income of $1,200 or less. He is an admitted profiteer thriving on the collateral damage caused by our winner-take-most economy, but he also is a zealous student of the constantly changing landscapes of American poverty. \u201cThe bottom line is Americans as a group are getting poorer,\u201d he told his students \u2014 and while that\u2019s bad news for those living on the economic fringes, it also means opportunities for those willing to take advantage of the trend.Rolfe, who lives in a small town one hour south of St. Louis, has always looked older than his years, he says, so much so that when he was in his 20s, people mistook him for someone twice his age. Back then, he imagined he would earn an M.B.A. and maybe work at an investment bank. But his brother told him business schools wanted their students to have at least a year of practical experience, and so he went into the billboard business, buying first one billboard, and then a few more, until a decade later he was up to 300 when another company bought him out for $5.8 million. At 35, he had to decide what to do with the rest of his life.Before Rolfe bought a trailer park, he had visited only one, the Glenhaven Mobile Home Park in Dallas, when an out-of-town billboard client asked him to deliver a message to its manager. Rolfe says: \u201cInvariably, the guy would open the door just wearing his underwear, totally hung over \u2014 \u2018What do you want?\u2019 \u201d Yet four months after selling his billboard company, Rolfe bought Glenhaven, a grim, junked-up, half-filled park, for $400,000. \u201cThe first thing I did was get a concealed-handgun license,\u201d Rolfe says. \u201cBecause I was afraid I would get assaulted.\u201dThis was 1996, near the start of the Internet era. At that point, a great many Stanford grads were lured to technology by the fortunes that could be made investing in dot-com start-ups. Rolfe had a couple of million dollars in the bank and a newborn daughter at home. Someone in those circumstances might be expected to choose a field that doesn\u2019t entail carrying a loaded pistol to work each day, but Rolfe couldn\u2019t help himself once he calculated the financial potential of Glenhaven. He eventually made more than a million-dollar profit on that one park. And maybe just as important, he discovered that he was drawn to what was to him an exotic, fringe world that he had stumbled into.\u201cI don\u2019t drink, I don\u2019t smoke, I don\u2019t gamble,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t travel, I don\u2019t restore cars, I have no hobbies. I don\u2019t do anything.\u201d Trailer parks are his world, and after nearly two decades in the business, he can entertain his students with a near-endless repertoire of tales. One of the class\u2019s favorites was the tenant who tried to drown his girlfriend \u2014 and then nearly became a murder victim himself when the same woman tried to saw off his head.\u201cI love the weirdness,\u201d is how Rolfe put it to me, apparently unaware of how it might sound to some that a man who makes his money squeezing a little bit more out of the working poor also finds entertainment value in the pathologies of the more miserable among them.After owning Glenhaven for a few months, Rolfe realized there was no reason to carry a gun to work. A year later, he also realized that he didn\u2019t need to spend his days in the small manager\u2019s office there. For a relatively nominal salary \u2014 these days, around $12,000 a year for the typical park plus a rent-free trailer \u2014 he could hire a manager and the day-to-day problems would be someone else\u2019s. That freed Rolfe to roam the country in search of poorly managed parks to be bought on the cheap. His strategy drew the interest of a private equity firm that provided him with the money he needed to expand his empire. Rolfe had acquired two dozen parks when he reversed course, feeling emboldened by a spike in real estate prices that had potential buyers willing to purchase his properties for much more than he thought they were worth. By 2007, he had sold his entire portfolio, earning about as much on his trailer parks, he says, as he did from the sale of his billboard company.Rolfe was still winding down his business in 2006 when he met Dave Reynolds at an industry conference. The two competitors agreed over lunch that they could do a much better job teaching people the nuts and bolts of the trailer-park business than the pair who had asked them to serve as guest speakers. If anything, Reynolds knew more about trailer parks than even Rolfe. Reynolds had been born into the business; his parents owned a mobile-home court in Colorado. He went to school to study accounting, but doing the books for the family opened his eyes to the profitability of a world he shunned growing up. \u201cI was the middle-class kid suddenly having to live among the poor,\u201d he said about the few months he had to live in his parents\u2019 park as a kid. \u201cI hated it.\u201d But Reynolds realized that he \u201ccould make three times what I could have made as a C.P.A.\u201d He bought his first park in 1993, when he was 24.At first, Rolfe and Reynolds both taught the curriculum they created. But then a couple of years ago, Reynolds calculated the hours he was devoting to teaching a three-day course six times a year during boom times for the trailer-park industry. By that point, the two of them were searching the country for parks to buy. \u201cThere were better uses of my time,\u201d he concluded. That meant more work for Rolfe, who was happy to pick up the slack. \u201cSome people dream of going to the beach,\u201d he says. \u201cI dream of going to an office.\u201dAs an instructor, Rolfe has a veritable Ph.D. in the habits and rituals of trailer-park residents. It\u2019s as if he carries a map in his head based on trailer parks he has bought or at least contemplated buying and that gives him a fascinating, if perhaps narrow, view of his fellow citizens. Trailer-park residents living in the North, he told everyone, are rock-solid citizens compared with their counterparts in the South. For one thing, they tend to be neater and also more responsible. In Texas, for instance, 5 to 6 percent of their tenants are delinquent each month paying the rent, compared with less than 2 percent of those living in parks in Wisconsin, North Dakota or Minnesota.Rolfe avoids buying any parks in New York and California; both states are too \u201ctenant friendly,\u201d he said \u2014 too much in the way of time and money are required to evict someone who is behind on the rent. And forget Las Vegas, Phoenix and other locales hit hard by the subprime meltdown. The glut of cheap homes represents competition. \u201cIf we look on Zillow and see houses selling for $30,000 or $50,000, we\u2019re walking from that deal,\u201d Rolfe said. In most of the country, the key to calibrating the proper rent means knowing the price of a decent two-bedroom in the surrounding area. If the going rate is $700 a month, Rolfe said, then cap your lot rent at half that. And think long and hard, he warned the class, before crossing the $500 threshold. The industry \u201csweet spot\u201d is a lot rent of $495, he explained, but raising it by another $5 \u201ccould mean death.\u201d On the other hand, Rolfe said, you can always have your tenants pay for water, which is a trailer-park owner\u2019s largest expense.Rolfe doesn\u2019t offer much practical advice about overcoming any embarrassment in associating yourself with the trailer-park business. That, it seems, is something attendees have worked out for themselves before plunking down their tuition. Among those I spent time with in Orange County was Jefferson Lilly, who had made a lot of money working sales jobs at a series of Silicon Valley-based technology start-ups. \u201cAt first I was like, \u2018No way am I buying a freaking trailer park,\u2019 \u201d said Lilly, a clean-cut, 46-year-old Ivy Leaguer who lives in San Francisco. But when he discovered the price of apartment buildings and compared them with the cost of trailer parks, he found himself reconsidering. What difference did it make, Lilly asked himself, whether he bought a trailer park or an apartment building when he wasn\u2019t going to live in either one?A mobile-home park feels more like an army base than a neighborhood. A trailer is still a trailer, even with the vinyl siding and pitched roofs that are now common, and all but the priciest parks include the familiar Truman-era rectangular metal mobile homes and wooden ones that are also decades old. To maximize the number of homes that can fit in a park, trailers are arranged so passers-by generally see the sides of people\u2019s rectangular boxes (spaced 15 to 20 feet apart) rather than their front entrances.Still, people make the effort to personalize their homes at Pontoon Beach. Everywhere I looked, I saw handsome wooden decks thick with potted plants, American flags, chimes and wooden birds whose wings twirl with the wind. The residents had planted shrubs and rose bushes and small flower beds bordered by rocks.I heard the occasional complaint during my time at Pontoon Beach \u2014 kids riding their bikes in the street, potholes patched instead of streets repaved \u2014 but they sounded like what you might hear at the monthly meeting of a suburban homeowner\u2019s association. More typical was the view of Alisha Stanek, a 22-year-old high-school dropout with an 8-month-old daughter. Including the installment payments on a used, three-bedroom, two-bath trailer, she was spending $550 a month on rent. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a house for even close to that,\u201d Stanek said.Others even expressed feelings of superiority to those burdened with big mortgages or hefty monthly rents, including Barbara Watz. She moved to Pontoon Beach in 1978, a single woman in her 40s working at a blood clinic. She could have bought a tiny house on her salary, but a two-bedroom, one-bath trailer cost less per month than her car payment \u2014 and meant she was done with house payments after a few years. Now 76 and retired, Watz pays $285 a month in lot rent and spends her days reading murder mysteries and tending to her plants. Watz drives a 2010 Honda S.U.V. and has the money for small splurges. (One day when we were talking, U.P.S. delivered to her a box of wooden ducks dressed in yellow raincoats.) Her only complaint about living in a mobile-home park? \u201cThe trailer trash, redneck jokes I\u2019ve been hearing since the day I moved in,\u201d she said.A Rolfe-Reynolds park is, if nothing else, well run. Based on what I saw, tenants kept their lots junk-free and the grass mowed \u2014 or management will take care of things and send you the bill. Rolfe and Reynolds begin eviction proceedings on a tenant as soon as local laws allow, even if a tenant is just two or three weeks late in paying the rent. \u201cOurs is a strict \u2018no pay, no stay\u2019 policy,\u201d Rolfe says. The practice helps rid their parks of bad seeds and ne\u2019er-do-wells \u2014 though that\u2019s little consolation to the newly laid-off tenant who now has to simultaneously think about finding a new job and a new place to live, while facing the possibility that he\u2019s about to lose whatever equity he has in his home. And most do have considerable equity invested, given that four out of five are paying only a monthly lot rent, which means they own their trailer outright or are making payments to a third party. If their trailer parks can be viewed as part of the new safety net, it\u2019s a fragile one.The trailer park also seems a bad deal for the manager. After all, it\u2019s the managers who deal with a clogged sewer line or the unstable tenant behind in his rent \u2014 in exchange for a low-paying job that doesn\u2019t even offer health insurance. Yet Rolfe has a point when he argues that it\u2019s often better than most of the alternatives. He mentions Linda Wright, who manages his park in Arnold, Mo. \u201cWhat was she making at Walmart: $13 an hour?\u201d Rolfe asked. \u201cFor $25,000 a year, she had to be in that store eight hours a day, driving there, had a boss. Now she\u2019s making close to the same with us, in her own house. She\u2019s her own boss.\u201dRolfe confesses to feeling some guilt that he owns the largest house in his hometown while his customers are making do in cramped quarters. It breaks his heart, he confesses, when they evict a family even as he tells himself it\u2019s for the best. He acknowledges he has made millions of dollars warehousing those living on the economic margins. But what if you simply want to keep your monthly living expenses low so you have a nest egg for emergencies \u2014 or have the option to take in a movie or buy some wooden ducks every once in a while? Or what if Pontoon Beach is simply your best option? With around 10,000 lots scattered mostly across the Midwest and the Central Plains, Rolfe and Reynolds are about equivalent in size to a public-housing agency in a midsize city \u2014 and in an important way, they play the same role. Those living in public housing are generally required to pay up to 30 percent of their household income as their share of the rent. Rolfe and Reynolds\u2019s tenants pay on average closer to 20 percent. And unlike the civil servants working for a housing agency, their managers know they must enforce the rules or they\u2019re out. \u201cWe go through managers like crazy,\u201d Rolfe says.Their tenants, though, tend to stay if for no other reason than a lack of options. The average resident has \u201csuch bad credit,\u201d Rolfe said, that it would be a deal-killer for most landlords running credit checks on potential tenants. Those who are retired are thankful that they own a place of their own, even if it\u2019s only a metal box, because it allows them to live on the little they have. And here Rolfe and Reynolds are providing safe, low-cost housing to those who can\u2019t afford to pay more or choose not to.\u201cWe\u2019re the Dollar General store of housing,\u201d Rolfe said, adding, with an amiable grin, \u201cIf you can\u2019t afford anything else, then you\u2019ll live with us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Billionaires With Big Ideas Are Privatizing American Science", "Date": "2014-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast April, President Obama assembled some of the nation\u2019s most august scientific dignitaries in the East Room of the White House. Joking that his grades in physics made him a dubious candidate for \u201cscientist in chief,\u201d he spoke of using technological innovation \u201cto grow our economy\u201d and unveiled \u201cthe next great American project\u201d: a $100 million initiative to probe the mysteries of the human brain.American science, long a source of national power and pride, is increasingly becoming a private enterprise.In Washington, budget cuts have left the nation\u2019s research complex reeling. Labs are closing. Scientists are being laid off. Projects are being put on the shelf, especially in the risky, freewheeling realm of basic research. Yet from Silicon Valley to Wall Street, science philanthropy is hot, as many of the richest Americans seek to reinvent themselves as patrons of social progress through science research.The result is a new calculus of influence and priorities that the scientific community views with a mix of gratitude and trepidation.They have mounted a private war on disease, with new protocols that break down walls between academia and industry to turn basic discoveries into effective treatments. They have rekindled traditions of scientific exploration by financing hunts for dinosaur bones and giant sea creatures. They are even beginning to challenge Washington in the costly game of big science, with innovative ships, undersea craft and giant telescopes \u2014 as well as the first private mission to deep space.The new philanthropists represent the breadth of American business, people like Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor (and founder of the media company that bears his name), James Simons (hedge funds) and David H. Koch (oil and chemicals), among hundreds of wealthy donors. Especially prominent, though, are some of the boldest-face names of the tech world, among them Bill Gates (Microsoft), Eric E. Schmidt (Google) and Lawrence J. Ellison (Oracle).This is philanthropy in the age of the new economy \u2014 financed with its outsize riches, practiced according to its individualistic, entrepreneurial creed. The donors are impatient with the deliberate, and often politicized, pace of public science, they say, and willing to take risks that government cannot or simply will not consider.Yet that personal setting of priorities is precisely what troubles some in the science establishment. Many of the patrons, they say, are ignoring basic research \u2014 the kind that investigates the riddles of nature and has produced centuries of breakthroughs, even whole industries \u2014 for a jumble of popular, feel-good fields like environmental studies and space exploration.\u201cPhysics isn\u2019t sexy,\u201d William H. Press, a White House science adviser, said in an interview. \u201cBut everybody looks at the sky.\u201dFundamentally at stake, the critics say, is the social contract that cultivates science for the common good. They worry that the philanthropic billions tend to enrich elite universities at the expense of poor ones, while undermining political support for federally sponsored research and its efforts to foster a greater diversity of opportunity \u2014 geographic, economic, racial \u2014 among the nation\u2019s scientific investigators.Historically, disease research has been particularly prone to unequal attention along racial and economic lines. A look at major initiatives suggests that the philanthropists\u2019 war on disease risks widening that gap, as a number of the campaigns, driven by personal adversity, target illnesses that predominantly afflict white people \u2014 like cystic fibrosis, melanoma and ovarian cancer.Public money still accounts for most of America\u2019s best research, as well as its remarkable depth and diversity. What is unclear is how far or fast that balance is shifting, since no one, either in or out of government, has been comprehensively tracking the magnitude and impact of private science. In recognition of its rising profile, though, the National Science Foundation recently announced plans to begin surveying the philanthropic landscape.There are the skeptics. Then there are the former skeptics, people like Martin A. Apple, a biochemist and former head of the Council of Scientific Society Presidents.Initially, Dr. Apple said, he, too, saw the donors as superrich dabblers. Now he believes that they are helping accelerate the overall pace of science. What changed his mind, he said, was watching them persevere, year after year, in pursuit of highly ambitious goals.\u201cThey target polio and go after it until it\u2019s done \u2014 no one else can do that,\u201d he said, referring to the global drive to eradicate the disease. \u201cIn effect, they have the power to lead where the market and the political will are insufficient.\u201dAnd their impact seems likely to grow, given continuing federal budget wars and their enormous wealth. Indeed, a New York Times analysis shows that the 40 or so richest science donors who have signed a pledge to give most of their fortunes to charity have assets surpassing a quarter-trillion dollars.\u201cToday, federal funding of basic research is on the decline,\u201d the group said. \u201cThe best hope for near-term change lies with American philanthropy.\u201dA New TemplateWhen Mr. Ellison, chief executive of the Oracle Corporation, heard a Nobel laureate biologist give a talk at Stanford about artificial intelligence, he was mesmerized. It was the early 1990s, and the idea of applying fast computers to genetic riddles was new. \u201cI had never experienced anything like it,\u201d Mr. Ellison recalled.It\u2019s not that Mr. Ellison is the biggest or most visible of the philanthropists. (That distinction probably belongs to Bill Gates, who has donated roughly $10 billion for global public health.) But his work is very much a template for the new private science.In the traditional world of government-sponsored research, at agencies like the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, panels of experts pore over grant applications to decide which ones get financed, weighing such factors as intellectual merit and social value. At times, groups of distinguished experts weigh in on how to advance whole fields, recommending, for instance, the construction of large instruments and laboratories costing billions of dollars.By contrast, the new science philanthropy is personal, antibureaucratic, inspirational.For Wendy Schmidt, the inspiration came in 2009, from a coral reef in the Grenadine islands of the Caribbean. It was her first scuba dive, and it opened her eyes to the riot of nature.\u201cWe want to rapidly advance scientific research, to speed it up,\u201d Mrs. Schmidt said in an interview.Eli Broad, who earned his money in housing and insurance, donated $700 million for a venture between Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to explore the genetic basis of disease. Gordon Moore of Intel has spent $850 million on research in physics, biology, the environment and astronomy. The investor Ronald O. Perelman, among other donations, gave more than $30 million to study women\u2019s cancers \u2014 money that led to Herceptin, a breakthrough drug for certain kinds of breast cancer. Nathan P. Myhrvold, a former chief technology officer at Microsoft, has spent heavily on uncovering fossil remains of Tyrannosaurus rex, and Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund, has lent his mega-yacht to hunts for the elusive giant squid.The availability of so much well-financed ambition has created a new kind of dating game. In what is becoming a common narrative, researchers like to describe how they begged the federal science establishment for funds, were brushed aside and turned instead to the welcoming arms of philanthropists. To help scientists bond quickly with potential benefactors, a cottage industry has emerged, offering workshops, personal coaching, role-playing exercises and the production of video appeals.Advancement Resources of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, did its first workshop in 2002 and has now conducted hundreds across the country, mostly to coach scientists and medical institutions in what it calls the art of donor development. \u201cWe help make their work accessible to people who do not have scientific backgrounds but do understand money,\u201d said its founder, Joe K. Golding.Practice in front of the mirror and \u201cwith anyone who will listen,\u201d it advised. When the pitch is smooth enough, \u201caim high.\u201dGovernment GloomIn November 2012, the White House issued a thick and portentous update on the health of the nation\u2019s research complex. Produced by Mr. Obama\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, it warned of American declines, emphasized the rise of scientific rivals abroad and called for bold policy interventions.The financial outlook had fallen far and fast. Congress had long reached across party lines to support government research, for its economic and military rewards and because the distribution of billions of dollars plays well come election time. After rising steadily for decades, federal science financing hit a high point in 2009, in the early days of the Obama administration, as Congress, to stimulate the economy amid the global financial crisis, allocated about $40 billion for basic science.That bipartisan consensus eroded with the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives in the 2010 midterm elections and the budget battles that followed. Spending on basic research has fallen by roughly a quarter, to $30 billion last year, one of the sharpest declines ever.The cutbacks translate into layoffs: A group of scientific societies recently surveyed 3,700 scientists and technical managers and reported that 55 percent knew of colleagues who had lost jobs or expected to lose them soon.In an interview, the director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis S. Collins, called 2013 one of his agency\u2019s darkest years ever, with fewer grants awarded and with jobs and programs cut. In decades past, research financed by the institutes won more than 100 Nobel Prizes. The cutbacks, Dr. Collins said, were \u201cprofoundly discouraging.\u201dLargely unmentioned in the gloom is the rise of private science. The White House report mentioned philanthropy only in passing. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do it justice,\u201d said one of the authors, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the report\u2019s preparation.Science policy has always been shot through with politics. Little surprise, then, that political sensitivities have been stoked by the injection of philanthropic money into this traditionally public sphere.The official reticence about private science may reflect, in part, a fear that conservatives will try to use it to further a small-government agenda. Indeed, some of the donors themselves worry that too much focus on private giving could diminish public support for federal science.\u201cIt\u2019s always been a major worry,\u201d said Robert W. Conn, president of the Kavli Foundation, which has committed nearly a quarter of a billion dollars to science and is part of the private effort to increase financing for basic research. \u201cPhilanthropy is no substitute for government funding. You can\u2019t say that loud enough.\u201dRepresentative Lamar Smith would beg to disagree. Mr. Smith, a 14-term Republican from Texas, helped found the House Tea Party Caucus and, after the Tea Party ferment swept the Republicans to power in the House, became chairman of the Committee on Science, Space and Technology.\u201cWe must better recognize what the private sector can do to aid our efforts to protect the world,\u201d Mr. Smith said.In decades past, that job would have belonged to NASA. But at the hearing, the project\u2019s head, Edward T. Lu, a former astronaut and Google executive, testified that the spacecraft\u2019s cost \u2014 $450 million \u2014 was about half what the government would have spent.Committee members enthusiastically suggested that the private endeavor pointed the way toward a new era of lower federal spending.\u201cCongratulations!\u201d said Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican. \u201cI\u2019m totally supportive.\u201dIn the recent interview, Dr. Collins of the N.I.H. acknowledged that the philanthropists were \u201cterrifically important\u201d for filling gaps and taking advantage of new opportunities. The science, he emphasized, \u201chas never been at a more exciting moment.\u201dStill, he and other experts are quick to add that the private surge is far too small to replace public financing.The N.I.H. budget alone runs to about $30 billion \u2014 half for basic research. At least for now, said Dr. Press, the board chairman of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, private giving is \u201cstill a drop in the bucket.\u201dUncharted BillionsFor all that, the government knows very little about how much philanthropic money is flowing into science, or how it is being spent.Science analysts say that knowledge is vitally important: Without it, the government cannot get a comprehensive picture and strive for a smart balance in the nation\u2019s overall science plans.The issues are considered social as well as intellectual, and so, in their own grant-making decisions, federal agencies strive to ensure that their money does not flow just to established stars at elite institutions. They consider gender and race, income and geography.Yet even as the federal government finely monitors its own investments in science research, philanthropy remains largely uncharted territory. (The government does carefully track science financed by private industry, but that research tends to produce such practical things as drugs, jets and gadgets, rather than fundamental insights into the mysteries of nature.)\u201cPeople assume we do it,\u201d said John E. Jankowski, a senior analyst at the National Science Foundation, which not only finances research but also tracks science budgets. \u201cBut we don\u2019t, because of resource constraints.\u201dThe task is daunting. If government science is centralized, science philanthropy is determinedly not: It is an agglomeration of donors, from the wealthiest patrons to people who write modest checks to their favorite charities.The National Academy of Sciences has repeatedly urged the government to step up its monitoring of the uncharted billions. And recently, Dr. Jankowski said, the National Science Foundation began developing a pilot survey, to be completed in about a year.If budgets allow, he added, the agency plans to \u201cultimately fund\u201d a comprehensive survey.In the meantime, Fiona E. Murray, a professor of entrepreneurship at M.I.T., has taken a different tack, studying not the donors but the recipients \u2014 particularly the nation\u2019s research universities.To simplify the task, she looked at the 50 leading universities in science-research spending, places like Columbia and Stanford, Duke and Harvard, Michigan and Johns Hopkins.The new patrons are responsible for one of the most striking trends on these campuses: the rise of privately financed institutes, the new temples of science philanthropy.In Cambridge, Mass. \u2014 home to M.I.T. and Harvard \u2014 they include the $100 million Ragon Institute for immunology research, the $150 million Koch Institute for cancer studies, the $165 million Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, the $250 million Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, the $350 million McGovern Institute for brain research, the $450 million Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and the $700 million Broad Institute for genome research.\u201cIf I\u2019m a rich person, I\u2019m going to give to a leading institution \u2014 to Harvard or Princeton,\u201d Dr. Murray said in an interview. That pattern, she added, \u201cposes big issues\u201d for the nation.A Focus on DiseaseIf the map of the world of private science has yet to be drawn, one thing is clear: Much of the money is going into campaigns for a cure.This private war on disease has resulted not only in significant advances in treatment, but also in what experts describe as a major breakthrough in how biomedical research is done. The method opens up blockages that have traditionally kept basic discoveries from being turned into effective treatments \u2014 especially for rare diseases that drug companies avoid for lack of potential profit.\u201cWe think it\u2019s potentially transformative,\u201d said Maryann P. Feldman, a professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who studies the approach.The first success came with cystic fibrosis, which arises when a faulty gene clogs the lungs and pancreas with a sticky mucus. People with cystic fibrosis suffer from coughing, fatigue, poor digestion and slow growth, and die relatively young.Year after year, the foundation held galas, hikes, runs and golf tournaments, eventually raising more than a quarter-billion dollars. With great skill, it used the money to establish partnerships across industry and academia, smashing through the walls that typically form around research teams.The success begot a global rush to turn basic discoveries into treatments, a field now known as translational science. It also inspired rich donors to shower new money on disease research.Many of their efforts are rooted deep in personal or family trauma. Sometimes, by sheer force of genetics and demographics, that impulse may risk widening historical racial inequalities in health care and disease research, disparities that decades of studies have shown to contribute to higher rates of disease and death among blacks, Hispanics and other minority groups.Of course, the pervasiveness of most diseases means most philanthropists give comfort and medical relief across the lines of race and ethnicity. When Mr. Milken, for example, learned that he had prostate cancer, he set up a foundation to fight it. The charity has raised more than half a billion dollars, helping save not only him but also many black men, since they develop the disease more frequently than white men do.Scientists first described sickle cell anemia in 1910 and uncovered its genetic basis in 1949. The discovery, by a team that included Linus Pauling, a Nobel laureate twice over, was central to the creation of the field of molecular medicine. Yet with little financing for sickle cell research, either public or private, no drug has been developed that targets the disease\u2019s underlying cause, even though it has crippled and killed millions of people.Dr. Collins, who works with many wealthy donors, said the government was trying to level the playing field rather than rush off to where \u201ceverybody\u2019s already piled up effort.\u201d An effective treatment for sickle cell disease, he said, has \u201cbeen a long time coming.\u201dSetting the AgendaIn the early 1980s, Leroy Hood, a biologist at the California Institute of Technology, proposed to make the first automated DNA sequencer, which he pitched to the National Institutes of Health as a way to rapidly identify the billions of hereditary units in every human cell. His grant proposals were rejected, so he turned to Sol Price, a warehouse-store magnate whose companies ultimately merged with Costco.The breakthrough of the DNA sequencer led to the Human Genome Project \u2014 the federal effort that, at a cost of $3.8 billion, mapped all the heritable units \u2014 and, more recently, to the burgeoning field of personal genomics.Science philanthropy, Dr. Hood said, \u201clets you push the frontiers.\u201dOver the years, the flood of private money has also inspired something of a reversal. In gene sequencing, in translational medicine, in the Obama administration\u2019s Brain initiative and in other areas, the federal government, instead of setting the agenda, increasingly follows the private lead.Sometimes, private donors go to the government\u2019s aid. When budget cuts threatened to shut down a giant particle accelerator on Long Island in 2006, Dr. Simons, the hedge-fund investor, who lives nearby, raised $13 million to bail it out. As a result, research teams were able to keep exploring subatomic aspects of the blast that brought the universe into existence.If the rich donors are to be believed, their financing of scientific research in the years ahead will expand greatly in size and scope. A main reason is the Giving Pledge.In 2010, Mr. Gates, along with his wife, Melinda, and the investor Warren E. Buffett, announced the campaign. So far, roughly a fifth of America\u2019s nearly 500 billionaires have signed up, pledging to donate the majority of their fortunes to charity.\u201cWe want to eradicate diabetes in our lifetime,\u201d wrote Harold Hamm, a leading figure in the North Dakota oil rush, and his wife, Sue Ann.Jon M. Huntsman, a Utah billionaire whose son Jon Jr. unsuccessfully sought the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, said his philanthropy would \u201cmake sure cancer is vanquished.\u201dAdmirers of the new patrons \u2014 and the patrons themselves \u2014 say that, over the decades, the surge in donations will probably result in economic growth that helps the United States fend off global challengers. The private gifts, they emphasize, will become especially important if Washington funding continues its downward spiral.\u201cWe have no excuse\u201d for losing the lead, Mr. Mitchell said. \u201cWe need to fix it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Yellen, that fueled speculation of an earlier-than-expected increase in interest rates.After several weeks of soft economic data attributed to harsh winter weather conditions, a government report on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing initial claims for unemployment benefits was nearly at a three-month low last week. A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed that factory activity in the Mid-Atlantic region rebounded in March, suggesting economic momentum could be on the upswing.\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything that had me jumping for joy, but it seems more like the smoldering, slowly improving economy,\u201d said Stephen Massocca, managing director of Wedbush Equity Management. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index gained 11.24 points or 0.6 percent, to 1,872.01. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 108.88 points or 0.67 percent, to close at 16,331.05. The Nasdaq composite index added 11.68 points or 0.27 percent, to 4,319.29.The S.&P. 500 is roughly 6 points away from its closing high, but volume has been anemic on positive market days, suggesting limited conviction behind the move. According to the latest Reuters poll of analysts, the S.&P. 500 is expected to end 2014 at 1,950, less than 5 percent above current levels.On Thursday, about 5.9 billion shares traded on the domestic stock exchanges, below the 6.7 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.Financial shares, which are tied to the pace of economic growth, were among Thursday\u2019s biggest gainers, with the S.&P.\u2019s financial sector index up 1.7 percent. JPMorgan Chase gained $1.81, or 3.1 percent, to $60.11, rising above $60 for the first time since April 2000. Citigroup advanced $1.28, or 2.6 percent, to $50.22. The stock market had come under pressure on Wednesday when Ms. Yellen indicated that the first increase in short-term interest rates could come in the first half of next year. She estimated the \u201cconsiderable period\u201d between the end of the Fed\u2019s economic stimulus campaign and its first rate increase at possibly six months. Analysts widely expected a rate increase in the second half of 2015.Mr. Massocca seemed unfazed by the possibility of an earlier rate increase. \u201cHer point is, it could be six months because if the data dictates it, they will do it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see anything in the data today that is demonstrating we have a runaway economy here.\u201d The Nasdaq\u2019s gains were limited by weakness in large-capitalization Internet stocks.

{"Headline": "Florida Election a Crash Course for Midterm Races", "Date": "2014-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADEIRA BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Pinellas County, with its off-the-clock retirees and gentle Gulf Coast beaches, cultivates a life of flip-flops and easy breathing.But with just days to go before a special election that will kick off the high-stakes battle for the control of Congress, serenity is not easy to come by for anyone with a television, mailbox or phone. Both parties and their surrogates have swooped into this laid-back House district, which was overseen by Representative C. W. Bill Young, a Republican, for four decades until his death last year, and shaken it up like a dime-store sand globe.Outside groups have dumped millions of dollars into mostly acrimonious messages meant to fire up voters and test the potency of the Affordable Care Act as an election issue. That snarling tone has rubbed off on the two major candidates, both relative moderates: Alex Sink, a Democrat and Florida\u2019s former chief financial officer, and David Jolly, a Republican, former lobbyist and former aide to Mr. Young. They have traded accusations over a wide variety of issues, including immigration reform and Social Security.The third candidate in the special election on Tuesday, Lucas Overby, a Libertarian, has mostly stayed out of the fray.The barrage of salvos and slogans, many filled with half-truths, is largely paid for by outside groups hoping to influence voters in this quintessential swing district, where independents make up a quarter of registered voters. So many nasty political advertisements, fliers and robocalls about President Obama\u2019s health care law, Social Security, lobbying and abortion rights have hit the airwaves that many voters say it feels as though a presidential election somehow sneaked up on them. More than 105,000 residents have already submitted absentee ballots in a county that prefers early voting.\u201cI think it is way too much,\u201d said Amy Verdensky, a Republican who supports Mr. Jolly and is a board member for the Old Salt Fishing Foundation in Madeira Beach. She called the messages \u201cpropaganda\u201d and a \u201cwaste of time.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t put a whole lot of stock in anything I see in a commercial,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone is bashing each other.\u201dThe intensity of the ad wars is a testament to the importance that both parties are placing on a victory in this tight race. Even if the bragging rights outweigh the tangible impacts of one congressional race, the two sides see the contest as a potential harbinger, particularly on the health care law. The stakes are particularly high for Democrats, who are on the defensive nationwide over the issue, and who put forward a strong candidate in Ms. Sink, an early favorite in this race. The district, which includes Clearwater and most of St. Petersburg, is 87 percent white and has a high proportion of older voters.Dodging the blizzard of political messages is no longer an option. One moment, a flier pillories Ms. Sink as \u201cnot one of us\u201d and a narrator on television calls her a lackey for President Obama and his health care law, which will lead to \u201ccanceled health plans, higher premiums, Medicare cuts,\u201d according to an ad from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.The next moment, an ad from a Democratic political action committee shows an office in Washington, where \u201cDavid Jolly lobbied for a special interest that wanted to privatize Social Security,\u201d and adds that he \u201cstill says privatization should be on the table.\u201dNeither position is wholly accurate. Ms. Sink, 65, supports the Affordable Care Act but has said she would work to fix it rather than repeal it. And Mr. Jolly, 41, said that while he and his firm, Three Bridges Advisors, lobbied in 2009 for Free Enterprise Nation, a group dedicated to controlling \u201cunsustainable\u201d government spending, he did not lobby on that issue. The group\u2019s chief executive, James MacDougald, a businessman, is a strong advocate for privatizing Social Security and co-chairman of Mr. Jolly\u2019s finance team. Mr. Jolly said the program should remain untouched for workers who have paid in at least 10 years but must be re-evaluated for the rest, with all options on the table, including allowing private accounts.So far, conservative groups have outspent liberals in an attempt to blunt Ms. Sink\u2019s considerable fund-raising advantage, spending $5 million on ads that oppose her, compared with $3,7 million by liberal groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the past six weeks, Ms. Sink has raised $1.3 million, a prodigious sum for a special election and double the amount raised by Mr. Jolly.Mr. Jolly\u2019s lackluster fund-raising and at times uncertain campaign \u2014 he was not the first choice of party leaders looking for a candidate to take on Ms. Sink \u2014 have left some Republicans nervous about his chances. Still, polls show that the race has tightened. Ms. Sink, a former bank executive, was narrowly ahead, but Republicans usually turn out in higher numbers for special elections, something that Ms. Sink has tried to diminish with an intense absentee and early-voting effort.Ms. Sink, who lost the governor\u2019s race in 2010 to Gov. Rick Scott by one percentage point, is well known throughout the state. And while her moderate stances and business background are a boon in the district, her low-key nature does not tend to rev up a room. Still, many see her as genuine, and she has made efforts to reach out to older voters.\u201cShe has the brains and the integrity,\u201d said Helen Emrick, 89, part of a group that gathered to support Ms. Sink at the Palms of Largo, an independent- and assisted-living center. \u201cJolly has the charisma and the good looks,\u201d Ms. Emrick added, but \u201che\u2019s a politician. She\u2019s a real person.\u201dAs Ms. Sink mingled with residents at the center, complimenting one woman\u2019s jacket and thanking another for her support, she emphasized her traditional upbringing on a farm in North Carolina. Then, with her twang, she homed in on Social Security.\u201cSocial Security is not an entitlement program,\u201d Ms. Sink told the senior citizens, a group she is assiduously wooing. \u201cWe earned it. We paid into it.\u201dNot too far away, on Madeira Beach, Mr. Jolly squinted into the sun on a dock with charter fishermen looking on and argued for less fisheries regulation. \u201cThis is about protecting the quality of life in Pinellas and growing our economy,\u201d he said.Mr. Jolly, who had been a senior aide to Mr. Young, is campaigning heavily as Mr. Young\u2019s natural successor. His smooth style and grasp of the issues have helped bolster his standing in the polls.\u201cHe\u2019s articulate, he\u2019s smart and runs a great campaign,\u201d said Fred Piccolo Jr., a Republican political consultant who grew up in the district. \u201cHis Achilles\u2019 heel is that he was lobbying for as long as he was.\u201dBut Mr. Jolly has shifted to the right on some issues, a potential problem in this moderate district, political analysts said. During one debate, he said he would advocate the repeal of Roe v. Wade. Questioned about Syria, he responded that Mr. Obama should have intervened, a contentious position in an area with so many veterans.\u201cIt surprised a lot of people how conservative Jolly went in the debates, and it gave Sink an opening,\u201d Mr. Piccolo said.For the most part, though, Mr. Jolly and Republicans have focused on the Affordable Care Act, with few other issues gaining as much traction against Ms. Sink, Mr. Piccolo said. Mr. Jolly\u2019s depiction of Ms. Sink as a carpetbagger may have done some damage, too; Ms. Sink moved to Pinellas from a neighboring county several months ago. Questions have also been raised about the depth of Mr. Jolly\u2019s ties to the district.Although not nearly as visible, Mr. Overby, 27, the Libertarian candidate, may pose problems for both Ms. Sink and Mr. Jolly. A commercial diving supervisor, he could lure enough discontented voters away to make a difference.\u201cHe a candidate of the future for young people,\u201d said Susan MacManus, a professor of political science at the University of South Florida. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know how much he is going to drain off.\u201dNo matter who wins, there will be little time to celebrate. The next election is eight months away.\u201cThis is the warm-up,\u201d said David Beattie, a Democratic pollster. \u201cWhoever wins is going right back in, whether it\u2019s the same opponent or not.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Costs, Benefits and Masterpieces in Detroit", "Date": "2014-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewMost of the paintings on my walls are by artists I know personally. And although some of these works are hauntingly beautiful, they wouldn\u2019t command much on the open market.But the prices fetched by famous artists have spiked sharply in recent decades. That is not because their paintings have become any better. Rather, it\u2019s that these works have become trophies in bidding wars among the superrich.With Detroit\u2019s sense of history and civic pride on the line, how much should its boosters be willing to pony up? It\u2019s an emotionally charged question, and few people would want the institute\u2019s art to leave the city. Yet officials cannot responsibly ignore the costs and the benefits of the choices ahead.One way to think about the decision is to imagine Detroit as a new municipality about to build a museum stocked and operated at taxpayer expense. Which paintings should it display?Perhaps the most important principle of economics is that an action should be taken only if its benefit, broadly construed, exceeds its cost. This principle counsels that a painting should be displayed if the resulting gains \u2014 primarily, the pleasure that museum visitors take in seeing it, in addition to any indirect benefits, like those for civic pride and tourism \u2014 add up to more than the corresponding costs.Some people say that because it\u2019s so hard to put a dollar figure on such benefits, this principle is of little practical use in Detroit. But the benefits must be substantial \u2014 how else to explain the extraordinary efforts of private donors to save the collection?A tidy sum, as it turns out. According to Christie\u2019s, this canvas alone could fetch up to $200 million. Once interest rates return to normal levels \u2014 say, 6 percent \u2014 the forgone interest on that amount would be approximately $12 million a year.If we assume that the museum would be open 2,000 hours a year, and ignore the cost of gallery space and other indirect expenses, the cost of keeping the painting on display would be more than $6,000 an hour. Assuming that an average of five people would view it per hour, all year long, it would still cost more than $1,200 an hour to provide the experience for each visitor.Notwithstanding the crudeness of these approximations, we can say that even a very wealthy taxpayer would be reluctant to pay anything close to $1,200 an hour for the privilege of viewing this painting. And that suggests that most taxpayers think the same money could deliver much greater value if spent in other ways. Of course, the painting might still justify its cost if other indirect benefits were large enough.Yet the point remains that prices affect the options we face. Relative to famous art, lesser-known works have become much cheaper in recent years, despite no evidence of any decline in their quality. In a rational world, this change would encourage curators to invest more heavily in emerging artists.Many of these artists produce works that are deeply affecting, yet surprisingly affordable. Talented curators could assemble collections of their art that would delight visitors and draw fulsome praise from critics. And as those works became better known, their value would climb rapidly.Ownership by public or nonprofit institutions is also not a prerequisite for public exhibition of prized art. The superrich pay so much for these works largely because they are already so famous. Yet being chosen for prominent display in public spaces was how many of these works became famous in the first place. If fewer museums owned them, the rich would have good reason to lend them more often for public display, as indeed many already do, thus preserving and enhancing their value. If sold, many of the institute\u2019s famous works would return as loaners, along with such works from other collections.If billionaires choose to bid up the prices of trophy art, that\u2019s their privilege. And because most of them will die with large fortunes unspent, they can buy what they want without having to buy less of other things they value. But because money for worthy public purposes is chronically in short supply, city officials and true philanthropists must grapple with agonizing trade-offs.Yes, communities benefit from famous paintings, but they also benefit from safer roads and better schools.ROBERT H. FRANK is an economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University. Advertisement"}

The number of competitors is proliferating, as entrepreneurial shops and big car companies alike seek profits from the world\u2019s wealthiest people.A case in point is McLaren Automotive, a sister company of the British Formula One racecar builder. The automaker said at the Geneva show that it made its first profit in 2013. That is just three years after it began selling its debut model, a turbocharged V8 with a lightweight carbon fiber body that can hit 60 miles per hour in three seconds. Starting price: about $275,000.\u201cThe market is getting more crowded,\u201d Mike Flewitt, chief executive of McLaren Automotive, said as the company\u2019s newest model, the $360,000 650S, rotated slowly on a display stand a few feet away. \u201cBut the world is growing.\u201dAnyone looking for more evidence of the growing economic divide can find it in the market for ultraperformance cars. An Italian plumber these days probably has trouble getting a loan to buy a new utility van. But there is no shortage of wealthy buyers lining up for Italian-made Ferraris or Lamborghinis. And they tend to pay cash.As a result, mass-market carmakers like Fiat Chrysler, which owns Ferrari, and the Volkswagen Group, which owns Lamborghini, are getting much of their profit from high-end vehicles. Fiat earned a 14 percent profit margin on its luxury vehicles, which include Maserati, while the mass-market cars earned a 5 percent margin in the United States and lost money in Europe.Demand for Ferraris is so strong that Luca di Montezemolo, the company\u2019s chairman, said he had set a production limit for the sports cars to fewer than 7,000 a year. Otherwise, apparently, they might become so commonplace in the country club parking lot that they would lose their cachet.Ferrari reported a net profit of 246 million euros, or $342 million, for 2013, an increase of 5.4 percent. That sum amounted to 27 percent of the profit of its parent company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, even though the number of Ferraris was a tiny percentage of the 4.4 million vehicles sold by the group.In an interview in Geneva, Mr. di Montezemolo noted the contrast with the early 1990s, when he first took charge of Ferrari. Back then, exotic sports cars were regarded as an endangered species, too temperamental for all but the most dedicated car buffs.\u201cI vowed I would not be the last of the Mohicans,\u201d Mr. di Montezemolo said in an interview.If anything, the tribes are now proliferating.Besides the specialty sports car makers like McLaren, large companies like Daimler have been moving up the luxury ladder. In Geneva, Daimler revealed a coupe version of its top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benz S-Class, whose options will include headlights inlaid with Swarovski crystals. Daimler has not yet named a price for the coupe, which will reach dealers later this year. But it is expected to be in the range of \u20ac150,000, or about $200,000.As recent surveys have shown, wealthy people have become even wealthier in the last year, fueling demand for automotive extravagance. And the world\u2019s richest people are no longer found almost exclusively in the United States, Europe and a few oil-producing countries. They may also be entrepreneurs in Shanghai or Russian oligarchs.\u201cTwenty years ago none of us would have thought of selling cars in China,\u201d Mr. Flewitt of McLaren said.So far, turmoil in countries like Ukraine and Turkey has not hampered sales much, car executives said.Volkswagen may be best known for its practical Passat or Golf models, but it also owns Bugatti \u2014 special editions of which can cost $3 million. VW\u2019s stable of expensive breeds also includes Porsche and Bentley.Lamborghini displayed the Hurac\u00e1n in Geneva, successor to the company\u2019s Gallardo. Lamborghini said it already had buyers for all 700 Hurac\u00e1ns it has on offer, even though the car costs about $275,000, compared with a mere $180,000 for the Gallardo.Audi, another Volkswagen unit, is also in the supercar business. It is building an update of its R8, which can accelerate to 60 m.p.h. in 3.6 seconds. The new version, available next year, will cost about \u20ac200,000 with options. About 1,000 customers have already placed orders and put down deposits, Rupert Stadler, the chief executive of Audi, said in an interview in Geneva.The expanding portfolio of cars costing hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars raises the question of whether the market is at risk of becoming saturated. Not all sports car makers have thrived recently. Aston Martin, James Bond\u2019s ride, in October reported a pretax loss of 24.6 million pounds, about $41 million, for 2012 year after a \u00a321.2 million loss in 2011. In February, Aston Martin was forced to recall 17,590 vehicles after discovering a Chinese supplier had used counterfeit plastic material.Bernhard Maier, a member of the management board of Porsche who is in charge of sales and marketing, said that the company, based in Stuttgart, Germany, counted about five main competitors back in 2000. By 2010 the number had doubled, he said, and has probably continued to increase.One reason that high-end sports cars are selling well is that the carmakers have introduced models designed to appeal to a broader segment of the superwealthy, not just purists and aficionados.In contrast to the finicky, uncomfortable models of several decades ago, modern sports cars are more reliable, and many offer creature comforts like well-upholstered seats and sound systems. The Ferrari California, for example, is designed to be a vehicle that a Hollywood agent can use for the daily commute.Another trend is to give high-end sports cars at least the appearance of being more environmentally friendly. Mr. Flewitt of McLaren attributed some of the success of its cars to their relatively good fuel economy. According to the company, the 650S \u2014 so named because of its 650-horsepower engine by European ratings \u2014 estimates that it will get 24 miles to the gallon in a combination of city and highway driving. That is thrifty by sports car standards.In Geneva, Porsche introduced a hybrid racecar, the 919, which it will use to return to competition in the F.I.A. World Endurance Championship, the racing series that includes the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Porsche has been absent from the series for 16 years. The 919 has an electric motor to drive the front wheels and, according to Mr. Maier, recovers energy underway with a fan that generates electricity from the exhaust. Porsche says such fuel-saving innovations will eventually find their way to production vehicles.The track at Le Mans on June 14 will be something of a metaphor for the ever more crowded market for sports supercars. Porsche will even be competing against Audi, its cousin within the Volkswagen Group.Asked if the internal rivalry leads to any boardroom backstabbing, Luca de Meo, an Audi board member responsible for sales and marketing, said with a laugh, \u201cNot in the back \u2014 in the front.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Home Prices in China May Hurt Families", "Date": "2014-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s banks may not be directly exposed to losses from the country\u2019s soaring housing prices, but any slump in those prices could set off widespread public anger, data from a broad new survey of household finances indicates.The survey \u2014 the largest academic study of personal finances in China, with 99,000 individuals in 28,000 households interviewed late last summer \u2014 found that Chinese families have put their savings overwhelmingly into their houses. A combination of large down payments and soaring prices means that even if housing prices were cut in half, only 5 percent of homes would be worth less than the remaining balance on their mortgages, the survey found.But the survey, conducted by Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu, China, also found that Chinese households have an inordinate share of their total assets in their homes, with very little diversification into stocks, bonds and other assets. Housing prices have been soaring for more than a decade in China, up as much as twentyfold in smaller towns that have been suddenly connected to big cities by high-speed rail lines, and up significantly in large cities as well.If housing prices fall, \u201cthey\u2019ll not get just a little angry, they\u2019ll get tremendously angry,\u201d said Li Gan, an economics professor at Texas A&M University who oversaw the study.Share prices fell 4.5 percent in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets last Monday and Tuesday before stabilizing at a lower level after the government announced that housing prices were rising more slowly, after years of double-digit percentage increases. The government has been trying to slow the rise in real estate prices through measures that include forcing banks to require down payments of 30 percent or more for the first home purchased, and even more money \u2014 or no mortgages at all \u2014 for subsequent homes.When property developers in Hangzhou tried a week ago to cut prices to reduce their large inventories of unsold apartments, earlier buyers who had paid more protested, demanding that the price cuts be rescinded, according to the state media. Some signs have also emerged that construction, which accounts for nearly one-fifth of China\u2019s economic output, is starting to slow.In another sign of weakness in the Chinese economy, the government\u2019s monthly survey of purchasing managers in manufacturing, released on Saturday, showed that sentiment in February was the weakest in eight months. The index dropped to 50.2, from 50.5 in January. A reading of 50 indicates expansion, while a lower reading indicates contraction in manufacturing.Analysts have cautioned that although banks may have limited their direct exposure to household mortgages, the banking system has huge loans outstanding to property developers, construction companies and construction suppliers, like steel mills. Steel prices have been drifting down since last summer, an indication that demand may be faltering.Households across the country have 66 percent of their assets in their homes, and in Beijing the figure is now 84 percent, the study from Southwestern University found. The comparable figure for the United States is about 41 percent.Wealthy families in China often diversify into other assets, like shares of privately held companies, preventing the proportion of assets in housing from appearing to be even higher. But the middle class has put almost all of its money into homes, Mr. Gan said.The study found that 87 percent of city dwellers already own their homes, which appears to be limiting the number of first-time home buyers left to hold up prices. The survey also found signs that urbanization may be slowing, as the young and the educated have already moved from rural areas to cities in extremely large numbers.Financing for the survey came from Southwestern University and the state-controlled Agricultural Bank of China. But Mr. Gan said that the survey had been done with complete independence, following the latest statistical practices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Currency Market Cautious on Renminbi Policy Change", "Date": "2014-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The renminbi eased against the dollar on Monday, after the Chinese central bank doubled the currency\u2019s daily trading band as part of its commitment to let markets play a greater role in the economy.Yet the Chinese currency moved in a relatively narrow range reflecting market views that the People\u2019s Bank of China would seek to limit currency swings as markets fret about the cooling of growth in China and the quality of corporate debt.In the long run, however, the central bank is expected to allow the currency to move in a broader range in a sign of its confidence that it can keep speculators at bay and that the economy is mature enough to handle greater uncertainty about the exchange rate.On Saturday, the People\u2019s Bank of China doubled the renminbi\u2019s daily trading range, so that it can now rise or fall 2 percent around the daily midpoint rate. By early evening in Asia, the renminbi was trading about 0.75 percent weaker than the daily parity rate of 6.1321 renminbi to the dollar.Since the start of this year the renminbi has lost 1.8 percent against the dollar, largely as a result of the central bank\u2019s efforts, reversing much of a nearly 3 percent rise last year as Beijing sought to change the perception that the renminbi was a safe one-way appreciation bet.Beijing\u2019s efforts to clamp down on such trades, combined with concerns about China\u2019s economic health, are expected to keep the renminbi weak in coming weeks.Earlier this month, a Chinese company became the first to default on a corporate bond, and concerns about economic growth were highlighted by an 18 percent fall in exports in February and sluggish manufacturing.\u201cGiven China\u2019s recent relatively weak export performance, we see little upside for the yuan this coming year,\u201d said Tao Wang, an economist at UBS in Hong Kong, using another term for the renminbi. The Bank of International Settlements data underscores that point, showing the renminbi at a record high against a basket of currencies of China\u2019s trading partners adjusted for inflation.Futures markets are implying a drop of nearly 1 percent over the next 12 months after a drop of half a percent in December.But China will be careful to temper expectations of more renminbi weakness to prevent capital outflows at a time when the economy is facing difficulties.A series of weak economic surveys made some economists predict that Beijing will struggle to meet its 7.5 percent growth target this year, which it itself would be already the weakest in 24 years.China\u2019s new leadership has signaled greater tolerance for more pedestrian growth as the necessary price for its intended rebalancing away from rapid investment- and export-driven expansion towards more sustained development.Giving markets more leeway in setting the exchange rate is part of a broad overhaul plan by the Chinese government that also includes freeing up interest rates, allowing private investment in protected sectors and cutting red tape. But Beijing has also made clear it was ready to act if the economy lost traction too quickly to preserve economic and social stability.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Minnesota Makes Do Without a Civil War Battlefield", "Date": "2014-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMuseums Special SectionST. PAUL \u2014 THE Civil War seems a long way from St. Paul: 1,100 miles to Manassas; 1,000 miles to Gettysburg. Even the nearest battlefields, in Missouri, are hundreds of miles away.So if you\u2019re the Minnesota Historical Society, how do you give the ever-popular subject of the war a local twist in your offerings \u2014 particularly during the war\u2019s 150th anniversary, which is being marked with museum exhibits around the country on almost every conceivable aspect?Danielle Dart, a public programs specialist with the society, which is based in St. Paul, came up with this idea: Instead of examining the brave deeds of Minnesotan soldiers during the war (already the focus of an exhibit in the spring of 2013), talk about what happened when they returned home.Last summer, \u201cSt. Paul After the Civil War,\u201d led by Ms. Dart, joined a lineup of existing tours, or crawls, as the society calls them. While it might not be quite as popular as the pub and food crawls that allow participants to eat and drink their way through the history of the city, the Civil War tour was a success, and it will be offered again this summer. Using a 28-passenger, air-conditioned bus, with Ms. Dart narrating, the three-hour tour, which cost $45, including lunch, was a near sellout all six times it was offered.\u201cWe wanted to do something Civil War-related, but we knew there were no battles in St. Paul,\u201d said Ms. Dart, 47, who has been running tours for the society since 2007. \u201cSo we thought about what happened to these men when they came home from the fighting.\u201dMinnesota became a state only in 1858 \u2014 three years before the war began. \u201cThis was our debut on the national stage,\u201d Ms. Dart says. \u201cMinnesota went big for Lincoln in 1860.\u201d The state\u2019s governor, Alexander Ramsey, was in Washington when Fort Sumter was fired upon. He immediately offered President Lincoln 1,000 volunteers \u2014 supposedly securing the state\u2019s position as the first to officially offer a volunteer regiment to the Union cause, a point of pride to Minnesotans to this day.The starting point for the tour is Fort Snelling, built in 1819 on the banks of the Mississippi and now a historic site operated by the society.The fort is famous for its role in the Dakota War or Sioux Uprising of 1862, but it is also \u201cthe Civil War portal for Minnesota,\u201d says Matt Cassady, a program specialist at Fort Snelling, who welcomed a reporter retracing the tour route with Ms. Dart last autumn. \u201cFor 25,000 of these men, this is where it started, and for those who survived, this is where it ended.\u201d About 20,000 Minnesotans returned; 2,500 of them were grievously wounded, most with missing limbs.Here on the exposed parade ground and drafty barracks of Fort Snelling is where adjustment to civilian life began. \u201cMen would form up, get their last pay and then sit and wait for the paperwork to be drawn up,\u201d Ms. Dart said. Once discharged, \u201cthey were on their own.\u201dMost would amble up Fort Road, now West Seventh Street, which the tour takes back into the city. In 1865, St. Paul was barely 25 years old, and while the economy of the river town had boomed in the war, to most Americans it might as well have been a colony on the moon.\u201cBefore the war, Minnesota is seen as this remote, far-off place, this outpost on the edge of the American empire,\u201d says historian Mary Lethert Wingerd of St. Cloud State University. \u201cI think what the Civil War does do, at least for people here, is to substantiate Minnesota\u2019s place as part of the nation.\u201dWhile such overarching themes are interesting to ponder, they are hard to build a tour around. Ms. Dart instead decided she would focus on half a dozen men whose stories she researched in the society\u2019s archives, on websites, in census records and in old city directories.We meet, for example, Albert Siebers, a 19-year-old teamster from Minneapolis. Seriously wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg, he returned to Minnesota for a year, then went off to become a cowboy in California. He died in 1907, at age 64, in an accident while part of a construction crew on the Roosevelt Dam in Arizona.\u201cSome of these men were very peripatetic, very restless after the war,\u201d Ms. Dart says.The tour arrives in St. Paul\u2019s West End, one of the city\u2019s oldest neighborhoods. Ms. Dart points out 262 Banfil Street, a blue, two-story Greek-revival house with a white front porch. This was once the home of Henning von Minden, a cavalry officer. Ms. Dart learned from her research that about 10 other German immigrants like Mr. von Minden lived within blocks of this house and volunteered for the Union army as well. As was common in other parts of the country, they very likely enlisted together in a surge of patriotism for their new country.The West End is also where many of the veterans settled. \u201cThis would have been a middle-class neighborhood,\u201d Ms. Dart said. \u201cThey had gas lighting not long after the war, and sidewalks.\u201dSuddenly the Civil War doesn\u2019t seem quite so remote.\u201cThere\u2019s something compelling about saying \u2018this is where that man lived,\u2019\u00a0\u201d says Charles F. Bryan Jr., former president and chief executive of the Virginia Historical Society, and now a consultant who has been involved with many Civil War-related programs. \u201cIt\u2019s a very creative way to organize a tour like this.\u201dNot all of the men we meet are heroes. Ms. Dart pulls up in front of 256 Goodrich Avenue.The home is that of John Miner. A police officer after the war, he had registered for the draft in two neighboring states but never reported for duty. Other houses on the same block belonged to men who had served.\u201cImagine a veteran living next door to this guy who may have run away from the draft,\u201d she said, adding that she saw the topic as a discussion point for future tours. Ms. Dart continues her tour through the nooks and crannies of old St. Paul, ticking off the names of soldiers who lived or worked here and there or whose names adorn street signs. There are 14 streets in St. Paul named after Civil War veterans.One never accorded that honor was Alfred Gales, an escaped slave who fell in with the 3rd Minnesota in Arkansas and became the unit\u2019s cook. \u201cWhen they mustered out, he came with them,\u201d she said. \u201cHe met his wife and lived the rest of his life in St. Paul.\u201dHe also changed his name legally to Alfred Miller. \u201cI make a point of mentioning that on the tour,\u201d Ms. Dart says. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that he chose a name other than his slave name once he could.\u201dThe tour includes Oakland Cemetery, where many of the veterans are buried, and the towering Civil War memorial, the Soldiers and Sailors Monument in St. Paul, erected in 1903. The tour ends at the Minnesota Veterans\u2019 Home, originally called the Old Soldiers Home, in Minneapolis\u2019s Minnehaha State Park \u2014 a government-funded precursor to the Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals of today \u2014 where some of the veterans ended their days.Summer tours include a picniclike lunch, with food from a local 1876 cookbook.\u201cLuckily for tourgoers,\u201d Ms. Dart says, \u201clate-19th-century picnic foods are remarkably similar to our own. Chicken salad and egg salad sandwiches, fresh fruit and carrot cake.\u201d But even here, Ms. Dart seeks to make the experience as vivid as possible, regardless of the lack of a battlefield.\u201cMaybe next year,\u201d she jokes, \u201cI\u2019ll have everyone try hardtack.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Factory Activity Shrinks for Fifth Straight Month", "Date": "2014-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s manufacturing sector contracted in the first quarter of 2014, a preliminary private survey showed on Monday, raising market expectations for a government stimulus effort to reverse a slowing in economic growth.Speculation about possible stimulus helped the renminbi to rebound sharply against the dollar, in the currency\u2019s biggest daily gain in nearly 30 months.The early reading of the Markit/HSBC factory purchasing managers\u2019 index fell to an eight-month low of 48.1 in March from a final reading in February of 48.5. The index has been below the 50 level, indicating a contraction in the sector, since January.Output and new orders weakened, but new export orders grew for the first time in four months, the survey showed, suggesting the contraction has been driven primarily by weak domestic demand.\u201cUsually, for the month of March, the P.M.I. will rebound, because after Chinese New Year, there should be some activity coming back, but this P.M.I. is disappointing,\u201d said Wei Yao, China economist at the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in Hong Kong. \u201cThe government probably will have to provide some supporting measures.\u201dThe CSI 300 index of leading shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen shed all its gains after the data was released, before recovering some ground.Also Monday, the renminbi closed at 6.1888 per dollar, up 0.6 percent from Friday\u2019s close of 6.2250, the biggest jump since October 2011. It hit 6.1882 in afternoon trade. The Chinese currency fell to a 13-month low last week with a 1.2 percent weekly loss, its biggest weekly drop, as investors fretted over the outlook of the economy.This year, a string of weak economic indicators in China has reinforced concerns about a slowdown.\u201cWe expect Beijing to launch a series of policy measures to stabilize growth,\u201d Hongbin Qu, chief China economist at HSBC, said in a note accompanying the index data. \u201cLikely options include lowering entry barriers for private investment, targeted spending on subways, air-cleaning and public housing, and guiding lending rates lower.\u201dThe Markit/HSBC index is weighted more toward smaller and private companies than the official purchasing managers\u2019 index, which contains more large and state-owned companies and has showed slight but slowing rates of growth in the first two months of this year.The final Markit/HSBC manufacturing index and the official manufacturing index for March are due on April 1.Prime Minister Li Keqiang said last week that investment and construction plans would be accelerated to ensure domestic demand expands at a stable rate.Zhiwei Zhang, chief China economist at Nomura in Hong Kong, said he expected the Chinese central bank to cut its reserve requirement ratio in the second quarter and third quarter, which would free up money for banks to lend. He added that the bank might adopt expansionary fiscal policies to keep economic growth above 7 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela\u2019s Failing State", "Date": "2014-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLos Teques, Venezuela \u2014 As I compose these words from the Ramo Verde military prison outside Caracas, I am struck by how much Venezuelans have suffered.For 15 years, the definition of \u201cintolerable\u201d in this country has declined by degrees until, to our dismay, we found ourselves with one of the highest murder rates in the Western Hemisphere, a 57 percent inflation rate and a scarcity of basic goods unprecedented outside of wartime.Our crippled economy is matched by an equally oppressive political climate. Since student protests began on Feb. 4, more than 1,500 protesters have been detained and more than 50 have reported that they were tortured while in police custody. Over 30 people, including security forces and civilians, have died in the demonstrations. What started as a peaceful march against crime on a university campus has exposed the depth of this government\u2019s criminalization of dissent.I have been in prison for more than a month. On Feb. 12, I urged Venezuelans to exercise their legal rights to protest and free speech \u2014 but to do so peacefully and without violence. Three people were shot and killed that day. An analysis of video by the news organization \u00daltimas Noticias determined that shots were fired from the direction of plainclothes military troops.In the aftermath of that protest, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro personally ordered my arrest on charges of murder, arson and terrorism. Amnesty International said the charges seemed like a \u201cpolitically motivated attempt to silence dissent.\u201d To this day, no evidence of any kind has been presented.Soon, more opposition mayors, elected by an overwhelming majority in December\u2019s elections, will join me behind bars. Last week the government arrested the mayor of San Crist\u00f3bal, where the student protests began, as well as the mayor of San Diego, who has been accused of disobeying an order to remove protesters\u2019 barricades. But we will not stay silent. Some believe that speaking out only antagonizes the ruling party \u2014 inviting Mr. Maduro to move more quickly to strip away rights \u2014 and provides a convenient distraction from the economic and social ruin that is taking place. In my view, this path is akin to a victim of abuse remaining silent for fear of inviting more punishment.More important, millions of Venezuelans do not have the luxury of playing the \u201clong game,\u201d of waiting for change that never comes.We must continue to speak, act and protest. We must never allow our nerves to become deadened to the steady abuse of rights that is taking place. And we must pursue an agenda for change.The opposition leadership has outlined a series of actions that are necessary in order to move forward.Victims of repression, abuse and torture, as well as family members of those who have died, deserve justice. Those who are responsible must resign. The pro-government paramilitary groups, or \u201ccolectivos,\u201d that have tried to silence the protests through violence and intimidation must be disarmed.All political prisoners and dissenters who were forced into exile by the government, as well as students who were jailed for protesting, must be allowed to return or be released. This should be followed by restoring impartiality to important institutions that form the backbone of civil society, including the electoral commission and the judicial system.In order to get our economy on the right footing, we need an investigation into fraud committed through our commission for currency exchange \u2014 at least $15 billion was funneled into phantom businesses and kickbacks last year, a move that has directly contributed to the inflationary spiral and severe shortages our country is experiencing.Finally, we need real engagement from the international community, particularly in Latin America. The outspoken response from human rights organizations is in sharp contrast to the shameful silence from many of Venezuela\u2019s neighbors in Latin America. The Organization of American States, which represents nations in the Western Hemisphere, has abstained from any real leadership on the current crisis of human rights and the looming specter of a failed state, even though it was formed precisely to address issues like these.To be silent is to be complicit in the downward spiral of Venezuela\u2019s political system, economy and society, not to mention in the continued misery of millions. Many current leaders in Latin America suffered similar abuses in their time and they should not be silent accomplices to the abuses of today.For Venezuelans, a change in leadership can be accomplished entirely within a constitutional and legal framework. We must advocate for human rights; freedom of expression; the right to property, housing, health and education; equality within the judicial system, and, of course, the right of protest. These are not radical goals. They are the basic building blocks of society. Leopoldo L\u00f3pez is the former mayor of the Chacao district of Caracas and the leader of the Popular Will opposition party. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the more than 30 people killed in the political demonstrations in Venezuela since Feb. 4 were protesters. That number includes security forces and civilians, not only protesters.Advertisement"}

Despite the state\u2019s image as a Big Sky bastion of low taxes, small government and libertarian values, Montana voters have a long history of electing Democrats to the Senate. In 2012, for example, Senator Jon Tester, a buzz-cut farmer, won a second term even as Montana voters swung for Mitt Romney by a nearly 14-point margin and elected a Republican businessman, Steve Daines, to his first term as the state\u2019s sole congressman.Mr. Daines is now running for the Senate. A former software firm executive who also worked in China for Procter & Gamble, he is selling himself as a counterweight to Democratic policies on health care, spending and development.Mr. Daines and his campaign have kept their distance from the conservative attacks on Mr. Walsh\u2019s time in the Montana National Guard, instead airing gauzy biographical ads that highlight his business experience and family roots in Montana. Democrats have lacerated Mr. Daines for casting votes with his Republican colleagues that precipitated the government shutdown, and supporting what they call draconian budget cuts. Supporters hoped Mr. Walsh\u2019s appointment would raise the stature of a candidate who lacks the easy name recognition of a former governor or long-serving politician. Mr. Walsh said he would devote his attention to job growth, debt reduction, veterans and privacy issues.\u201cIt was such an insider deal,\u201d said Bowen Greenwood, executive director of the Montana Republican Party. \u201cHe has so little record with the people of Montana. So few people even know him.\u201dAs the campaign intensifies, Mr. Walsh is juggling jobs as both a candidate and a new senator, simultaneously trying to introduce himself to voters and prove that he can do the job.This winter, Mr. Walsh and Mr. Tester, his fellow Democrat, went on a road show across Montana, meeting with veterans groups, Native American tribal councils, older voters and business owners.\u201cEveryone\u2019s talking to Jon, not to John,\u201d one woman said.At the end of one meeting, Ron Trahan, the chairman of the tribal council, gave Mr. Tester a framed map of the tribe\u2019s lands, apologizing that he did not have one for Mr. Walsh. They would do something for him next time, he told the new senator.While Mr. Tester, an organic wheat and barley farmer, said Mr. Walsh had \u201chit the ground running\u201d in Washington, he said voter turnout and the right message would be critical to whether Mr. Walsh won in November.Montana\u2019s economy has improved, with an energy boom along its eastern plains helping to trim unemployment to 5.3 percent. But the rollout of the health care law has further soured voters on the Obama administration.\u201cThey\u2019re going to try to make him into something he\u2019s not \u2014 he\u2019s got to fight that and overcome that,\u201d Mr. Tester said. \u201cHe\u2019s somewhat untested, but Daines is in the same boat.\u201dMr. Walsh, the son of a pipe fitter, grew up in the mining town of Butte, and was the first person in his family to graduate from college, according to his campaign biography. The way he sees it, his new Senate seat is a working job interview.\u201cIt will give the citizens of Montana an opportunity to see what kind of senator I\u2019ll continue to be,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Sulfur Rule, Tardy but Welcome", "Date": "2014-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThis is no small achievement, though it bears noting that it could have been reached earlier were it not for the timidity of Mr. Obama\u2019s political advisers and the Office of Management and Budget. The Environmental Protection Agency had a similar proposal ready to go in December 2011 but was told by the White House to wait until after the 2012 elections to submit it for review. The oil companies were claiming that the rule would raise fuel prices by 9 cents a gallon, and the administration was loath to give Republicans, who had already turned rising gas prices into a campaign issue, another weapon to attack them with. Those claims were bogus then and remain so now. The E.P.A. estimates that the rule will raise gasoline prices by less than a penny a gallon and add about $75 to the sticker price of a car, leading to an annual cost of $1.5 billion in 2030. In exchange, the agency says, the rule will yield $6.7 billion to $19 billion in annual economic benefits, mainly by lowering health care costs. Looking ahead, the administration faces tough and complex decisions involving greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Its decision to proceed with the sulfur rule, however tardy, bodes well.

Gross domestic product was estimated to have grown at an annual rate of 2.4 percent in the quarter, the Commerce Department said. That was below estimates and down sharply both from its estimate last month of 3.2 percent and the 4.1 percent rate in the third quarter.

{"Headline": "Arundhati Roy, the Not-So-Reluctant Renegade", "Date": "2014-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI\u2019ve always been slightly short with people who say, \u2018You haven\u2019t written anything again,\u2019 as if all the nonfiction I\u2019ve written is not writing,\u201d Arundhati Roy said.It was July, and we were sitting in Roy\u2019s living room, the windows closed against the heat of the Delhi summer. Delhi might be roiled over a slowing economy, rising crimes against women and the coming elections, but in Jor Bagh, an upscale residential area across from the 16th-century tombs of the Lodi Gardens, things were quiet. Roy\u2019s dog, Filthy, a stray, slept on the floor, her belly rising and falling rhythmically. The melancholy cry of a bird pierced the air. \u201cThat\u2019s a hornbill,\u201d Roy said, looking reflective.Roy, perhaps best known for \u201cThe God of Small Things,\u201d her novel about relationships that cross lines of caste, class and religion, one of which leads to murder while another culminates in incest, had only recently turned again to fiction. It was another novel, but she was keeping the subject secret for now. She was still trying to shake herself free of her nearly two-decade-long role as an activist and public intellectual and spoke, with some reluctance, of one \u201clast commitment.\u201d It was more daring than her attacks on India\u2019s occupation of Kashmir, the American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan or crony capitalism. This time, she had taken on Mahatma Gandhi.She\u2019d been asked by a small Indian press, Navayana, to write an introduction to a new edition of \u201cThe Annihilation of Caste.\u201d Written in 1936 by B. R. Ambedkar, the progressive leader who drafted the Indian Constitution and converted to Buddhism, the essay is perhaps the most famous modern-day attack on India\u2019s caste system. It includes a rebuke of Gandhi, who wanted to abolish untouchability but not caste. Ambedkar saw the entire caste system as morally wrong and undemocratic. Reading Ambedkar\u2019s and Gandhi\u2019s arguments with each other, Roy became increasingly dismayed with what she saw as Gandhi\u2019s regressive position. Her small introductory essay grew larger in her mind, \u201calmost a little book in itself.\u201d It would not pull its punches when it came to Gandhi and therefore would likely prove controversial. Even Ambedkar ran into difficulties. His views were considered so provocative that he was forced to self-publish. The more she spoke of it, the more mired in complications this last commitment of hers seemed.Roy led me into the next room, where books and journals were scattered around the kitchen table that serves as her desk. The collected writings of Ambedkar and Gandhi, voluminous and in combat with each other, sat in towering stacks, bookmarks tucked between the pages. The notebook in which Roy had been jotting down her thoughts in small, precise handwriting lay open on the table, a fragile intermediary in a nearly century-old debate between giants.\u201cI got into trouble in the past for my nonfiction,\u201d Roy said, \u201cand I swore, \u2018I\u2019m never going to write anything with a footnote again.\u2019 \u201d It\u2019s a promise she has so far been unable to keep. \u201cI\u2019ve been gathering the thoughts for months, struggling with the questions, shocked by what I\u2019ve been reading,\u201d she said, when I asked if she had begun the essay. \u201cI know that when it comes out, a lot is going to happen. But it\u2019s something I need to do.\u201dRoy\u2019s tenure as a national icon came to an abrupt end when, a year later, the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (B.J.P.) government carried out a series of nuclear tests. These were widely applauded by Indians who identified with Hindu nationalism, many of them members of the rising middle class. In an essay titled, \u201cThe End of Imagination,\u201d Roy accused supporters of the tests of reveling in displays of military power \u2014 embracing the jingoism that had brought the B.J.P. to power for only the second time since independence \u2014 instead of addressing the abysmal conditions in which a majority of Indians lived. Published simultaneously in the English-language magazines Outlook and Frontline, the essay marked her beginning as an overtly political writer.Roy\u2019s political turn angered many in her upper-caste, urban, English-speaking audience, even as it attracted another. Most of her new fans had never heard of her novel; they often spoke languages other than English and felt marginalized because of their religion, caste or ethnicity, left behind by India\u2019s economic rise. They devoured the essays Roy began writing, which were distributed in unauthorized translations, and flocked to rallies to hear her speak. \u201cThere was all this resentment, quite understandable, about \u2018The God of Small Things,\u2019 that here was this person writing in English winning all this money,\u201d Roy said. \u201cSo when \u2018The End of Imagination\u2019 came out, there was a reversal, an anger among the English-speaking people, but also an embrace from everyone else.\u201dThe vehemence of the response surprised her. \u201cThere is nothing in \u2018The God of Small Things\u2019 that is at odds with what I went on to write politically over 15 years,\u201d Roy said. \u201cIt\u2019s instinctive territory.\u201d It is true that her novel also explored questions of social justice. But without the armature of character and plot, her essays seemed didactic \u2014 or just plain wrong \u2014 to her detractors, easy stabs at an India full of energy and purpose. Even those who sympathized with her views were often suspicious of her celebrity, regarding her as a dilettante. But for Roy, remaining on the sidelines was never an option. \u201cIf I had not said anything about the nuclear tests, it would have been as if I was celebrating it,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI was on the covers of all these magazines all the time. Not saying anything became as political as saying something.\u201dRoy turned next to a series of mega-dams to be built on the Narmada River. Villagers likely to be displaced by the project had been staging protests, even as India\u2019s Supreme Court allowed construction to go forward. Roy traveled through the region, joining in the protests and writing essays criticizing the court\u2019s decision. In 2001, a group of men accused her and other activists of attacking them at a rally outside the Supreme Court. Roy petitioned for the charges to be dismissed. The court agreed but was so offended by the language of her petition (she accused the court of attempting to \u201cmuzzle dissent, to harass and intimidate those who disagree with it\u201d) that it held her in contempt. \u201cShowing the magnanimity of law by keeping in mind that the respondent is a woman,\u201d the judgment read, \u201cand hoping that better sense and wisdom shall dawn upon the respondent in the future to serve the cause of art and literature,\u201d Roy was to be sentenced to \u201csimple imprisonment for one day\u201d and a fine of 2,000 rupees.The 2002 BBC documentary \u201cDam/Age\u201d captures some of the drama around Roy\u2019s imprisonment at the fortresslike Tihar Jail. When she emerged the next day, her transformation from Indian icon to harsh national critic was complete. Her hair, which she had shorn into a severe cut, evoked, uneasily, both ostracized woman and feisty feminist. The English-language Indian media mocked Roy for criticizing the dams, which they saw as further evidence of India\u2019s rise. Attacks followed each of her subsequent works: her anguished denunciations of the massacre of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002, the plans for bauxite mining in Orissa (now Odisha) by a London-based corporation called Vedanta Resources, the paramilitary operations in central India against indigenous tribal populations and ultraleft guerrillas known as Naxalites; and India\u2019s military presence in Kashmir, where more than a half million troops hold in check a majority Muslim population that wants to secede from India.Kashmir, over which India has fought three of its four wars against Pakistan, would become one of Roy\u2019s defining issues. In 2010, after a series of massive protests during which teenage boys faced off against soldiers, Roy publicly remarked that \u201cKashmir was never an integral part of India.\u201d In suggesting that the state of India was a mere construct, a product of partition like Pakistan, she had crossed a line. Most progressives in India haven\u2019t gone that far. Roy soon found herself the center of a nationwide storm. A stone-throwing mob, trailed by television vans, showed up at her front door. The conservative TV channel Times Now ran slow-motion clips of her visiting Kashmir in which she looked as if she were sashaying down a catwalk, refusing to answer a reporter\u2019s questions. Back in Delhi, Times Now convened a panel moderated by its immensely popular host, Arnab Goswami, to discuss \u2014 squeezed between headlines and a news crawl in which \u201canger\u201d and \u201cArundhati\u201d were the most common words \u2014 whether Roy should be arrested for sedition. When the sole Kashmiri Muslim panelist, Hameeda Nayeem, pointed out that Roy had said nothing not already believed by a majority of Kashmiris, she was cut off by Goswami. Cases were filed against Roy in courts in Bangalore and Chandigarh, accusing her of being \u201cantinational,\u201d \u201canti-human\u201d and supposedly writing in one of her essays that \u201cKashmir should get freedom from naked, starving Indians.\u201dRoy was born Suzanna Arundhati Roy in 1959 in Shillong, a small hill town in the northeastern fringes of India. Her mother, Mary, was from a close-knit community of Syrian Christians in Kerala. Her father, Rajib, was a Bengali Hindu from Calcutta, a manager of a tea plantation near Shillong and an alcoholic. The marriage didn\u2019t last long, and when Roy was 2, she and her brother, Lalith, a year and a half older, returned to Kerala with their mother. Unwelcome at the family home, they moved into a cottage owned by Roy\u2019s maternal grandfather in Ooty, in the neighboring state of Tamil Nadu.\u201cThen there are a lot of horrible stories,\u201d Roy said and began to laugh. \u201cMy mother was very ill, a severe asthmatic. We thought she was dying. She would send us into town with a basket, and the shopkeepers would put food in the basket, mostly just rice with green chilies.\u201d The family remained there until Roy was 5, defying attempts by her grandmother and uncle to turn them out of the house (inheritance laws among Syrian Christians heavily favored sons). Eventually, Roy\u2019s mother moved back to Kerala and started a school on the premises of the local Rotary Club.As the child of a single mother, Roy was ill at ease in the conservative Syrian Christian community. She felt more at home among the so-called lower castes or Dalits, who were kept at a distance by both Christians and upper-caste Hindus.\u201cMuch of the way I think is by default,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody paid enough attention to me to indoctrinate me.\u201d By the time she was sent to Lawrence, a boarding school founded by a British Army officer (motto: \u201cNever Give In\u201d), it was perhaps too late for indoctrination. Roy, who was 10, says the only thing she remembers about Lawrence was becoming obsessed with running. Her brother, who heads a seafood-export business in Kerala, recalls her time there differently. \u201cWhen she was in middle school, she was quite popular among the senior boys,\u201d he told me, laughing. \u201cShe was also a prefect and a tremendous debater.\u201dRoy concedes that boarding school had its uses. \u201cIt made it easier to light out when I did,\u201d she said. The child of what was considered a disreputable marriage and an even more disgraceful divorce, Roy was expected to have suitably modest ambitions. Her future prospects were summed up by the first college she was placed in; it was run by nuns and offered secretarial training. At 16, Roy instead moved to Delhi to study at the School of Planning and Architecture.Roy chose architecture because it would allow her to start earning money in her second year, but also out of idealism. In Kerala, she met the British-born Indian architect Laurie Baker, known for his sustainable, low-cost buildings, and was taken with the idea of doing similar work. But she soon realized she wouldn\u2019t learn about such things at school. \u201cThey just wanted you to be like a contractor,\u201d Roy said, still indignant. She was grappling, she said, with questions to which her professors didn\u2019t seem to have answers: \u201cWhat is your sense of aesthetic? Whom are you designing for? Even if you\u2019re designing a home, what is the relationship between men and women assumed in that? It just became bigger and bigger. How are cities organized? Who are laws for? Who is considered a citizen? This coalesced into something very political for me by the end of it.\u201dFor her final project, Roy refused to design a building and instead wrote a thesis, \u201cPostcolonial Urban Development in Delhi.\u201d \u201cI said: \u2018Now I want to tell you what I\u2019ve learned here. I don\u2019t want you to tell me what I\u2019ve learned here.\u2019 \u201d Roy drew sustenance from the counterculture that existed among her fellow students, which she would represent years later in the film \u201cIn Which Annie Gives It Those Ones\u201d (1989). She wrote, designed and appeared in it \u2014 an elfin figure with a giant Afro playing the character of Radha, who gives up architecture to become a writer but drowns before completing her first novel.By this time, Roy had broken off contact with her family. Without money to stay in the student hostel, she moved into a nearby slum with her boyfriend, Gerard da Cunha. (They pretended to be married in deference to the slum\u2019s conservative mores.) \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to be a young person who decides to slum it,\u201d Roy said. \u201cFor me, it wasn\u2019t like that. There was nobody. There was no cuteness about it. That was my university, that period when you think from the point of view of absolute vulnerability. And that hasn\u2019t left me.\u201dAfter graduation, she briefly lived with Da Cunha, in Goa, where he was from, but they broke up, and she returned to Delhi. She got a job at the National Institute of Urban Affairs, and met Pradip Krishen, an independent filmmaker who offered Roy the female lead in \u201cMassey Sahib\u201d (1985), a film set in colonial India in which Roy played a goatherd. Roy and Krishen, who later married, collaborated on subsequent projects, including \u201cBargad,\u201d a 26-part television series on India\u2019s independence movement that was never completed, as well as two feature films, \u201cAnnie\u201d and \u201cElectric Moon\u201d (1992).Krishen\u2019s background could not have been more different from Roy\u2019s. A Balliol scholar and former history professor, Krishen, a widower, lived with his parents and two children in a sprawling house in the posh Chanakyapuri neighborhood. When Roy joined him, they moved to a separate apartment upstairs. Roy immersed herself in Delhi\u2019s independent-filmmaking world. The movies\u2019 progressive themes appealed to her, but it was a world dominated by the scions of elite families, and it soon came to seem out of touch and insular to her. She spent more and more time teaching aerobics, to earn her own money, and hanging out with artists she met in school.She had already begun work on her novel when \u201cThe Bandit Queen,\u201d a film, based on the life of the female bandit Phoolan Devi, was released. Devi was a low-caste woman who became a famous gang leader and endured gang rape and imprisonment. Roy was incensed by the way the film portrayed her as a victim whose life was defined by rape instead of rebellion. \u201cWhen I saw the film, I was infuriated, partly because I had grown up in Kerala, being taken to these Malayalam films, where in every film \u2014 every film \u2014 a woman got raped,\u201d Roy said. \u201cFor many years, I believed that all women got raped. Then I read in the papers how Phoolan Devi said it was like being raped again. I read the book the film was based on and realized that these guys had added their own rapes. . . . I thought, You\u2019ve changed India\u2019s most famous bandit into history\u2019s most famous rape victim.\u201d Roy\u2019s essay on the film, \u201cThe Great Indian Rape Trick,\u201d published in the now-defunct Sunday magazine, eviscerated the makers of \u201cBandit Queen,\u201d pointing out that they never even bothered to meet Phoolan Devi or to invite her to a screening.The piece alienated many of the people Roy worked with. Krishen, who gives the impression of a flinty loyalty toward Roy even though the couple split up, says it was seen as a betrayal in the tightknit film circles of Delhi. For Roy, it was a lesson in how the media worked. \u201cI watched very carefully what happened to Phoolan Devi,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw how the media can just excavate you and leave a shell behind. And I was lucky to learn from that. So when my turn came, the barricades were up.\u201dBut for the most part, she kept out of the public eye. Roy was staying at the house of a journalist friend, and as he and another journalist talked on their mobile phones, following a story about a fight that had broken out between Amarnath pilgrims and Kashmiri porters, she distributed packs of Lavazza coffee brought from Delhi, only half listening. Later, she declined to attend the screening of a new documentary about the Naxalite guerrillas, preferring to work on her novel.Roy had come to Kashmir mainly to see friends, but it was hard to escape the strife altogether. A few days later, we drove through the countryside, a landscape of streams sparkling through green fields and over cobblestones, punctuated by camouflaged, gun-toting figures. Sometimes they were a detachment of the Central Reserve Police Force, sometimes the local police and, every now and then, distinctive in their flat headgear, soldiers of the counterinsurgency Rashtriya Rifles. \u201cThere were bunkers all over Srinagar when I first began coming here,\u201d Roy said. \u201cNow they use electronic surveillance for the city. The overt policing is for the countryside.\u201dIn Srinagar earlier that week, the policing had seemed overt enough. Roy had been invited to speak at a gathering organized by Khurram Parvez, who works for the Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society, an organization that has produced extensive reports on mass graves and extrajudicial killings in Kashmir. As 40 or so people sat cross-legged on the floor \u2014 activists, lawyers, journalists and students \u2014 Parvez asked that cellphones be turned off and placed in \u201cthighland\u201d in order to prevent surreptitious recordings that could be passed on to authorities.Roy put on reading glasses, and these, along with the stack of books in front of her, a selection of the nonfiction she has written over the past 15 years (just brought out by Penguin India as a box set of five candy-colored volumes), gave the gathering the air of an impromptu seminar. Roy began by asking audience members to discuss what was on their minds. A young lawyer who grew up in a village about 30 miles from Srinagar told a story of two women, who, after being raped by soldiers, spent the night shivering in separate bathing cabins, too ashamed to go home, hearing only each other\u2019s weeping. Roy listened carefully to this and similar accounts, occasionally nudging the conversation beyond Kashmir, to the rifts and fractures within India itself, including the forests of central India, where she spent more than two weeks in 2010 with ultraleft guerrillas and their tribal allies for her last book, \u201cBroken Republic\u201d (2011).\u201cI feel sad, you know, when I\u2019m traveling in India and see Kashmiris who\u2019ve been recruited into the Border Security Force,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s what this state does, hiring from one part of the country and sending them to fight in other parts, against people who on the surface might seem different but who are actually facing the same kind of oppression, and this is why perhaps it\u2019s important to be able to talk to each other.\u201dThe discussion went on for hours, spanning global capitalism and climate change, before returning to Kashmir. Did Kashmiris identify with Pakistan? Some did, some emphatically did not. What about the role of women in the struggle for Kashmiri self-determination? How could they make themselves heard when they found it so difficult to make themselves heard in this room? In the fierce summer heat, the group, splintered into factions, growing tired and agitated. Roy decided to bring the proceedings to a close with a joke from Monty Python\u2019s \u201cLife of Brian.\u201d\u201cIn the movie, this man, Brian, asks a band of guerrilla fighters, \u2018Are you the Judean Peoples\u2019 Front?\u2019 \u201d Roy said, mimicking a British accent. \u201cAnd the reply he gets from this really offended group is: No, absolutely not. \u2018We\u2019re the Peoples\u2019 Front of Judea.\u2019 \u201d The joke, an elaborate parody of radical factionalism, made Roy laugh heartily. It also changed the emotional temperature of the room. As we came out of the house and milled around in the alley, the various groups seemed easier with each other. Later, a young man who had just completed a degree in fiction would express to me his disappointment that the conversation had never turned to writing at all.\u201cThe things I\u2019ve needed to say directly, I\u2019ve said already,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I feel like I would be repeating myself with different details.\u201d We were sitting in her living room, and she paused, knowing the next question would be how political her fiction might now be. \u201cI\u2019m not a person who likes to use fiction as a means. I think it\u2019s an irreducible thing, fiction. It\u2019s itself. It\u2019s not a movie, it\u2019s not a political tract, it\u2019s not a slogan. The ways in which I have thought politically, the proteins of that have to be broken down and forgotten about, until it comes out as the sweat on your skin.\u201dBut publishing is a risky venture in India these days; court orders are used to prevent books from coming out or to remove them from circulation, even when they are not explicitly political. Most recently, Penguin India pulped all existing copies of \u201cThe Hindus: An Alternative History,\u201d by Wendy Doniger, after a conservative Hindu pressure group initiated a case against the book. Penguin also publishes Roy, and she felt compelled to protest.Although Roy won\u2019t divulge, even to her closest friends, what her new novel is about, she is adamant that it represents a break from both her nonfiction and her first novel. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to write \u2018The God of Small Things\u2019 again,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s much more grappling conceptually with the new novel. It is much easier for a book about a family \u2014 which is what \u2018The God of Small Things\u2019 was \u2014 to have a clear emotional heart.\u201d Before she became caught up in her essay on Ambedkar and Gandhi, she was working on the novel by drawing, as she tends to do in the early stages, trying to figure out the structure. She then writes longhand. What she calls the \u201csandpapering\u201d takes place on a laptop, at her kitchen table.\u201cI\u2019m not attached to any particular space,\u201d she said when I asked her how important the routine was to her writing. \u201cI just don\u2019t need to feel that someone\u2019s breathing over me.\u201dAfter \u201cThe God of Small Things\u201d was published, she began to give some of the money she made from it away. She sent her father, who resurfaced after she appeared in \u201cMassey Sahib\u201d and was not above trying to extort money from her, to a rehab center. (He died in 2007.) In 2002, when Roy received a Lannan Foundation award, she donated the $350,000 prize money to 50 small organizations around India. Finally, in 2006, she and her friends set up a trust into which she began putting all her nonfiction earnings to support progressive causes around the country.\u201cI was never interested in just being a professional writer where you wrote one book that did very well, you wrote another book, and so on,\u201d Roy said, thinking of the ways in which \u201cThe God of Small Things\u201d trapped her and freed her. \u201cThere\u2019s a fear that I have, that because you\u2019re famous, or because you\u2019ve done something, everybody wants you to keep on doing the same thing, be the same person, freeze you in time.\u201d Roy was talking of the point in her life when, tired of the images she saw of herself \u2014 the glamorous Indian icon turned glamorous Indian dissenter \u2014 she cut off her hair. But you could see how she might say the same of the position in which she now finds herself. The essay on Gandhi and Ambedkar was meant to complete one set of expectations before she could turn to something new. \u201cI don\u2019t want that enormous baggage,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI want to travel light.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stanley Fischer, Fed Nominee, Has Long History of Policy Leadership", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Stanley Fischer has worked for much of his professional life to improve economic policy in the developing world. Now he is on the verge of a new role in a country with plenty of economic problems of its own: the United States.Mr. Fischer, nominated by President Obama to serve as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, is likely to move quickly through a confirmation process that begins with a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday morning.Assuming Mr. Fischer successfully negotiates that gantlet, he would join Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s new chairwoman, in the difficult work of figuring out how much more the Fed can do to help the economy recover from the Great Recession. Ms. Yellen proposed his selection to the White House.Mr. Fischer has supported the efforts by the Fed and other central banks to revive economic growth, but he has also described the benefits as limited. \u201cYou could do a lot with monetary policy, but you couldn\u2019t get the economy growing fast again,\u201d he said on Bloomberg Television in September. \u201cYou needed fiscal policy.\u201dGenial, courtly, self-effacing, Mr. Fischer is skilled at making sharp points without making enemies.Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury secretary, suggested at a November conference held by the International Monetary Fund in Mr. Fischer\u2019s honor that there were fewer financial crises in the decades after World War II because people acted prudently.\u201cLarry,\u201d Mr. Fischer responded, \u201cI wonder whether the 35 years after World War II had something to do with the fact that financial liberalization hadn\u2019t yet happened.\u201dMr. Fischer\u2019s prepared remarks before the Senate committee, released by the committee on Wednesday, focused on the importance of the Fed\u2019s role as a financial regulator. \u201cThe Great Recession has driven home the lesson that the Fed has not only to fulfill its dual mandate, but also to contribute its part to the maintenance of the stability of the financial system,\u201d he said.Mr. Fischer, now 70, is a widely respected figure in the world of economic policy. His academic work in the 1970s helped to provide the intellectual justification for today\u2019s activist monetary policy. His students included the recently retired Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank.He subsequently began a career in policy-making, including a stint as second-in-command at the I.M. F. during the 1990s and, most recently, an eight-year run as governor of the Bank of Israel, a job he left in June.Along the way, Mr. Fischer, born into a family of shopkeepers in a small town in present-day Zambia, in a home without running water, amassed a fortune as the author of a best-selling economics textbook and a senior executive at Citigroup.Mr. Fischer in December disclosed assets worth $14.6 million to $56.3 million, including a residence in New York worth at least $5 million. He said that he would divest some stock and investment holdings if he were confirmed.Mr. Fischer has said that his upbringing in Mazabuka, then part of the British colony of Northern Rhodesia, imbued him with a passion for economic development.He turned to policy-making in the late 1980s \u2014 a change Mr. Bernanke and others would describe as an inspiration in their own careers \u2014 by joining the World Bank as chief economist. Then, after a brief return to academia, the Clinton administration secured his appointment as the I.M.F.\u2019s first deputy managing director.Developing nations were hit by a series of financial crises during Mr. Fischer\u2019s time at the fund, and the changes in economic policy that the I.M.F. required from countries seeking its help remain controversial. The fund\u2019s typical demands included reductions in domestic spending and greater openness to foreign investment. Critics argue that many of the changes did more harm than good.\u201cTens of millions of people were unnecessarily thrown into poverty,\u201d said Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. He said the United States suffered, too, as those countries devalued currencies and pumped out cheap exports, driving trade deficits to record heights.\u201cDid he ever admit that they were wrong in the Asian crisis?\u201d Mr. Weisbrot asked of Mr. Fischer. \u201cIf he\u2019s never admitted that, then I wouldn\u2019t trust him.\u201dMr. Fischer\u2019s tenure as a Citigroup executive between 2002 and 2005 also has drawn scrutiny from Democratic senators who favor stronger limits on big banks.\u201cI\u2019d never been in a private sector and it interested me,\u201d Mr. Fischer said in 2004.He led the bank\u2019s public sector advisory group and served as president of Citigroup International, overseeing the bank\u2019s foreign operations, working under a contract that allowed him to leave for a \u201chigh-level\u201d government job without surrendering the value of his stock options. When Israel called in late 2004, he left.Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, has said that he plans to ask Mr. Fischer what he learned on Wall Street and how it would influence his work at the Fed.Mr. Fischer became an Israeli citizen in 2005 while retaining his American citizenship, but he already had deep ties to the country, and he insisted on speaking Hebrew there from the outset. His arrival was compared by one local paper to the acquisition of the Brazilian soccer great Ronaldinho by an Israeli team.Although the Israeli economy swooned during the global financial crisis, it never fell into recession. Mr. Fischer cut interest rates quickly at the beginning of the crisis and, breaking with the I.M.F. playbook he had helped to write, he built up foreign reserves to limit the rise of the shekel.Shlomo Maital, a professor at the Technion Institute of Management, credited Mr. Fischer with \u201cnavigating Israel through the global financial crisis that began in 2008, more or less unscathed, by clever manipulation of interest rates and impeccable timing.\u201dMr. Fischer also worked quietly to preserve the Palestinian banking system and, when he stepped down last year, both Israeli and Palestinian officials mourned his departure.While Mr. Fischer has avoided public speaking in recent months, there have been glimpses of his views. The former secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin said last week that he had made a $1 bet with Mr. Fischer about the economy\u2019s performance in 2014. Mr. Rubin said he was the pessimist, while Mr. Fischer was more optimistic.\u201cI think he\u2019s good for the money,\u201d Mr. Rubin joked. \u201cI know I am.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letters: Bad Boys, Heschel and Kennan\u2019s Diaries", "Date": "2014-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBad Boys and OthersTo the Editor:All three mention that this is the 100th anniversary of Burroughs\u2019s birth, and I have read similar stories elsewhere over the past few weeks. I\u2019m struck, though, that I have not encountered any items that identify March 1, 2014, as the 100th anniversary of Ralph Ellison\u2019s birth.\u201cInvisible Man\u201d (which I am, coincidentally, teaching in my other class this semester) is another challenging work of fiction published in the 1950s, and one I believe everyone should read. (I can\u2019t say I\u2019d recommend \u201cNaked Lunch\u201d to everyone.) One of the central texts of the African-American literary tradition and one of the top contenders for the Great American Novel, Ellison\u2019s magisterial work explores the psychological consequences of feeling invisible. There is certainly an irony in his absence from news media outlets today.The writer is a professor and the chairman of the English department at Suffolk University.\u25c6To the Editor:Rivka Galchen is right in claiming, in her Bookends essay (Feb. 23), that literary bad boys will always be around. Less acknowledged are the women writers (whom I will not demean by calling \u201cliterary bad girls\u201d) who defied conventions, social and literary, in their own ways. Among them are George Sand, an unapologetic woman of affairs and an elegant prose stylist; Radclyffe Hall, who in \u201cThe Well of Loneliness\u201d dispelled the stigma of a relationship between two women as unnatural; Mary Renault, who in her novels about ancient Greece invested love between men with a purity of which Plato would have approved. Finally there is the novelist of my youth, Kathleen Winsor, whose \u201cForever Amber\u201d was a historical novel about Restoration England in which bodices remained intact while passion flared discreetly unchecked.These were women who ventured into terrain previously staked out by men. Let\u2019s acknowledge them for their achievements. William Burroughs had it easy.The writer is professor emeritus of communications and English at Fairleigh Dickinson University.\u25c6In Search of HeschelTo the Editor:The writer, a professor in the department of Romance studies at Brandeis University, is the author of four books on Abraham Heschel.\u25c6Realism About KennanTo the Editor:This is a misinterpretation. The strategy of containment was rejected by the president, State Department, Pentagon and C.I.A., much to Kennan\u2019s grief and frustration, as borne out in the diaries. The Cold War was \u201cwon\u201d because of the bankruptcy of the Soviet Union, caused in turn by its effort to maintain great power military forces with an economy insufficient for the purpose. This had nothing to do with Kennan or his ideas.\u25c6To the Editor:Like many admirers of George Kennan, I have had to come to grips with the startling contrast between the elegant moralism of his analysis of international affairs and his dismissive elitism and retrograde attitudes toward race. How could a man be regarded as a leading \u201crealist\u201d if he failed to come to terms with the realities of his country and the world as they emerged in the 20th century?In Kennan\u2019s defense, I will say that he needs to be seen as someone promoting civilized behavior among civilized people, and that, in the nuclear age, there was no room for error in allowing popular passions or utopian dreams to suspend civilized behavior.Unfortunately for his reputation, Kennan was too constrained in his views about who was capable of civilized behavior. But I have no problem calling on all people to transcend Kennan\u2019s narrow social vision and aspire to his high standards of collective introspection and prudent behavior in public affairs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Israel No Longer Trusts Europe", "Date": "2014-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 In February, the German politician Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament and the Social Democratic candidate for European Commission president in the coming European Union elections, traveled to Israel to address the Knesset. The idea of a German politician speaking before the Israeli Parliament is newsworthy enough. But it was what he said that caused an uproar: Mr. Schulz quoted a young Palestinian he met in the West Bank, who had asked him: \u201cHow can it be that an Israeli is allowed to use 70 liters of water a day but a Palestinian only 17?\u201d Though Mr. Schulz didn\u2019t elaborate, his implication was clear: Israel is purposely depriving Palestinians of their basic needs. But if his comments drew immediate condemnation in the Israeli press, they attracted little attention in Europe, perhaps because he was simply expressing what has come to be conventional wisdom there: Israel, many Europeans believe, is capable of almost anything in its treatment of Palestinians. The feelings of distrust are mutual: According to the Global Attitudes Project at the Pew Research Center, only 41 percent of Israelis had a favorable view of the European Union in 2013, down from 56 percent in 2009 (even the United States, which under President Obama has been more critical of Israel than under his predecessor, was viewed favorably by 83 percent of Israelis). Europe and Israel have hit rough spots before. But the rancor of the last few years is different \u2014 more vituperative, more widespread. If it remains, the hopes for a European role in a final peace deal will be dashed.European animosity toward Israel goes beyond the public. The European Union recently adopted guidelines forbidding its agencies to send money to Israeli companies and organizations in the West Bank; this and other similar steps apply a double standard it doesn\u2019t use in other conflicts. And it seems aimed to increasingly push Israel into a corner. Israel, with its dogged commitment to expanding settlements, has brought some of that on itself. But Europe has also lost the measure of how one-sided its approach has become. European officials have a habit of aggrandizing obstacles for peace put up by Israel and minimizing those put up by the Palestinians.To understand Europe\u2019s Middle East complex, one has to go back to the days when the Continent started to forge a common foreign policy. The first joint declaration in foreign affairs emerged in 1973 as a response to the Gulf states\u2019 oil embargo against the West after the Yom Kippur War. Its aim was to appease Arab states and to lift the embargo\u2019s pressure on European economies. The Middle East thus became the subject around which European diplomats continued to press a collective response. For decades they had no common foreign policy toward any region of the world but the Middle East. But instead of finding pragmatic solutions, they settled for airy joint resolutions; after having agreed on most subtle wordings, the diplomats in Brussels would fly home exhausted \u2014 until the next crisis demanded another declaration. As a result, European talk about the conflict has become terribly clich\u00e9-ridden. The \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d is always closing fast. The \u201cspiral of violence\u201d is always in danger of spinning out of control. And the Palestinians are usually seen as victims reacting to Israeli measures, and not as authors of their own fate. To Europe, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the root of all problems facing the region \u2014 a view in no way altered by the Arab Human Development Reports published by the United Nations since 2002, which showed that Arab autocracies and cultural backwardness were the root of the region\u2019s woes. Even after the outbreak of the Arab revolutions revealed that indeed corruption \u2014 and lack of dignity, democracy and opportunity \u2014 were to blame for the rage of the Arab street, Europe insisted on the centrality of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is striking that Europe always comes to the Israelis with demands for concessions when it has itself such a bad track record at helping resolve problems in the region. After Israel\u2019s withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, the European Union agreed to police the Rafah crossing in order to help prevent weapons smuggling. But it essentially abandoned the mission two years later. After the 2006 Lebanon war, European nations took over large parts of the United Nations mission to prevent weapons smuggling to Hezbollah. On their watch the terrorist group acquired tens of thousands of new and more sophisticated rockets. If the Europeans were honest with themselves, they would admit that some of their long-held assumptions didn\u2019t pass the reality test. Like the idea that Israel should always swap land for peace. It has worked with states like Egypt. But it has failed whenever ideologically driven nonstate actors were involved. Israel\u2019s withdrawal from Lebanon resulted not in the disarming of Hezbollah, as many European experts had predicted, but in a heavily armed Iranian proxy sitting directly at Israel\u2019s border. We\u2019ve seen much the same in Gaza.Despite these discouraging experiences, every Israeli military action against radicals in Gaza or Lebanon is met with protests in Europe. Which doesn\u2019t inspire confidence in Israeli leaders that Europe would accept Israel\u2019s right to self-defense if a future Palestinian state in the West Bank became a similar hotbed of extremism and revisionist politics.It is always comfortable for Europeans to demand that Israel make hard decisions for peace. But Europe must now ask itself some hard questions, too. What guarantees could Europe offer Israel in return for a Palestinian state to protect it if the peace experiment failed and radicals took over the West Bank? Would Europe be ready to offer membership in NATO and the European Union if the Israelis asked for it? I am not sure there are any promising answers to these questions. But if all Europe has to offer Israel is criticism and disapproval, then it will be part of the problem, not the solution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Foreign Buyers Eyeing Forbes Magazine, a Chronicler of the World\u2019s Wealthiest", "Date": "2014-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Media EquationGrowing up in the Midwest, my idea of rich was my dentist, who lived a few blocks away and had a split-level that was bigger than the rest of ours and a Cadillac in the driveway. Then I saw a copy of Forbes in his office and realized there was a different sort of wealth, a gossamer existence beyond my wildest imaginings.Fast-forward a few decades and I ended up covering publishing in New York during the unwinding of the dot-com boom in 2001. Forbes was still chronicling the new titans, putting out a magazine every other week stuffed with heroic stories and lucrative advertising. Although I was taught to suspect the rich as a young man, I was not immune to the blandishments of wealth. So when I was invited to a party on the Highlander, the Forbes yacht, I practically skipped past the hired bagpipers at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan and hopped aboard. Steve and Timothy Forbes, the sons of Malcolm who were charged with running Forbes, hosted a floating crowd of journalists, advertisers and executives as we feasted on lush hors d\u2019oeuvres and remarkable bottles of Scotch. Midtown glimmered in the dusk as we motored up the Hudson River and word came that I, along with Keith Kelly of The New York Post, were about to get a ride on a helicopter. Did I mention the yacht had a helicopter? Soaring over the Statue of Liberty, Midtown and most remarkably, the twin towers, it was, undoubtedly, one of the greatest nights of my life.It was Sept. 10, 2001.The Forbes family had hoped to receive as much as $400 million to $500 million for the magazine and website, and it is not hard to see why. In 2006, it sold a minority stake to the private equity firm Elevation Partners for $264 million, and Elevation, even after significant write-downs, has a preferred position, which means that at the low end of the sales range, not much would be left for the family. (That may be why some of the deals floated in the news media suggest that the family will maintain a minority stake after a sale.)Forbes has always been a robust international brand, but who would have predicted that a magazine led by Steve Forbes, a man who ran for president on a platform based on the magical power of American capitalism, would be sold to a foreign company? It is less ironic than it is telling, a reminder that the America celebrated by Forbes is best seen in the rearview. How did we get here?To start, Forbes was conceived and built by the first generation \u2014 B. C. Forbes \u2014 but fully realized by the second. Malcolm Forbes was a media mogul in full, including a lifestyle replete with islands, palaces, ranches and private jets that embodied the brand. Under his reign, the Forbes formula of how to get/be/stay rich struck an aspirational note perfectly in tune with the times. After Mr. Forbes died, the family sold his cherished collection of Faberg\u00e9 eggs, mothballed the yacht, peddled the jet and offloaded the company\u2019s historic headquarters on lower Fifth Avenue. Now it has come down to selling the magazine itself, which, beginning next year, will be based in an office tower in Jersey City. There will be no more soaring helicopter rides over Manhattan. If the Forbes brand has been dented, it has hardly been destroyed. The name has always resonated globally, partly because the Forbes 400 \u201crich list\u201d is fetishized by the wealthy, many of whom will be on the list of the world\u2019s billionaires that comes out Monday. And the Forbes Asia summit remains a popular, profitable event.In that context, a buyer from a nascent economy on the rise make sense. The Far East is a place that is not only making much of the world\u2019s goods, the countries there are also manufacturing wealth at an astounding rate. Forbes might be a nice trophy for a foreign buyer as a way of signaling its arrival. It would not be the first time a publication was bought as a multiple of ego rather than earnings.But in America, there is a growing disconnect in the narrative of business magazines. The world of titans that Malcolm Forbes once so vividly inhabited has become a lot less sexy. The mix of buffoonery and greed that created the financial meltdown in 2008 dispelled the image of businesspeople as heroes. Forbes\u2019s worldview \u2014 \u201cBusiness was originated to produce happiness,\u201d B. C. Forbes asserted \u2014 has been overtaken by the grimness of a new economy, one that still produces billionaires that end up on the Forbes list, but few jobs to go with them.Email: carr@nytimes.com;\nTwitter: @carr2n David Barboza contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Found in Mud: Precious Links to Loved Ones", "Date": "2014-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDARRINGTON, Wash. \u2014 Gently, Dayn Brunner reached into the mangled car and lifted his younger sister\u2019s lifeless body out of the driver\u2019s seat and onto a waiting tarp. For almost a week, he and his teenage sons had slogged through the muddy catacomb of what had once been a neighborhood, scouring the pulped homes and broken earth for some sign of her. Now, it was time to say goodbye and wait for the helicopter to take her away.\u201cWe cried together, and we moved her over,\u201d he said.But before they could go, Mr. Brunner, 42, turned back to the blue Subaru to salvage a few of the things that his sister Summer Raffo, 36, had carried with her on her final drive through the valley. He found a horse halter \u2014 she had loved to ride and breed horses. Her wallet. Her checkbook. A few packets of honey from KFC stashed in the glove compartment. He tucked them away.It seems all but certain no one is still alive in the muddy wreckage of the Oso landslide, which left at least 18 people dead and devastated towns up and down this valley of loggers, backcountry skiers and outdoor enthusiasts in the Cascade mountains of northern Washington. But as search teams pick through the devastation that obliterated homes and pulverized a highway, families and rescuers are finding glimmers of the disparate lives that were irrevocably brought together in one instant on March 22.They have found the officer\u2019s sword and uniforms of Navy Cmdr. John Regelbrugge III, who died. Photographs that Reed Miller, who was not home at the time, had taken with his son, Joseph, who was at home and is now missing. A mud-splattered painting of a Native American night warrior that bubbled up from the watery rubble of Robin Youngblood\u2019s home, just as she was being rescued. The baby blanket that belonged to Sanoah Huestis, 4 months old, whose body was recovered on Thursday.After a disaster that has left so many missing, some perhaps never to be found, these ordinary objects have become connections to loved ones and lost lives. They are all that is left.\u201cIt means a lot because it\u2019s a piece of the person,\u201d said John Regelbrugge Jr., whose son\u2019s body was found on Tuesday. \u201cThe person\u2019s gone.\u201dRescue crews are carefully saving what they find: Bibles, stuffed animals and antiques. On Saturday, workers could be seen sorting hundreds of family photos and piling plastic bags filled with personal items onto all-terrain vehicles. Everything will be sorted, decontaminated and photographed for families to reclaim.With 30 people still officially listed as missing and dozens possibly entombed in millions of tons of clay and tree trunks, residents here are bracing for fresh waves of grief ahead, even as they begin to wonder how the valley and its struggling logging economy will recover from the sheer physical and human toll of one of the worst landslides in the country\u2019s history.\u201cPeople have been hurting for a long time,\u201d said Olan Flick, who owns an upholstery store a few miles west of the landslide. \u201cThis is just going to make things worse.\u201dAsk residents, and they describe lives as intertwined as a web of tree roots. Here people often recognize your voice if you dial a wrong number. Gas station attendants and supermarket clerks will call parents if they spot children breaking curfew or getting into trouble. Neighbors make preserves for one another and catch up at Friday-night high school baseball games. In Darrington, a few miles upstream from Oso, each time a resident dies, a memorial dinner is held at the community center.\u201cYou know them all,\u201d said Darrington\u2019s mayor, Dan Rankin. \u201cThis is so beyond us, beyond anybody.\u201dSome of the people whose lives were swept away had just moved to the area, drawn here by the snow-covered peaks that float above the emerald valley. Others were electricians or plumbers in Oso on a job. Ms. Raffo, who split her time between Darrington and the nearby town of Concrete, was one of several motorists just passing through along Highway 530.Like many residents, Ms. Raffo worked a handful of part-time jobs, as a custodian at the school and for her parents\u2019 janitorial business. She was also a farrier, and on that Saturday morning, she was on her way to meet a client to shoe a horse. When the slide struck her, it hit so fast that she did not even have time to lift her hands off the steering wheel before her car was buried, her brother, Mr. Brunner, said.Even as law enforcement agents set up barricades to keep people out of the treacherous slide zone, Mr. Brunner\u2019s family and other clusters of residents rushed past or made their way in through rainy back roads. Helicopter rescuers shouted at Mr. Brunner to leave. But he kept telling anyone who asked: My sister\u2019s out there.Residents like Robin Youngblood, 63, who survived, now have only scraps remaining of the lives their families built. Ms. Youngblood\u2019s great-grandfather worked in the logging camps, and her great-grandmother cooked for those men. In 2012, she moved back to the area, drawn by a desire to live close to the Stillaguamish River, eagles and salmon-hunting bears.\u201cThis place brought me back here,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing home. I\u2019ve always wanted to come back.\u201dThe slide sent Ms. Youngblood tumbling through a slurry of mud and trees, leaving her modest mobile home in shards. She climbed onto a washing machine, and a friend who had been visiting climbed onto a refrigerator, and they began screaming for help.Before the helicopter arrived to airlift them out, something floated up from the muddy soup beside Ms. Youngblood. It was a painting called \u201cWolf Vision,\u201d given to her 20 years ago by an artist she had known in Seattle, of an Indian night warrior.She said she would never return to the home she lost, a place she now describes in the past tense. And she keeps the painting close.

His father, Reed Miller, 75, who had driven into Arlington, about 20 miles away, for groceries, is in a Red Cross shelter, his house gone. His daughter, and Joseph\u2019s sister, Pam Sanford, came from Idaho to be with him, to see if his insurance might cover anything \u2014 it will not \u2014 and to wait, resigned to the worst, for news from the bleak and muddy field of debris that was their home.As for possessions, what her father drove into town wearing is all he has left, Ms. Sanford, 40, said.\u201cHis whole entire life, right there, gone,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI just went and got him his vitamin D and a pillbox and his ChapStick \u2014 I mean, those things would be sitting at home in a junk drawer.\u201d She described him as being in shock in the week since the disaster, and sometimes a little confused.But then something unexpected happened: A local volunteer at the landslide site, searching for survivors or bodies, came upon a handful of photographs caked in mud and, recognizing Joseph or Reed Miller\u2019s work, got them to Ms. Sanford. The dates of the photos are a jumble \u2014 some much older than others. But then, her father\u2019s system of organization was his own, she said, with or without a landslide to compound the disorder.\u201cIt\u2019s a menagerie of pictures that were somewhere in the house,\u201d she said. Her father, she added, is \u201can eclectic little old man,\u201d who kept things in piles, boxes and drawers.The saved images are from an artist\u2019s eye: in the bedroom with the cats, some outdoor scenes, an old car, a card-mounted photograph of the type that Joseph Miller made and offered for sale in a local gift shop.Ms. Sanford carefully cleaned them off and dried them and made a collage that her father can have at the shelter to look at while they wait for news. They are comforting memories, but also the treasures, now, of a lost world.Alan Blinder contributed reporting from Atlanta, and Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re from New York.Advertisement"}

The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite fell more than the other indexes, giving up 60.69 points, or 1.4 percent, to 4,173.58.Investors may be questioning whether the returns on those investments will ultimately justify the high prices, said Lawrence Creatura, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors.

Tastes change and people move on. One day, the Chrysler PT Cruiser is on top, praised for its daring retro style and toting up big sales. The next, it\u2019s a washed-up punch line \u2014 the booby prize for Walter Jr. on \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d nearly as pathetic as the Pontiac Aztek driven by his meth-dealing dad.But the Kia Soul has steadily increased its following, toting up 118,000 sales last year, compared with about 32,000 in its debut year of 2009. This endearingly odd box has been backed by those irresistible hip-hop hamsters, a stroke of advertising genius. Honda\u2019s own inside-the-box car, the Element, started strong in 2002 but faded badly before it was laid to rest in 2011. Following the Honda, Scion\u2019s xB met with approval from young and old alike. But Nissan\u2019s sad-clown car, the Cube, is so rarely seen that I assumed, wrongly, that Nissan had stopped selling it.With the Soul firmly established, you can bet that Kia designers and engineers saw a cautionary tale in what became of Scion\u2019s box: Seeking to broaden the xB\u2019s appeal with a 2008 redesign, Toyota ruined the car instead, softening the polarizing shape and turning the campus rebel into a bland conformist.Fortunately, Kia\u2019s second-generation Soul has grown and evolved, but without selling out or shedding its funky persona. Noticeably more solid-feeling and quiet, thoroughly pleasant to drive and filled with winning design cues and premium features, the Korean-built Soul actually has more charm than before.The new Soul\u2019s template was the lauded Track\u2019ster concept car \u2014 it had the stance of a bulldog \u2014 and the production version has a number of show-car styling cues. A body-colored panel seems to float within the liftgate. That liftgate is book-ended by eye-catching high-mounted vertical taillamps. Round fog lamps dangle like hip earrings from a glowering, trapezoidal air intake. More jewelry is optional: LED marker lights at front and rear. The Kia\u2019s decisively upgraded cabin and materials are persuasive in a budget-friendly car that starts at just $15,695. The whimsical spirit of BMW\u2019s Mini brand is in evidence, expressed here in a circular theme that recalls leftover parts from the robot factory. Handsome outer dashboard vents, capped with \u201cfloating\u201d tweeter enclosures, resemble little industrial cooling stacks. An extruded oval center stack houses an optional 8-inch navigation screen and climate controls. Available mood-lighted speakers in the front wheel wells ripple through multiple LED colors \u2014 in sync with music, if you wish. A glossy ball-shaped shift lever controls the 6-speed automatic transmission.Whereas Mini\u2019s interiors have often allowed cute form to take precedence over useful function, the Soul is a paragon of ergonomics. Everything just works \u2014 no owner\u2019s manual or anger management required. Touch-screen menus are straightforward, Bluetooth cellphones pair up in seconds, navigation is a snap. High-quality switches are right where you want them. A number of luxury automakers might wish that their driver interfaces worked as fluidly as the Kia\u2019s. All of this maturation does mean slightly higher prices, especially for the model I tested, a top-dog Exclaim version that started at $21,095 and peaked at $26,195. Most shoppers, I imagine \u2014 including parents covering the tab for their progeny \u2014 will aim for versions closer to $20,000. But it was hard to fault the Exclaim\u2019s luxury-level equipment.12 PhotosA handsome leather-wrapped steering wheel offers well-placed thumb rests and multifunction switches grouped in a circular arrangement. Deeply recessed driver\u2019s gauges feature a secondary digital information display.And while I recently tested two BMWs (one topping $65,000!) that didn\u2019t even have heated front seats, my Kia test car had heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, a cooled glovebox and a heated steering wheel. Kia\u2019s Uvo telematics system links smartphone apps like Pandora to the car\u2019s onboard display. A free three-month trial of SiriusXM radio includes real-time traffic, weather, movie times and sports scores. But although I sometimes appreciate wild car colors, I\u2019m definitely not in the right demographic for the metallic algae color that Kia calls \u201cAlien II.\u201d Perhaps the Kale Green or Inferno Red would be more appropriate. The Soul has grown slightly longer and wider. There\u2019s a smidgen more space for legs, shoulders and cargo, though the box-shaped hauler already seemed roomy relative to its tidy footprint. If you drop the rear seats, the Soul suddenly seems more like a small S.U.V., eager to prove how much tall or bulky gear can be crammed inside. The base 1.6-liter 4-cylinder makes 130 horses and can be had with a 6-speed manual transmission. But you\u2019re better off with the 2-liter engine, available only with the automatic. This new engine now has direct fuel injection and makes 164 horsepower and 151 pound-feet of peak torque. The old Soul could feel buzzy and a bit clunky, but the new one seems more substantial on the road. Kia says the chassis is 29 percent more rigid, with added sound absorption reducing interior noise by up to 3 decibels. The front pillars are nearly an inch narrower for better visibility.The Soul isn\u2019t exactly athletic in the manner of the Mazda 3 or \u2014 to name another oddball crossover \u2014 the Nissan Juke. But the Soul is eager, like a movie underdog determined to make the most of his chances. And that\u2019s a charming quality in any car.Kia relocated the rack-and-pinion steering box farther forward, in a stronger one-piece unit that helps to improve control and handling. On Route 301, a lovely, winding road that spills east from Clarence Fahnestock State Park an hour north of New York City, the 18-inch alloy wheels and tires provided plenty of grip, permitting the car to slingshot from corner to corner. The fuel economy is nothing special, partly a result of the car\u2019s bricklike aerodynamics, at 23 miles per gallon in town and 31 on the highway. The front seats are well-shaped, but the thin seat backs could be better cushioned for long drives. Finally, the optional FlexSteer system, which lets drivers tailor the level of steering assist through Comfort, Normal and Sport settings, is pretty much superfluous. Most drivers are likely to set it to Normal and forget it.Some people just can\u2019t get past the styling, and that\u2019s understandable. But fans will find a compact that, more than ever, goes beyond novelty: The Soul is smart and stuffed, and it puts a smile on your face. One comparison kept nagging at me. Honda once specialized at exceeding expectations in small cars, infusing them with charm and value.Now Kia and Hyundai are filling that role. And, improbably, I find myself asking: Why can\u2019t Honda make a cool car like the Soul?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Minimum Wage Rises, Many Are Left Looking Up at It", "Date": "2014-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout New YorkOn Tuesday, Edgar Juarez, 36, awoke in the two-bedroom apartment that he shares with five other men on 136th Street in Manhattan. His shift in a restaurant on the Upper West Side would begin at 4 p.m., and he would stay until nearly 1 a.m. The job is dishwasher.It was one year to the day that the governor and the State Legislature emerged from the cave where they conduct all business to announce that New York\u2019s minimum wage had been raised 75 cents an hour as of Jan. 1, 2014. For people in Mr. Juarez\u2019s shoes, this should have brought it to $8 an hour, up from $7.25.But after his third check of the year, Mr. Juarez said, he noticed that his hourly rate had not changed. He says he approached the manager at the restaurant, Hummus Kitchen, and invoked the name of the governor, Andrew M. Cuomo. \u201cI told her, \u2018Cuomo increased it to $8,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Juarez said. The manager seemed unimpressed, he recounted: \u201cShe said, \u2018It\u2019s not our problem. It\u2019s the governor\u2019s problem.\u2019\u201cI tell her, \u2018You are supposed to pay the minimum,\u2019 and she said, \u2018If you want to go, go. For me it is not hard to get dishwashers.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Juarez had only to look to his roommates, all of whom worked for the minimum wage, or near it, to realize the blunt facts behind her calculation. The economy of Dine-In and Take-Out New York rests entirely on people who wash dishes and bus tables and deliver food and swab toilets. Many restaurants treat their workers fairly, whether out of a sense of decency or the self-interest of having a loyal work force. Yet so many immigrants are willing to do this work that it is not hard for unscrupulous businesses to find people desperate enough to do it for less than what the law requires. \u201cPeople saw in the newspaper that it would become $8 an hour, and they came to us,\u201d Mr. Lam said. \u201cThey are afraid to complain to the company.\u201d As a Mexican immigrant, Mr. Juarez said, it is expected that he will send at least some money home for his mother and aunts.\u201cRent, food, transportation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all go up in dollars. Our pay rises in cents.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s move on,\u201d said Jeffrey D. Klein, the leader of the small group of Democrats in the State Senate who hold the balance of power there.To win the support of Republicans, the minimum wage deal included a subsidy valued at $45 million in tax credits to corporations that hire or retain teenagers. Mr. Klein may find that the conversation has not moved on. On Wednesday morning, minimum-wage workers plan to demonstrate outside his office across from City Hall in New York, calling for a repeal of the subsidy, a minimum wage of $10 and increases for tipped workers, who are paid at different rates and have lagged behind others.Some restaurant owners \u201cthink the minimum is a recommendation, not an obligation,\u201d Mr. Juarez said.A week after he complained, he said, his employers at Hummus Kitchen increased his hourly pay to $8. He and other employees are now suing the company for back pay. On Tuesday, a manager answering the phone at the restaurant gave her name as Charlie and said she was unaware of any problems over the hourly pay rate. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard any complaints about that,\u201d she said, saying that she would relay a message to the company\u2019s main office. No further comment was offered.Mr. Juarez said he intended to speak at the Wednesday rally. Was it not incautious of him to be giving an interview and speeches? He answered, \u201cWe are going to live in this condition until we raise our voices.\u201d Email: dwyer@nytimes.com\nTwitter: @jimdwyernyt Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Three Faces of President Obama", "Date": "2014-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBARACK OBAMA is surely the first president to be accused of acting in foreign policy like Pollyanna, John Wayne and Henry Kissinger in the same month.Ever since Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s land grab in Crimea, conservatives have denounced President Obama as a man who doesn\u2019t appreciate what a merciless, Hobbesian world this really is. He\u2019s a Pollyanna \u2014 always looking for people\u2019s good side. Meanwhile, liberals have been hammering Obama for what they say is his trigger-happy drone habit, having ordered the targeted killing by air of hundreds of individuals; he\u2019s John Wayne, seeking vigilante justice against those who have harmed, or might be planning to harm, the United States. And, just to round things out, Obama has been accused by critics on the left and right of being a Kissingerian hyperrealist who is content to watch the Syrian regime crush its people, because, as tragic as that is, American interests there are minimal. It can\u2019t be easy being Pollyanna, John Wayne and Henry Kissinger all at once. So who is Obama \u2014 really \u2014 on foreign policy? I\u2019d say less Pollyanna than his critics claim, more John Wayne and Henry Kissinger than he\u2019d admit, but still undefined when it comes to the greatest leadership challenges in foreign policy \u2014 which go beyond Crimea but lurk just over the horizon.If Obama has been a reluctant warrior in Crimea, it\u2019s because it\u2019s long been part of Russia and home to a Russian naval base, with many of its people sympathetic to Russia. Obama was right to deploy the limited sanctions we have in response to Putin\u2019s seizure of Crimea and try to coolly use diplomacy to prevent a wider war over Ukraine \u2014 because other forces are at play on Putin. Do not underestimate how much of a fool Putin will make of himself in Crimea this weekend \u2014 in front of the whole world \u2014 and how much this will blow back on Russia, whose currency and stock markets are getting hammered as a result of Vladimir\u2019s Crimean adventure. And if Obama has been a Kissingerian realist in his reluctance to dive into the Syrian civil war, or Ukraine, it\u2019s because he has learned from Iraq and Afghanistan that the existence of bad guys in these countries doesn\u2019t mean that their opponents are all good guys. Too many leaders in all these countries turned out to be more interested in using their freedom to loot rather than liberate. Where authentic reformers emerge in Syria or Ukraine we should help them, but, unlike Senator John McCain, most Americans are no longer willing to be suckers for anyone who just sings our song (see dictionary for Hamid Karzai), and they are now wary of owning the bailouts and gas bills of countries we don\u2019t understand. As for John Wayne Obama, \u201cthe quickest drone in the West,\u201d every American president needs a little of that in today\u2019s world, where you now have legions of superempowered angry people who wish America ill and who have access to rockets and live in ungoverned spaces.So I have no problem with Obama as John Wayne or Henry Kissinger. If you want to criticize or praise him on foreign policy, the real tests fall into two categories: 1) How good is he at leading from behind on Ukraine? And 2) How good is he at leading from in front on Russia, Iran and China? There is probably no saving Crimea from Putin in the short term, but we do not want to see him move beyond Crimea and absorb the parts of eastern Ukraine where the Russophones reside. We should be ready to offer arms to the Ukraine government to prevent that. But let us never lose sight of the fact that the key to keeping more of Ukraine out of Russia\u2019s paws will depend on the ability of Ukrainians to come together in a way that is inclusive of both the majority that sees its future with the European Union and the minority of Russophones who still feel some affinity for Russia. If the Ukraine drama pits a united Ukraine \u2014 seeking a noncorrupt democracy tied to Europe \u2014 against a Putin trying to forcibly reintegrate Ukraine into a Russian empire, Putin loses. But if Ukrainians are divided, if hyper-nationalist parties there dominate and pro-Russians are alienated, Putin will discredit the Ukraine liberation movement and use the divisions to justify his own interventions. Then our help will be useless. We can\u2019t help them if they won\u2019t help themselves. Ukrainians have already wasted a quarter-century not getting their act together the way Poland did. The big three issues where Obama must lead from the front are: changing the character of Russia\u2019s government, preventing Iran from getting a nuke and preventing a war in the South China Sea between Beijing and Tokyo. I will save China and Iran for later.But regarding Russia, I vehemently opposed NATO expansion because I held the view then, and hold it today, that there is no big geopolitical problem that we can solve without Russia\u2019s cooperation. That requires a Russia that does not define its greatness by opposing us and recreating the Soviet empire, but by unleashing the greatness of its people. It is increasingly clear that that will never be Putin\u2019s Russia, which stands for wholesale corruption, increasing repression and a zero-sum relationship with the West. Putin is looking for dignity for Russia now in all the wrong places \u2014 and ways. But only Russia\u2019s people can replace Putinism. The way the United States and European Union help, which will take time, is by forging new energy policies that will diminish Europe\u2019s dependency on Russian gas \u2014 the mother\u2019s milk of Putinism. But we Americans also have to work harder to make our country a compelling example of capitalism and democracy, not just the world\u2019s cleanest dirty shirt when it comes to our economy and not just the best democracy money can buy when it comes to our politics.The most important thing we could do to improve the prospects of democracy in the world \u201cis to fix our democracy at home,\u201d said Larry Diamond, a democracy specialist at Stanford University. \u201cThe narrative of American decline and democratic dysfunction damages the luster of democracy in the world and the decisions of people to feel it is a model worth emulating. That is in our power to change. If we don\u2019t reform and repair democracy in the United States, it is going to be in trouble globally.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s Shifting of Border Force Stirs U.S. Worry", "Date": "2014-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House cast doubt Friday on the Kremlin\u2019s claims that thousands of troops massing on the border of southeastern Ukraine are merely involved in training exercises, deepening fears that Russian aggression will not end in Crimea.\u201cIt\u2019s not clear what that signals,\u201d the national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, said to reporters in a briefing at the White House. But she added, \u201cObviously given their past practice and the gap between what they have said and what they have done, we are watching it with skepticism.\u201dAt the Pentagon, senior officers and analysts said they were monitoring the Russian infantry, airborne, air defense and other reinforcements with growing alarm, uncertain of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s ambitions. Pentagon officials do not believe that a new Russian move into Ukraine is imminent. But one of their big worries is that American and NATO officials would have virtually no time to react if it did happen. All told, officials said, there are more than 20,000 troops near the border.\u201cThe Russian forces are reinforcing and bulking up along the eastern Ukrainian border,\u201d a Pentagon official said. \u201cOur view is they\u2019re preserving all their options, including going in, absolutely. If they choose to do that, we just wouldn\u2019t have much warning.\u201dHe warned Russia against further incursions after its annexation of Crimea.Ms. Rice\u2019s comments, which set the stage for Mr. Obama\u2019s trip to Europe next week, suggested that the tensions between the United States and Russia were continuing to intensify. Asked if the Ukraine crisis was prompting a \u201cfundamental reassessment\u201d of America\u2019s relationship with Russia, she answered in a single word: \u201cYes.\u201dRussia\u2019s integration into the global political and economic order after the Cold War, Ms. Rice said, was predicated on its adherence to international rules and norms. \u201cWhat we have seen in Ukraine is obviously a very egregious departure from that,\u201d she said.Her comments were among the bluntest of any ranking administration official since the crisis began, and were even more striking because they came hours after Mr. Putin signaled that he wanted to halt the cycle of tit-for-tat retribution between Moscow and Washington. The White House, it seems, is paying less attention to Mr. Putin\u2019s words than to the movement of his troops, described as a mix of infantry, motorized and airborne forces. Officials also worry about clashes with Ukrainian soldiers, who are increasingly agitated. Ukrainian officials have told American officials that Russia could use that as a pretext to move.\u201cThis is obviously a very worrying and fragile situation,\u201d Ms. Rice said, \u201cbut we have been very much admiring of the posture that the Ukrainian people and government have been taking.\u201dOn Thursday, Russia\u2019s defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, told Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel that \u201cthe troops he has arrayed along the border are there to conduct exercises only, that they had no intention of crossing the border into Ukraine, and that they would take no aggressive action,\u201d according to the Pentagon\u2019s press secretary, Rear Adm. John Kirby.Mr. Hagel has held several urgent calls with Ukraine\u2019s defense minister, Ihor Tenyukh, and told him Friday that the Pentagon was reviewing a request for military assistance. Ukrainian officials have asked for small arms and ammunition, as well as nonlethal aid like medical supplies. The Pentagon said it was focusing on nonlethal aid.On Wednesday, Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, called Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to warn him about the mounting tensions in the country\u2019s east. Mr. Biden was then on a two-day trip to Poland and the Baltic States to reassure them of American support in the wake of Russia\u2019s moves against Ukraine.He encountered deep divisions among Europeans about how swiftly to impose sanctions on Russia. Estonia\u2019s president, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, urged his fellow leaders to act boldly, but officials in Poland and Lithuania were more cautious, citing energy contracts with Russia.The European Union stepped up its own sanctions, adding 12 Russian officials to its list of 21 blacklisted figures. But it did not penalize wealthy business people with ties to Mr. Putin, whom the White House describes as cronies. Part of the reason, a senior administration official said, is that Europe has different legal criteria for penalizing such people. The \u201ccronies\u201d tend to have assets stashed in Europe, which makes putting them on a blacklist more complicated.Ms. Rice said the European Union\u2019s latest move \u201cvery much matches the theory behind the executive order that President Obama signed yesterday, which gave us and gives us the ability as needed to target particular sectors within the Russian economy.\u201dIn addition to targeting those close to Mr. Putin with sanctions, the White House hopes to drive away foreign investors. In that regard, the best news the White House might have gotten was an announcement on Thursday by Standard & Poor\u2019s, the ratings agency, that it had downgraded its outlook for the Russian economy to negative.Ms. Rice was not among three White House officials banned from Russia by the Foreign Ministry in response to Mr. Obama\u2019s sanctions. One of the officials who was \u2014 Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser \u2014 stood next to her at the briefing.While Ms. Rice inveighed against Russia, Mr. Rhodes offered a businesslike recitation of the president\u2019s schedule next week, which includes a meeting with Pope Francis in the Vatican, with King Abdullah in Saudi Arabia and with the leaders of the Group of 7 countries in The Hague \u2014 a club in which Russia is normally the eighth member. \u201cOf course,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said, \u201cthe meeting itself is part of our isolation of Russia.\u201dEric Schmitt and Helene Cooper contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Armored vehicles cross paths with jeeps on winding roads lined by vineyards.In an area known for picturesque villages, winter skiing and summer Alpine excursions, the fortified construction yard is a jarring juxtaposition, betraying the bitterness of a two-decade battle over plans to build a high-speed train link between Italy and France.Over the years, the saga of the train line has been punctuated by episodes of popular resistance and colorful, thousands-strong demonstrations, but also by violent clashes, nighttime acts of sabotage and even accusations of terrorism.Local people have long resisted the rail link, fearing damage to aquifers as well as the possible release of asbestos and radioactive materials during the excavation. They also questioned the economic sense of a project that required an initial outlay of nearly $12 billion.But the strategic location of the Susa Valley has also given the 90,000 people who live here an outsize platform in Italy\u2019s broader cultural and political debate over balancing the country\u2019s identity with European integration, and more generally, preservation with progress.For Europe, the long deadlock has become a prime example of the strange jujitsu of European Union politics, in which sometimes the smallest local issues threaten to tie up a continent\u2019s grandest ambitions.\u201cThis is not about a train,\u201d said Lisa Ariemma, a resident who has opposed the Treno Alta Velocita rail project, or TAV, as it is known.The construction here is the first step in a planned 35-mile tunnel on a high-speed train line that would connect Turin, Italy, and Lyon, France. It is one section of the Mediterranean Corridor \u2014 a trans-European railway route from Algeciras, Spain, to Budapest, Hungary \u2014 that the European Commission has named as a priority.But for some residents here, the barricades, both physical and metaphorical, have come to reflect their differing view of development, and even democracy, and their distance from decision-makers in Rome and Brussels.The issue has given momentum to the Five Star Movement, the anti-establishment and anti-European Union party of Beppe Grillo, who was sentenced this month to four months in prison for a 2010 protest staged against the rail link in Chiomonte.Mr. Grillo\u2019s party is overtly opposed to the project, and several members of his party were elected to Parliament here and in nearby districts in national elections last year. Many are looking to local, regional and European elections in May to gauge the popularity of the line, which is a hot-button issue.For the national government, as Transport and Infrastructure Minister Maurizio Lupi put it this month after visiting this site, \u201cthe tunnel is evidence that the state exists, and that it believes in a project it sees as fundamental to the development of the country and of Europe.\u201dConstruction of the site began in 2011 amid protracted protests that climaxed in violent clashes. Large swaths of the mountain have since been fortified to keep demonstrators at bay, delaying the actual boring of the mountain until late last year.The long effort at resistance has not deterred the Italian government\u2019s commitment to the plan, despite political changes over the last 20 years, and regardless of which party was in power.But the long delay has put Italy\u2019s own reputation as a dependable European partner on the line. Fear of losing European financing, which Italian officials say is expected to cover 40 percent of the costs of the line, finally spurred the government to more concerted action. Opponents have waged a multifront resistance, through court challenges and \u201cNo TAV\u201d publications and websites. They have even bought up one-meter square patches of land along the planned rail route to bog down the expropriation process. Hundreds of protesters have been investigated \u2014 and some tried. Four young protesters are in jail on charges of terrorism.\u201cThe \u2018No TAV\u2019 movement has become radical, drawing on anarchic disaffected young people,\u201d said Stefano Esposito, a pro-TAV senator with the Democratic Party, who has received death threats and now travels with bodyguards.Alberto Perino, a longtime leader of the opposition to the rail link who was convicted alongside Mr. Grillo, believes the feeling against the project is far broader. \u201cWe\u2019re angry because they\u2019re carrying out a project with our money, against us,\u201d he said. Many locals feel their political representatives \u201cno longer represent the interests of citizens,\u201d but rather those of banks and constructions groups, he said.Luca Giunti, a park ranger and \u201cNo TAV\u201d activist argues that passenger and cargo traffic between Italy and France on the old rail line \u2014 built in 1871 \u2014 has been on a steady decline for years, and sees no need for a new one.\u201cYou\u2019re looking at a certain expense, and a certain environmental damage vis-\u00e0-vis an uncertain financial gain,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not much of a business model.\u201dEven as they acknowledge that the valley will bear some inconveniences, proponents of the plan say that rail infrastructure has changed significantly since the old line was built, and the current track is inefficient because it is built on a steep slope and the tunnel is not large enough to handle modern freight traffic.Gemma Amprino Giorio, the mayor of the nearby town of Susa, where a station designed by the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma is to be built once the track is complete, sees the train as breathing new life into the region\u2019s stagnant economy. \u201cRight now the valley is a dry branch. To have an international station \u2014 an architectural gem \u2014 will bring development, and a reinforcement of the territory\u2019s economy, in particular, tourism.\u201dMario Virano, an expert called by the government in 2006 to help moderate between the various factions, noted that the issue was much larger than the Susa Valley.\u201cWe can\u2019t lose the possibility of European funding, or let France lose theirs because of us,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t go ahead now, when the rest of Europe is working towards more homogeneous infrastructure, the scandal will be that we didn\u2019t do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Quarterly Trade Deficit Was the Smallest in 14 Years ", "Date": "2014-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Big gains in exports and overseas investment income narrowed the United States\u2019 current-account deficit in the fourth quarter to the lowest level in 14 years.The current account is the country\u2019s broadest measure of trade, covering not only goods and services, but also investment flows. A smaller trade deficit usually means that American companies are producing more to meet domestic and overseas demand.Goods exports rose 1.9 percent to $405.4 billion, driven by higher overseas sales of petroleum and agricultural products.Americans received $206.1 billion in overseas income, mostly from investments, a 4.3 percent increase from the previous quarter. Payments to overseas owners of United States assets rose 2.4 percent, to $137.8 billion. That helped push the United States income surplus to $64.4 billion.As a percentage of the American economy, the current-account deficit declined to 1.9 percent, the lowest since the third quarter of 1997.Two trends have helped narrow the gap in the last several years. The United States has benefited from an oil and gas boom because new drilling technologies have made it feasible to drill in states like North Dakota and Pennsylvania. That has pushed down the trade deficit by bolstering petroleum exports and lowering oil imports.The deficit in goods and services trade fell to a four-year low in November. It has widened slightly since then.Second, low interest rates have reduced the payments foreigners have received on their holdings of United States Treasury bonds and other investments. The payments that Americans receive on overseas investments have risen, increasing the nation\u2019s investment surplus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Putin, a Blessing in Disguise", "Date": "2014-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are a lot of people who seem intent on restarting the Cold War \u2014 in both Moscow and Washington. I am not one of them. But if we\u2019re going to have a new Cold War, then I have one condition: I want a new moonshot.And as opposed to the stimulus/deficit debate, in the energy case, there really is now the raw material for a \u201cGrand Bargain\u201d between Democrats and Republicans \u2014 if President Obama wants to try to forge it. Such an energy grand strategy would be a first. It\u2019s shocking how devoid of strategic intent U.S. energy policy has been. Both political parties have repeatedly let our economy be hostage to Middle Eastern and Latin American oil despots and to energy booms and busts.Here\u2019s the deal Obama should offer oil-patch Republicans and Democrats. \u201cYou really want to open up the country to the exploration of natural gas? You really want to be free to export oil and gas to global markets \u2014 so long as it\u2019s consistent with our national interests \u2014 and affect global markets in ways that could weaken Putinism? You really want the Keystone pipeline? Fine, I\u2019ll give you all of it. And in return you\u2019ll give me a bridge to a secure, clean-energy future for America.\u201dHarvey argues that such a deal should include the following: First, to ensure that natural gas is a boon rather than a curse, the oil and gas industry \u2014 and the lawmakers they control \u2014 have to accept national rules for extracting natural gas based on known best practices, including strategies that eliminate the leakage of methane, which is so much more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.Second, we need to set a national clean energy standard for electricity. One popular approach is to require utilities to raise the fraction of their electricity from zero-carbon sources \u2014 such as wind, solar or nuclear \u2014 by, say, 2 percent per year. Such a standard creates a market for renewables, which drives down costs, and helps ensure that natural gas is a transition fuel that replaces coal, not solar, wind and other clean power sources. Thirty states have some variant of this, and it has been hugely successful in stimulating development of new technology.\u00a0Third, we have to accelerate energy efficiency and clean power technologies by building up our research and development programs to the levels they merit, probably triple today\u2019s levels. This is the source of our long-term advantage.Fourth, we have to impose a revenue-neutral carbon tax \u2014 a Republican idea, championed by one of America\u2019s most respected statesmen, Reagan\u2019s secretary of state, George Shultz \u2014 that would replace payroll and corporate taxes.I don\u2019t like Keystone. Extracting oil from tar sands leads to even higher carbon emissions than drilling and devastates the landscape. But, if approval is the price for a truly transformational clean energy policy, I\u2019m in. You\u2019re not going to move the vested interests without a trade, but it has to be a smart trade.This is a grand bargain on energy that would advance our growth, national security and climate policy. If paired with similar efforts by our NATO allies, it would, in time, sharply reduce Putin\u2019s ability to blackmail his neighbors, using energy.\u00a0It would also protect Americans from price shocks, as both the sun and the wind are free, make our farmers, our coastal cities and our public health system much more resilient and tilt our energy policy toward exploiting our advantage \u2014 technology \u2014 rather than oil.Nader Mousavizadeh, the co-founder of Macro Advisory Partners, recently recalled for me what a U.S. energy company executive once told him: \u201cThe one thing we\u2019re never going to run out of is technology.\u201d We need to play to our strength.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Challenge: Pull Back Without Pulling the Rug Out", "Date": "2014-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesMarch has been an up-and-down stretch for the stock market, but it is turning into a month of milestones nonetheless. The bull market reached its fifth anniversary last weekend, and if the trend continues this week, on Saturday it will become the fifth-longest bull market since 1928. Already, it\u2019s the fourth-strongest bull, with a gain of more than 172 percent in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. All of this is undoubtedly reason for celebration, especially for the affluent households that hold the bulk of the wealth and have benefited most from the stock market\u2019s big rebound. But for anyone with even a modest stake in the market \u2014 as well as for Janet L. Yellen and the other Fed policy makers who are at least partly responsible for the market\u2019s rise \u2014 the startling increase in asset prices also raises difficult questions. For market strategists, chief among them may be this: How will the bull market respond as the Fed throttles its accommodative monetary policy? When the Federal Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, with Ms. Yellen at the helm for the first time, policy makers are expected to discuss how to proceed with the tightening of monetary policy without causing serious problems for financial markets. Unleashing that policy in the first place had powerful effects, which the central bank has acknowledged. After the stock market hit bottom, Ben S. Bernanke, then the Fed chairman, and other Fed officials said repeatedly that by bringing down bond yields and making credit more available, they hoped to increase the appeal of riskier assets like stocks, stimulating the economy. By the Fed\u2019s own criteria, the economic recovery is still incomplete. But the restoration of prices to their pre-financial-crisis levels has already occurred in many asset categories, and then some. (As big as the stock market rally has been, it\u2019s far from the strongest or the longest we\u2019ve seen. The rally from Dec. 4, 1987, to March 24, 2000, has a lock on first place in both categories, with a gain of 582 percent over that period, according to figures from the Bespoke Investment Group going back to 1928.) Central bank policies that lead to higher stock prices can distort financial markets, said Joseph G. Carson, director of global economic research at AllianceBernstein.\u201cHousehold debt and corporate debt have been reduced sharply,\u201d Mr. Carson said. \u201cBut the Fed has effectively moved the debt onto its own balance sheet. It\u2019s crucial that they unwind it, but the question is, how?\u201d The Fed has helped to sustain the bull market in stocks, and because home values have also risen in the last year, many middle-class people have begun to spend more freely, spurring short-term economic growth, he said. But one effect of Fed policies has been to widen wealth inequality. That\u2019s because the wealthy hold a high proportion of their assets in the stock market and benefit when the market rises, he said. What\u2019s more, stock market prices have increased far more rapidly than housing prices, and the net worth of less wealthy Americans is heavily concentrated in the value of their homes. In a note to clients, Mr. Carson pointed out that average home prices rose roughly 10 percent in 2013 while the S.&P. 500 index surged more than 30 percent, disproportionately benefiting those who held stock. And, of course, those with neither home equity nor financial assets fell further behind those who own both.The Fed\u2019s report, \u201cFinancial Accounts of the United States,\u201d broke down the figures this way: While the total value of real estate in the United States increased $2.3 trillion, the total value of stocks grew by $5.6 trillion. Even if such issues provide a subtext for Fed discussions, the direct effects of Fed policy on the stock and housing markets may not be an explicit part of the Fed\u2019s agenda this week. Still, the Fed closely monitors financial market price levels, and it has taken on growing responsibility for maintaining the stability of the entire financial system. In congressional testimony, Ms. Yellen has said that the central bank needs to \u201cattempt to detect asset bubbles\u201d in both the stock and the housing markets. She has also said that she sees no such bubbles in evidence now. There may not be full-blown bubbles at this moment. But valuations have become much less attractive as prices have risen. Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, is among those who have argued vigorously that the Fed needs to cut back sharply on its monetary stimulus because it has, in his view, been feeding speculative bubbles. Mr. Fisher\u2019s view appears to be a minority one at the Fed, but he makes some telling points. Certainly, as the stock market reaches ever more impressive milestones, it\u2019s important, as he says, to monitor market indicators very carefully, \u201cto ensure that the ghost of \u2018irrational exuberance\u2019 does not haunt us again.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Tries to Assuage Fears Over U.S. Trade Deal", "Date": "2014-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The top trade official for the European Union sought on Thursday to soothe opposition to a planned deal with the United States by imposing a 90-day period for the public to comment on protections for investors and companies.The talks on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership aimed at cutting tariffs and easing the burden of regulation on companies have been underway since last year. But they have progressed less rapidly than some officials had hoped, partly because of a clause that would allow companies to sue any member state for failing to comply with the terms of an eventual Transatlantic partnership.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the general public is much more interested in this deal than in any other deal before,\u201d Mr. De Gucht said. He said the outcry over matters including protections for investors and companies was because \u201cthe two biggest economies in the world are speaking to each other.\u201dMr. De Gucht acknowledged that similar clauses elsewhere had \u201cresulted in some very worrying examples of litigation against the state.\u201d Philip Morris International, the tobacco company, for instance, challenged Australia for requiring plain, brown packaging for cigarettes as a breach of Australia\u2019s bilateral investment deal with Hong Kong. Mr. De Gucht noted that the case, filed in 2011, was still in progress.But Mr. De Gucht said Europe still needed to agree on ways to allow investors and corporations to enforce the terms of a trade deal in order to reach an accord with the United States. A failure to include them would mean that the United States would \u201chave to withdraw from their normal practice\u201d and \u201cwe won\u2019t have an agreement then anymore.\u201dOne of the major sticking points to an agreement in Europe is a legal tool known as an investor-to-state dispute settlement. This approach is aimed at ensuring governments comply with obligations they have agreed to by allowing companies to bring a lawsuit directly against a country. European Union officials say it is becoming an increasingly common component of trade and investment agreements around the world.But labor unions and environmentalists say this tool could be used to weaken European standards in areas like environmental protection, food safety and publicly funded health care.There is also skepticism among governments. Sigmar Gabriel, the German economy minister, told Mr. De Gucht in a letter dated March 26 that \u201cspecial investment-protection provisions are not required in an agreement between the E.U. and the U.S.,\u201d according to an official who had seen the letter.The Europeans have promoted a trade pact with the United States as a relatively easy way of increasing growth and creating jobs in the wake of the prolonged financial and economic crises that began six years ago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise of Anti-Capitalism", "Date": "2014-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionWE are beginning to witness a paradox at the heart of capitalism, one that has propelled it to greatness but is now threatening its future: The inherent dynamism of competitive markets is bringing costs so far down that many goods and services are becoming nearly free, abundant, and no longer subject to market forces. While economists have always welcomed a reduction in marginal cost, they never anticipated the possibility of a technological revolution that might bring those costs to near zero.The first inkling of the paradox came in 1999 when Napster, the music service, developed a network enabling millions of people to share music without paying the producers and artists, wreaking havoc on the music industry. Similar phenomena went on to severely disrupt the newspaper and book publishing industries. Consumers began sharing their own information and entertainment, via videos, audio and text, nearly free, bypassing the traditional markets altogether.The huge reduction in marginal cost shook those industries and is now beginning to reshape energy, manufacturing and education. Although the fixed costs of solar and wind technology are somewhat pricey, the cost of capturing each unit of energy beyond that is low. This phenomenon has even penetrated the manufacturing sector. Thousands of hobbyists are already making their own products using 3-D printers, open-source software and recycled plastic as feedstock, at near zero marginal cost. Meanwhile, more than six million students are enrolled in free massive open online courses, the content of which is distributed at near zero marginal cost.Industry watchers acknowledge the creeping reality of a zero-marginal-cost economy, but argue that free products and services will entice a sufficient number of consumers to purchase higher-end goods and specialized services, ensuring large enough profit margins to allow the capitalist market to continue to grow. But the number of people willing to pay for additional premium goods and services is limited.Now the phenomenon is about to affect the whole economy. A formidable new technology infrastructure \u2014 the Internet of Things \u2014 is emerging with the potential to push much of economic life to near zero marginal cost over the course of the next two decades. This new technology platform is beginning to connect everything and everyone. Today more than 11 billion sensors are attached to natural resources, production lines, the electricity grid, logistics networks and recycling flows, and implanted in homes, offices, stores and vehicles, feeding big data into the Internet of Things. By 2020, it is projected that at least 50 billion sensors will connect to it.People can connect to the network and use big data, analytics and algorithms to accelerate efficiency and lower the marginal cost of producing and sharing a wide range of products and services to near zero, just as they now do with information goods. For example, 37 million buildings in the United States have been equipped with meters and sensors connected to the Internet of Things, providing real-time information on the usage and changing price of electricity on the transmission grid. This will eventually allow households and businesses that are generating and storing green electricity on-site from their solar and wind installations to program software to take them off the electricity grid when the price spikes so they can power their facilities with their own green electricity and share surplus with neighbors at near zero marginal cost.Cisco forecasts that by 2022, the private sector productivity gains wrought by the Internet of Things will exceed $14 trillion. A General Electric study estimates that productivity advances from the Internet of Things could affect half the global economy by 2025.THE unresolved question is, how will this economy of the future function when millions of people can make and share goods and services nearly free? The answer lies in the civil society, which consists of nonprofit organizations that attend to the things in life we make and share as a community. In dollar terms, the world of nonprofits is a powerful force. Nonprofit revenues grew at a robust rate of 41 percent \u2014 after adjusting for inflation \u2014 from 2000 to 2010, more than doubling the growth of gross domestic product, which increased by 16.4 percent during the same period. In 2012, the nonprofit sector in the United States accounted for 5.5 percent of G.D.P. What makes the social commons more relevant today is that we are constructing an Internet of Things infrastructure that optimizes collaboration, universal access and inclusion, all of which are critical to the creation of social capital and the ushering in of a sharing economy. The Internet of Things is a game-changing platform that enables an emerging collaborative commons to flourish alongside the capitalist market.This collaborative rather than capitalistic approach is about shared access rather than private ownership. For example, 1.7 million people globally are members of car-sharing services. A recent survey found that the number of vehicles owned by car-sharing participants decreased by half after joining the service, with members preferring access over ownership. Millions of people are using social media sites, redistribution networks, rentals and cooperatives to share not only cars but also homes, clothes, tools, toys and other items at low or near zero marginal cost. The sharing economy had projected revenues of $3.5 billion in 2013.Nowhere is the zero marginal cost phenomenon having more impact than the labor market, where workerless factories and offices, virtual retailing and automated logistics and transport networks are becoming more prevalent. Not surprisingly, the new employment opportunities lie in the collaborative commons in fields that tend to be nonprofit and strengthen social infrastructure \u2014 education, health care, aiding the poor, environmental restoration, child care and care for the elderly, the promotion of the arts and recreation. In the United States, the number of nonprofit organizations grew by approximately 25 percent between 2001 and 2011, from 1.3 million to 1.6 million, compared with profit-making enterprises, which grew by a mere one-half of 1 percent. In the United States, Canada and Britain, employment in the nonprofit sector currently exceeds 10 percent of the work force. Despite this impressive growth, many economists argue that the nonprofit sector is not a self-sufficient economic force but rather a parasite, dependent on government entitlements and private philanthropy. Quite the contrary. A recent study revealed that approximately 50 percent of the aggregate revenue of the nonprofit sectors of 34 countries comes from fees, while government support accounts for 36 percent of the revenues and private philanthropy for 14 percent.As for the capitalist system, it is likely to remain with us far into the future, albeit in a more streamlined role, primarily as an aggregator of network services and solutions, allowing it to thrive as a powerful niche player in the coming era. We are, however, entering a world partly beyond markets, where we are learning how to live together in an increasingly interdependent, collaborative, global commons.The author of \u201cThe Zero Marginal Cost Society.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Data Suggests Economy Is Gaining Strength", "Date": "2014-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFactory activity rebounded from an eight-month low last month, and consumer spending increased more than expected, suggesting the economy was regaining some strength after slowing abruptly in recent months.Many analysts said the signs of a comeback should bolster the Federal Reserve\u2019s resolve to keep scaling back its monetary stimulus campaign.\u201cThe economy is beginning the slow process of digging its way out of the weather-induced slowdown of recent months,\u201d said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. \u201cThis upward momentum should be sustained in the coming months.\u201dThe Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 53.2 last month after slumping in January to 51.3, which was the weakest reading since last May. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. New orders bounced back, as did supplier deliveries, inventories and order backlogs. However, production slipped for a third straight month.Manufacturers said cold weather was still affecting operations, by hampering logistics, causing backups at ports and disrupting supplies of raw materials. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said consumer spending increased 0.4 percent in January after a 0.1 percent gain in December. Economists had predicted that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economic activity in the United States, would rise only 0.1 percent.The increase in spending was driven by a 0.9 percent jump in outlays for services, the biggest gain since October 2001. The increase probably reflected a surge in demand for utilities because of the cold weather, and increased spending on health care after President Obama\u2019s signature 2010 health care law took effect.\u201cWe have argued before that higher demand for utilities will work as an automatic stabilizer for consumer spending during the unusually cold winter months,\u201d said Harm Bandholz, chief United States economist at UniCredit Research in New York. \u201cIt should dispel concerns about a too-dramatic economic slowdown.\u201dThe spending data led Barclays to raise its forecast for first-quarter economic growth by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 2 percent annual rate.

{"Headline": "European Union's Banking Union Can Work", "Date": "2014-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyThe European Union\u2019s half-baked banking union could be made to work, even though it wasn\u2019t strictly needed to solve the euro zone\u2019s problems and what has been agreed upon isn\u2019t what the designers wanted.The original advocates of a banking union saw it as a way to prevent the euro\u2019s collapse during the dark days of early 2012. The idea was that a well- financed eurowide deposit insurance system would stop savers from panicking. Meanwhile, if banks got into trouble, a strong eurowide safety net could bail them out.During the crisis, savers and investors lost faith in the ability of weak governments to rescue their banks. That is why banking union enthusiasts wanted eurowide support systems.In the end, what has emerged from the European policy factory is completely different. Germany latched onto a part of the banking union idea that hadn\u2019t previously gotten much attention, centralized supervision of banks, and rejected the idea of common deposit insurance. It did not want to be on the hook for bailing out other countries\u2019 banks. Berlin also diluted the plan for a eurowide safety net for weak banks, though the European Parliament is still trying to beef it up.Despite all this, a banking union would not have to be a disaster. To see this, it is important to understand why the euro zone does not need one.In 2012, much was made of the \u201cdoom loop\u201d that connected weak banks and weak governments. This had two elements: Weak banks dragged their governments down if the governments had to bail them out; and weak states dragged their banks down if the banks bought too many of their bonds.This doom loop was, and remains, a serious flaw. But it is a mistake to think the only way to cut the loop is with eurowide bailouts. There are better alternatives.Look first at the problem that weak banks infect their governments. This is a problem only if taxpayers have to rescue them. But who said governments should be in the business of bailing out banks? It is much better to make banks safe enough so that they do not get in trouble in the first place, and, if they do, to require their investors to foot the bill.That, indeed, is the broad program that governments around the globe have been pursuing for the past five years. It involves preventing credit bubbles, forcing banks to hold more capital, \u201cbailing in\u201d bondholders if they run out of equity and restructuring lenders so it is easy to close them down, if necessary.The European Union is doing all this too. But it did not require a banking union to push it forward.That said, the European Central Bank could speed up some of these initiatives.First, the central bank needs to work out how it is going to stop bubbles. In its new supervisory role, it will have what is known as \u201cmacroprudential\u201d powers. This will allow it to tell national authorities to do things like increase banks\u2019 capital ratios if it fears credit is growing too strongly.The snag is that too many cooks may spoil the broth, as there are multiple bodies with macroprudential responsibility for all or parts of the euro zone. Even the central bank will have two units \u2014 the new bank supervisor and its financial stability directorate. It needs to provide clarity on who is going to do what.Second, many banks do not have enough debt that could be easily bailed in if they run out of enough equity. The solution is to require all banks to hold a minimum amount of bail-in debt so that taxpayers do not have to ride to the rescue. This can be done without a banking union. Indeed, the Group of 20 nations have asked for a global proposal later this year. The central bank should use its influence to produce a robust proposal.Then there is the matter of avoiding situations in which banks are deemed too important to fail because their bankruptcy would cause havoc for the whole system \u2014 and so again have to be rescued. Part of the solution is to require lenders to draw up \u201cresolution plans\u201d that spell out exactly how they can be packed off to the slaughterhouse without too much contagion.Again, a banking union is not required. But, as a result of it, the E.C.B. will be responsible for vetting euro zone banks\u2019 resolution plans. With luck, the central bank will be less susceptible than national supervisors to lobbying by national champions, and so force banks to restructure themselves if that is what is needed to stop the too-big-to-fail phenomenon.Now look at the other half of the doom loop \u2014 how weak nations infect their banks. Yet again, a banking union per se does nothing to address that problem. It can be dealt with only if lenders are told they cannot hold more than a certain amount of their own governments\u2019 bonds.The central bank would prefer to impose such limits as part of a global system. The snag is that countries with their own currencies and central banks do not have such a need to follow suit. So the bank may, at some point, have to face going it alone. It will not be easy for the bank to bite these bullets. But it will need to, if the euro zone\u2019s half-baked banking union is to be turned into something that is fit for its purpose.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Break Up the Bank? It\u2019s Not for You to Ask", "Date": "2014-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameJPMorgan Chase is trying to put its troubles behind it. Having agreed to pay a $13 billion settlement to the government for its past mortgage-lending misdeeds, it wants to move on. At the big \u201cInvestor Day\u201d meeting with shareholders last week, Jamie Dimon, its chief executive, and his top lieutenants extolled the bank\u2019s strong and diversified position in its four main businesses. \u201cI am so damn proud of this company,\u201d Mr. Dimon exclaimed.But not so fast. Proxy season is around the corner. And, behind the scenes, a skirmish is flaring over what will be put to an investor vote at the bank\u2019s annual shareholder meeting this spring. Such private battles rage every year in companies across the country, pitting shareholders, who want to hear other owners\u2019 views on topics related to management, against company officials who\u2019d rather not. The Securities and Exchange Commission adjudicates these disputes, deciding which shareholder proposals must be included on a company\u2019s proxy. Among the more interesting proposals this year is from Michael C. Davidson, a tax accountant and individual investor in Portland, Ore., who owns about 300 JPMorgan Chase shares. The S.E.C. hasn\u2019t yet ruled on whether it will require the bank to have shareholders vote on the idea. While Mr. Davidson, 72, is new to the shareholder proposal business, the topic he has seized upon is a venerable one \u2014 specifically, how to resolve the problem of financial institutions that are too big and interconnected to be allowed to fail. This threat was supposed to have been eliminated by the Dodd-Frank law of 2010. But it wasn\u2019t, as a throng of experts has acknowledged. Among them are Ben S. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman; Janet L. Yellen, the current Fed chairwoman; William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and Richard W. Fisher, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. In Mr. Davidson\u2019s view, it\u2019s high time for big-bank shareholders to weigh in on this crucial issue. His proposal, should the S.E.C. allow it to stand, recommends separating JPMorgan\u2019s commercial bank operations from its investment banking and asset management units, similar to the way banks operated after the Glass-Steagall law was passed in the 1930s. The proposal asks the company\u2019s board to create a committee of independent directors \u201cto develop a plan for divesting all noncore banking business segments\u201d and to report to shareholders on that plan within 120 days.Mr. Davidson said in a recent interview that between the $13 billion settlement paid by shareholders and the nice raise the board gave to Mr. Dimon, \u201cI really think they\u2019re not looking out for investors\u2019 interests.\u201d He added: \u201cI hope the proposal is allowed to appear because I think there should be some kind of debate going on among shareholders on this.\u201d JPMorgan, of course, disagrees. Its lawyers have argued at length to the S.E.C. that the proposal should be excluded from its proxy. The main reason, the bank contends, is that the proposal involves \u201cordinary business\u201d or \u201croutine matters,\u201d which under S.E.C. rules can be exempted from a shareholder vote. \u201cThe philosophy is that ordinary business matters are best left to the management and board, but some situations raise a significant policy issue on which it is appropriate for shareholders to advise,\u201d Mr. Hitchcock explained. \u201cThe classic example from many years ago was whether electric utilities should not invest in nuclear power. In that case, the S.E.C. said nuclear energy raises significant policy issues and shareholders have the right to advise.\u201d Even if the S.E.C. allowed the proposal to be put on the proxy and a majority of shareholders supported it, JPMorgan wouldn\u2019t have to abide by its terms. As a so-called precatory proposal, it is not legally binding on the company. Still, JPMorgan wants to keep it off the ballot.Among the topics broached in these proposals were executive pay, disclosures surrounding a company\u2019s political contributions and the repeal of classified boards, where director elections are staggered to protect against the ouster of an entire board at one time.Mr. Davidson says he thinks his proposal is important, and not only because it would let shareholders express their views on an issue affecting the entire economy. He said JPMorgan shareholders would be better off if the bank was broken up because the individual parts could be more valuable than the combined entity. As precedent, he points to the early 1980s, when AT&T was broken up into regional telephone companies. \u201cLooking back at the AT&T breakup, the shareholders made out like bandits because the thing was worth a lot more in pieces than whole,\u201d Mr. Davidson said. \u201cJPMorgan is identical \u2014 it\u2019s got this banking side and risk-taking side. If you break it in half, it\u2019s going to be worth more to shareholders.\u201dNevertheless, given some of the management missteps at JPMorgan in recent years \u2014 most notably the London Whale mess \u2014 and its regulatory run-ins, it certainly seems appropriate to ask shareholders whether they think the institution is too big to manage. Even as simply a point of information, such a vote could be revealing. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Venezuela, Conciliatory Talk but Combative Tactics", "Date": "2014-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Acting on the orders of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, riot police officers and soldiers this week blocked a march of thousands of student protesters, doused them with pepper spray, blasted them with water cannons and bombarded them with tear gas.A few hours later, Mr. Maduro invited the student protest leaders to sit down to peace talks, promising to listen and chat \u201cwith respect and affection.\u201dAfter more than a month of protests and bloody unrest, Mr. Maduro has tried to blunt the greatest political challenge to his young presidency in two distinct ways: He has projected an image of openness and inclusion, while simultaneously cracking down.Mr. Maduro has repeatedly called for dialogue, even holding a series of televised meetings that he calls peace conferences. But with only a handful of his opponents attending the conferences, and with security forces striking out at demonstrators around the country, some of his opponents say that Mr. Maduro\u2019s kinder face is likely intended only to deflect international criticism, which has come most strongly from the United States. They say his police tactics aim to provoke the demonstrators.But his supporters say he is trying to restore order.On Wednesday, events followed a now-familiar trajectory. After police officers and soldiers blocked what had been a peaceful march of thousands of students and other protesters before they could reach the center of Caracas, angry demonstrators began throwing rocks. The police responded with tear gas, and an ugly melee ensued.\u201cWe wanted to have a peaceful march, but the government wants us to look like the bad guys,\u201d said Antonio Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez, 39, the manager of an electrical goods store, who had joined the student-led march. As many others had, he stayed on to watch the confrontation, retreating occasionally when the sting of tear gas became too strong.But he did not condemn the protesters\u2019 violent reaction. \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d he said. \u201cThey have guns. We have rocks and the flag.\u201dThe wave of protests rocking Venezuela, which has the world\u2019s largest oil reserves and is a major energy supplier to the United States, began in early February with student demonstrations against the country\u2019s high rate of violent crime.The protests soon widened to encompass frustrations over the crippled economy, pent-up opposition anger at the governing party\u2019s monopoly on power and, now, the aggressive tactics against demonstrators ordered by Mr. Maduro, a leftist who vows to continue the socialist-inspired revolution of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the longtime president who died last year.The student-led march on Wednesday was held a month after two protesters and a government supporter were shot dead during a day of demonstrations in Caracas, the first in a string of what the government says are more than two dozen deaths linked to protests around the country.The death toll grew on Wednesday when the government said that three people, including a student and a National Guard officer, were fatally shot in Valencia, the country\u2019s third largest city.The government has routinely sought to block and outmaneuver the protesters, and that was true as well on Wednesday in Caracas, when, even as it refused to allow the opposition march, it organized a march of its own student supporters.The government also staged what it called a \u201cConcert for Peace\u201d at a spot that concentrated its supporters in an area that could bring them into conflict with the protesters.The protest march, which included students and other government opponents, started without trouble in an opposition enclave and then moved through the leafy campus of the Central University of Venezuela, one of the country\u2019s main universities and a Unesco World Heritage site, renowned for its modernist architecture and works of public art.But when the marchers tried to leave the campus, they found their way blocked by the phalanx of police officers and National Guard soldiers.After meeting with officers in charge of the blockade, a group of student leaders announced they had been told that once the pro-government countermarch passed, they would be allowed to proceed.But the negotiations with the police dragged on and tensions rose, with many marchers chanting \u201cLet us pass!\u201d Dozens of hard-core protesters began to gather at the front of the march, near police lines, many covering their faces with bandannas or T-shirts, against the admonition of student leaders, who used megaphones to urge nonviolence.\u201cThey want to provoke us to fight with them and then Maduro will come out and say that they are the protectors of the people,\u201d said one of the hooded protesters, Manuel Madrid, 17, a high school student, who nonetheless said he was ready to do battle with the police. He wore a thick glove on his right hand to protect it when hurling tear gas canisters back at the police.Finally, after about an hour and a half, negotiations with the police broke down.Several student leaders went to the front of the march, linked arms and then walked into the line of riot police officers, who repelled them with plastic shields. They were doused with a torrent of pepper spray and drenched by water cannons.A few protesters threw stones at the police, but others in the crowd urged calm. There was a brief pause, and then the student leaders tried again to restart the march. Again they were pushed back, pepper sprayed and hit with jets of water.More stones started to fly, the police responded with tear gas, and the entrance to the landmark campus turned into a battleground.The students marchers had intended to reach the office of the defender of the people, a national ombudsman.Instead, Mr. Maduro went there later in the day to stage a television broadcast, which was depicted as a \u201cpeace conference\u201d with pro-government students.He defended his decision to block the protest march. \u201cIf this group, infiltrated by violent fascist groups, had entered Caracas, by now we would be lamenting I don\u2019t know how many material losses and losses of life,\u201d Mr. Maduro said.At the same time, he extended his invitation to the student protest leaders to meet with him.\u201cI will listen to everything they have to tell me and then they have to listen to me,\u201d Mr. Maduro said. \u201cEverything I am going to say, I will say it with respect and affection.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consumer Confidence Rebounds, but Uncertainty Lingers", "Date": "2014-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsTHE American economy continues to improve, month after month, according to a survey of consumers.But even as those consumers have become steadily more confident in the present, they have not become more confident about the future. While their optimism now is much higher than it was at the depth of the financial crisis in 2009, it remains below the levels seen as recently as last summer.The Conference Board reported this week that its overall index of consumer confidence climbed to 82.3 in March, the highest reading since January 2008, just as the recession was beginning.But the two components of the index provided two different perspectives, as can be seen in the accompanying charts.The present-situation index has been rising fairly steadily since it hit bottom at the end of 2009, although it slipped slightly in March, according to the preliminary figures. But the expectations index, based on consumer forecasts for six months later, remains well below where it was in early 2011, when enthusiasm grew over prospects for recovery. The present-situations index is based on answers to two questions. The first asks if current business conditions are good, normal or bad. In March, nearly as many Americans characterized the conditions as good (22.9 percent) as saw them as bad (23.1 percent). Not since the beginning of 2008 has that difference been as narrow.The second question asks about the state of the job market. Respondents are given three choices \u2014 that jobs are \u201cplentiful,\u201d that they are \u201cnot so plentiful\u201d or that they are \u201chard to get.\u201dThere, the improvement has not been as visible. But there has been a steady decline in the proportion of people who think jobs are hard to get, from nearly half of respondents at the worst to about a third in recent months. The proportion who say jobs are plentiful \u2014 a view that finds little support in news coverage of the job picture despite a steady fall in the unemployment rate \u2014 was just 13.1 percent in March. That was down a little from the previous month, but otherwise was higher than at any time since 2008.The expectations index is based on three questions, and the answers to them have bounced around in a range for the last couple of years. Two of the questions are shown in the charts, each reflected by the percentage that expects improvement less the percentage that expects things to get worse.On business conditions, Americans expect improvement by a margin of 7.4 percentage points, with 18.1 percent saying conditions will improve and 10.7 percent forecasting the opposite, while the majority expects no change. On employment, the margin is a negative 4.1 percentage points, with 13.9 percent expecting more jobs and 18 percent expecting fewer.For both those questions, the current views are much more optimistic than they were at the depths of the recession, but they remain within a range that has now held for two years.The third question for expectations, not shown in the charts, concerns whether people expect their own income to rise or fall in the next six months. The latest figures show a bare plurality expects improvement, while a plurality expected things to get worse as recently as December. In all, the view from Main Street seems to be of a steady improvement in economic conditions, but with little confidence that the improvement will last.Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Currency of China Continues to Decline", "Date": "2014-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The value of China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, continued to slide against the United States dollar on Friday, rattling investors by falling to its lowest level in nearly a year before closing higher.The weakness in the renminbi, which has been dropping steadily in 2014, reverses a trend of gradual incremental appreciation against the dollar and other major currencies during the last eight years.Analysts say China\u2019s central bank is intervening heavily in the currency markets, intentionally engineering a slide in the value of the Chinese currency to punish speculators and prevent huge capital flows, or so-called hot money, from entering the country. The huge inflows of capital are showing up in China\u2019s economic figures, with some analysts estimating hot money inflows last year at $150 billion. The authorities worry that the large inflows could generate inflationary pressure and complicate the central government\u2019s effort to revamp China\u2019s economy, improve the banking system and eventually free up interest rates. The move comes just before the start of high-level government planning meetings, which could prompt further economic reforms. Some analysts say they think the government could soon move to widen the renminbi\u2019s daily trading band, increasing the amount by which the currency\u2019s value can fluctuate in either direction. The idea would be to make the currency more flexible, allowing for greater use in global commerce and trade. To some, the recent volatility is the government\u2019s way of showing that the value can go down as well as up. Lawmakers in the United States, for one, want China to loosen its hold on the currency, long a source of tension. The latest drop in the renminbi caps off a volatile period for the currency. Since the beginning of January, it has lost around 1.5 percent of its value against the dollar. On Friday, the renminbi lost 0.3 percent of its value, hitting 6.145 to the dollar; the intraday drop of almost 1 percent was the biggest in years.The sudden drop has surprised investors, who have become accustomed to a slow and steady rise in the currency. Last year, the renminbi was one of the world\u2019s strongest-performing currencies, rising 3 percent against the dollar.The recent currency weakness has weighed on the markets, which have been rattled lately by a slowdown in the vast real estate market and other economic concerns. This week, the CSI 300 index of big companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets dropped more than 3.5 percent. While the Chinese authorities maintain tight control over the flow of money into the country, global investors have found ways to funnel hot money into China, often through trade financing deals. Speculators do so hoping to capitalize on something not so easy to find outside China: an economy wedded to fast growth, high interest rates and a steadily appreciating currency.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to completely stop\u201d hot money from flowing into China, Wang Tao, the chief China economist at UBS, said. \u201cOffshore, the interest rates are low; Chinese interest rates are really high. And if the exchange rate is appreciating, investors view it as a win-win.\u201d By weakening the value of the renminbi, the authorities here apparently hope to make it harder for speculators to engage in a one-way bet on a rising renminbi, in what is essentially an arbitrage game between interest rates in the advanced economies outside and higher rates in the more tightly controlled Chinese system. For speculators, currency appreciation is seen as an added benefit.But low interest rates in the United States and Europe mean there are few places to invest. At the same time, Chinese companies are desperate for cash because of rising interest rates at home and tighter bank liquidity. Analysts say the government wants speculators to know that making such a bet on appreciation could backfire, if appreciation slows or even reverses course, and that is why the last few days have been so volatile.In a statement this week, China\u2019s State Administration of Foreign Exchange, a division under the central bank, suggested the market volatility had been normal. \u201cThe recent movement of the renminbi exchange rate is the result of market players adjusting their near-term renminbi trading strategies,\u201d it said. \u201cThe degree of exchange rate volatility is normal by the standards of developed and emerging markets. There is no need to overinterpret it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the drop of the renminbi against the dollar on Friday. It was a drop of 0.3 percent, or 6.145 to the dollar, not \u201cnearly 1 percent,\u201d or 6.18 to the dollar. (An earlier version of the headline repeated the error.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Have All the Raises Gone?", "Date": "2014-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialMost people who work for a living know that for a long time now, raises have been few and far between. Wages typically fall or stagnate in recessions, and the Great Recession was particularly severe, exerting a drag on pay that persists to this day. The findings help to explain the trajectory in wages for workers with bachelor\u2019s degrees. From 1979 to 1995, their average pay rose modestly, by 0.46 percent on average annually, while wages declined for the non-college-educated who make up the vast majority of workers. From 1995 to 2000, wages grew for all educational groups, but since 2002 pay for the less educated has declined while pay for the college educated has largely stagnated. While economic recovery and more college education are generally believed to lift wages, that didn\u2019t happen in the 2000s and hasn\u2019t since the end of the last recession. What\u2019s needed to raise pay are policies like a higher minimum wage; trade pacts that foster high labor and regulatory standards; and more support for union organizing. Increasing the number of high-paying jobs also depends on strategies like enhancing public spending to fix roads and bridges and to hire more teachers, as well as developing new energy and technology industries through government-financed research. Otherwise, the norm may very well be an economy where even college-educated workers cannot thrive. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Murray L. Weidenbaum, Reagan Economist, Dies at 87", "Date": "2014-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMurray L. Weidenbaum, who as President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first chief economic adviser elevated government regulation of business to the forefront of public policy debate, but resigned unhappy about the administration\u2019s budget-making, died on Thursday in St. Louis. He was 87.His son, Jim, confirmed the death.Mr. Weidenbaum, a Bronx-born economist, was fond of saying, \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there, undo something.\u201d And he did, beginning in 1981, when the newly inaugurated Mr. Reagan appointed him chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.Reducing the size of government and loosening its regulatory hold on the private sector became a large theme of the Reagan presidency, which began with inflation still running in double digits and the economy heading into recession. The banking, broadcasting and food and drug industries were a particular focus.Deregulation, the White House believed, would help stimulate the economy by reducing the government rules and restrictions that industries say hamper their ability to expand and create jobs. But the policy\u2019s critics feared that an unfettered private sector could be dangerous to the economy and the public interest.At the heart of what came to be known as Reaganomics was the proposition that the nation could be restored to economic health through fiscally stimulating tax cuts \u2014 the essence of supply-side economic theory \u2014 and by restricting the money supply to contain inflation. Critics of the administration called that combination contradictory.Mr. Weidenbaum, a wry and slightly rumpled figure who had long shuttled between government and academic posts, previously at Washington University in St. Louis, proved to be one of the administration\u2019s least doctrinaire members, neither full-throated supply-sider nor strict monetarist.\u201cI was sympathetic to both,\u201d Mr. Weidenbaum said in a 2011 telephone interview for this obituary. But neither side \u201cthought I was one of them.\u201dHe was also a prominent advocate of federal revenue-sharing, involving no-strings payments to states and localities. As an assistant secretary of the Treasury under President Richard M. Nixon, he had led a revenue-sharing initiative, which was briefly effective. But he wound up helping President Reagan dismantle the program when revenue sharing did not displace a proliferation of separate grants and payments to state and local governments voted for by Congress.Though fiscally conservative, Mr. Weidenbaum was more moderate than some of his peers in the White House. He was generally aligned with administration pragmatists like the budget director, David A. Stockman, and the chief of staff, James A. Baker III. They favored compromising with Democrats in Congress on raising tax revenue and cutting military spending because of their concern about deficits.Internal battles over budget deficits were a hallmark of the administration in those years.Mr. Weidenbaum, in the 2011 interview, said he left the administration after a year and a half precisely because he was unhappy with the 1983 budget, and chose to quit rather than defend it before Congress.Stepping down in August 1982, a time when Mr. Reagan\u2019s popularity had plummeted and the country was sinking into a deep recession, Mr. Weidenbaum was replaced by Martin S. Feldstein.\u201cAfter fighting the good fight, I quietly folded my tent and returned to St. Louis,\u201d Mr. Weidenbaum said.\u201cFor the first time in decades, no new major regulatory activities were enacted or promulgated,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn fact, many burdensome regulations were modified or rescinded.\u201dMr. Weidenbaum also expressed general satisfaction with the administration\u2019s policy in a 2005 memoir, \u201cAdvising Reagan: Making Economic Policy, 1981-82.\u201d\u201cIt seems clear that, on balance, Reaganomics was a success,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe president\u2019s policies had injected a new sense of realism into the decision making in the private sector,\u201d as both management and workers paid more attention to controlling costs and raising productivity.Murray Lew Weidenbaum (the first syllable rhymes with \u201cfeed\u201d) was born on Feb. 10, 1927, into a liberal Democratic household in the Bronx. He graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn and the City College of New York, where he was elected president of the student body on a platform of \u201cWine, Women and Weidenbaum.\u201dMr. Weidenbaum received a master\u2019s degree from Columbia University, then joined the New York State Department of Labor as a junior economist. At the time, like his family, he held union-friendly views, and saw labor as the little guy at the mercy of big business. But he grew disillusioned with the labor cause after being assigned to a statistical analysis of a master contract for the Teamsters union. His encounter with an independent trucker who had vainly sought to negotiate on his own was a pivotal moment.\u201cThe roles were reversed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe little employer was dealing with the giant union.\u201dLaid off under New York State\u2019s \u201clast in, first out\u201d policy, he found work in Washington at the Bureau of the Budget. During a leave to pursue doctoral work at Princeton, he met Phyllis Green. They married in 1954.Besides his son, Jim, he is survived by two daughters, Laurie Stark and Susan Juster-Goldstein, and six grandchildren.After marriage, he began a life characterized by the title of a 2009 autobiographical monograph, \u201cVignettes From a Peripatetic Professor,\u201d moving among academia, government, industry and research institutes in Washington and elsewhere.Mr. Weidenbaum had an early, formative stint in the military industry. The General Dynamics Corporation in Fort Worth hired him as an economist and had him analyze the operations of the B-58 supersonic bomber. Moving to Boeing, in Seattle, he developed forecasts of the military market.The jobs exposed him to the numerous rules military contractors were subject to, underscored by the full-time presence of inspectors stationed in the factories.\u201cThere\u2019s more government regulation of the defense industry than any other,\u201d Mr. Weidenbaum said in the 2011 interview, adding that complaints were seldom voiced for fear of offending the main customer, the government itself.After Boeing, he moved to the Stanford Research Institute in California to continue studying the military industry.That was followed by a turn in Washington as the staff director of President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.He moved to St. Louis in early 1975 when Washington University created the Center for the Study of American Business and recruited him to be its first director. He was there when Mr. Reagan lured him back to the White House.The center gave him a platform from which to express his views on deficit spending \u2014 \u201cI conclude that deficits do not matter, but that Treasury borrowing and money creation surely do\u201d \u2014 and on military spending and other economic matters. It also gave him an opportunity to display his dry sense of humor.Speaking at the center\u2019s annual policy conference in October 1982, he remarked, \u201cAt a time when, alas, economist jokes are in vogue, I would like to add my favorite wisecrack about our profession: If all the economists in the world were laid end to end, it might be a good thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Delphi Says Autonomous Cars Are Coming, but Only in Bits and Pieces", "Date": "2014-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cFully automated driving is decades away,\u201d Jeffrey J. Owens, chief technology officer and executive vice president at Delphi, said in an interview. \u201cThere are legal issues to address, and then there\u2019s the question of whether consumers will want to pay $5,000 to $10,000 more for an autonomous vehicle if they still have to be in the front seat and fully alert.\u201dIt\u2019s true that when many consumers think of self-driving cars, they imagine themselves in the back seat, accessing their mobile devices. Delphi doesn\u2019t think that rosy vision will be realized anytime soon.But many forms of in-car technology are advancing more rapidly. In the next 10 years, Mr. Owens said, new systems will make it possible for cars to have 50 percent fewer accidents and 100 percent better fuel economy. The connected vehicles the company is helping to develop, he said, will have up to two miles of wiring, some of which will be made \u2014 like the body of the new Ford F-150 truck \u2014 of lightweight aluminum.Delphi showcased some cars at the event to demonstrate its latest technology, much of it infotainment-based and not yet available on production cars.The same car was also outfitted with a camera and other gear to detect and warn an inattentive driver, as well as embryonic autonomous-driving software. The system suggested that Delphi believes that self-driving technology will be introduced at first on stretches of limited-access highway, and that drivers will need to be alerted \u2014 with increasing aggressiveness \u2014 to the necessity of reassuming command of the vehicle\u2019s controls.When the autonomous road approaches its end, a stern voice advises the human pilot to \u201cplace both hands on the steering wheel and look ahead in the driving direction.\u201d Alarms sound and bright displays flash if that message is ignored, and eventually, if the driver remains disengaged, the car will simply steer to a stop at the side of the road.On a yellow Fiat 500, Delphi showed off some new possibilities in infotainment. One of these was a natural voice-command system, which worked well when demonstrated by Jada Tapley, an engineering group manager. Another, an Apple interface that mirrors what\u2019s on the driver\u2019s mobile phone, sounded intriguing, but Delphi said it couldn\u2019t offer a demonstration.\u201cPer Apple, we are unable to demonstrate that function publicly,\u201d said Kristen Kinley, a spokeswoman for the electronics and safety division. \u201cIt\u2019s a concept that isn\u2019t ready to show.\u201dA Ferrari 458 Speciale was also on hand, outfitted with lightweight wiring. A Mercedes-Benz E350 offered satellite digital audio reception, and a Buick LaCrosse featured a collision warning system, adaptive cruise control and electronically scanning radar.

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Anemic Speech in Europe", "Date": "2014-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Having pivoted to Asia and done the de rigueur minimum over several years to keep the trans-Atlantic alliance off life-support, Barack Obama awakened with a jolt to Europe this week and, on his first visit to Brussels as president, spoke of \u201cinseparable allies\u201d with a shared mission to demonstrate that Russia cannot \u201crun roughshod over its neighbors.\u201dShaken from a view of Europe as a kind of 20th-century yawn, Obama spoke of freedom and the ideas that bind the United States and Europe still in an ongoing \u201ccontest of ideas\u201d against autocracy and \u201cbrute force.\u201d He rightly rejected the notion that this is \u201canother Cold War that we\u2019re entering into,\u201d noting that President Vladimir Putin of Russia represents \u201cno global ideology.\u201dHe spoke in timely fashion of \u201cour Article 5 duty\u201d under the North Atlantic Treaty to respond with force to any attack on a NATO country, important reassurance to the Baltic states, among others. This military commitment was backed by reference to the need for \u201cvery real contingency plans\u201d to protect NATO nations in Central and Eastern Europe. Those plans, to date, have been inadequate. Overall, the combination of sanctions against Russia, economic support for Ukraine, and the dispatch of additional military forces eastward sent a clear message to Putin \u2014 one that will not reverse Russia\u2019s Crimea annexation but may stop him going any further.Better late than never: The Russian president has benefited from the perception of a United States in full-tilt, war-weary retrenchment; of American red lines turning amber and then green; of a divided European Union; and a hollow NATO living more on the past than any vision of a 21st-century future. Obama has been making up for lost ground.Still, his Brussels speech, presented as a capstone of his visit and one of those Obama specials designed to offset with eloquence a deficit of deeds, was a poor performance overall, a jejune collection of nostrums about binding values of free-market Western societies and their appeal to the hearts (and pocketbooks) of people throughout the world, not least Ukrainians.The problem is not that these propositions are untrue. The United States and the European Union are still magnets to the poor and disenfranchised of the earth. The problem is not even that an argument that the Iraq war (with its myriad dead) is somehow more defensible than Crimea is impossible to win. The problem is Obama needed to be more honest. The fact is the Western democracies he was exalting have been failing to deliver, and autocrats of the world, bare-chested Putin included, benefit indirectly from the resulting disenchantment.It is not just the soaring unemployment in Europe (likely to prompt a surge by rightist anti-immigrant parties in European Parliament elections this year). It is not just the crisis (contained for now) of the euro and the unresolved issue of how the European integration needed to back the currency is to be achieved. It is not just the widespread disillusionment with a navel-gazing European Union seen as over-bureaucratic and under-democratic. It is not just the growing income disparities in both Europe and the United States, and the spreading middle-class dystopia, and the sense in democracies on both sides of the Atlantic that money has skewed fairness and electoral processes themselves. It is not just the sense that something has gone seriously wrong with a polarized American democracy where scorched-earth Republicans devote their politics to obstruction, and the government can grind to a halt as it did last year, and a C.E.O. can earn $80 million for a few weeks of work while incomes for most Americans are stagnant. It is not just the National Security Agency eavesdropping and data-vacuuming revelations. It\u2019s not just the loss of a sense of possibility for many young people.It is all of this. Unless Western societies find a way to shake their moroseness, level the playing field and rediscover, as Obama put it, the \u201csimple truth that all men, and women, are created equal,\u201d they are going to have a very hard time winning \u201cthe contest of ideas.\u201dInstead of a speech of weary worthiness, Obama should have addressed how an alliance neglected through much of his presidency can be revived; and how American and European democracies, for all their failings, can right themselves because that is the great distinguishing feature of open societies \u2014 their capacity for renewal.\u201cNow is not the time for bluster,\u201d Obama intoned. \u201cThe situation in Ukraine, like crises in many parts of the world, does not have easy answers nor a military solution.\u201dThis is true. But nor is it a time for clich\u00e9s about the wonders of democracy, freedom, open-market economies, the rule of law and other underpinnings of the West. Not when democracy seems blocked, freedom sometimes selective, open markets cruel and the law harshest on those who have least.Advertisement"}

Economists had expected a 0.2 percent gain. Along with the manufacturing increase, a gain in mining production, which offset a drop in utility output, helped lift overall industrial production 0.6 percent in February after a decline of 0.2 percent in JanuaryIn a separate report, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said its Empire State business conditions index, which measures factory activity in the state, rose to 5.61 in early March from 4.48 in February. New orders, shipments and inventories all increased.The manufacturing data added to evidence ranging from retail sales to employment that suggested the economy was regaining strength after an abrupt slowdown at the end of 2013 and early this year, as an unusually cold winter took its toll.Still, first-quarter growth was expected to be quite a bit weaker than it was in the final three months of 2013 as businesses work through a pile of unsold goods. Last month, the government estimated the economy expanded at a 2.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, but that figure was expected to be revised next week to about 3 percent.With job growth accelerating and manufacturing output rebounding, economists expect the Fed to announce another $10 billion reduction to its monthly bond purchases when the central bank\u2019s policy makers conclude a two-day meeting on Wednesday.\u201cThe gains should be enough to reassure policy makers at the Fed that the economy continues to make forward progress,\u201d said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics.A third report showed that sentiment among homebuilders edged up in March.

{"Headline": "The Biggest Election", "Date": "2014-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialA growing population guarantees that every national election in India is the largest election ever held. This year is no exception. More than 814 million citizens are eligible to vote in national elections scheduled to begin on April 7 and conclude on May 12. Much is riding on the results, which are expected on May 16. The Election Commission of India has time and again performed the amazing feat of getting mind-boggling numbers of voters to the polls \u2014 and then counting all those votes. There is every reason to believe that this next mammoth democratic exercise will be free and fair. Polls indicate that the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party is likely to win the most seats, though probably not enough to form a government without support from one or more of India\u2019s large regional parties. This leaves a very slim chance that the Indian National Congress could cobble together enough seats to remain a part of a governing coalition. There are many wild cards, including the impact of India\u2019s new Aam Aadmi Party, whose anticorruption campaign resonates with many voters. India\u2019s national elections are an achievement, but are only one of the pillars on which democracy depends. And here India\u2019s democracy has proved far shakier. Its Constitution promises much: It guarantees essential democratic rights, including equality before the law and freedom of religion and expression. It prohibits discrimination based on religion, caste or race, and it guarantees the right to an education. The Constitution also explicitly prohibits exploitation, forced labor and child labor.Yet in many of these areas, the country has fallen tragically short. While a vibrant economy has created a record number of billionaires and an aspiring middle class, grossly exploitive working conditions are the lot of many Indians, including children. The vast majority of young children are now enrolled in primary school, but many attend schools so poorly staffed and equipped that they cannot learn. The court system remains inefficient, with far too many cases languishing without resolution. Attacks on freedom of expression are increasingly common, with pressure and threats of the crudest kind casting a dangerous chill on the free exchange of ideas and opinions. These conditions pose serious threats to India\u2019s open society. That\u2019s why the next election will be crucial. Voter turnout is expected to be high. Indians hold dear their power to express their hopes and vent their frustrations at the ballot box. But if the next government cannot deliver the freedoms enshrined in the Constitution, India\u2019s democracy will have failed its citizens. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Story of Bridie and Mo", "Date": "2014-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorON a visit to Dublin in 2008, just before Ireland\u2019s economic collapse, I took a walk down to the Docklands at the edge of the River Liffey and was astonished to find that what had long been a sooty, rundown port of 19th-century warehouses had become one of the most modern and desirable neighborhoods in Europe \u2014 all luxury apartments and upscale hotels bathed in theatrical lighting, a glossy prairie of glass and steel. As I neared the docks, I met two red-haired girls dragging planks of wood out of a Dumpster. They were fitting the boards over the top of a makeshift little shack, creating the beginnings of a roof. Though the day was gloomy, with a brisk wind skirling in off the sea, one of the girls was in a sleeveless pink cotton dress and the other was shoeless and wore only a pair of red Capri pants. The two couldn\u2019t have been more than 7. I asked them what they were building. This was six years ago, but the girls were so vibrant I made note of our encounter. \u201cTis a bedroom, o\u2019 course,\u201d the smaller one said with mild impatience.I looked inside the half-finished structure and saw a mattress on the ground with a naked Barbie doll lying facedown in the middle of it, like a porn star down on her luck.\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cNot bad.\u201dThe girls grinned, and the small one said proudly, \u201cYap, we\u2019re working on it.\u201d She dealt Barbie a contemptuous kick. \u201cWhen it\u2019s done to its full completion, it\u2019ll be posh, like.\u201dThe sidewalk outside was strewn with trash \u2014 a rusted tricycle, a car seat, charred shoes. On a plywood wall that enclosed a new building site nearby, someone had chalked in a childish hand, \u201cBridie is a bich.\u201d\u201cAre you girls going to sleep in this bedroom?\u201d I asked. They leaned away from me and gave me a wary look, as though it was just dawning on them that I might be one of those dangerous individuals thoroughly unable to tell reality from fantasy. The little barefoot one, who was clearly the spokeswoman, said: \u201cAh, Christ, \u2019course not, Mrs. \u2019Tis only make believe! We live in them trailers beyond.\u201d She pointed at a huddle of shabby mobile homes beyond the Dumpster \u2014 a campsite of Irish Travelers from the looks of it.When the Irish government first began building houses for them in the 1960s, in an effort to encourage settlement and subsequent assimilation into the mainstream, some Travelers simply shrugged, used the wooden doors for firewood and the bathtubs as feeding troughs for their horses, and continued living in their caravans as they had always done. They preferred the road to the fixed abode, a preference that has subjected them to discrimination and harassment. I was surprised to see this Traveler campsite at the edge of the Liffey, for such sites had become increasingly rare and were now officially illegal. Under continued pressure from the Irish government, the majority of Travelers had become settled or semi-settled either in government housing or in authorized \u201chalting\u201d sites.I asked the little girls their names. The small one crossed her arms and said cozily: \u201cWell, myself, I\u2019m Bridget Mary McDonagh ... Bridie, if you like. And that one there is Mo Byrne.\u201d Bridie paused to look across the river, and I saw in her mercurial features that she was developing an excellent idea. Presently she said, \u201cNow, you see, Mrs., me and Mo ... we\u2019re twins!\u201d Lowering her voice and pointing a finger at Mo\u2019s nose, she added with a touch of patronizing pity, \u201cAh, but sure, poor Mo\u2019s face is all freckly.\u201dMo was incredulous. \u201cBut, you\u2019re worse freckly, Bridie!\u201d she cried.It was true. Bridie\u2019s freckles were, in fact, more plentiful. And the girls didn\u2019t look a thing like twins. They didn\u2019t even look like sisters. I asked them how old they were. \u201cWell,\u201d Bridie said, \u201cI am 6. And of course Mo is 6, too, like.\u201dMo glanced nervously at Bridie, uncomfortable with the ruse. \u201cYeah,\u201d she ventured, \u201cbut I\u2019m older.\u201dI admired the plastic ruby necklace Mo wore around her neck. Flattered, she said: \u201cThanks, Mrs. I got that in a box of crackers.\u201d Bridie piped in, \u201cAnd I got one, too!\u201d and put a hand to her throat to indicate where the necklace would be were she wearing it.Mo stared at Bridie in disbelief. A pregnant silence followed while she mustered the courage to defy her friend, and then, anchoring her hands on her hips, she howled: \u201cChrist, the number o\u2019 lies that come gushin\u2019 outta you would drown a fella dead on the floor! You\u2019ve no necklace, Bridie!\u201dBridie tittered wickedly and hopped up and down on the dirty mattress. I asked her where her shoes were. Ireland may once have been the poorest country in the European Union, but it had been a long time since anyone there went barefoot. She flapped a hand in dismissal, said, \u201cJays, I hate wearin\u2019 em.\u201d\u201cNow,\u201d she said, eager to change the subject, \u201cI\u2019ve a boyfriend. But do not tell anybody, Mrs.! And Mo\u2019s got a boyfriend, too.\u201dMo sheepishly acceded that at least that part of Bridie\u2019s story was true, and that he was, in fact, the same boyfriend. \u201cWe share him, see?\u201dI asked where the boyfriend was. Bridie\u2019s face went sour. \u201cGone off,\u201d she said with a wave of her arm that was as much a gesture of riddance as it was an indication of the direction he\u2019d gone off in.\u201cI\u2019d like to meet him,\u201d I said.\u201cAh, not a bit! You do not want to meet that one. He\u2019s bold. He\u2019ll tap you for the loan of a euro.\u201d\u201cAnd never pay it back,\u201d Mo added shrewdly, shifting one of her roof boards a bit to the left. When I said goodbye that day, Bridie said, \u201cYou\u2019re a nice lady.\u201d\u201cReally? Why do you say that?\u201d\u201c\u00a0\u2019Cause you talked to us. Nobody ever talks to us.\u201dI asked them why they thought that was. They looked around at the Dumpster, the burned shoes, the shabby trailers, the banner draped across a brand-new building announcing Longboat Quay Superb Luxury Apartments, and the skyline beyond, crosshatched with cranes laboring over more building sites. Bridie shrugged and said, \u201cDunno, really.\u201d Mo said, \u201cSee you next time. Mrs.!\u201d and they skipped up the sidewalk toward the campsite with the wind snatching at their flaming hair.Soon enough, the Irish boom would go bust. The cranes would disappear. Scores of new housing estates hastily thrown up across the Irish countryside would stand empty, crumbling, hardly worth the cost of tearing them down, and the Irish people would be scrambling to make ends meet under strict austerity measure designed to lift them out of a dire economic crisis. Real estate, which became the focus of greed and a source of wealth for many, would become a source of serious woe.And Bridie and Mo? They\u2019d be 12 this St. Patrick\u2019s Day, moved on to some new campsite, still outsiders, no doubt, and perhaps not terribly affected one way or the other by the vagaries of the Irish economy. There is nothing romantic about their poverty. There is, though, something admirable about their verve, their tenacity, their independence and their savvy imagination.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Will Seek Broad Expansion of Overtime Pay", "Date": "2014-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama this week will seek to force American businesses to pay more overtime to millions of workers, the latest move by his administration to confront corporations that have had soaring profits even as wages have stagnated. On Thursday, the president will direct the Labor Department to revamp its regulations to require overtime pay for several million additional fast-food managers, loan officers, computer technicians and others whom many businesses currently classify as \u201cexecutive or professional\u201d employees to avoid paying them overtime, according to White House officials briefed on the announcement.Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to use his executive authority to change the nation\u2019s overtime rules is likely to be seen as a challenge to Republicans in Congress, who have already blocked most of the president\u2019s economic agenda and have said they intend to fight his proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour from $7.25.Mr. Obama\u2019s action is certain to anger the business lobby in Washington, which has long fought for maximum flexibility for companies in paying overtime. In 2004, business groups persuaded President George W. Bush\u2019s administration to allow them greater latitude on exempting salaried white-collar workers from overtime pay, even as organized labor objected. Conservatives criticized Mr. Obama\u2019s impending action. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch,\u201d said Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow with the Cato Institute, who warned that employers might cut pay or use fewer workers. \u201cIf they push through something to make a certain class of workers more expensive, something will happen to adjust.\u201d Marc Freedman, the executive director of labor law policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the nation\u2019s overtime regulations \u201caffect a very wide cross section of employers and our members.\u201d\u201cI expect this is an area we will be very much engaged in,\u201d Mr. Freedman said. Mr. Obama\u2019s authority to act comes from his ability as president to revise the rules that carry out the Fair Labor Standards Act, which Congress originally passed in 1938. Mr. Bush and previous presidents used similar tactics at times to work around opponents in Congress.The proposed new regulations would increase the number of people who qualify for overtime and continue Mr. Obama\u2019s fight against what he says is a crisis of economic inequality in the country. Changes to the regulations will be subject to public comment before final approval by the Labor Department, and it is possible that strong opposition could cause Mr. Obama to scale back his proposal.Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, the director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, said the effort was part of Mr. Obama\u2019s pledge to help workers thrive. \u201cWe need to fix the system so folks working hard are getting compensated fairly,\u201d she said on Tuesday evening. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are jump-starting this effort.\u201dThe overtime action by Mr. Obama is part of a broader election-year effort by the White House to try to convince voters that Democrats are looking out for the middle class. White House officials hope the focus on lifting workers\u2019 pay will translate into support for Democratic congressional candidates this fall.Since the mid-1980s, corporate profits have soared, reaching a post-World War II record as a share of economic output. The profits of the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 have doubled since the recession ended in June 2009, but wages have stagnated for a vast majority of workers in the same period. Recently, workers\u2019 wages fell close to an all-time low as a share of the economy.In 2012, the share of the gross domestic income that went to workers fell to 42.6 percent, the lowest on record.Under current federal regulations, workers who are deemed executive, administrative or professional employees can be denied overtime pay under a so-called white-collar exemption.Under the new rules that Mr. Obama is seeking, fewer salaried employees could be blocked from receiving overtime, a move that would potentially shift billions of dollars\u2019 worth of corporate income into the pockets of workers. Currently, employers are prohibited from denying time-and-a-half overtime pay to any salaried worker who makes less than $455 per week. Mr. Obama\u2019s directive would significantly increase that salary level.In addition, Mr. Obama will try to change rules that allow employers to define which workers are exempt from receiving overtime based on the kind of work they perform. Under current rules, if an employer declares that an employee\u2019s primary responsibility is executive, such as overseeing a cleanup crew, then that worker can be exempted from overtime.White House officials said those rules were sometimes abused by employers in an attempt to avoid paying overtime. The new rules could require that employees perform a minimum percentage of \u201cexecutive\u201d work before they can be exempted from qualifying for overtime pay.\u201cUnder current rules, it literally means that you can spend 95 percent of the time sweeping floors and stocking shelves, and if you\u2019re responsible for supervising people 5 percent of the time, you can then be considered executive and be exempt,\u201d said Ross Eisenbrey, a vice president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization in Washington.Jared Bernstein, the former chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and the former executive director of the White House Task Force on the Middle Class, embraced Mr. Obama\u2019s move.\u201cI think the intent of the rule change is to make sure that people working overtime are fairly treated,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a potential side effect is that you may see more hiring in order to avoid overtime costs, which would be an awfully good thing right about now.\u201dMr. Bernstein, now a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, and Mr. Eisenbrey wrote a paper last year urging the administration to raise the salary threshold for overtime to $984 a week. Their study estimated that in any given week, five million workers earning more than the current threshold of $455 a week and less than $1,000 a week are likely to be exempted from overtime. President Bush raised the threshold to $455 in 2004.Mr. Bernstein said, \u201cRemember, inflation has eroded this threshold a great deal over the years, so it\u2019s hard to see why it\u2019s unfair to make that adjustment.\u201dWhite House officials said that in California an employer cannot deny overtime pay to a salaried worker who makes less than $640 a week. In New York, the threshold is $600 a week. Under recently passed laws, the California threshold is set to rise to $800 per week in 2016, and the New York threshold to $675.If the changes to the overtime regulations are made, it will fall to the Labor Department\u2019s wage and hour administrator to put them into effect. That position has been vacant since Mr. Obama took office. David Weil, a professor at the Boston University School of Management, is the latest nominee for the post. He is awaiting confirmation.Advertisement"}

Putin \u201cwill look beyond those things to see where the real check on his actions might come from.\u201dNATO has refrained from deploying substantial numbers of troops in member states bordering Russia \u2014 \u201ca unilateral promise made to Moscow in 1997, when Russia was behaving more cooperatively,\u201d said Ivo H. Daalder, a former American ambassador to NATO. He urged \u201csound plans, forward deployment of real capabilities and demonstrable will.\u201dAnd the NATO secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said Russia\u2019s moves were a \u201cgame-changer\u201d for the alliance. \u201cWe live in a different world than we did less than a month ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the first to stress that Europe must do more.\u201dNATO has agreed that member countries should spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense and should cooperate more to reduce expensive overlaps. But the economic crisis has hit Europe hard, making budget cuts necessary and military budgets among the easiest areas to cut politically.Spain and Hungary, along with the apparently vulnerable Baltic countries Latvia and Lithuania, were spending less than 1 percent. Even Germany, which is relatively wealthy, was spending only 1.3 percent. Over all, European members of NATO were at 1.6 percent.Despite the rhetoric, Crimea \u201cwon\u2019t make much difference for defense spending, but it might make a difference in how spending is allocated,\u201d said Xenia Dormandy, a former American diplomat at Chatham House, a research institute in London. \u201cIt\u2019s still very difficult for governments to sell the idea that social spending on health and education is less important than defense, especially in Western Europe.\u201dGiven that roughly half of military spending goes to personnel, she said, \u201ceven with Ukraine there is a feeling that we have too many people.\u201d The problem in Europe, as in the United States, she said, is less the amount of money available than the political difficulties involved in deciding how to spend it.In Europe, too, Ms. Dormandy said, there are domestic demands for military spending in local constituencies, as opposed to troop deployments abroad.Jonathan Eyal, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute, said that an irredentist Russia meant that \u201cdefense is coming home \u2014 we\u2019re back to more emphasis on land forces and equipment in Europe and territorial defense, stuff that defense planners had thought were unfashionable.\u201dDebates in NATO, which has a summit meeting in Wales scheduled for September, will no longer emphasize \u201chow do we send troops around the world to do good, stabilize countries and fight pirates,\u201d Mr. Eyal said. \u201cSubjects like tanks and soldiers will be back to the fore, and more troops will be available for training and stationing in Eastern Europe and fewer for deployments farther abroad.\u201dBut Mr. Eyal thought there would be changes. The members of NATO nearest Russia have let military spending slip. \u201cIf we\u2019re there to defend them, they should put their money where their mouths are,\u201d he said. With Estonia the exception, Romania, Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and the other Baltic States \u201cshould lead by example\u201d and increase their military spending, he said.Other NATO members are likely to at least freeze their military budgets. \u201cIt would be astonishing for a government to cut defense expenditure in the current situation,\u201d Mr. Eyal said.Nick Witney, a former chief executive of the European Defense Agency, said, \u201cThe answer is not to worry about spending more, but to spend it more wisely and stop wasting so many defense resources on duplicative and incompatible programs.\u201dMr. Witney, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that allied statements about cooperation on naval operations and drones would be more impressive were they not so similar to pledges made a decade ago. \u201cThe issue is whether they mean it any more than they did,\u201d he said.John Baron, a former army officer and a Conservative member of the British Parliament, said that for Britain and NATO, operations in Iraq and Afghanistan had distracted officials from growing threats from Russia and China. \u201cThe Chinese and Russians are reaching the point where they can deploy forces in a very professional manner, while we are cutting and cutting again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are forgetting the age-old adage that there is no substitute for boots on the ground.\u201dThis month, a British parliamentary committee criticized the government\u2019s planned military cuts, saying that they had been \u201cdesigned to fit a financial envelope.\u201d After cuts to the regular army, it was unlikely that Britain could recruit 30,000 reservists, the committee said, potentially leaving the army \u201cshort of personnel in key supporting capabilities.\u201dA former United States defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, caused a fuss in January when he warned that the cuts would harm Britain\u2019s \u201cability to be a full partner\u201d for Washington. The British government responded acerbically at the time, saying that as the eighth-largest economy in the world, Britain had the fourth-largest military budget.But that argument disguises the expense of modernizing and retaining Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent. Some senior American officials have criticized Britain for hollowing out its conventional forces, especially its ground troops and its navy, in order to maintain a nuclear deterrent that the country may not need. British officials have responded that they can afford both.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Studying Abroad, in a Linked World", "Date": "2014-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetters To the Editor:Fewer than one in 10 American college students graduate with study-abroad experience, and most of those students study in familiar countries with which the United States already has strong cultural, political and economic ties, and they spend eight weeks or less abroad.The simple truth is that study abroad is no longer just an excuse for college students to backpack across Europe or relax on foreign beaches; it\u2019s an economic and strategic imperative. Globally fluent citizens and workers \u2014 those adept at navigating at least some countries and markets outside their own \u2014 are a necessary component of a competitive American economy.America is at a critical juncture. How its students react to our rapidly changing world will help determine not just how they fare in the global job market but also how America fares on an increasingly competitive global stage.  The writer, a junior majoring in political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is studying at the University of Cape Town. To the Editor:Nicholas Kristof is correct in saying that study abroad should be part of every college student\u2019s education. Whether the program is academic or experiential, it\u2019s important for all college students to graduate having had an international experience that enhances cross-cultural communication skills and foreign language capabilities necessary to succeed in the global economy.In an effort to build that nationwide coalition, the Institute of International Education has recently launched Generation Study Abroad, a five-year initiative whose goal is to double the number of American students studying abroad by the end of the decade.Eight countries and 175 campuses have already joined us as partners, and we hope to enlist many more.To the Editor:While I agree that young people should travel abroad, not everyone can.Nicholas Kristof claims that \u201cthere\u2019s a misconception that gap years or study-abroad opportunities are feasible only for the affluent,\u201d but what Mr. Kristof calls \u201cfree\u201d options require participants to pay program fees and travel expenses and, of course, make a significant time commitment.What he doesn\u2019t acknowledge is that there is an access gap for young people who come from low socioeconomic status families or underrepresented populations or who are first-generation college students. The writer is an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Northern Colorado.To the Editor:Even though Princeton covers almost all costs associated with the program, a relatively small number of freshmen apply. Why? It seems as if American students struggle with the idea of separating from the educational fast track that parents and educators expect.Back on campus, however, returned volunteers not only successfully readjust to an academic setting, incorporating their new experiences into their academic pursuits, but are also overwhelmingly active in civil service organizations and social action groups.So my advice? Do something different. Go on an adventure. Learn a new language. You won\u2019t regret it. The writer is a freshman at Princeton.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After the Annexation of Crimea", "Date": "2014-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetters Regarding \u201cIs Crimea the next Yugoslavia?\u201d (Opinion, March 18) by Jochen Bittner: Crimea could be the next Chechnya, but not the next Yugoslavia. The writer draws attention to potential radicalization of the Muslim Tatars. This is groundless. The Tatars suffered persecution under the czars and then mass deportation under Stalin. Any upheaval today in Crimea would be ruthlessly suppressed by Russia, and the Tatars, who bitterly remember what happened to them and to their brother Chechens, would suffer the consequences.In response to Russia\u2019s unlawful actions in fostering the separation of Crimea from Ukraine, could the West organize the shipment of oil and gas from the United States and other supplier countries to Western Europe and Ukraine to replace the Russian oil and gas that these countries rely upon? Such a move would have a huge impact on the Russian economy and make Russia understand that there are serious consequences for violating international law by absorbing Crimea, much more serious than withholding visas and banking privileges from a few Russian individuals. President George W. Bush\u2019s play for Ukraine and Georgia to join NATO was one of the principal factors that fueled Russian paranoia about the West, together with America\u2019s withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Meanwhile, the West would do well to remember that buffer states can actually contribute to stability. That said, Russia and Ukraine need to come to some accommodation, and the sooner the better.Regarding \u201cBangladesh\u2019s coal delusion\u201d (Opinion, March 5): Joseph Allchin\u2019s claim that plans in Bangladesh to build clean coal power stations are a \u201cdelusion\u201d ignores both socioeconomic and environmental realities. Bangladesh has about 83 million people who do not have electricity. Likewise, 37 percent of children are malnourished, 45 percent of families do not have improved sanitation, half the women cannot read and the infant mortality rate is six times that of the United States. Air pollution? Almost 50,000 people die each year from indoor cooking with wood, dung and charcoal.To alleviate both poverty and air pollution, Bangladesh proposes to build major coal plants at Rampal and Matarbari. These facilities will utilize state-of-the-art technologies to attain near zero emissions of key pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates. These plants also enable highly efficient mercury removal and reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal by 25 percent.Far from being deluded, the realistic leaders of Bangladesh are using 21st century technologies that are good for people as well as the environment. In Bangladesh, and around the world, coal is not the problem. It is the solution. The writer is an emeritus professor of social science at Penn State University. Regarding \u201cSwiss begin to count cost of limiting immigration\u201d (News, March 20): Consider the irony that Switzerland, the only European country practicing \u201cpure\u201d democracy (including the constitutional right to launch a referendum if a citizen disagrees with an act of Parliament) and with a foreign population of 23 percent, is penalized for its vote to clamp down on immigration by the European Union, whose two leading members, Germany and France, have foreign populations of 8 percent and 6 percent, respectively. It is understandable that, with its economic successes, Switzerland is a magnet for people from poorer countries. But while the ethos of freedom of movement is to be applauded, it must be tempered with some recognition of reality and justice. Absent popular referendums, at least the European Union could consult its member populations via surveys to better understand the grass-roots views of the bloc\u2019s citizens. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama Makes Push for Political Solution to Crisis in Ukraine", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama and Ukraine\u2019s interim prime minister opened the door on Wednesday to a political solution that could lead to more autonomy for Crimea if Russian troops withdraw, as the United States embarked on a last-ditch diplomatic effort to defuse a crisis that reignited tensions between East and West.The tentative feeler came as Mr. Obama dispatched Secretary of State John Kerry to London to meet with his Russian counterpart on Friday, two days before a Russian-supported referendum in Crimea on whether to secede from Ukraine. Mr. Obama said the world would \u201ccompletely reject\u201d what he called a \u201cslapdash election,\u201d but added he still hoped for a peaceful settlement.In a show of solidarity for the besieged Ukraine, Mr. Obama hosted a White House visit by Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, the country\u2019s pro-Western acting prime minister, and vowed to \u201cstand with Ukraine.\u201d But he also hinted at a formulation that could be the basis for the coming talks between Mr. Kerry and Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, recognizing Moscow\u2019s interest in helping the Russian-speaking population in Crimea while affirming that it is part of Ukraine.Mr. Obama said Mr. Yatsenyuk told him that a new Ukrainian government formed after elections scheduled for May 25 could find ways to address Crimea\u2019s concerns. \u201cThere is a constitutional process in place and a set of elections that they can move forward on that, in fact, could lead to different arrangements over time with the Crimean region,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cBut that is not something that can be done with the barrel of a gun pointed at you.\u201dAt a separate appearance later in the day, Mr. Yatsenyuk expressed willingness to consider concessions to Crimea. \u201cWe the Ukrainian government are ready to start a nationwide dialogue how to increase the rights of autonomous Republic of Crimea, starting with taxes and ending with other aspects like language issues,\u201d he told an audience at the Atlantic Council. Any such discussion, he added, had to take place in a \u201cconstitutional manner\u201d rather than imposed by Russian troops. But he did not rule out holding a local referendum if authorized by the Ukrainian Parliament. \u201cOnly afterward, this referendum could be a constitutional one,\u201d he said.Although Mr. Yatsenyuk has articulated similar sentiments before, bringing the idea directly to Washington could frame the final diplomatic discussions before the\u00a0Sunday vote. He also tried to reassure Moscow by saying that he respects the longstanding agreement permitting a Russian naval base in Crimea, and that Ukraine would not cut off water, electricity or other supplies to the peninsula.But he used his visit to Washington to make clear that despite his preference for talks, his government would not accept partition of the country. \u201cMr. President,\u201d he told Mr. Obama in the Oval Office, \u201cit\u2019s all about the freedom. We fight for our freedom. We fight for our independence. We fight for our sovereignty. And we will never surrender.\u201dMr. Kerry employed similarly tough language during testimony Wednesday on Capitol Hill, where he said the United States and its partners were prepared to impose tough sanctions if Russia moved to annex Crimea. \u201cIt can get ugly fast if the wrong choices are made, and it can get ugly in multiple directions,\u201d he said. \u201cOur hope is that there is a way to have a reasonable outcome here.\u201dIn fact, he suggested the two sides could continue talking even if Sunday\u2019s referendum is held, as long as Russia stops short of annexation. \u201cThere are a lot of variants here, which is why it is urgent that we have this conversation with the Russians,\u201d he said. The United States has \u201cexchanged some thoughts\u201d with Moscow on how to address the crisis, he said, but the two sides \u201chaven\u2019t had a meeting of the minds.\u201dFor Mr. Yatsenyuk, the visit to Washington was not just about rallying support against Russia but was also an effort to seek an economic booster shot for his vulnerable economy. Yet even as both American political parties celebrated Mr. Yatsenyuk as a hero and promised to help Ukraine, a bid to provide financial assistance bogged down in a polarized Congress.The Republican-led House has passed legislation authorizing $1 billion in loan guarantees, but the Democratic-led Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday passed, in a 14-to-3 vote, an alternative version that attached long-stalled reforms to the International Monetary Fund sought by the Obama administration. The administration and its allies contend that the I.M.F. changes would raise loan limits for countries like Ukraine, while House Republicans maintain they would weaken American influence at the organization and expose taxpayers to more risk.The Treasury Department has lobbied Congress to approve the reforms since they were negotiated in 2010, and this moment might be its best chance to finally pass them. With Ukraine in financial free-fall, the department has redoubled its efforts, arguing that the country\u2019s standing in the I.M.F., and the fund\u2019s standing in the world, are at stake.\u201cWe\u2019re already hearing calls by some to say if the United States doesn\u2019t approve them, we should maybe move on without them,\u201d Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, told a Senate committee on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good place for the United States to be.\u201dSome Senate Republicans and other party figures sided with the Obama administration. A group of officials from President George W. Bush\u2019s administration sent a letter of support on Wednesday signed by Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state; Paul H. O\u2019Neill and John W. Snow, the former treasury secretaries; Tom Ridge, the former homeland security secretary; and Stephen J. Hadley, the former national security adviser.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he was trying to persuade House Republicans to support the I.M.F. changes. \u201cInternational organizations like the I.M.F. can provide stability at a time we really need it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strategic tool for U.S. foreign policy. We would be shortsighted not to embrace these reforms.\u201dBut Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said the Obama administration was trying to take advantage of the crisis to advance unrelated policy goals. \u201cThis legislation is supposed to be about assisting Ukraine and punishing Russia, and the I.M.F. measure completely undercuts both of these goals by giving Putin\u2019s Russia something it wants,\u201d he said, although he missed the committee vote, citing jury duty in Miami.Even as the administration lobbied for the bill, it also began holding the first test sale of crude oil from government reserves since 1990, a move officials said was planned months ago and yet still sent a message to Moscow that the United States could use its growing energy supplies to relieve Ukraine and other European nations dependent on Russia.With Mr. Yatsenyuk at his side, Mr. Obama pledged again to \u201capply a cost\u201d on Russia if it does not reverse course in Ukraine. \u201cThere\u2019s another path available, and we hope that President Putin is willing to seize that path,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if he does not, I\u2019m very confident that the international community will stand strongly behind the Ukrainian government.\u201dJonathan Weisman and Annie Lowrey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blending Old and New in South Australia", "Date": "2014-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHeathfield, AUSTRALIA \u2014 Set in the rolling Adelaide Hills of southern Australia, the five-bedroom, six-bath house is something of a contrast in itself. The French-style facade looks traditional, but the building has a high-technology core of ecologically minded features that make it virtually self-sustaining and maintenance-free. Called Kingsbrae, the house is in the small village of Heathfield, a 25-minute drive from Adelaide. It is on the market for 5 million Australian dollars, or $4.5 million. The main house offers 825.4 square meters, or 8,884 square feet, spread over two levels. Most of the living area is concentrated upstairs, where there is an octagon-shaped living room and an open-plan dining room that is linked to the kitchen but can be closed off. There are three bedrooms with bathrooms en suite, a study, a laundry and a large spa room. All the rooms and the numerous outdoor areas \u2014 a balcony, a veranda, a porch and long decks \u2014 have views of the lawn, its trees and the undulating green hills that surround the property. The ground floor includes a guest room with a bathroom en suite, a games room and a large outdoor dining-entertainment area with kitchenette, grill and fireplace. There is also a garage for five cars (five more can be parked outside), two utility rooms and a wine cellar. A ramp provides entry-level wheelchair accessibility, and an indoor elevator offers access to the two floors and, for maintenance, the roof.There is also a remodeled cottage dating from the 1860s on the 8-hectare, or 20-acre, property. It adds an additional 185 square meters of living space, with a living room, a kitchen, three bedrooms and one bath. Built in 2006 by Andrew Fletcher, a civil engineer, and his wife Jan, a passionate gardener, the house reflects their interests. He took care of the technology: solar panels, geothermal heating and a wind-powered generator to meet energy needs; irrigation and rainwater tanks along with a pumped spring- and rain-fed reservoir to provide water.An integrated home management system offers touch-screen control of all the amenities, including floor heating, communications, entertainment, security, sprinklers for both the house and the cottage and even the ornamental waterfall. The facade was coated in sandstone to ensure minimal maintenance.Jan Fletcher took care of the land, combining native plants and trees like eucalyptus and weeping acacias with more exotic ones, like Japanese maples and holm oaks. There is a country-estate feel about the property. A gaggle of geese, chickens, deer, an alpaca and a llama \u2014 all of which are included in the sale \u2014 roam about the grounds, protected from predators by an electrified fence. The main house sits on a rise, its top-floor windows offering an almost eye-level view of the evergreens that surround the house. \u201cThe elevation gives you a sense of space,\u201d Jan Fletcher said. \u201cYou can see everywhere.\u201dThe couple is selling the property, she said, because they want to travel more, visiting their grown children who have moved away from the area. The Fletchers have reduced the price from the 6.5 million dollars that they initially set two years ago. The original asking price was considerably more than average house values in this region, which is popular with residents of the Adelaide metropolitan area because it can be several degrees cooler than in the city. According to Louis Christopher, managing director of SQM Research, an independent property advisory group in Australia, the median home price for the Adelaide area, including Adelaide Hills, was 446,000 dollars at the end of 2013. Prices are expected to rise 3 percent to 6 percent in 2014. He said that, compared with the country as a whole, the Adelaide housing market has been weak, losing 1.3 percent of its value in the last three years. Prices in other Australian cities, however, are rising \u2014 especially in Sydney, where the median is 763,000 dollars. SQM has said it expects Sydney\u2019s median price to rise 15 percent to 20 percent this year. The news media has reported on concerns about the possibility of a real estate bubble. But Mr. Christopher said that if there were such a problem, he believed the federal and state governments and the Reserve Bank would intervene, as they did in 2008, to prevent a market collapse.He said the decline in the value of the Australian dollar \u2014 which, fueled by worries over the growth of the Chinese economy, has lost 14.5 percent of its value against the American dollar since January 2013 \u2014 might attract additional overseas investors. But he believes such potential investors mostly would be drawn to tourist areas like the Gold Coast of Queensland.However, Sharon Reeves of Harcourts Brock Williams, the real estate agency marketing Kingsbrae, said there was interest from Asian buyers in the property.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: 2014 Toyota Highlander Limited", "Date": "2014-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany automobile manufacturers have abandoned minivans over the last 10 years because crossovers are where the money is these days. Need proof? Porsche now makes two of them.So it would be easy to think that the 2014 Highlander is roomy enough to fill in for school bus duty, should the need arise. A quick check of the specifications finds the new model actually has 0.7 cubic feet less passenger space than the previous model. The Highlander isn\u2019t as spacious as General Motors\u2019 crossovers, but hey, the cargo area gains 3.5 useful cubic feet.And, happily, there\u2019s no room for boring.Toyota has been known for reliable transportation, not inspired styling, engaging driving dynamics and rich interior materials. The mission of its president, Akio Toyoda, is to change that. He wants his engineers to add more passion to their vehicles. Progress has already occurred with the Avalon, the Corolla and now the Highlander.Interior materials get a noticeable upgrade, though admittedly I tested a top-of-the-line Limited with all-wheel drive and the Platinum package \u2014 a setup with a sticker price of $44,450. The stitching and wood trim might be simulated, but it takes a determined stare to tell.A long shelf running from the center of the dashboard to the passenger door is especially handy. So is a one-way intercom to the third row, making it easy for parents to give children ultimatums when they\u2019re acting like Animal. The Platinum package adds radar-assisted cruise control, but it doesn\u2019t work under 30 miles per hour.The Highlander\u2019s mash-up of Toyota 4Runner and Dodge Durango design elements is a welcome update, though the headlights and tail lamps stick out awkwardly. The rear window opens separately from the hatch \u2014a feature as rare as a Snuffleupagus.Improvements to the handling include a suspension system that substantially reduces body roll. Over all, the Highlander\u2019s driving dynamics are fairly crisp, and road noise is average. Generation 3 uses the same platform as Gen 2, with some additional high-strength steel surrounding the front passengers. This year\u2019s model is 3 inches longer than before and a bit wider and lower, too. Keep Big Bird out of the third row; headroom back there is tight even for full-size adults.The base 4-cylinder (offered only with front-wheel drive) delivers about the same fuel economy as the 270-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 that I tested. The gearbox has 6 speeds. For better fuel economy, there\u2019s also a Highlander Hybrid.Among gasoline-only crossovers, the Nissan Pathfinder remains, by a hair, the fuel-economy champ in this class. The 6-cylinder Highlander with all-wheel drive has an E.P.A. rating of 18 miles per gallon in the city and 24 on the highway. Many three-row crossovers, like the Chevy Traverse, Honda Pilot, Hyundai Santa Fe and Ford Explorer, are all within 1 or 2 m.p.g. of the Toyota.At the end of the day, the new Highlander is less Bert, more Ernie. It\u2019s good to see Toyota putting a dash of personality in its vehicles.The family crossover segment is fiercely competitive, so if you\u2019re not test driving at least three vehicles, you might be missing out on the one that\u2019s just right for your family.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Side Business as a Way to Gain Financial Security", "Date": "2014-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayIN the height of the recession, as new rounds of layoffs were announced on what seemed like a daily basis, I was grappling with motherhood. Staring at my newborn daughter\u2019s face, I felt overwhelmed with the responsibility. The job market only worsened my anxiety. What would we do if I were to suddenly lose my job, or if my husband were to lose his? How would we care for our child?As a reporter working in a struggling industry, I always knew unexpected job loss was a possibility, but now, the stakes had never been higher. Being so financially vulnerable was unacceptable to me. And one day, as I was preparing to interview a businesswoman who made her living by selling cutting boards on Etsy.com, the handmade marketplace, I thought I had come upon a solution: I could have a side job making things to sell on the site. By adding a second stream of income, I would no longer be entirely dependent on a single paycheck. As I explored the website to prepare questions for my interview, I discovered a section of calendars and planners. Some of them, like meal planning and budgeting sheets, looked like something I could create. What if I started an Etsy shop of my own, selling money planners based on my years of personal finance reporting? I could create workbooks based on different life goals, including having a baby and budgeting. What if I could become as successful as those Etsy sellers who crochet scarves and carve furniture? I got to work as soon as I finished the article I was working on. Within two weeks, I had created my first money planner, which took readers through my best budgeting, saving and smart spending tips. It encouraged people to reflect on their big money goals and to come up with a personal definition of financial success. I enlisted a freelance illustrator to create a cover and inside illustrations for around $100. In addition to creating a PDF to sell as a digital file, I sent my planner to a printer to create a few dozen spiral-bound versions, at a total cost of about $300. My entire shop was off the ground for just $400 and a couple of weeks of work on weekends and evenings. As soon as I listed that first product, I felt more in control of my life. I was an entrepreneur, not just an office worker. I felt a rush of pride every time I pulled up my shopfront on my computer screen. Those good feelings were soon clouded by my lack of sales. My number of visitors hovered around 10 people a day, and none were buying. That\u2019s when I decided I had to spend some serious time on marketing, and I started studying the advice of other creative entrepreneurs who sell on Etsy. I began pitching my shop to bloggers who write about motherhood, family life and money \u2014 my target audience. I hosted giveaways and wrote guest posts for those sites. My number of visitors slowly climbed, and so did my sales. I started earning about $200 a month from my shop.That might not sound like much. But it felt extremely significant to me. That\u2019s because I felt my new business was something that I could ramp up and turn into something even bigger if I ever had the time, desire or need to do so. In the meantime, an extra $200 a month came in pretty handy for the escalating baby-related costs.My plans did not proceed without hiccups, of course. Few people bought my spiral-bound planners, so that investment ended up being largely a waste of money. My customers gravitated toward the digital versions, which are available immediately for download upon purchase. I made more adjustments after noticing that people often bought a few different types of planners at once. To meet that demand, I created \u201cplanner kits,\u201d which came with discounts on bundles around a theme, like buying a home or starting a business. As my business grew, so did my stress level. I was suddenly juggling my young daughter, a full-time job and my online shop. I worked on my planners whenever I could, which was primarily during nap time on the weekends and in the evenings after my daughter went to bed. The kind of business that it is \u2014 requiring a lot of upfront work creating the products but then very little as sales are made, since Etsy handles the payment collection and file downloads \u2014 made it possible for me to continue to fit the shop into my life. Etsy charges me 20 cents for every product listing and 3.5 percent of every sale, but that seems well worth the relative ease of running my shop. We soon added a son to our family, which increased my desire to create more financial security, but made it harder to find the time to do so. I still build my shop when I can, which is usually when my children are asleep. (And thanks to Etsy, my sales get processed even when I am asleep.) My side business now brings in around $5,000 a year, and I figure I could double that if I carved out more time to work on it each week, to add more planners and do more marketing.Like many side-business owners, I never want to leave my full-time job. Not only do I enjoy it, but I feel lucky to have a level of financial security and benefits that are hard to come by as a full-time entrepreneur. A lot of people feel the same way: The Young Entrepreneur Council reports that a third of millennials have a side business. On Elance, 30 percent of the freelancers also maintain full-time jobs. On Etsy, a quarter of sellers hold day jobs. One of those millennials is Sydney Owen Williams, who handles marketing during the day for a sky diving center in Lake Elsinore, Calif., and in her off time coaches 20-somethings hunting for their first jobs. That income, she said, supplements her relative low base salary at the sky diving center. Similarly, Chris Furin, a full-time custom cake designer in the Washington area in his early 40s, started his business when he worked full time at his father\u2019s deli, baking and designing the cakes at night. When the deli shut in 2011, he was able to start bringing in at least $3,000 a week on his orders. Febe Hernandez, a federal worker and jewelry maker in her early 60s, adds to her salary by holding trunk shows where she said she regularly pulled in $2,000. She plans to continue to expand her jewelry business when she retires from government.Those kinds of hybrid careers are exactly what this new economy demands. People lucky enough to have a full-time job may never know for sure how long it will last. And having a backup plan in case it does disappear not only provides a safety net but for some a satisfying creative outlet.Kimberly Palmer is the author of the new book, \u201cThe Economy of You: Discover Your Inner Entrepreneur and Recession-Proof Your Life\u201d and senior editor of money at US News & World Report.

{"Headline": "Jobless Claims and Activity At Mid-Atlantic Factories Suggest Stronger Economy ", "Date": "2014-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits was near a three-month low last week, and factory activity in the Mid-Atlantic region rebounded this month, suggesting the economy is regaining strength after being weakened by severe weather.While other data on Thursday showed home sales at a year and a half low in February, the limited stock of houses on the market that has constrained sales eased for a second consecutive month. \u201cMuch of the weakness that we have seen is weather-related and what we are seeing now as the impact dissipates is a much brighter outlook for the U.S. economy,\u201d said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities.Initial applications for state unemployment benefits rose 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 320,000 last week, the Labor Department said. The increase, which was smaller than economists had expected, kept jobless claims close to the three-month low hit in the previous week.A four-week moving average of new jobless claims, which cuts volatility to provide a better gauge of underlying conditions, hit its lowest level in more than three months.Last week\u2019s jobless claims data covered the period for the government\u2019s March employment survey. Claims fell between the February and March survey periods, suggesting the survey will point to further job growth this month.\u201cThe recent level of claims seems to be pointing to a reduction in layoffs and possibly a very strong March employment report,\u201d said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors. The government will issue its March employment report on April 4.In a separate report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its business activity index rebounded to 9.0 in March from \u2014 6.3 in February. Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region\u2019s manufacturing.The report, which covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, showed a rebound in new and unfilled factory orders. Shipments also bounced back, but inventories fell. Though sales of existing homes fell again in February, there is optimism they will improve as better weather returns. The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes slipped 0.4 percent to an annual rate of 4.60 million units. That was the lowest level since July 2012.While the weather has hampered sales, an increase in mortgage rates and prices has also taken a toll. In addition, a dearth of listed properties has given buyers few options. But last month the supply rose, reaching 5.2 months\u2019 worth, the highest in nearly a year.\u201cSales are being impacted by lower inventory levels, rising prices and interest rates,\u201d said Bill Banfield, vice president at Quicken Loans. \u201cWith improving weather conditions and a drop in interest rates in January, I expect to see more buyers and sellers in the coming months.\u201dA measure of future economic activity rose more strongly than expected in February. The Conference Board said on Thursday that its index of leading indicators climbed 0.5 percent, to 99.8, last month. Economists polled by Reuters had expected it to gain 0.2 percent. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Glimpsing a Lost Paris, Before Gentrification", "Date": "2014-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookYou might almost think of Charles Marville, the 19th-century photographer, as akin to the guys who drive around mapping streets for Google. He was a hired hand, an illustrator turned photographer near the dawn of the medium. Paris officials enlisted him to document, among other things, new parks and squares but also the streets, shops and tenements scheduled for demolition \u2014 to make, in essence, a historical record of a city soon to be lost. That was the Paris of Victor Hugo and \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d which Baron Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, Napoleon III\u2019s planning czar, was sweeping away to make room for the glittery, bourgeois metropolis that tourists love. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has a great show of Marville\u2019s photographs from back then, when luxury apartment buildings were replacing old shops and homes, and many working people could no longer afford to live in their own neighborhoods. Marville was a man for our time.His project was very French. Outside Paris, there\u2019s a museum dedicated to a banker and philanthropist named Albert Kahn, who, not long after the turn of the last century, realized the world was changing irrevocably, and that many societies and places faced extinction. Until he lost a bundle during the Depression, Kahn dispatched photographers with color film, something new at the time, to the four corners of the globe to compile what he came to call his Archives of the Planet, a celebration of life in all its variety and, in retrospect, an anthology of loss.Marville\u2019s ambit wasn\u2019t quite so grand; it was a single city, and he seems to have never publicly uttered a peep about its transformation.Still, his photographs speak across the ages. Clear, cool and rigorous \u2014 a few almost seem like Mondrians in their geometry \u2014 they extract all sorts of humanity from the chaos and cramped quarters, the nooks and crannies, the mismatched rooflines and patched-up, stained masonry buildings plastered with peeling posters and fading advertisements that today seem so picturesque and full of life but that drove Haussmann nuts. Haussmann saw in those areas only squalor, congestion and sickness, the cures for which were new plazas and pissoirs, kiosks and gas lamps, cultural palaces and apartment buildings, built along straight boulevards that bulldozed through old neighborhoods to improve circulation, culminating in monuments. The sidewalks and avenues had to be broad enough to accommodate cafe tables and the two-horse barouches of the industrialists and socialites moving into those apartment buildings. An architecturally harmonious capital rose from the rubble, a city of spectacle, built for a new, modern economy, but homogeneous and no longer welcoming to many of the poor souls who had helped make the place run and had always been deep in its cultural lifeblood.You don\u2019t see many of these people in Marville\u2019s pictures. To cope with the state of cameras at that time, his photographs were mostly made in the early morning, when the streets were empty. Even so, it\u2019s hard to miss the evidence of lives lived in the cobblestones and tattered storefronts. \u201cSo much information is contained in that split-second burst of photons,\u201d the historian Graham Robb wrote about a classic Marville photo of the Place Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Arts. \u201cIf the glass plate survived a holocaust and lay buried under rubble for centuries in a leather satchel, there would be enough to compile a small, speculative encyclopedia of Paris in the late second millennium.\u201d I wonder, here in the early third, whether photographers are now out and about, in the spirit of Marville, documenting 57th Street, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick and East Harlem, Willets Point, Long Island City and Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Big cities change. That\u2019s urban life. But the best cities don\u2019t leave the vulnerable behind. Some 20,000 working poor were said to have lost their homes on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 when Haussmann\u2019s renewal forced them out. Centuries-old tanneries along the Bi\u00e8vre \u2014 the impoverished \u201cfaubourg of misery,\u201d as it was called, but a community rich in history and pride \u2014 got the boot, too. French writers, Hugo among them, compared the new Paris to Babylon, a fallen city. A raft of French literature predicted a flood, Paris sinking into an abyss. Loss was in the air. War with Germany led to a revolt, violently crushed. Haussmann went back to work afterward. A hill called the Butte des Moulins, a working class warren, was leveled to give patrons of the city\u2019s new opera house breathing room and a better vista. All these years later, it\u2019s easy to forget the criminal gangs cleared from the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, the sewage-filled gutters and filthy water drawn from barrels that spread misery and disease across Paris. In retrospect, Haussmann\u2019s redevelopment produced wealth and a miracle of well-proportioned, grand and gracious public spaces, a cosmopolitan model of light and air \u2014 on which many displaced Parisians were now compelled to gaze from afar. Marville photographed a few of their new homes on the city\u2019s outskirts, like the fetid shantytown at the rue Champlain. In the foreground sprawls a formless mess of shacks and mud. A boy sits alone on a hill, staring into the distance, where Haussmann\u2019s pristine Paris rises, white and remote, like an apparition. \u201cCharles Marville: Photographer of Paris\u201d runs through May 4 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org.

{"Headline": "U.S. Effort to Broker Russia-Ukraine Diplomacy Fails", "Date": "2014-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRussian and Ukrainian soldiers on Wednesday guarded the entrance to the Ukrainian military base in Yevpatoria, on the western coast of Crimea.\u00a0PARIS \u2014 An effort by the United States to broker the first face-to-face diplomatic meeting between Russia and Ukraine over the Crimea crisis failed on Wednesday, but Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart announced more discussions in the days ahead.Their remarks left open the possibility of progress toward a solution to de-escalate one of the most serious East-West confrontations since the Cold War. But while Mr. Kerry asserted Wednesday night that his deliberations here had yielded creative ideas and that he planned to resume talks with the Russian foreign minister in Rome on Thursday, there were also signs of how acute the crisis remained. In Washington, President Obama consulted further with allies, speaking by telephone to Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, whose government has resisted any trade sanctions against Russia. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called with reassurances to President Andris Berzins of Latvia, one of the Baltic states unnerved by Moscow\u2019s military occupation of the Crimean Peninsula.In Paris, Mr. Kerry\u2019s emphasis was on diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis and bring Russian diplomats together with representatives of the new Ukrainian government.On Wednesday morning, Mr. Kerry and his British and Ukrainian counterparts met on the 1994 Budapest memorandum, an agreement signed by Russia, the United States and Britain obliging them to refrain from the \u201cthreat and use of force\u201d or \u201ceconomic coercion\u201d against Ukraine, which also signed the agreement and agreed to give up the nuclear weapons inherited after the Soviet Union\u2019s breakup.Mr. Kerry said he regretted that Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, had not attended. William Hague, the British foreign secretary, said the group would make \u201cevery diplomatic effort today to bring Russia and Ukraine into direct contact at ministerial level.\u201dAndrii Deshchytsia, Ukraine\u2019s acting foreign minister, who flew to Paris on Tuesday night on Mr. Kerry\u2019s plane, said at the session that he was prepared to have \u201cconsultations with Russia, bilaterally and multilaterally.\u201d After Mr. Kerry met with Mr. Lavrov later that day at the Russian ambassador\u2019s residence, the two diplomats went to the French Foreign Ministry for further discussions on the crisis with European envoys. Mr. Deshchytsia, who Ukrainian officials said had left for the airport only to be called back, arrived at the ministry soon afterward. But a direct meeting between Mr. Lavrov and Mr. Deshchytsia, who was in the same building but not the same room, did not happen. The failure reflected the tensions over Russia\u2019s refusal to recognize the interim government in Kiev that replaced President Viktor F. Yanukovych, who fled last month but is regarded by Russia as Ukraine\u2019s rightful leader.Asked if he had met his Ukrainian counterpart, Mr. Lavrov said: \u201cWho is it? I didn\u2019t see anyone.\u201d Mr. Deshchytsia, asked by reporters why he and Mr. Lavrov had not met, said, \u201cAsk Lavrov.\u201dThe frenetic diplomacy came as the European Union added a significant financial underpinning to the struggling Ukrainian government in the middle of the crisis with Russia over Ukraine\u2019s future, offering aid worth as much as $15 billion over the next two years.The offer came atop $1 billion in American loan guarantees to ease Ukraine\u2019s economic transition, announced by Mr. Kerry on Tuesday in Kiev, where he was visiting to reassure the interim Ukrainian government and challenge Russia.The offers of loans are crucial because Ukraine is in dire economic shape, with a promised Russian loan of $15 billion in abeyance since the ouster of Mr. Yanukovych, and with Russia\u2019s decision to cancel a large discount on gas supplies to Ukraine starting April 1.Ukrainian officials have said they need $35 billion in new loans and credits over the next two years to avoid default.A team from the International Monetary Fund was in Kiev to study the books and consider a loan. The fund is expected to demand difficult changes, including the reduction of lavish subsidies on gas prices, so the American and European money is intended in part to help cushion the blow to Ukrainian voters before new elections in May.The American and European offers are also intended to answer political criticism in Washington and some European countries that the West is not doing enough to support Ukraine in the face of Russian threats.European Union leaders will meet on Thursday in Brussels to consider sanctions against Russia. The loan announcement on Wednesday came from Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, the union\u2019s executive arm. He said the offer of 11 billion euros, or $15 billion, \u201cover the next couple of years\u201d included \u20ac1.6 billion, or about $2.2 billion, in loans and \u20ac1.4 billion in grants, as well as \u20ac3 billion in new credit from the European Investment Bank through 2016.He also promised efforts with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, where the European Union is a majority shareholder, to free up \u20ac5 billion, and other steps to grant \u20ac3.5 billion in loans.But Mr. Barroso was vague on the details, indicating a rapid effort to come up with an offer that could come close to matching the original Russian one. He said he would discuss details on Thursday with Ukraine\u2019s interim prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, who will attend the emergency summit meeting of leaders.The European Union also announced that it was freezing the financial assets in Europe of 18 people held responsible of misusing state funds in Ukraine. Their identities were withheld pending the official publication in the union\u2019s legal journal on Thursday.In Kiev, Mr. Yatsenyuk said Russia\u2019s deployment of forces was having an \u201cextremely negative\u201d impact on the country\u2019s shaky economy.But Russia signaled no intention to release its grip on Crimea, headquarters of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Russian troops there, in uniforms without insignia, continued to surround major Ukrainian military facilities. Most of the Ukrainians have resisted calls to surrender weapons and leave their bases, where they are effectively imprisoned.In Paris, Mr. Kerry sought to accent the positive. \u201cI personally feel as if I have something concrete to take back and talk to President Obama about so that I can get his input and thinking, advice, on what he\u2019s prepared to do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I believe that Foreign Minister Lavrov is in exactly the same position with respect to President Putin.\u201dMichael R.

{"Headline": "Rhode Island Legislators Vie to Fill Speaker Post After Hasty Resignation", "Date": "2014-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 The political world in Rhode Island remained in turmoil on Sunday as two members of the State House scrambled for support to become the next speaker after the sudden resignation of Gordon D. Fox, a Democrat who had held the job since 2010.Mr. Fox resigned on Saturday, and the reason remained a mystery. In a move that seemed designed to draw attention, several federal and state agents, including some from the Internal Revenue Service, raided his office in the House and his home on Friday and were seen carting out boxes and bags labeled \u201cevidence.\u201dBut no one has offered an explanation for the raid or said what the authorities were searching for, and Mr. Fox gave no clues in a statement he issued late Saturday announcing his resignation as speaker. Mr. Fox, 52, who was first elected to the State House of Representatives in 1992, also announced that he would not seek re-election this fall. He said he did intend to complete his current term, which ends in December. Those who wish to succeed him were not waiting around for answers. They immediately swung into high gear, with pop-up caucuses quickly materializing as the candidates put themselves forward and House members split into factions.The situation was so fluid that even the six Republican state representatives, who usually count for little in the 75-member chamber of this heavily Democratic state, were being courted as if they held the keys to the kingdom.The speakership is perceived as the most powerful position in Rhode Island politics, and the sudden vacancy created a leadership vacuum as Rhode Island struggles to create jobs and rebuild its economy from a longtime slump. Unemployment here in January was 9.2 percent, the highest in the country.By Sunday, the race for speaker had boiled down to two candidates: Representatives Nicholas A. Mattiello, the majority leader, and Michael Marcello, chairman of the House Oversight Committee.Others also predicted that the fight for votes would continue through Tuesday, when the House reconvenes for the first time since the upheaval Friday. They expect to elect their new speaker then.Mr. Mattiello told reporters outside a caucus Sunday evening at the Providence Marriott that he had collected signed statements from 42 members who committed to voting for him on Tuesday. Winning the speakership requires 38 votes.But Mr. Marcello said earlier outside a caucus at a fire house in suburban Johnston that he had a solid 33 votes and that no one had the magic 38 yet to claim victory because a handful of legislators were still in play.\u201cBoth sides are deadlocked,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will go to the floor.\u201dMr. Mattiello, who called himself a \u201cpro-business legislator,\u201d said he wanted to get the economy back on track and unite the House after the turmoil of the weekend. Representative Joseph A. Trillo, a Republican who attended Mr. Mattiello\u2019s caucus, said Mr. Mattiello would help the state focus on business issues, away from social issues.Mr. Marcello said he represented clean government and transparency and would change the way business is done in Providence. He said he wanted to expand the professional staff in the legislature and wanted lawmakers to have the same access to the levers of power that paid lobbyists have.\u201cIf the other side wins, our ideas are going nowhere,\u201d he said.Wendy Schiller, a political scientist at Brown University, said Mr. Fox\u2019s legacy was chiefly in the social arena. Mr. Fox, who is gay, pushed through legislation allowing same-sex marriage, despite intense opposition from the Roman Catholic Church, and oversaw an overhaul of the pension system, despite intense opposition from unions.\u201cHe was a practical politician who used his power well to shake up Rhode Island and get it to move forward,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was a big deal for a small state trying to get into the 21st century.\u201d Losing him, Ms. Schiller said, \u201ccould be a significant step backward, not only because you are losing a progressive leader but you could elect someone who would take us back to old-style politics.\u201dIt was not clear what the candidates for speaker were offering their potential supporters. Mr. Mattiello has announced a slate of candidates that he would bring into the leadership, if elected, while Mr. Marcello has said he had not made any offers in exchange for support.But whether or not the candidates are making any promises, those who could tip the scales might be asking for something in return.\u201cThis is the biggest opportunity that individual legislators have had in years to extract favors from a new speaker,\u201d Ms. Schiller said. \u201cIn a small state like Rhode Island, that\u2019s a big deal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Trial of Bin Laden Relative, Witness Describes Meeting 9/11 Mastermind", "Date": "2014-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA British operative for Al Qaeda testified on Tuesday that, before abandoning a plot to blow up an airplane, he flew from Pakistan to the Netherlands and then on to Britain while concealing a bomb in his shoe.The operative, Saajid Badat, said in federal court in Manhattan that \u201cPlan A\u201d had been to blow up a domestic flight in the United States, so he did not detonate his shoe bomb.Mr. Badat has said that he did not meet Mr. Abu Ghaith in Afghanistan. But he offered a fairly intimate account of his interactions with Bin Laden and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed organizer of the Sept. 11 attacks.On Tuesday, he described how he and Richard C. Reid, who tried but failed to blow up a Paris-to-Miami flight, met with Mr. Mohammed in December 2001 about the shoe-bomb plot. \u201cWe discussed how we should go about this attack,\u201d Mr. Badat said.He said Mr. Mohammed had an almanac and showed him a list of the world\u2019s tallest buildings, which included the two World Trade Center towers.\u201cHe got the pen out and crossed them out,\u201d Mr. Badat testified, adding, \u201cI am ashamed to say that when he did this, he did it in order to make us laugh, as a joke.\u201dMr. Badat said that after he agreed to undertake a shoe-bombing mission, he met with Bin Laden, who asked whether he understood \u201cthe significance of this operation.\u201d\u201cHe then said that the American economy is like a chain,\u201d Mr. Badat added. \u201cHe said if you break one link, you will bring down the American economy.\u201dThe designer of the shoe bombs gave them to Mr. Badat and Mr. Reid in Kandahar, Afghanistan, Mr. Badat testified. He added that they each practiced lighting the fuse.Mr. Badat testified from Britain via a live video connection, and a prosecutor, Nicholas J. Lewin, and Mr. Abu Ghaith\u2019s lead lawyer, Stanley L. Cohen, were in Britain to question him.Mr. Badat pleaded guilty in Britain in 2005 and has been cooperating with the authorities. He testified about his time in Qaeda guesthouses and training camps in Afghanistan, and in the group\u2019s media center, where he said he translated Bin Laden\u2019s speeches into English.But in the Manhattan trial, Mr. Badat has offered new details. He elaborated, for example, on a plot he described in 2012, in which he and Mr. Reid helped a group of Malaysians, including a pilot, who had wanted to carry out their own \u201cterrorist act\u201d involving an airplane, he testified on Tuesday.Mr. Badat said that he gave the Malaysians one of his shoes that had explosives hidden inside. The Malaysians, he said, wanted to use the device to \u201caccess the cockpit\u201d of a plane. He offered no further detail about how far that plot progressed.Mr. Badat said that when he arrived in Britain, ready to make preparations to fly to the United States, his parents sat him down and asked whether he was a \u201csleeper,\u201d an operative who remains hidden, sometimes for years, before carrying out an attack.\u201cThey knew I was in Afghanistan,\u201d Mr. Badat said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t quite sure who I was working with.\u201dHis father warned that he \u201cbetter not be one of those sleepers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my mum also said that I wouldn\u2019t want my son to be one of those sleepers.\u201d\u201cIt was then I decided to back out of the mission,\u201d he said. He emailed his handler in Karachi, Pakistan, using a code name to refer to Mr. Reid. \u201cTell Van Damme he\u2019ll be on his own,\u201d Mr. Badat recalled writing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Indianapolis, a Bike Path to Progress", "Date": "2014-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHeads Up For an old car town, Indianapolis has been doing a lot for biking lately. A new eight-mile landscaped bike and pedestrian pathway is helping residents rediscover their city and reshaping how outsiders view it. The trail is putting Indianapolis on the map as a place to see bold innovation, along with the Colts and some car races in a town long known as an international racing capital, home to the Indy 500 and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Paved with stylish two-tone patchworks of hexagonal and striped asphalt, the main loop of the path swoops past every major cultural and entertainment venue in the downtown area \u2014 from the Indiana State Museum in White River State Park to the Indiana Repertory Theater to the Indianapolis City Market. Straightaways veer off to the restaurants and shops of the historic Mass Ave and Fountain Square neighborhoods. Residents and visitors from nearby cities like Cincinnati and Louisville, Ky., are using the trail to explore Indianapolis with new enthusiasm, city officials said, and more convention planners are now choosing Indianapolis because of it. Planners from cities including Cologne, Germany; Portland, Ore.; and Miami have also come to take stock of the trail that Indianapolis has blazed.\u201cThe design team researched similar projects in cities around the world \u2014 Copenhagen, Paris, Bogot\u00e1, Boulder,\u201d said Kevin Osburn, the principal designer of the landscape architecture firm Rundell Ernstberger Associates. \u201cWe discovered that there really wasn\u2019t quite anything like what we were attempting to do anywhere in the world.\u201d Before the path arrived, Indianapolis didn\u2019t have a mainstream bike scene \u2014 just streets designed to improve traffic flow. Now, children and the elderly have joined the spandex swarms of longtime cycling enthusiasts. The pathway has connected people with the places they want to go and encouraged physical activity in a state with the eighth-highest obesity rate in the country.The public art along the trail accentuates the path\u2019s role as a sculptor of the city\u2019s evolving identity. For example, Donna Sink\u2019s \u201cMoving Forward\u201d is a series of seven stained-glass-hued eco-friendly bus shelters covered in lines from poems by local writers. And in Sean Derry\u2019s \u201cChatham Passage,\u201d the whiff of roses wafts from an intricate steel grate concealing a \u201cfragrance machine\u201d \u2014 a witty nod to Mass Ave\u2019s historic coal vaults. The trail has also helped spark a sluggish local economy. Hundreds of millions of dollars in new commercial and residential developments surrounding the pathway have coincided with the trail\u2019s progress, said Brian Payne, president of the Central Indiana Community Foundation, which oversaw its creation. Fountain Square, a designated cultural district southeast of downtown, separated by freeways, has bloomed, its increasingly vibrant streets filling up with high-end dining spots as well as scrappy galleries. \u201cWe have seen no fewer than 25 new businesses open in the last few years, all within a five-block area,\u201d said Ed Rudisell, owner of three Indianapolis restaurants, including the popular Siam Square in Fountain Square.Elizabeth Garber, the owner of Best Chocolate in Town, a shop in Mass Ave, a neighborhood situated around one of the city\u2019s first streets, told a similar story. \u201cThe building across the street had been vacant,\u201d she said. \u201cThen it was torn down. Now it\u2019s been reconstructed.\u201d\u201cTwo other businesses have arrived on our block,\u201d Ms. Garber said. \u201cThere have been more bikers, joggers and people on skateboards. More people are taking the time to stop by.\u201dYet the project has never been just about boosting business profits, creating jobs or linking up downtown hot spots, said Mr. Payne, who stumbled upon the idea for the pathway while biking around the city with his then-2-year-old son. \u201cPeople use the trail to explore downtown because it\u2019s beautifully designed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have spontaneous experiences.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Criticism Over Handling of Missing Flight Stirs Malaysian Backlash", "Date": "2014-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySocial media in Malaysia has been flooded with criticism of China this week, with many noting that Malaysians as well as Chinese died on the Malaysia Airlines flight. Many on Malay-language social media contend that China is wrong to assail Malaysia during the national mourning that began Monday night, when Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that the flight had disappeared into the stormy waters of the southern Indian Ocean.Chinese officials\u2019 demands for greater transparency by the Malaysian government in its investigation of Flight 370 have been met with online retorts that China itself has one of the world\u2019s most opaque governments. Many here have been particularly dismayed that relatives and friends of Chinese passengers were able to break through thin screens of police officers in Beijing and march to the Malaysian Embassy.\u201cI don\u2019t agree with their activities because Malaysia has made a big effort to find the plane,\u201d said Muhamad Hairi Sulaiman, a 35-year-old telecom technician, as he left a special prayer session for Flight 370 passengers and crew at the cavernous National Mosque here Thursday night. \u201cThe general view of my friends is that we are shocked that they are biased against Malaysians.\u201dThe burst of nationalism here is in some ways a relief for the Malaysian government, since Internet users had castigated Kuala Lumpur in the first days after the Boeing 777-200 vanished.By contrast, Malaysian newspapers and television, controlled by pro-government business leaders, were circumspect about the government\u2019s repeated release of contradictory information in the early days, and said little about the air force\u2019s failure to react as the plane turned around and flew back over the country nearly unnoticed.Satellite imagery captured near the Australian search areas shows objects that officials said could be related to the missing Malaysian plane.Yet public hostility toward China also holds risks for the Malaysian government. China is the nation\u2019s biggest trading partner and one of its largest foreign investors. Chinese tourists throng Malaysia\u2019s resorts and shopping malls, one reason that more than 150 of the 239 people aboard the Beijing-bound flight were Chinese.Malaysian officials have been low-key in their response to China\u2019s anger. They even asked for China\u2019s help on Thursday in seeking to assuage the anger of the family and friends of passengers aboard the flight, as bad weather over the southern Indian Ocean forced another interruption on Thursday afternoon of an aerial search to find traces of the plane.Malaysian officials asked Huang Huikang, China\u2019s ambassador to Malaysia, \u201cto request the government of China to engage and clarify the actual situation to the affected families in particular and the Chinese public in general,\u201d Malaysia\u2019s transport ministry said in a statement Thursday evening.The pro-establishment New Straits Times weighed in with an editorial on Thursday noting that China had nuclear weapons and the world\u2019s largest standing army in addition to the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States, and concluded that, \u201cIn short, China is a friend not to be antagonized.\u201dJames Chin, a professor of political science at the Kuala Lumpur campus of Monash University, said the government was eager to avoid quarrels with Beijing. \u201cThe elites understand that in the long term, you have to deal with the dragon,\u201d he said.The nationalistic response has complicated the political environment for Malaysia\u2019s broad-based opposition, which has been chastising the government for its slow response but now perceives a public enthusiasm for national unity.Fuziah Salleh, a vice president of one of the opposition parties and a member of Parliament, said that while many Malaysians were sympathetic toward Chinese families who lost loved ones, some were also upset at the Chinese government and angry about the embassy protest.\u201cBeing Malaysians, we rally together and feel it is wrong to treat our embassies that way,\u201d she said.The prospect of heavy claims by the families of Chinese nationals and others against Malaysia Airlines, the national carrier, has unsettled many here and contributed to unease about foreign criticism. Hishammuddin Hussein, the defense minister and acting transport minister, declined to address a question on Wednesday about whether the airline might need a government bailout.But insurance executives say that Malaysia Airlines is heavily insured against air disasters because it operates the world\u2019s largest commercial airliner, the Airbus A380. Air carriers commonly insure themselves based on the number of passengers carried by their largest jet, in case of individual claims by every passenger or the passengers\u2019 estates.Malaysia Airlines configures its A380 to carry 494 passengers. By contrast, Flight 370 had 227 passengers, as well as a dozen crew members.Because the details of the aircraft\u2019s disappearance are not yet known, it is unclear whether the airline could make insurance claims for the loss under a terrorism policy, a mechanical failure policy or some other type of policy. While local insurers wrote the initial policies, they transferred most of the exposure for claims to a consortium led by Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty, part of Allianz of Germany, a financial services conglomerate.\u201cIn this case, only a small percentage of the risk is retained with the local lead insurer, with the remaining proportion of the risk fully reinsured,\u201d Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty said in a statement, adding that various reinsurers have already begun making claims payments.The most volatile aspect of Malaysian politics involves race relations. Malays, roughly half the population, have dominated the political process and sometimes limited participation by the country\u2019s ethnic Chinese minority.But that minority has had weakening links to mainland China in recent decades. Most people here appear to have drawn a distinction between Malaysian Chinese and the government in Beijing.Unhappiness over the Chinese government\u2019s response to the disappearance of Flight 370 \u201cis not going to affect race relations within Malaysia,\u201d Mr. Chin predicted.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Proposed Housing Bill Would Create a Co-op of Mortgage Lenders", "Date": "2014-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet another proposal for winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and overhauling the nation\u2019s housing finance system will be put before Congress on Thursday, this one by Representative Maxine Waters of California, the ranking Democratic member of the Financial Services Committee.The major distinction of Ms. Waters\u2019s proposal is that it would make the mortgage lending system more like a public utility, by creating a co-op of lenders that would be the sole issuer of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the government. Such a system would significantly differ from those proposed by the major bills in the Senate, which would allow banks and bond guarantors to participate independently in the market. Both Ms. Waters\u2019s proposal and the Senate ones would establish a new federal regulator.The Waters bill would require private backers to take the first 5 percent loss before the government guarantee kicks in. By contrast, the latest Senate bill, by the Senate Banking Committee\u2019s chairman, Tim Johnson, a Democrat from South Dakota, and Mike Crapo of Idaho, the committee\u2019s ranking Republican, requires private capital to take the first 10 percent loss.Some economists say that during the housing crisis, Fannie and Freddie, which were formally taken over by the government in 2008 and now back the overwhelming majority of home mortgages, sustained approximately a 4 percent loss, but that number is in dispute. Setting the right levels of loss is a balancing act: The higher the loss requirement for the system\u2019s private backers, the more expensive mortgages would be for home buyers, but the less vulnerable taxpayers would be in another crisis. Ms. Waters\u2019s proposal would set the same guidelines for minimum down payments \u2014 3.5 percent for a first-time buyer and 5 percent for everyone else \u2014 as the Johnson-Crapo bill, but would allow the regulator to lower those requirements at its discretion.While almost everyone agrees that the housing finance system is in dreadful need of improvement, the bills stand little chance of passing. In the Senate, the Johnson-Crapo bill probably has enough votes to get out of the banking committee, but even if it manages to get to a floor vote it is unlikely to go very far in the Republican-controlled House. The House Financial Services Committee has approved a bill by its Republican chairman, Jeb Hensarling, but the bill does not have enough support to pass. Given the unlikelihood that a Democrat-sponsored bill would have a better chance of passing, Ms. Waters\u2019s bill seems intended mostly as a marker for housing reformers on the left.\u201cI am hopeful that this legislation will continue to move the conversation on housing finance reform forward,\u201d Ms. Waters said in a statement. \u201cWhile there are differences, this legislation and the two bipartisan proposals in the Senate embrace a number of common themes.\u201dMs. Waters\u2019s bill also clarifies who would get paid first in a wind-down of Fannie and Freddie, starting with the Treasury, which would be paid according to the original terms of its bailout of the mortgage giants. Those terms were later altered, prompting shareholder lawsuits.\u201cEveryone talks about wanting to put private sector capital ahead of the federal government, but the key to any of these proposals working is whether enough entities will provide such capital,\u201d said Karen Shaw Petrou, a co-founder and managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics. \u201cA utility, or co-op, may solve for that because it creates a special purpose entity that doesn\u2019t need to meet shareholder demand the same way a big bank or bondholder does.\u201dSome liberal advocacy groups, like the Center for Responsible Lending, support a co-op model in part because it would create a single entity that could be held accountable for making sure that mortgages are available in all markets, and would discourage cherry-picking of mortgages in more desirable or profitable areas. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have a duty-to-serve requirement, then there is a question about how you enforce it if there\u2019s multiple guarantors,\u201d said Gary Kalman, the center\u2019s executive vice president. \u201cIf somebody\u2019s not serving South Dakota, who do you hold accountable?\u201dAn article on Thursday about a proposal for winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and overhauling the nation\u2019s housing finance system misstated how taxpayers would be affected in another crisis if there were higher loss requirements for the mortgage lending system\u2019s private backers. In that case, mortgages would be more expensive and taxpayers would be less vulnerable to bailouts, not \u201cmore vulnerable.\u201d The article also misstated the job title of Gary Kalman of the Center for Responsible Lending, who commented on the proposal. He is executive vice president, not executive director.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After a Punishing Winter, Investors Bet on the Promise of Spring", "Date": "2014-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market rose on Tuesday as biotechnology companies bounced back after days of heavy selling.The market has been flipping between gains and losses for the most of the month, as investors have bought stocks after every dip. While many are confident economic growth will accelerate as the weather moderates after an unusually harsh winter, they are reluctant to push stock prices higher before seeing more evidence that the economy is picking up.\u201cThe reasons to buy are certainly there,\u201d said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners, a wealth management company. \u201cPeople are afraid to jump the gun.\u201dThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 8.18 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,865.62. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 91.19 points, or 0.6 percent, to 16,367.88. The Nasdaq composite index gained 7.88 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,234.27. Nine of the 10 industry groups in the S.&P. 500 ended the day higher. Industrial stocks rose the most, gaining 0.9 percent, followed by the energy and health care sectors, which each gained 0.8 percent.Biotechnology companies in the S.&P. 500 rose 0.6 percent, led by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, which gained $3.32, or 2.2 percent, to $153.08.McCormick was the best performing stock in the S.&P. 500 on Tuesday. The company, which makes spices, seasonings and condiments, rose $3.69, or 5.5 percent, to $71.20 after reporting earnings that beat analysts\u2019 estimates. McCormick also reaffirmed its outlook for the year.Another big gainer was Sonic Corporation, the drive-in restaurant company. Its shares jumped $2.31, or 11 percent, to $23.23 after it posted earnings that exceeded the expectations of Wall Street analysts. Net income rose despite the unusually harsh winter weather.There were conflicting reports on the economy for investors to consider.One report showed that fewer people bought new homes in February. Sales fell to the slowest pace in five months, a sign that the housing market has yet to recover fully from brutal a winter, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. But an index measuring consumer confidence rose to the highest level in six years, another sign that the economy\u2019s prospects should brighten with warmer weather.Mixed signals have undermined investor confidence in the economy after a strong fourth quarter last year suggested that growth was poised to accelerate, said Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist for BlackRock. \u201cThe investment thesis for 2014 was that the U.S. economy was going to start sprinting ahead,\u201d Mr. Koesterich said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very sluggish start to the year,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are not seeing the growth that they expected.\u201dAmong the stocks on the move on Tuesday, the cruise ship operator Carnival fell $1.98, to $38.02, after it swung to a loss in the first quarter, stung by losing bets on the future price of fuel. Carnival\u2019s adjusted results and revenue beat analysts\u2019 expectations, but the company narrowed its full-year forecast and gave a second-quarter projection below Wall Street\u2019s view.The drugstore chain Walgreen rose $2.11, or 3.3 percent, to $66.42 after it reported its fiscal second-quarter earnings and said it planned to close 76 stores in the second half of its fiscal year. That is a big shift from its previous growth strategy, which focused on opening locations to maximize convenience for its customers.The Luxottica Group, the Italian eyewear maker, jumped $2.34, or 4.3 percent, to $56.20 after forming a partnership with Google to create designs for Google Glass. Luxottica said the deal could help produce annual growth of 5 to 10 percent.In the bond market, interest rates moved higher. The yield on the Treasury\u2019s 10-year note rose to 2.75 percent, from 2.73 percent late Monday, as its price fell 6/32, to 100. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. and Russia Hit Diplomatic Roadblock Trying to Start Ukraine Talks ", "Date": "2014-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration\u2019s effort to solicit Russia\u2019s help to defuse the crisis in Ukraine hit a roadblock on Monday when Secretary of State John Kerry delayed an anticipated trip to Russia and the two sides issued dueling accounts of their recent diplomacy. The State Department responded by rushing out a statement saying that it was the Russians who were not prepared to engage in discussions on the United States\u2019 proposals, especially the idea that they meet with officials from the new Ukrainian government. \u201cWe are still awaiting a Russian response to the concrete questions that Secretary Kerry sent Foreign Minister Lavrov on Saturday in this regard,\u201d Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement. The administration\u2019s efforts to enlist Russia\u2019s support involved several phone calls by President Obama to Mr. Putin. But it moved into high gear last week when Mr. Kerry went to Europe and met with Western foreign ministers, Ukrainian officials and Mr. Lavrov, twice. The basic Western strategy was to form a \u201ccontact group\u201d that would include the United States, European nations, Russia, Ukraine and international organizations. That would be a way, American officials calculated, to hammer out a common strategy on Ukraine and to bring Russian and Ukrainian officials together for their first face-to-face meeting on the crisis.But Russia has not accepted the legitimacy of the new Ukrainian government, and Mr. Lavrov has never agreed to sit in the same room with his Ukrainian counterpart.Within the Obama administration, the view was that Mr. Lavrov lacked the diplomatic leeway to change policy. So American officials developed a strategy to engage Mr. Putin. On Thursday, Mr. Obama told Mr. Putin that Mr. Kerry was prepared to hold further talks with Mr. Lavrov on how a contact group might work, according to an American official who declined to be identified because the official was discussing diplomatic exchanges. On Friday, Mr. Kerry presented the Russian foreign minister with a one-page paper that outlined American and European ideas for solving the crisis, a paper that Mr. Lavrov could present to Mr. Putin.That same day, Mr. Lavrov invited Mr. Kerry to Sochi, Russia, where he could see Mr. Putin, who was there for the Paralympic Games. Mr. Kerry indicated that he would consider the idea.Even as the invitation was made, however, American officials became concerned that Russia was doubling down in Crimea. Encouraged by Russia, the local Parliament was pushing for secession, a move endorsed by leading Russian lawmakers. To American officials, the hope for a diplomatic breakthrough appeared to be undercut by Russian actions on the ground.In a Saturday morning call with Mr. Lavrov, Mr. Kerry emphasized that Russian steps to annex Crimea would close the window for more diplomacy. Later that day, the State Department sent Mr. Lavrov a page-and-half document with a series of questions that were intended to see whether the Kremlin was receptive to the United States\u2019 proposals before Mr. Kerry traveled to meet with Mr. Putin.American officials wanted to know if Russia would cease its military advances in Crimea, rein in Crimean militias and also work with the contact group on steps like an International Monetary Fund program to stabilize the Ukrainian economy and a countrywide election. They also wanted Russia to halt moves to annex the Crimean Peninsula, and were looking for signs that Russia would be willing to return their troops to their barracks, allow international monitors to work in Crimea and, importantly, meet with new Ukrainian government, either directly or as part of a contact group. Russia never responded officially to the questions. Yet an answer of sorts came on Monday when, to the surprise of the State Department, Russian television carried the short video clip of Mr. Putin and Mr. Lavrov. Mr. Putin said that he had authorized Mr. Lavrov to invite Mr. Kerry to Russia. Mr. Lavrov responded that he had expected Mr. Kerry to arrive as early as Monday for talks that could involve Mr. Putin himself. \u201cBut then on Saturday he called and said that he would like to postpone the trip for the moment,\u201d Mr. Lavrov added, referring to Mr. Kerry. The Russian foreign minister went on to complain that the paper Mr. Kerry had given him on Friday cast Moscow as a belligerent and treated the establishment of the new Western-backed government in Ukraine as a \u201cfait accompli.\u201d\u201cWe are not just passively receiving our colleagues\u2019 proposals,\u201d Mr. Lavrov added. \u201cWorking together with the members of the Russian Federation Security Council, we have drafted some proposals of our own.\u201d Neither Mr. Putin nor Mr. Lavrov explained their proposals. But the thrust of their exchange, and the fact that the Kremlin chose to make it public in what seemed like an attempt to influence domestic and international opinion, underscored that there was no agreement between Moscow and Washington.At the State Department, Ms. Psaki issued a short statement outlining American conditions for more high-level talks. \u201cThe United States needs to see concrete evidence that Russia is prepared to engage on the diplomatic proposals we have made to facilitate direct dialogue between Ukraine and Russia and to use international mechanisms like a contact group to de-escalate the conflict,\u201d she said. Michael R. Gordon reported from Washington, and Steven Lee Myers from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gaza-Israel Escalation Threatens Cease-Fire", "Date": "2014-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Sixty rockets fired from the Gaza Strip rained down across southern Israel on Wednesday afternoon, sending thousands of Israelis scrambling into bomb shelters, in by far the most intense barrage since a cease-fire that ended eight days of cross-border violence in 2012.Israel retaliated Wednesday night with airstrikes on what the military described as 29 \u201cterror sites\u201d across Gaza, after hitting two locations with artillery fire. No injuries were reported on either side of the border, save for a 57-year-old Israeli woman who fell while running for cover.Islamic Jihad, one of several militant Palestinian groups in Gaza, asserted responsibility for the rockets, and said they were a response to an Israeli airstrike on Tuesday that killed three of its members. The Israeli military said the three had fired a mortar at its soldiers while they patrolled just inside the border fence.Palestinians and Israelis alike were bracing for further escalation overnight, threatening to subvert not only the nearly 16-month-old cease-fire but the American-led Middle East peace talks that started last summer.A spokesman for Islamic Jihad\u2019s armed wing said in a text message that the rockets \u201cestablish a new phase: any aggression will be met with fierce response.\u201d Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said he saw \u201cno alternative other than a complete takeover of the Gaza Strip\u201d and would oppose any more limited operation. President Shimon Peres, one of Israel\u2019s most vocal supporters of the talks, said: \u201cThe people of Gaza have to choose \u2014 it\u2019s either peace or violence.\u201dPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement even as the rockets were falling around 5:30 p.m. declaring, \u201cWe will not be deterred.\u201d\u201cWe will continue to intercept and hurt those who want to hurt us,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. On Twitter, he added, \u201cIf there won\u2019t be quiet in the South, there will be noise in Gaza, and this is an understatement.\u201dThe violent exchange came as Secretary of State John Kerry was pushing forward a framework for a final-status agreement that would extend the talks beyond their current April 29 deadline, with President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority scheduled to visit the White House on Monday. Both the Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad and Hamas, the militant Palestinian faction that controls the Gaza Strip, oppose the framework.Gaza and Hamas have suffered severe economic and political setbacks since the Egypt military\u2019s ouster last summer of President Mohamed Morsi, an Islamist ally. Egypt\u2019s new military-backed government announced Wednesday that it had destroyed more than 1,300 smuggling tunnels into Gaza, which Hamas officials say has cost the coastal enclave\u2019s economy more than $400 million. Cairo recently banned Hamas, along with its patron Muslim Brotherhood, as a terrorist organization.\u201cThis retaliation by the Islamic Jihad doesn\u2019t come without a green light from Hamas,\u201d said Mkhaimer Abu Saada, a political scientist at Al-Azhar University in Gaza City. \u201cHamas is being choked financially and economically. It seems to me one of the options for Hamas to get out of this choking, to get out of this extreme financial, economic and political condition, is to open a new cycle of violence with Israel.\u201dWhile Islamic Jihad asserted it fired 90 rockets, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli military, said 60 made it to Israel, five of them landing in populated areas. One exploded near a library, another near a gas station in the Negev desert. Three were intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system.Colonel Lerner described Israel\u2019s retaliatory strikes as \u201cprecise and prompt.\u201d\u201cWe targeted the infrastructure that serves the terrorists while they train, plan and implement their hideous attacks,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThey will not be permitted to conspire in the safety of their terrorist temples.\u201dThroughout southern Israel, red-alert sirens returned residents to the defensive posture they had grown used to, as thousands of rockets have been fired from Gaza since Israel withdrew its settlers and troops in 2005.\u201cIt\u2019s frightening, because you don\u2019t know where it will fall,\u201d Dani Rachamim, 60, who lives on a kibbutz near Gaza\u2019s eastern border, said in a telephone interview. \u201cI\u2019m sitting watching the TV and I hear the red alert, and when I start to run to the bomb shelter, I already heard the boom. I heard at least three booms around our kibbutz.\u201dThe rockets fell during a state visit to Jerusalem by Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who called them \u201cbarbaric,\u201d and said: \u201cWe condemn them completely.\u201d In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman called the rocket fire \u201creprehensible,\u201d saying \u201cthere is no justification for such attacks.\u201dHours before the rocket barrage began, the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization met with Mr. Abbas, who is also its chairman, and released a statement emphasizing its \u201cutmost rejection\u201d of an extension in the peace talks.Palestinian leaders expressed outrage over what they described as a purposeful escalation by the Israeli military, citing the deaths of the three Gaza men Tuesday; the fatal shooting Monday morning of a Jordanian judge of Palestinian descent who the military said had tried to seize a soldier\u2019s weapon as he crossed the Allenby Bridge into the West Bank; and the killing of 18-year-old Saji Darwish Monday evening near the Israeli settlement of Beit El. The Jordanian Parliament voted Wednesday to expel the Israeli ambassador in Amman and recall the Jordanian ambassador from Tel Aviv.\u201cIsrael is intentionally working to generate a culture of violence,\u201d Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the P.L.O. executive committee, said in a statement at noon Wednesday. \u201cSuch incessant and unaddressed crimes will plunge the entire region into great instability and violence.\u201dIn Gaza, Hamas evacuated government buildings Wednesday evening and urged residents to stay off the streets, where an intense thunderstorm was in some cases mistaken for Israeli bombings. The airstrikes from about 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. caused large, fiery explosions, but in open areas far from homes.With the news that Israel had closed Kerem Shalom, the commercial crossing through which Gaza imports and exports limited goods, residents of Gaza City rushed out Wednesday night to fill their fuel tanks and stock up at bakeries and supermarkets.Israelis who live in the south were advised to stay close to bomb shelters.Adele Raemer, a teacher who lives on another Israeli kibbutz east of Gaza, said she had been about to take her two dogs, Nikki and Nala, for a walk Wednesday at about 5 p.m. when the siren sounded \u2014 and the rockets began to fall.\u201cWe had thunder all day, so we\u2019ve been hearing booms, but then we heard something that was definitely not thunder,\u201d said Ms. Raemer, 59. \u201cWe\u2019re always waiting for the other shoe to fall, it\u2019s always something that\u2019s sort of hovering, you know. We always take into account that it can ignite any minute and suddenly \u2014 like it just did.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the threat posed to the Middle East peace talks by rocket attacks on Israel by militants from the Gaza Strip and retaliatory Israeli strikes misspelled the given name and the surname of a teacher who lives on an Israeli kibbutz east of Gaza. She is Adele Raemer, not Adel Ramer.Fares Akram contributed reporting from Gaza, Rana F. Sweis from Amman, Jordan, and Michael R. Gordon from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On the Art Fair Carousel", "Date": "2014-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFairsPARIS \u2014 If, as we\u2019ve been told of late, connoisseurship is over, then what do we make of the thousands of people who crowded into the Palais Brongniart in Paris last week? There they were, poring over drawings by long-dead artists, many of them known only to a specialist audience.\u201cThe Salon is the place where drawings people from all the world get together,\u201d said Gregory Rubinstein, Sotheby\u2019s worldwide head of Old Master drawings, at the preview. \u201cIt has by far the biggest concentration of dealers and they keep the best things for this fair.\u201dThis year, the best included an early 16th-century black chalk study of a kneeling Mary Magdalene by the Florentine High Renaissance artist Fra Bartolomeo. The drawing, a preparatory sketch for an altarpiece still in situ in the church of San Marco in Florence, had been in an English private collection since 1980. It was sold by the London-based dealers Bellinger-Colnaghi to a European collector for just over $1 million during the early hours of the Salon.An early 19th-century Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix pen-and-ink study of cats\u2019 heads and a male figure was another early sale, bought by a Swiss collector for 28,000 euros, or $38,550, at the booth of the Paris-based dealer Nathalie Motte Masselink, one of 39 dealers exhibiting at the fair.\u201cThe people who come here are just passionate about drawings,\u201d said Ms. Motte Masselink, who named the French movie star Alain Delon among the field\u2019s varied enthusiasts. \u201cThere aren\u2019t limits between those who collect contemporary and those who collect Old Masters. And with drawings, you can still make discoveries.\u201dTo prove the point, the Paris dealership Talabardon & Gautier offered a pen-and-ink drawing of St. Paul and other figures, which it had recently identified as the work of the 17th-century artist Anthony van Dyck. Bought at a regional French auction eight months ago, the study was sold to an American museum for \u20ac250,000.At the other end of the price spectrum are contemporary drawings, which, unlike Old Masters, still lack a fully developed specialist collectors\u2019 market.Also at Drawing Now, which ran from Wednesday to Sunday, was a three-dimensional black-and-white work of a fox-drawn ambulance inspired by the English novelist Hari Kunzru. The \u201cdrawing,\u201d by the London-based collective Le Gun, was exhibited at the Victoria & Albert Museum last year and was being offered by the Paris-based Galerie Suzanne Tarasieve, priced at \u20ac30,000.\u00a0Art Paris looks to ChinaChina (surprise, surprise) was the \u201cguest of honor\u201d at this year\u2019s fair, which ended Sunday. Among the 140 mostly French galleries in the Grand Palais, 10 dealers from China exhibited. The Paris-based Galerie Daniel Templon, one of the better-known names, showed the 2013 painting \u201cBlue Sky and White Clouds,\u201d priced at $800,000, by China\u2019s prolific political Pop artist Yue Minjun.\u201cArt Paris is improving, but it\u2019s not there yet,\u201d said Christian Ogier, a Paris-based dealer in Asian contemporary art. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to be fashionable when it should be more original. It needs more things like this,\u201d he said, pointing to two 1988 calligraphic paintings by the French-Chinese artist T\u2019ang Haywen (1927-91), who was so poor he could only afford to paint on a job lot of X-ray envelopes. These were being offered by the Paris-based dealer Galerie Thessa Herold, priced at \u20ac4,800 and \u20ac6,000.\u00a0Wealthy flock to Tefaf\u201cTefaf attracts wealthy people who don\u2019t regard themselves as specialist art collectors,\u201d said the London-based dealer Stephen Ongpin, who sold a 1979 pastel by the American Abstract Expressionist Joan Mitchell at the fair for $230,000. \u201cThey have several homes, and they think such-and-such a thing will look good in one of the rooms.\u201dThe organizers of the Dutch fair reported that a record 375 private jets landed at Maastricht-Aachen airport during the event.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stone Unturned: Credit Ratings", "Date": "2014-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameIt\u2019s the one question about the 2008 financial crisis that people still ask me more than any other: Why have regulators done so little to rein in the credit rating agencies? Other institutions that contributed to the mortgage debacle have submitted to new rules and compliance requirements, but Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Standard & Poor\u2019s and their peers remained relatively untouched. The status quo is especially baffling because the Dodd-Frank financial reform law actually directed the Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate these firms more closely. So why have they been left to operate pretty much as in the past? First, a little reminder. The rating agencies grade all kinds of securities \u2014 from simple corporate debt to collateralized debt obligations. The grades, which run from AAA to D, are supposed to reflect the creditworthiness of the security and offer a guide to investors. During the housing boom, however, the firms slapped high grades on complex mortgage securities that were filled with garbage. The ratings abetted Wall Street\u2019s corrupt mortgage machine and did enormous damage to investors in those securities, which inevitably failed. The reverberations were felt in the economy as a whole. In the scrutiny after the financial crisis, it became clear that not only were the ratings inflated, but also that the business model of the rating agencies contained a troubling conflict of interest: The rating agencies are paid by the very issuers whose securities they are rating. The proposals were pretty tepid. Some investor advocates are now hoping that Mary Jo White, who became chairwoman of the S.E.C. after the rules were prepared, will toughen them up or go back to the drawing board.Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, is also dismayed by the state of play. \u201cIt is totally unacceptable, given the evidence of credit rating agency abuses in our 2010 hearings and the S.E.C.\u2019s own inspection reports, that proposed rules to stop the conflicts of interest and inflated ratings have been stalled for three years, wrapped up in bureaucratic red tape,\u201d he said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cWorse, the proposed rules aren\u2019t tough enough to cure the problems.\u201dThe rating agencies, for their part, say they have improved their systems and can manage the conflicts of interest. In comment letters related to the S.E.C. proposal, Moody\u2019s and S.&P. said they had heightened their governance practices. John Nester, an S.E.C. spokesman, said: \u201cAmong other things, the commission\u2019s decision will take into consideration the public comments we\u2019ve received, the annual examinations we\u2019ve conducted of the firms, and the prohibitions we\u2019ve already imposed around conflicts of interest.\u201dWhile awaiting that decision, the federation has detailed the weaknesses in the proposed rules. In two areas, the letter said, the S.E.C. allowed rating agencies to come up with their own solutions. In another, involving conflicts of interest inside the rating agencies, the S.E.C. proposed an \u201cunacceptably narrow\u201d fix to the problem, the federation said.The S.E.C.\u2019s proposal to address this problem applies only to sales representatives, who drum up business from issuers. This is not enough, the federation contends, because other actors inside these organizations \u2014 especially top managers keen on profitability \u2014 can also influence ratings activities. \u201cMotivations by management to increase profits and market share can lead to top-down policies and practices that emphasize higher ratings over improved accuracy and reliability,\u201d the letter said. The federation urged the S.E.C. to broaden the rule significantly to eliminate the potential for other rating agency officials to influence ratings.Despite Dodd-Frank\u2019s invitation to set standards ensuring that internal controls were in place, the S.E.C. declined to make any prescriptions in its proposal, choosing instead to defer that process. It asked for public comments on whether it should prescribe any rules and, if so, what kind. Finally, there is the matter of standardizing ratings so that the grades assigned to various types of securities \u2014 simple and complex \u2014 accurately reflect their risks. Dodd-Frank called for such universal ratings to protect against the tendency among rating agencies to give the same high marks to complicated and risky mortgage securities during the real estate bubble that they assigned to high-quality corporate or sovereign issues. But instead of proposing specific steps to make the agencies\u2019 grades more consistent, whether on sovereign debt or structured finance deals like mortgage-backed securities, the S.E.C. punted. It would require only that the rating agencies have policies and procedures in place intended to make the credit ratings consistent. \u201cTriple-A should mean the same thing regardless of the asset class,\u201d Ms. Roper said. \u201cIf they can\u2019t get comparability, they should take structured finance out of that system and adopt separate ratings. It\u2019s a statutory mandate.\u201dThe root of the rating-agency problem, of course, is an overreliance on these grades throughout the financial system. Institutional investors who are too lazy to assess a security lean on ratings, and financial regulators rely on them when writing their rules. The Basel Committee, for example, uses ratings to determine how much capital banks must set aside against particular securities they hold. The S.E.C. has tried to reduce this reliance by removing references to credit ratings in many of its rules, thus encouraging market participants to do their own analyses. But ratings still loom large, even after they were found to have been so disastrously inaccurate in 2008. It\u2019s yet another example of the glacial pace of regulatory change. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Libya\u2019s Prime Minister Ousted in Chaos Over Tanker", "Date": "2014-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tanker escaped with the oil in defiance of military threats from Tripoli and legal warnings from Washington, and its voyage has evoked the lawlessness that prevailed on the same coast two centuries ago, when Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison sent the Marines and Navy to subdue the Barbary pirates.The oil sale is a vindication for Ibrahim Jathran, 33, the militia commander who has led an eight-month blockade of Libya\u2019s main oil ports to demand more revenue, power and autonomy for the eastern region. He took up arms in the revolt against the Qaddafi regime, and the transitional government initially chose him to lead a force charged with protecting the oil infrastructure. But then he turned against the government to join the eastern regionalist, or \u201cfederalist,\u201d cause.Libyan officials had appeared willing to wait out his blockade but feared his sale of oil as a far more serious threat. Then, after midnight on Tuesday morning, Mr. Jathran gave a televised statement on what appeared to be the deck of the oil tanker, defying the United States State Department, which called the sale a \u201ctheft\u201d from the Libyan people and warned of legal action.By Tuesday afternoon, the sale had also raised the specter of new clashes among regional militias. Near the midcoastal city of Sirte, fighters from the East supporting Mr. Jathran squared off against fighters from the Western city of Misrata, who denounced the sale as theft.The Parliament swore in the interim defense minister, Abdullah al-Thinni, for a two-week stint as acting prime minister, but there was no consensus about who might succeed him. The Parliament is disorganized, divided among lawmakers associated with the Muslim Brotherhood, those elected under the banner of a Western-friendly anti-Islamist coalition, and shifting coalitions of independents, who include ultraconservative Salafi Islamists and eclectic local notables.His inability to deter the illicit oil sales, however, evidently dissolved the last of his credibility. He had issued repeated, and unenforced, ultimatums for months threatening military action. Then, when the tanker reached the eastern port of Sidra over the weekend, Mr. Zeidan threatened to bomb it out of the water, even if that caused \u201can environmental disaster.\u201dEven as late as Monday night, other officials of his government were insisting that gunships loyal to Tripoli had surrounded the tanker or even seized it.Mr. Zeidan had already acknowledged his impotence, saying Libya\u2019s fledgling military had refused his command to stop the tanker\u2019s arrival in Sidra. \u201cEverybody was working against us,\u201d he said over the weekend.Then other government officials acknowledged on Tuesday that the tanker had slipped away into international waters. Abdul Qader Hweli, a member of Parliament\u2019s energy committee, blamed bad weather. \u201cThe vessels that were besieging the tanker were not equipped to withstand such weather,\u201d he said in a television interview. \u201cThe tanker could sail better than the vessels in such weather.\u201dThe tanker, the Morning Glory, flew a North Korean flag, but shipping experts said that was presumably a cover for its real ownership. Libyan and American officials said they intended to take legal action against anyone involved in shipping or buying the oil. If the shipment is deemed illegal, NATO ships could still apprehend the tanker. And any buyer known to have received the oil could face American sanctions or be shut out of future Libyan oil sales. But the tanker might attempt to offload its cargo in Syria, where petroleum supplies are short. It could pump it into another vessel flagged to Russia or another country unconcerned about Western opinion, or it could pump smaller lots to other tankers taking multiple shipments.\u201cIn theory,\u201d said Badr H. Jafar, the president of Crescent Petroleum, a regional oil and gas company in the United Arab Emirates, \u201cany trade is possible if they get the oil to international waters.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about the effect the Libyan government\u2019s failure to seize an oil tanker carrying an illicit cargo of oil had on the ouster of the country\u2019s prime minister misstated the title of Badr H. Jafar of Crescent Petroleum, an oil and gas company in the United Arab Emirates. He is the company\u2019s president, not its chairman.David D.

{"Headline": "Dusting Off Cold War Thinking", "Date": "2014-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropeBERLIN \u2014 The Cold War is back.Russia\u2019s occupation of Crimea and preparations for a possible annexation of the southern Ukrainian province have revived fears, calculations and reflexes that had been rusting away since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.The crisis was triggered by President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s attempt to prevent Ukraine, a strategic former Soviet republic, from turning to the West. Whether it becomes a turning point in international relations, like the Al Qaeda attacks on the United States in 2001 or the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, is not yet certain.But policy makers and analysts are considering the consequences of a prolonged East-West tug of war. And states in the middle, like Germany and Poland, are starting to weigh uncomfortable adjustments to their policies.The situation is already posing tricky questions about the balance between sanctions and diplomacy, setting loyalty tests for allies and raising the risk of spillover to other conflicts and of possible proxy wars. \u201cWelcome to Cold War Two,\u201d Dmitri Trenin, a Russian analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, declared in an article for Foreign Policy magazine. \u201cThe recent developments have effectively put an end to the interregnum of partnership and cooperation between the West and Russia that generally prevailed in the quarter-century after the Cold War.\u201dMr. Trenin is not alone in seeing the struggle for Ukraine as the biggest game changer in European security since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. While no one imagines the superpowers returning to a hair-trigger nuclear confrontation or a bloc-against-bloc military buildup \u2014 for starters, Russia no longer has a bloc \u2014 the implications for other security problems and for the world economy are significant. Frozen conflicts in Moldova, Georgia and Azerbaijan, all \u201cnear abroad\u201d post-Soviet states, could heat up again.In Berlin, policy makers worry that Russia could raise the stakes by stopping its cooperation with the West on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, the civil war in Syria, security in Afghanistan and managing North Korea\u2019s unpredictable leader. Any one of those could make life uncomfortable for the United States and its European and Asian allies.In hindsight, Russia\u2019s military intervention in breakaway regions of Georgia in 2008 was a dry run. It had less global impact partly because an erratic Georgian leader fired the first shots and also because it barely changed the status quo.\u201cUkraine is different. It\u2019s on the fault line and it\u2019s too big,\u201d said Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, a senior fellow in trans-Atlantic relations with the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research institution. \u201cNow we are entering a systemic competition,\u201d said Ms. Stelzenm\u00fcller, who led a recent major study on Germany\u2019s new foreign and security policies. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think the Cold War analogy is accurate. If you\u2019re in Berlin, that\u2019s the way it feels. This is the big one.\u201dDespite its strong economic interests in Russia, where 6,200 German companies do business, and its dependence on Russia for 40 percent of its natural gas supplies, Ms. Stelzenm\u00fcller says she expects Berlin to \u201csurprise on the upside by being firm.\u201dRussia is only Germany\u2019s 11th-largest trade partner. Germany\u2019s main trade body said last week that a trade conflict between the two countries would hurt German business but would be life-threatening for a stagnant Russian economy.As Chris Patten, the former governor of Hong Kong, observes, while almost every European household owns goods made in China, few have anything produced in Russia, except gas and vodka.Central European economies could be severely disrupted if Moscow played with the gas valves, but supplies are plentiful, winter is over and Russia needs the revenue. In Cold War One, hawks in the United States and western Europe fretted that West Germany could turn neutral in its pursuit of d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union and its east European allies, including East Germany.That never happened. Bonn remained firmly anchored in the Western political and military camp. But there were some epic trans-Atlantic battles along the way. They included a 1982 clash with the United States over a German-Soviet gas pipeline deal that the Reagan administration feared would make West Germany dangerously dependent on Moscow. The Germans stood their ground. The pipeline was built and is one reason why Germany remains so firmly hooked on Russian energy.That dispute may hold lessons for any new cold war. A year later, Bonn withstood mass protests and threats from Moscow and allowed the United States to deploy medium-range nuclear missiles on its soil in response to Soviet SS-20 rockets pointed at the West. That led eventually to a negotiated end to the East-West arms race.Then as now, a perceived Russian threat ultimately united Europe and the United States, despite misgivings reflected today in opinion polls showing that neither Germans nor Americans are eager to get tough with Russia. Then as now, both Moscow and the West turned to China to try to tip the balance. Then as now, American strategists traded charges of appeasement and warmongering as they argued over the right policy mix between containing Russia and taking its interests into account.If Mr. Putin moves to annex Crimea, Europeans may soon have to contemplate awkward sacrifices to show their resolve. For France, this could mean suspending a contract to sell helicopter carriers to Russia. For Britain, closing its mansions and bank vaults to magnates close to Mr. Putin. For Germany, initiating gradual steps to reduce dependency on Russian gas.It will take Cold War-style determination for any of that to happen. If the going gets tough, maintaining unity in the European Union \u2014 with states in southern Europe like Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Bulgaria closer to Moscow \u2014 could prove a challenge.Advertisement"}
