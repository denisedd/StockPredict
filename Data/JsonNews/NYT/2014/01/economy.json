{"Headline": "The Vicious Circle of Income Inequality", "Date": "2014-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewAlmost every culture has some variation on the saying, \u201crags to rags in three generations.\u201d Whether it\u2019s \u201cclogs to clogs\u201d or \u201crice paddy to rice paddy,\u201d the message is essentially the same: Starting with nothing, the first generation builds a successful enterprise, which its profligate offspring then manage poorly, so that by the time the grandchildren take over, little value remains. Much of society\u2019s wealth is created by new enterprises, so the apparent implication of this folk wisdom is that economic inequality should be self-limiting. And for most of the early history of industrial society, it was. But no longer. Inequality in the United States has been increasing sharply for more than four decades and shows no signs of retreat. In varying degrees, it\u2019s been the same pattern in other countries.The economy has been changing, and new forces are causing inequality to feed on itself.One is that the higher incomes of top earners have been shifting consumer demand in favor of goods whose value stems from the talents of other top earners. Because the wealthy have just about every possession anyone might need, they tend to spend their extra income in pursuit of something special. And, often, what makes goods special today is that they\u2019re produced by people or organizations whose talents can\u2019t be duplicated easily. Wealthy people don\u2019t choose just any architects, artists, lawyers, plastic surgeons, heart specialists or cosmetic dentists. They seek out the best, and the most expensive, practitioners in each category. The information revolution has greatly increased their ability to find those practitioners and transact with them. So as the rich get richer, the talented people they patronize get richer, too. Their spending, in turn, increases the incomes of other elite practitioners, and so on. More recently, rising inequality has had much impact on the political process. Greater income and wealth in the hands of top earners gives them greater access to legislators. And it confers more ability to influence public opinion through contributions to research organizations and political action committees. The results have included long-term reductions in income and estate taxes, as well as relaxed business regulation. Those changes, in turn, have caused further concentrations of income and wealth at the top, creating even more political influence.By enabling the best performers in almost every arena to extend their reach, technology has also been a major driver of income inequality. The best athletes and musicians once entertained hundreds, sometimes thousands of people at one time, but they can now serve audiences of hundreds of millions. In other fields, it was once enough to be the best producer in a relatively small region. But because of falling transportation costs and trade barriers in the information economy, many fields are now dominated by only a handful of the best suppliers worldwide.Income concentration has changed spending patterns in other ways that widen the income gap. The wealthy have been spending more on gifts, clothing, housing, celebrations and other things simply because they have more money. Their extra spending has shifted the frames of reference that shape demand by others just below them, so these less wealthy people have been spending more, and so on, all the way down the income ladder. But because incomes below the top have been stagnant, the resulting expenditure cascades have made it harder for middle- and low-income families to make ends meet. Despite taking on huge amounts of debt, they\u2019ve been unable to keep pace with community standards. Interest payments impoverish them while enriching their wealthy creditors.But perhaps the most important new feedback loop shows up in higher education. Tighter budgets in middle-class families make it harder for them to afford the special tutors and other environmental advantages that help more affluent students win admission to elite universities. Financial aid helps alleviate these problems, but the children of affluent families graduate debt-free and move quickly into top-paying jobs, while the children of other families face lesser job prospects and heavy loads of student debt. All too often, the less affluent experience the miracle of compound interest in reverse.More than anything else, what\u2019s transformed the \u201crags to rags in three generations\u201d story is the reduced importance of inherited wealth relative to other forms of inherited advantage. Monetary bequests are far more easily squandered than early childhood advantage and elite educational credentials. As Americans, we once pointed with pride to our country\u2019s high level of economic and social mobility, but we\u2019ve now become one of the world\u2019s most rigidly stratified industrial democracies.Given the grave threats to the social order that extreme inequality has posed in other countries, it\u2019s easy to see why the growing income gap is poised to become the signature political issue of 2014. Low- and middle-income Americans don\u2019t appear to be on the threshold of revolt. But the middle-class squeeze continues to tighten, and it would be imprudent to consider ourselves immune. So if growing inequality has become a self-reinforcing process, we\u2019ll want to think more creatively about public policies that might contain it.In the meantime, the proportion of our citizens who never make it out of rags will continue to grow.ROBERT H. FRANK is an economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goodyear Reaches Severance Deal With French Union", "Date": "2014-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Striking workers at a Goodyear tire plant in France agreed on Wednesday to accept severance pay that they said was three times as much as the company had initially offered, clearing the way for the facility to close after a bitter conflict that escalated into a \u201cboss-napping.\u201dThe agreement provided \u201csignificant improvements in benefits\u201d for the 1,173 employees of the plant in Amiens, 150 kilometers, or about 90 miles, north of Paris, Goodyear said in a statement. In return, the dominant union at the facility, the C.G.T., agreed to end the occupation of the plant and halt legal action meant to delay its closing.The company did not disclose the terms of the settlement, but a union statement said that Goodyear had agreed to pay \u201cthree times more severance for all employees\u201d than proposed as part of a plan announced in 2012. The iTele news channel in France cited a union lawyer as saying that the payout would be 120,000 euros to 130,000 euros, or about $163,000 to $176,000, per worker.As is usual in such cases here, the union will seek additional money in a labor court, because, it said, there was no economic rationale for closing the plant.Paolo Ghilardi, a spokesman for Goodyear in France, said on Wednesday that the company would have no comment beyond the statement.Unable to find a buyer, Goodyear said in January 2013 that it would shut down the facility as it was no longer viable in light of conditions in the moribund European automobile sector and structural changes in the tire market.This was the second time the conflict cast an unflattering light on labor conditions in France. Last February, a Texas tire magnate, Maurice M. Taylor Jr., wrote a public letter to Arnaud Montebourg, the country\u2019s industry minister, who had encouraged Mr. Taylor to invest in the plant, disparaging the plant\u2019s workers and asking, \u201cHow stupid do you think we are?\u201dAccording to the newspaper Le Figaro, Mr. Montebourg said the accord \u201cnow opens the way\u201d to a possible takeover of the site by Mr. Taylor\u2019s company, Titan International. Mr. Taylor had demanded that the conflict be completely resolved before he got involved. Mr. Taylor was not immediately available for comment.The French government applauded the agreement. \u201cNow we have to create the conditions for the future of the workers and the site,\u201d Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault wrote on Twitter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spending Plan Ignores Overhaul for I.M.F.", "Date": "2014-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate on Thursday gave final approval to a $1.1 trillion spending bill for the current fiscal year, leaving behind what might have been the Obama administration\u2019s best chance to overhaul the International Monetary Fund and meet its obligations to the world\u2019s other economic powers.Administration officials concede that Congress\u2019s decision not to make the changes will be an embarrassment to President Obama internationally, undermining future efforts to reach global economic accords. But congressional Republicans would not budge from their refusal to cede some control of the fund to China, India, Brazil and other emerging economic powers.The structural changes to the fund have languished since Mr. Obama agreed to the \u201crebalancing\u201d with great fanfare at the G-20 meeting in Seoul, South Korea, in 2010. Powers like China have chafed at their status as junior partners at the monetary fund, even as they become major international lenders.In response, the world\u2019s largest economies agreed to give up some of their authority at the fund \u2014 the international lender of last resort \u2014 to democratize the institution and head off efforts by China to create alternative funding sources.\u201cI have made no secret of the fact that I think it\u2019s critical for us to finalize the ratification,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said Thursday at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cWe made a full-court press to get it done and got close, but didn\u2019t get it done this past week. We are continuing to stand by our commitment, and we will get it done.\u201dUnder the agreement, the United States was required to shift $63 billion from the I.M.F.\u2019s crisis fund to its general accounts, where a newly rebalanced board of directors would have more control. China would become the fund\u2019s third-largest member, and Western Europe\u2019s traditional dominance would wane.Since the 2010 accord, every nation involved but the United States has ratified it. But the United States remains the monetary fund\u2019s largest contributor, and without Congress\u2019s approval, the restructuring cannot happen. The operational cost of reconfiguring the governance might have reached $315 million, according to experts, a tiny part of the budget. But Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the decision to omit the change would \u201censure the responsible use of taxpayer dollars.\u201dSome Republicans, such as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, strongly backed the move as a way to fortify the monetary fund\u2019s authority and preserve American influence over countries like Egypt, dependent on the fund\u2019s credit.\u201cI know we\u2019re broke, but let me tell you this, the amount of money we\u2019re talking about is a rounding error quite frankly, but the I.M.F. has shown the ability to change behavior because these countries like Egypt need the cash,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cIf you take this funding mechanism off the table, you\u2019re really hurting our cause in the developing world.\u201dBut the view did not prevail.\u201cRegardless of the wisdom, many Americans now rightfully question our ability to continue supporting multilateral financial institutions like the I.M.F.,\u201d said Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, who opposed the changes, at a hearing with Mr. Lew last month.Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland and chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said of Republicans, \u201cThe main impediment was they don\u2019t like the I.M.F.\u201dEdwin M. Truman, a former Obama Treasury official now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, called Congress\u2019s inaction\u00a0\u201ca major blow to U.S. credibility around the world, with ominous consequences for the future of international economic, financial, and political cooperation.\u201dChristine Lagarde, the monetary fund\u2019s managing director, was slightly less gloomy, but she made her disappointment clear.\u201cI very much hope that it\u2019s a question of timing and not a question of determination to exclude the I.M.F.,\u201d she said at the National Press Club this week.Mr. Lew has made the overhaul a priority since he became Treasury secretary in 2013. Over the past month, he has pressed Representatives Rogers, Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, and Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Budget Committee.Republicans did hint that they could include the changes, but the price they were asking was too high for the administration to meet.\u201cThe administration pushed very hard, but the other side pushed hard right back,\u201d Ms. Mikulski said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Loehmann\u2019s, Out of Step and Closing Down", "Date": "2014-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig CityAt the time of her death at 88 in 1962, the Brooklyn store was grossing $3 million annually and the company had expanded across the metropolitan area. Through March (in most cases), Loehmann\u2019s, which has been in bankruptcy proceedings three times, will be liquidating 39 stores around the country; the company is owned mostly by a Westchester County hedge fund.For much of the \u201990s and some part of the last decade I shopped at Loehmann\u2019s with a sense of devotion and excitement, and although I cannot say precisely when I stopped, it correlated with a moment when adulthood demanded more of me. Above all, shopping at Loehmann\u2019s required time \u2014 time to wade through the racks of clothes often bearing obscure foreign labels you imagined would impress peers at a cocktail party only in Warsaw; time to wait in line to get into the communal dressing room; time to scour the racks outside the dressing room to see what others had discarded and re-enter.The sales staff at Loehmann\u2019s was never ingratiating or particularly helpful. Salespeople couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t guide you toward the Prada stewardess skirt you might have hoped to find or tell you anything about the collection it came from, gestures that might have even felt intrusive because the point of shopping at Loehmann\u2019s was that you brought not only a commitment to the hunt but also your own prodigious authority.On a recent afternoon I wandered into the Armoury while walking down Duane Street and looked at the ties, of which there were only a few, but which had been culled from some of the finest tie makers in the world. The two young men minding the store told me about a Neapolitan tailor whose trousers they sold; he applied hand sewing even to the linings of the waistbands, they said. One of the men was wearing a pair of the trousers, whose rise and cuff size and fabric are all determined by the client. The men explained how skilled the tailor was at ironing, and then showed me the unique type of iron the store used to press its garments. Their level of erudition suggested that they could be working in many different settings \u2014 at an investment bank, at the Whitney.More and more, what it means to buy truly luxurious things is to engage the refinement of the person selling them to you, to exchange information with someone whose status doesn\u2019t appear to be very different from your own. At Loehmann\u2019s you were buying bargains, not conversation, from working-class people, not historians of fashion. EMAIL: bigcity@nytimes.com Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Exports Pollution to U.S., Study Finds", "Date": "2014-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Filthy emissions from China\u2019s export industries are carried across the Pacific Ocean and contribute to air pollution in the Western United States, according to a paper published Monday by a prominent American science journal.The latest paper explores the environmental consequences of interconnected economies. The scientists wrote that \u201coutsourcing production to China does not always relieve consumers in the United States \u2014 or for that matter many countries in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 from the environmental impacts of air pollution.\u201dThe movement of air pollutants associated with the production of goods in China for the American market has resulted in a decline in air quality in the Western United States, the scientists wrote, though less manufacturing in the United States does mean cleaner air in the American East.\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on the trade impact,\u201d said Mr. Lin, a professor in the department of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at Peking University\u2019s School of Physics. \u201cTrade changes the location of production and thus affects emissions.\u201dBlack carbon is a particular problem because rain does not wash it out of the atmosphere, so it persists across long distances, the statement said. Black carbon is linked to asthma, cancer, emphysema, and heart and lung disease.\u201cLos Angeles experiences at least one extra day a year of smog that exceeds federal ozone limits because of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide emitted by Chinese factories making goods for export,\u201d the statement said.The amount of air pollution in the Western United States resulting from emissions from China is still very small compared with the amount produced by sources in the United States that include traffic and domestic industries.The study\u2019s scientists also looked at the impact of China\u2019s export industries on its own air quality. They estimated that in 2006, China\u2019s exporting of goods to the United States was responsible for 7.4 percent of production-based Chinese emissions for sulfur dioxide, 5.7 percent for nitrogen oxides, 3.6 percent for black carbon and 4.6 percent for carbon monoxide.The interdisciplinary research project was begun two and a half years ago by scholars in Britain, China and the United States. The group included economists as well as earth and environmental scientists. The methodology applied various analyses and modeling to the Chinese economy and to the earth\u2019s atmosphere and weather patterns.The scholars who gave emissions estimates for China\u2019s export industries, a significant part of the country\u2019s economy, looked at data from 42 sectors that are direct or indirect contributors to emissions. They included steel and cement production, power generation and transportation. Coal-burning factories were the biggest sources of pollutants and greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming.Alex L. Wang, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies Chinese environmental policy, said after reading the new paper: \u201cThis is a reminder to us that a significant percentage of China\u2019s emissions of traditional pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions are connected to the products we buy and use every day in the U.S. We should be concerned, not only because this pollution is harming the citizens of China, but because it\u2019s damaging the air quality in parts of the U.S.\u201dMr. Lin, the report\u2019s lead author, said he hoped that the research would stimulate discussion of adopting consumption-based accounting of emissions, rather than just production-based accounting.Economists caution that this does not mean that a quarter of the economy was dedicated to producing goods for exports, since China still does a lot of reprocessing instead of making exports entirely itself.But the proportion of China\u2019s exports that are made in China has risen steadily in recent years as many companies move more of their supply chains, instead of just having final assembly work done here. So the overall percentages of economic output might not by themselves be fair indicators of the importance of exports to the Chinese economy.Chinese exports to the United States sagged in 2009 because of the global financial crisis but have resumed vigorous growth. By China\u2019s method of counting, which includes only direct shipments from mainland Chinese ports to the United States and excludes goods that travel by way of Hong Kong, Chinese exports grew to $368.5 billion last year from $252.3 billion in 2008. By contrast, China imported only $152.6 billion worth of goods directly from the United States.The United States, which does include goods briefly transiting Hong Kong in its trade figures with mainland China, has shown even larger American trade deficits with China for many years, because Chinese companies use Hong Kong heavily for exports but much less for imports. Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Jobless Youth, U.S. Is Said to Pay High Price", "Date": "2014-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe key takeaway here is that it\u2019s not just the individuals who are suffering as members of our generation,\u201d said Rory O\u2019Sullivan, the policy and research director of the Young Invincibles, a postrecession youth advocacy group, which did the study. \u201cWhen you have an entire generation of people that are out of work, it\u2019s going to create tremendous costs for taxpayers both now and in the future.\u201dThe new report is an effort to quantify the financial effect now. Its authors determined how much young people would have paid in taxes had they been working, and how much less they would have collected in unemployment and other social welfare spending. Each jobless worker between 18 and 24 accounted for $4,100 a year, they concluded, and those between 25 and 34 accounted for $9,875, the study said.Based on those figures, if youth unemployment were reduced to its prerecession rate, the study said, the federal government would recoup $7.8 billion, or $53 per taxpayer, and state and local governments would recoup $1.1 billion. If all those discouraged young people, who are not counted as unemployed because they are not actively seeking work, were also in the labor force, the total figure would be larger: $25 billion. About 93 percent of that number comes from taxes that would have been collected, and the rest from averting social spending, the study said. The report estimated that effect per state taxpayer was greatest in Alabama, Kentucky and North Carolina.The group intends to present its findings at a news conference on Tuesday with Senators Patty Murray of Washington and Cory A. Booker of New Jersey, both Democrats.The report is the latest in several detailing the disproportionate effect of the recession on young people and their lifetime earnings. The findings have renewed interest in programs that long ago went out of fashion, like apprenticeships and vocational high schools. President Obama has said he will reward colleges and universities that demonstrate an ability to place graduates in paying jobs.\u201cSuddenly people are talking about youth,\u201d said Anthony P. Carnevale, the director of the Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown, who wrote a foreword for the latest study. He said youth work programs went out of style in the 1980s, as the baby boom generation stopped needing them. Now, struggles among white, middle-class young people have helped bring the issue back to the fore, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting traction,\u201d he added. \u201cThe fear that\u2019s the strongest of all is that young people won\u2019t be middle class anymore.\u201dStill, Mr. Carnevale said, \u201cSpending for retirement is crowding out investment in young people, especially human capital investment.\u201dYoung Invincibles said that federal youth jobs programs had been cut by $1 billion a year since 2002, and recommended expanding the Labor Department\u2019s registered apprenticeship program and AmeriCorps, a national service program that had more than half a million applicants last year for about 80,000 positions, Mr. O\u2019Sullivan said. It also advocates restoring financing to Youth Opportunity Grants, which were aimed at at-risk youth and were ended in 2005. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Britain, Housing Prices Rise the Fastest Since 2006", "Date": "2014-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Housing prices in Britain rose last year at the fastest pace since 2006, adding to fears that the country\u2019s real estate market is overheating.The strength, in part, reflects government intervention. Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s government has been seeking to revive a sluggish economy by supporting the housing market through stimulus programs. The Bank of England has also kept interest rates at 0.5 percent since March 2009, a record low that has helped spur new purchases.Real estate prices in many areas have moved away from the lows that left many borrowers under water following the 2008 financial crisis. The pace of growth varied across regions, but was fastest in London, where prices rose 15 percent in the year, and the slowest in the north of the country, where prices were up 1.9 percent.At the end of 2013, the average home price stood at 175,826 pounds ($290,500), up from \u00a3147,746 at the low in February 2009. Still, home prices remain 5 percent below the precrisis peak in 2007, according to Danae Kyriakopoulou, an economist at the Center for Economics and Business Research in London.The rebound has been experienced broadly in the housing market, as consumer demand spurs new lending and construction. A survey of construction industry purchasing managers by Markit Economics, a data analysis firm, showed activity increasing for an eighth consecutive month in December. It barely slowed from November\u2019s pace, which was the fastest since 2007.But activity is raising concerns that the housing boom may be unsustainable.The government\u2019s Help-to-Buy program, introduced last year, allows some borrowers to purchase homes with a down payment of only 5 percent of the 25 percent that is usually required by banks, with the government guaranteeing the remaining 20 percent. Another program rewarded banks for writing both mortgages and business loans, although the government scaled back the effort in November.Some economists and policy makers worry that such programs encourage excess in the market, and threaten to create a bubble in the housing market. And other parts of the economy are not showing the same resilience.Monetary stimulus, for example, has not invigorated business lending in the same way. Home loans increased, but business lending fell by 3.9 percent, in November, according to the central bank. Some banks remain reluctant to lend while many businesses are shying away from taking credit as long as uncertainties about the world economic outlook persist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Thai Protest Is Losing Steam", "Date": "2014-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsBANGKOK \u2014 Even as demonstrators were spreading across Bangkok this week, they were losing ground with a constituency whose support they badly need: the urban middle class. The protesters \u2014 themselves mainly from white-collar backgrounds \u2014 are intent on bringing down Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. She was elected in 2011 on promises to revive the popular policies of her elder brother, Thaksin, who was prime minister from 2001 until he was ousted in 2006. But her opponents are claiming that the government is corrupt, and those policies ruinous. Meanwhile, the threat of violence is growing: Dozens of people were wounded on Friday when an explosion hit antigovernment demonstrators marching through the city.The government has tried to mitigate the crisis by calling an early election, for Feb. 2 \u2014 even though that will not improve its legitimacy. The Democrat Party has said it will boycott the vote; it wants nothing less than Ms. Yingluck\u2019s departure. This was what the protest leader, Suthep Thaugsuban, was hoping to achieve when he called, earlier this month, for vast protests to try to shut down Bangkok. But the demonstrations have threatened to become so disruptive to everyday life and the economy that even people who support the opposition are being turned off it. This is a significant shift, for it presents Thailand with an 11th-hour opportunity to find a peaceful resolution to the deadlock. The standoff is the latest round in a conflict that began in 2006 when the army toppled Mr. Thaksin on grounds of abusing power and offending the monarchy. The next election restored a pro-Thaksin government, sparking mass protests by the so-called Yellow Shirts; more instability ensued. After yet another election in 2011, won decisively by Ms. Yingluck, opponents of the Shinawatras have repeatedly tried to stir up public opposition and vainly appealed to the generals and the palace to throw her government out. The crisis exploded in late October when the government clumsily attempted to pass an amnesty bill that would have allowed Mr. Thaksin to return to Thailand and even possibly reclaim his seized assets. There was an immediate outburst of anger, which then matured into more general discontent with the politicians in power. At first, in the fall, the demonstrations were brilliantly devised for urban white-collar workers: Messages on social media invited flash mobs to convene over the lunch break at intersections served by mass transit and on Sundays for major gatherings. Since then, the protesters have marched around the city along the routes that the so-called Red Shirts backing Mr. Thaksin had followed in 2010, when they were demanding a new election. Yet Mr. Suthep and leaders of the protest movement have struggled to keep the demonstrations going on a large scale: Their core supporters need to keep office hours. Organizers have tried to make up by bussing in supporters from the Democrats\u2019 stronghold in southern Thailand and recruiting students, especially from vocational schools, which are notorious for brawls. These recruits have been involved in several clashes that have left eight dead.  The protest leaders have proposed no attractive alternative to the Yingluck government \u2014 just the vague notion of creating a \u201cpeople\u2019s council\u201d that would set up an interim government and oversee a reform agenda (still to be determined). And their rhetoric has grown increasingly shrill. A varied roster of speakers \u2014 politicians, doctors, high-society women \u2014 have taken turns hounding the whole Shinawatra clan, sometimes with lewd, sexist and ultranationalist abuse.  After Thailand\u2019s leading English-language daily, The Bangkok Post, called the demonstrators its \u201cpeople of the year,\u201d the paper\u2019s editorial writers began lambasting Mr. Suthep for disrupting the city, provoking violence and wrecking the national economy. Other media outlets also have cooled down. Huge billboards have appeared demanding \u201cStop Suthep Shutting Down the Country and Damaging the Economy.\u201d Citizens\u2019 groups have begun holding candlelit vigils calling for peace. A coalition of business associations has desperately tried to broker a compromise to stem economic damage. Parts of the urban middle class have cooled on Mr. Suthep\u2019s plans to oust the government by paralyzing their city. Even if they still support the objective, they have come to question the method. This is a chance to get beyond the current political impasse. The Democrats strongly supported the protests at first, but have moved quietly into the background over recent weeks. Dissenting voices in the party have pressed its leaders to accept the government\u2019s recent proposals to set up a process for reform and to drop its boycott of the election. The Election Commission has proposed delaying the voting by several weeks so that more candidates can be registered \u2014 demonstrators have blocked registration in several constituencies \u2014 and the Democrat Party can reconsider its boycott. So far, the party is still refusing to participate. Unless the party changes its position, it risks losing even more support among the urban middle class. Without some such compromise, Thailand will slide toward an election that cannot resolve the crisis and may be marked by violence, perhaps even a coup.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "2014 Elections Likely to Keep Capital\u2019s Split", "Date": "2014-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With the 2014 political landscape becoming more defined, it is increasingly likely that the midterm elections in November will maintain divided government in the capital for the final two years of President Obama\u2019s second term, with the chief unknown being exactly how divided it will be.A review of competitive congressional contests suggests that, at the moment, Republicans will hold on to the House, though Democrats could defy midterm history and gain a few seats. Senate Democrats, at the same time, are defending unfavorable terrain and will almost certainly see their majority narrowed. They are at risk of losing it altogether, an outcome that would leave Capitol Hill entirely in Republican control for the conclusion of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency.\u201cDemocrats are going to lose seats, there is no question about that,\u201d said Jennifer Duffy, who follows Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.Hoping to offset losses and make it more difficult for Republicans to net the six seats that would hand them the majority, Senate Democrats are taking aim at Republican-held seats in Georgia, an open contest, and Kentucky, where they hope to defeat Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader and 30-year Senate veteran who has seen his popularity dip back home.They are also hoping that Republicans, who are engaged in a continuing internal struggle over ideology, will end a series of bitter primaries by nominating far-right candidates who could be defeated in general elections even in Republican-leaning states, a phenomenon that cost Republicans in 2010 and 2012. Both parties will have to defend against an electorate sour on Washington\u2019s dysfunction as neither seems to be benefiting much from an improving economy.House and Senate Republicans are coalescing around the new health care law as their chief issue and plan to frame problems with the implementation of the law \u2014 and the individual stories of those adversely affected \u2014 to paint Mr. Obama and the Democrats as incompetent administrators of an overreaching expansion of government.\u201cObamacare, Obamacare, Obamacare,\u201d said Andrea Bozek, communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cIt is going to be an issue in every single congressional race.\u201dThe election is still 10 months away, and a major misstep by either party or an unexpected outside event could quickly shift the narrative of a campaign season that is likely to set records for midterm spending by outside groups seeking to influence the outcome without disclosing the sources behind their cash.But in the end, many experts agree, the distribution of power in Washington could be guided by the popularity of the president, whose approval rating now stands at 46 percent, according to the latest CBS News poll. The number is being watched closely by both parties, and the assumption is that if it is in the low 40s or worse around election time, Republicans would benefit significantly.After performing better than expected in 2012, Senate Democrats will be hard-pressed to repeat their success. They are defending seven seats in states won by the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Seats in three of them \u2014 Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia \u2014 are open because of retiring lawmakers, and incumbents seeking re-election in Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina are in for a defining political fight.Analysts say that South Dakota and West Virginia will be very difficult for Democrats to hold and that Montana will be a test. Democrats, though, believe the possible appointment to the Senate of Lt. Gov. John Walsh in place of Senator Max Baucus, nominated to be the ambassador to China, would give Mr. Walsh a push in that fight.With Republicans holding the edge in the competitive open seats, the battle for control will most likely come down to the ability of Democratic senators like Mark Begich of Alaska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Kay Hagan of North Carolina to wage successful re-election campaigns in states where the president is unpopular.Hoping to stoke enthusiasm, Democrats say they also intend to make the case about the dangers of a Republican-led Congress. \u201cThe fact that pundits have migrated from talking about South Dakota, West Virginia and Arkansas to states like Virginia, Michigan, Oregon, New Hampshire and Colorado shows clear momentum for Republican candidates,\u201d said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Considering they have twice as many seats as Democrats up in 2016, with some in Democratic-leaning states, Republicans and their allies will press every advantage because they see this election cycle as their best opportunity to win back the Senate for some time.In the House, Democrats would have to pick up 17 seats to regain the majority they lost in the Tea Party wave of 2010, though not even party optimists see that as realistic. Mr. Rothenberg said his best estimate was that either party is capable of winning a handful of additional seats. That prospect reflects the reality that most House districts are now considered safe for incumbents, forcing the parties to concentrate on the fairly limited number of districts where they have a partisan advantage.But Democrats believe they can beat back the challenge to five other incumbents in red districts and say they have real opportunities in seats being vacated by Republicans in Arkansas, Iowa, Montana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia and against incumbents in California, Colorado, Illinois and New York, among others. Republicans acknowledge that they will be defending vacancies in the expensive media markets of Philadelphia and Washington. For a moment in October when Republicans were cratering in public approval because of the government shutdown, Democrats entertained real thoughts of winning back the majority. But the flawed implementation of the health care law has tempered those expectations. Democrats say that at minimum, they expect to chip away at the Republican majority to get them in position for a run at control in 2016.\u201cWhile the rollout of Obamacare created a more challenging environment, House Republicans still have not recovered from the toxic environment of the shutdown,\u201d said Representative Steve Israel, the New York Democrat who heads up the party\u2019s House campaign committee. \u201cThey are still at historically low levels of job approval, and they are still extremely unpopular.\u201d Democrats, though, are held in similarly low regard.Democratic strategists also believe they have a counterattack to the continuing Republican blitz on the health care law and cite polling that shows the public wants the health care law improved, not repealed as Republicans insist. Trying to exploit that sentiment, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in recent days paid for automated phone calls in 15 states criticizing Republicans for focusing on repeal of the law.And in a new ad on behalf of Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, an Arizona Democrat who is a top Republican target, the House Majority PAC praises her and says she \u201cblew the whistle on the disastrous health care website, calling it stunning ineptitude.\u201dAdvisers to both House and Senate Democrats say they hope to be able to neutralize the health care law as an issue and focus their argument more on efforts to bolster the middle class. But they start the election year facing strong headwinds in an environment so poisonous that many of them will not even dare to have the president campaign for them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Counts on Power of Convening People for Change", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite House MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama may have lost the power of persuasion with Congress, but he still has the underrated power of invitation to the White House. Since congressional Republicans remain hostile as ever to his agenda, next week Mr. Obama will begin hosting influential groups in the West Wing to try to spur specific action on national problems short of changes to federal law.More than 100 college presidents are expected to gather with Mr. Obama on Thursday to discuss ways that they can commit to enrolling more low-income minority students and ensuring that more of them graduate.Two weeks later, corporate executives will be in the White House to talk about how they, as employers, can reduce the hiring stigma that attaches to many jobless Americans the longer they have been out of work.Mr. Obama is to highlight both initiatives in his State of the Union address on Jan. 28, and will keep seeking legislation to such ends, administration officials say. But rather than continue to wrangle with recalcitrant Republicans, Mr. Obama has told associates that he sees more opportunities for progress in using his so-called convening power to summon to the White House and mobilize some of the nation\u2019s most prominent citizens, who can have an immediate impact in their fields.In the dual metaphor now favored at the White House to describe the reliance on executive actions \u2014 the phone and the pen \u2014 the phone signifies presidential invitations to the meetings, while the pen represents Mr. Obama\u2019s more familiar authority to sign executive orders and federal regulations.\u201cIn a world of divided government, it is unrealistic to expect large portions of our agenda to pass a Republican Congress,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, Mr. Obama\u2019s senior strategist. \u201cBut what we have to do is demonstrate to the public how we are moving the ball forward, absent congressional action.\u201dWhile Mr. Obama in past years has formed advisory councils and hosted forums, the topics were typically broad areas like job creation or export promotion. The new gatherings are more narrowly focused and have the goal of producing \u201cdeliverables\u201d \u2014 commitments for specific actions and investments.But the sessions will require the kind of follow-up that Mr. Obama\u2019s critics say has been missing from a number of previous executive initiatives \u2014 for example, past outreach to business groups on job creation. And such shows of presidential leadership cannot soon offset the damage done by the bungled introduction of the government\u2019s health insurance website.\u201cThere\u2019s no better convener than the president of the United States,\u201d said M. Peter McPherson, a former president of Michigan State University. Now the president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, an alliance of about 200 institutions, Mr. McPherson has met with White House officials, led by Gene B. Sperling, Mr. Obama\u2019s top economic adviser, to plan the meeting with college presidents.\u201cThe way they\u2019re structuring this is they\u2019re saying: \u2018Here\u2019s the broad goal. What kinds of ideas or commitments do you have to meet it?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. McPherson said. \u201cThey had some suggestions, but they made it very clear that these weren\u2019t exclusive ideas.\u201dHe said of the summit: \u201cWe think it\u2019s just a great idea. You have got a bunch of universities that are really quite interested.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s heightened emphasis on executive action is also reflected in his recent hiring of John D. Podesta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. Mr. Podesta, who this week began a yearlong stint to help out in the White House after a rocky 2013 for Mr. Obama, is founder of the left-leaning Center for American Progress and has long called for Mr. Obama to make greater use of executive powers \u2014 including by convening White House summit meetings.\u201cCongressional gridlock,\u201d he added, \u201cdoes not mean the federal government stands still.\u201dMr. Podesta, who planned Mr. Obama\u2019s transition in 2008, cited in his report a first-term initiative, Skills for America\u2019s Future, as one example of the president\u2019s use of his convening power. In meetings with community colleges, employers, labor unions and job-training providers, the administration got their pledges to work toward graduating five million more community college students by 2020.She added, \u201cPresident Obama could bring thousands of business leaders to the White House to pledge action for job creation (but he hasn\u2019t yet).\u201dContacted last week, Professor Kanter said the kind of Clinton-like mobilization that Mr. Obama seems to be attempting \u201cgets the action going,\u201d with each participant \u201cdoing something in their own way that might then add up to significant change.\u201dFor the White House meeting with college presidents, a detailed agenda drafted in consultation with university officials shows the kind of results that Mr. Obama seeks.The proposed pledges include specific targets for recruiting more low-income students as well as efforts to help such candidates through the process of standardized testing, application writing and college interviews. The goal is to reduce their disadvantage against more privileged applicants who increasingly seek professional help.\u201cI couldn\u2019t afford to go on a bunch of college visits,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hire a personal tutor. I couldn\u2019t enroll in S.A.T. prep classes. We didn\u2019t have the money.\u201dTo retain low-income students through graduation, other proposals on the table would commit colleges to do more through counseling and bolster other efforts to help them both with classwork and with adjusting to life among more affluent students. One idea: \u201ccohort\u201d admissions that accept small groups of low-income students from the same high schools or communities, to support one another.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does Brazil Have the Answer?", "Date": "2014-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot long after I got back from my recent trip to Brazil, I called some economists to gain a better understanding of where the country stood economically. To me, Rio de Janeiro felt a little like Shanghai: there was plenty of high-end shopping in neighborhoods like Ipanema \u2014 and plenty of poverty in the favelas, or slums. There was also a lot in between. What is most striking to a visitor is how many middle-class citizens there seem to be. Cars were everywhere; traffic jams, I\u2019ve come to believe, are a sign of a growing middle class. It means people have enough money to buy automobiles.It is, of course, possible that Brazil\u2019s economy could hit the wall and some of the gains made could be reversed. A new emphasis on investment and entrepreneurship could probably help it. The spontaneous protests last summer were the results of the new middle class wanting the sorts of things that the middle class always wants: better services, higher quality schools, less corruption. Still, the Brazil example gives rise to a question we don\u2019t ask enough in this country:What\u2019s the point of economic growth if nobody has a job?An earlier version of this column misstated the United States unemployment rate. It is 6.7 percent, not 7 percent.Advertisement"}

Trade agreements must offer \u201ccarrots\u201d to win acceptance of environmental rules from developing countries and promote the broadest use of cleaner technologies, energy sources and management systems.Another example of this win-win attitude is the commitment by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation economies to scale back trade barriers to environmental goods and services.

{"Headline": "The Future of Broadband", "Date": "2014-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetterTo the Editor:American consumers pay more than they should for broadband because of the combination of weak competition and lax regulation, but other factors also raise costs, including low population densities, geographic diversity and wide variation in local government requirements. There is a persistent digital divide in America that reflects income and lack of computer skills, not failure of infrastructure deployment.The United States is not struggling in the digital economy. On the demand side, broadband subscriptions and use in this country are far higher than in the other major advanced industrial economies. On the supply side, the United States has a near-monopoly on the leading edge of innovation and production.Utility-style regulation might help the demand side, but it could undermine the supply side. Failing to restrain abuse of market power will slow growth and cause a severe reaction abroad.The hyperbole obscures the successful model of both the Internet and Wi-Fi communications protocols. Policy fostered decentralized communications and prevented abuse of telephone company market power, but regulators did not seek to dictate services and prices.Innovators filled the space between the market and the state with open standards administered by voluntary agreement of the participants.

In a subsequent meeting also attended by Chinmaya Garekhan of the United Nations Secretariat, a right-hand man of Mr. Boutros-Ghali\u2019s, the secretary general stuck to his position. In the end, however, Mr. Boutros-Ghali conceded that the Americans, at least, had been informed \u2014 which in his view should have been enough as far as the Security Council was concerned.

Rom\u00e9o Dallaire\u2019s views on the impending genocide, it would at least have had a chance to react \u2014 and history might have taken a vastly different turn.Karel Kovanda, BrusselsThe writer was the Czech ambassador to the United Nations from 1993 to 1997.\u00a0Ireland\u2019s Hard-Fought ProgressHe writes that \u201coutside Dublin, property prices are still falling,\u201d implying that this is a deplorable situation. The reality is that the return of property prices to affordable levels is now almost complete \u2014 a necessary and welcome development for a healthy economy.Mr. O\u2019Toole says that unemployment remains \u201cvery high\u201d at 12.8 percent, which is true (though the latest figures are 12.4 percent). But the rate is falling fast, and if that rate of decline continues, unemployment could be below 10 percent within a year \u2014 still too high but a move in the right direction.Further, he says that people are leaving Ireland because they have \u201clost faith in the idea that Ireland can give them the opportunities they want.\u201d Undoubtedly many leave out of necessity, but many others leave for adventure and experience elsewhere \u2014 and intend to return, just as many of those who left in the 1970s and 1980s came back in the 1990s. Mr. O\u2019Toole also ignores the offsetting immigration, which brings new and different energies into this country.The writer asserts that the so-called troika \u2014 the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank \u2014 \u201csomehow convinced themselves that sharp cuts in public spending and reductions in wages would go hand in hand with economic growth.\u201d No, the troika brought a checkbook and dose of healthy reality to a situation in which the Irish government was running out of money and no one would lend to Ireland to pay public sector salaries and keep services running.Mr. O\u2019Toole says that \u2018\u2018wages for most workers have dropped sharply.\u201d But the reality is that it is private sector workers who have borne the brunt of the cuts; public sector workers have been largely sheltered, despite being better paid even before the crisis broke. The failure of the government to grapple with this issue and the related one of protected professions has been repeatedly highlighted by the troika.Finally, the writer asserts that \u201cthe austerity program has not succeeded even in its basic aim of bringing down Ireland\u2019s sovereign debt.\u201d This is nonsense. Ireland\u2019s public finances were out of control; the involvement of the troika and the funding they brought allowed a necessary adjustment to the public finances to be undertaken in a measured way. The consequence of this approach was that sovereign debt had to increase, as we were gradually weaned off excessive spending, and extra taxation measures took effect.It is disappointing that Mr. O\u2019Toole takes such a negative and resentful view of Ireland\u2019s progress in grappling with this economic crisis.

{"Headline": "Divining a 5-Year Investment Strategy", "Date": "2014-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersFIVE years ago, it would have been easy to predict that the stock market would be higher today than it was then. But no one would have paid attention. Stocks were in a free fall and wouldn\u2019t hit bottom for two more months.Today, after a year in which the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose almost 30 percent, there are plenty of views on what the next five years might look like, but they\u2019re not in agreement. Plenty of people question whether the next five years can be as good as the last five. They base their concern on stock indexes setting records, while other parts of the economy, like jobs, continue to lag. On Friday, the S.&P. 500 closed at 1,831.37.Other people see the fundamentals of United States companies as so solid that stocks will continue to do well despite their large run-up. \u201cI think we\u2019re in for a long bull market and economic expansion that will be a little longer than average,\u201d said Marty Sass, chairman and chief executive of M. D. Sass, which manages $6 billion. \u201cThat\u2019s my best guess.\u201dThis is where my interest in the three- to five-year investment outlook comes in. Back in 2009, the economy could have continued getting worse for longer than it did, but it would have turned around at some point. Today, some investors have the opposite concern, that the good times have run too long and there is a correction coming.Regardless of whether a correction comes or not, this is where the medium-term projection should have value. Instead of reading tea leaves, it should be able to assess tectonic shifts. So now that we\u2019re in 2014, I wanted to consider what investment strategists think the near future could bring.Production of oil and gas in the United States, for one, is expected to be stronger in five years. This is based on proven reserves and new drilling techniques. Saying what will happen in six to 12 months in this industry, though, is always difficult: A pipeline could explode, turmoil in the Middle East could impact prices, or regulation in Washington could cost companies more money. Longer term, the issue is supply and demand.\u201cWe\u2019ve discovered through this shale drilling how to exploit much more natural gas than we ever thought we could,\u201d said Kent Croft, chief investment officer of Croft Leominster. \u201cHave all the stocks been the greatest this year? No. Do I expect them to outperform over time? I certainly do. I think this is one of those watershed moments in the U.S. economic outlook.\u201dThe mobile technology sector is another longer-term play. Mr. Sass said payment processors like PayPal were set to increase their processing of payments online but also to reach more into retail stores. And, of course, more of everything is moving to mobile devices, and companies are going to look to profit from that.In other industries, like airlines and television broadcasting, consolidation is going to make stronger companies over the medium term. \u201cThese are industries that have gone from horror shows to very compelling plays,\u201d Mr. Sass said.They worry first, she said, about how much higher equity prices can go. After four and a half years of prices going higher, they ask her when the rally is going to end. \u201cThis is where we\u2019ll walk them through corporate fundamentals and show them balance sheets and how margins can be sustainable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe find that most valuations are below 10- to 15-year historical norms.\u201dThe two other worries are what will happen to China and Europe. With China, she said, the concern is that the country\u2019s economic growth is going to slow and drag down the global economy. \u201cThere are some areas of the market, particularly in the resource space, that have overcapacity,\u201d she said.Michael Tiedemann, chief investment officer of Tiedemann Wealth Management, said he saw China as one of the two big questions over the next three to five years.(The other was how tighter rules on bank lending and the Federal Reserve\u2019s gradual end to buying bonds will play out.) He is not confident that China will be able to handle its transition from an export-based economy to a more balanced one smoothly.\u201cWe\u2019re not predicting it\u2019s going to go badly, but along the way perhaps there will be conflicting signals,\u201d he said. And that calls for investors to be prepared for some volatility.The questions about Europe revolved around whether the Continent had gotten over its problems. \u201cThey\u2019re either convinced that Europe is going to grow strongly next year because they\u2019ve seen an appreciation of assets,\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cOr they\u2019re very skeptical about institutional change and the capability to bring together so many different countries for cohesive change.\u201d (Her view is some place in the middle, she said.)But Dean Tenerelli, European stock fund manager at T. Rowe Price, said that Europe\u2019s continued recovery was linked to what happened in China, which for years was bolstering companies around the world with its demands for goods.\u201cI come across a lot of businesses where they\u2019re disappointing because that froth isn\u2019t there anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mining companies are cutting capital expenditures by 25 percent and that trickles through to all the companies that make that stuff and to the banks that were financing all of that. I even picked it up at beverage companies that have missed their numbers because the Chinese demand for cognac is declining.\u201dKeith Banks, president of U.S. Trust, said looking out 10 years was too long for most clients to think about, but five years was a great time frame to spot what he called the mega-trends where people made substantial wealth. These trends run over many years and offer a sustained opportunity for people to participate, even if they miss the very start of the trend.\u201cThe world isn\u2019t an on/off switch,\u201d Mr. Banks said. \u201cIt is a dimmer switch.\u201dHe said his firm talked to clients more and more about the three- to five-year outlook, but often they needed the view over the next year to get to the longer one. \u201cIt\u2019s an iterative process,\u201d he said.One of the main benefits of the longer view is it smooths out the noise that can crop up in just one year. \u201cI have more confidence in looking ahead five years than I do one year,\u201d said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management. \u201cAnd I think most strategists feel the same. The short term is so uncertain and can be impacted by a lot of noise, while in the long term, markets are very fundamental.\u201dHow those projections are done, though, naturally relies on assumptions, and that means they can be flawed.\u201cAny three- to five-year forecast typically relies pretty heavily on some mean reversion assumptions \u2014 I believe this company is relatively undervalued versus the market or its peers,\u201d Mr. Tiedemann said. \u201cWe have five-year forward views on asset classes and projections. At the core of those is our five-year expectation of G.D.P. growth, inflation and where we believe the 10-year Treasury yield will be at the end of five years.\u201dIn other words, the medium term may be more accurate, but projecting it is still difficult. Yet it is such a stabilizing view that can help people through the anxious moments of any year. \u201cOur advice is, \u2018Don\u2019t time, don\u2019t chase and don\u2019t react,\u2019 \u201d said Karl Wellner, president and chief executive of Papamarkou Wellner Asset Management. \u201cWe want our clients to think and plan ahead. It\u2019s very simple. But people kick themselves for making the same mistakes over and over.\u201dThere are worse New Year\u2019s resolutions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Human Rights Watch Criticizes Inaction on Syria", "Date": "2014-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 The advocacy group Human Rights Watch sharply criticized international powers on Tuesday for the way they are dealing with the civil war in Syria, saying that the desire to bring President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government to the negotiating table should not become a pretext for failing to protect civilians caught in the conflict, which has claimed more than 100,000 lives.Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, which has its headquarters in New York, said the images were consistent with what his organization had seen when it visited detention centers in Syria. The photographs, provided to the Syrian opposition by a man who described himself as a defector from Mr. Assad\u2019s security forces, highlight the importance of opening up Syrian detention facilities to international inspection, he said.Speaking at a news conference in Berlin, Mr. Roth said that Western governments, and especially the United States, had not spoken out strongly enough about the violence for fear that it could endanger the peace talks.\u201cIt is essential that the mass atrocities being committed in Syria be a parallel focus of any diplomatic effort,\u201d Mr. Roth said. He called for an end to the indiscriminate killing of civilians and an opening of Syria\u2019s borders for humanitarian aid. \u201cWe cannot afford to wait for the distant prospect of a peace accord before the killing of 5,000 Syrians a month comes to an end.\u201dIn addition to Syria, the group\u2019s report also condemned what it called \u201clip service\u201d paid to democracy by the governments of Egypt and Myanmar.Human Rights Watch said that rest of the world had done too little to intervene in Syria to protect civilians, in contrast with the efforts mounted by France, the United States and the United Nations in African countries like the Central African Republic South Sudan.President Obama\u2019s record on national security issues was criticized in the report, from the continued existence of the detention center in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, to what the group called the unlawful killing of civilians through drone attacks in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. The group also faulted the \u201cvirtually unchecked mass electronic surveillance\u201d that was revealed by documents released by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor. While Human Rights Watch praised Mr. Obama for appointing a panel to recommend reforms, the group questioned whether the recommendations would translate into concrete policy changes.\u201cHis speech did not address some of the fundamental problems with the massive invasion of our privacy rights represented by the N.S.A.'s surveillance,\u201d Mr. Roth said, referring to the president\u2019s speech last week on the nation\u2019s intelligence programs. \u201cThere is a complete failure to recognize the privacy interests involved.\u201dThe report also expressed concern that other governments, including those with poor rights records, could follow the American example in surveillance, forcing \u201cuser data to stay within their own borders, setting up the potential for increased Internet censorship.\u201d In addition, the group chided the United States for attempting to prosecute Mr. Snowden under the Espionage Act, noting that the decision has allowed Russia, which has offered temporary sanctuary to Mr. Snowden, to \u201crecast itself as a champion of privacy rights.\u201dPresident Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s decision to free activists from the punk band Pussy Riot and the environmental group Greenpeace, as well as the Russian dissident Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, were dismissed as attempts to avoid international criticism ahead of the Winter Olympics that begin in Sochi next month. \u201cThe effect was largely to highlight the arbitrariness\u201d of Mr. Putin\u2019s government, the report said.Egypt, Myanmar and Thailand, as well as Ukraine \u2014 where mass street protests turned violent again this week \u2014 were singled out as examples where governments pledged to make democratic changes that never came to fruition. Human Rights Watch praised the resulting widespread protests as an indication that the public is not willing to be denied basic freedoms.Compromises among political parties achieved in Tunisia were held up as an example of how, despite a stalled economy and political polarization, a consensus can be achieved in a young democracy that emerged from the popular movements for change across the Arab world in 2011, known as the Arab Spring.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated Human Rights Watch\u2019s complaint about international efforts to protect civilians in Syria, compared with those in South Sudan and the Central African Republic. The group\u2019s report said the efforts in Syria were insufficient; it did not call for military intervention in Syria.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Costa Rica\u2019s Wrong Turn", "Date": "2014-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 On Sunday, Costa Ricans will go to the polls in what many consider the most important presidential election in a generation.At stake is the future of an economic model that over the last 25 years has produced robust economic growth but has failed to significantly reduce the poverty rate. Unfortunately, a bad reading of the economic policies implemented by a succession of conservative and social-democratic administrations over the last three decades could lead voters to follow the siren song of populism.The groundwork for a populist shift has already been laid. Rampant corruption, social stagnation and growing inequality have provided fertile soil in other Latin American nations for the rise of populist candidates \u2014 and Costa Rica is no exception.The lead-up to the election has been marked by widespread national dissatisfaction, and according to surveys, corruption is voters\u2019 main concern. After eight years in power, the National Liberation Party has become synonymous with cronyism and embezzlement.This is the reason that a Socialist congressman, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Villalta, is one of the leading candidates. His platform calls for policies similar to those disastrously implemented in Venezuela, like land distribution, punitive taxes on big corporations, price controls and the nationalization of key industries.His claim that the country\u2019s economic liberalization of the last 30 years has failed the masses resonates among a large segment of the electorate. But Mr. Villalta\u2019s policy prescriptions are based on a wrong diagnosis of Costa Rica\u2019s economic model.After an acute crisis from 1980 to 1982 swelled the poverty rate to 54 percent, Costa Rica put in place reforms to move the economy toward an export-oriented model. The country set exchange rates to provide more certainty to exporters and established free-trade zones and entered into free-trade agreements with the United States, the European Union and China, among others. It also privatized inefficient state-owned enterprises and opened certain industries to competition.These reforms brought significant growth. Since 1987, Costa Rica has been growing an average of 4.7 percent a year, one of the fastest rates in Latin America.But since 1994, poverty has remained stagnant and income inequality is on the rise. In fact, Costa Rica is one of only three Latin American countries where inequality has risen since 2000.And this has happened despite the fact that Costa Rica has one of Latin America\u2019s highest social expenditures: The government has 44 anti-poverty programs, plus large entitlement programs like social security and state-provided health insurance.So why has Costa Rica been unable to lower its poverty rate despite healthy growth rates? Because its economic model is still in significant ways based on a mercantilist system that is biased toward certain favored sectors of the economy (exports, tourism) at the expense of the poor.Take, for example, monetary policy. Over the last 30 years the Costa Rican central bank has actively intervened in the foreign exchange market to boost the export-related sectors of the economy, even though doing so has driven inflation as high as 14 percent in 2005, the highest rate in the last 10 years.Trade policy is another problem. While Costa Rica opened up to imports in the early 1990s by cutting tariffs on many consumer goods, it maintains high tariffs on a number of key farm goods like milk, rice and chicken, which drives up prices.And yet these are precisely the products most consumed by the poor. A 2002 study by Costa Rica\u2019s Incae Business School found that agricultural protectionism constituted a 17.5 percent income burden on the poorest 20 percent of the population. In 2013, the cost of a basic basket of food products required to meet an average person\u2019s minimum caloric intake represented 82 percent of the average per capita income of the poorest Costa Ricans.Many Costa Ricans mistakenly believe that economic liberalization is to blame for the country\u2019s social woes. In reality, the current economic model is designed to benefit powerful sectors of the economy at the expense of the overall population, particularly the poor. What Costa Rica needs are genuine market reforms that eliminate the government\u2019s power to pick winners and losers. Let\u2019s hope the voters can see past the empty promises of populism next week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Borrowing Crisis Tactics to Aid Uninsured in Texas", "Date": "2014-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTexas TribuneHOUSTON \u2014 In an effort to coordinate education and outreach efforts associated with the Affordable Care Act, the Houston Department of Health and Human Services is taking an approach that mirrors how the Federal Emergency Management Agency might react to a catastrophe.\u201cThe number of uninsured people that we have here in Harris County, 1.1 million \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s a public health emergency,\u201d said Ben Hernandez, the deputy assistant director for the Houston health department. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s easy for us to say let\u2019s treat it like we\u2019d treat a hurricane.\u201dStill, government officials and community-based organizations are working together to incorporate new rules, maximize their resources, and educate uninsured Texans on how to take advantage of the federal law.\u201cI need health care right now, so I\u2019m anxious to get in there and see how that\u2019s going to work for me,\u201d said Lisa Guerrero, a part-time clerk in Bexar County\u2019s constable office, who visited BiblioTech recently for assistance.Ms. Guerrero has been uninsured for nine years. During that time, she relied on community-health clinics that offered sliding-scale prices for low-income residents.Low-income families like hers often struggle to navigate the health system, because the wait times for appointments at clinics with a specialist can range from four to six months, and scheduling follow-up appointments with the same doctor can be nearly impossible. Ms. Guerrero said she shared diabetes and blood pressure medication with her father, because appointments were too costly.In addition, more than one million adults \u2014 17 percent of the state\u2019s uninsured population \u2014 fall into a coverage gap, according to Kaiser, because the state declined to expand Medicaid to include adults below the federal poverty threshold. So far, only 118,532 Texans have selected a health plan on the federal marketplace.Gov. Rick Perry has said expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid program would cause taxes to \u201cskyrocket\u201d and crush the economy \u201cunder the weight of oppressive Medicaid costs.\u201dThe insurance department issued the regulations Tuesday, requiring federal navigators to undergo background checks and receive an additional 20 hours of state-specific training. Navigators must register with the insurance department by March 1, and complete the additional training by May 1, the end of the six-month enrollment period for the federal marketplace.The federal Department of Health and Human Services awarded $11 million to organizations in Texas to hire and train navigators, who are required to have 20 to 30 hours of training under federal law.The United Way of Tarrant County received the largest grant, $5.8 million, and has distributed the money to 17 organizations around the state. There are 165 navigators in that consortium, including 13 hired by the city of Houston. To expand its efforts, the Houston health department has trained 90 city employees to become navigators and expanded their job responsibilities, Mr. Hernandez said.The Houston health department is also working with government officials and community-based organizations in Dallas, El Paso, Austin and the Rio Grande Valley to extend Enroll Gulf Coast\u2019s strategy across the state, Mr. Hernandez said.Tim McKinney, the chief executive of United Way of Tarrant County, said navigators within the agency\u2019s consortium had conducted 10,000 one-on-one information sessions with Texans, and enrolled 914 people in health plans, as of Dec. 31.\u201cThe primary mission of a navigator \u2014 it\u2019s really not to enroll, it\u2019s to educate and inform,\u201d Mr. McKinney said.Democrats and some health care advocates are critical of the new state rules, saying they are intended to obstruct navigators by adding additional costs and training requirements during the final weeks of the six-month enrollment period.\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to say that it\u2019s not a politically motivated stunt,\u201d said Tiffany Hogue, the statewide campaign coordinator for Texas Organizing Project, a political advocacy group for low-income Texans that is working with government officials in Dallas, San Antonio and the Rio Grande Valley to educate Texans on the their insurance options.The insurance department has said that \u201cunrelated political considerations would be an inappropriate basis for the rules,\u201d and that its intent was to broaden the pool of qualified navigators.baaronson@texastribune.org This story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.

{"Headline": "Yellen Wins Backing of Senators to Lead Fed", "Date": "2014-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate confirmed Janet L. Yellen as the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve on Monday, marking the first time that a woman will lead the country\u2019s central bank in its 100-year history.As a Fed official, Ms. Yellen, 67, has been an influential proponent of the Fed\u2019s extraordinary measures to revive the economy, even though interest rates are already close to zero. But as chairwoman, Ms. Yellen will face the arduous task of overseeing the gradual unwinding of those measures, despite an uncomfortably high unemployment rate of 7 percent and subdued inflation.During the confirmation process, senators from both sides of the aisle criticized the Fed for not doing enough to aid the economy and help middle-class Americans, and for trying to do too much, thus distorting the markets and risking new bubbles.\u201cI fear that they are already in way too deep,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, on the Senate floor, before the confirmation vote. Mr. Grassley questioned how the Fed would pull back on its recent campaign of large-scale asset purchases \u201cwithout spooking investors,\u201d and whether that might stoke inflation.Despite those objections, Ms. Yellen won confirmation easily. Ms. Yellen was approved 56 to 26, with many senators kept away from the Capitol by inclement weather. Nearly a dozen Republicans \u2014 including Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma \u2014 crossed the aisle in support of Ms. Yellen. She will be the first Democratic nominee to run the Fed since President Jimmy Carter named Paul Volcker as chairman in 1979.Still, Ms. Yellen\u2019s was the thinnest margin of Senate approval for a Fed chairman in the central bank\u2019s history. Ben S. Bernanke, the most recent chairman, was confirmed for a second term with 70 yes votes and 30 no votes in 2010.As a woman, Ms. Yellen will be a rarity among the world\u2019s central bankers, a club dominated by men. \u201cPractically one hundred years to the day from when the Federal Reserve was created, the central bank finally has its first woman president,\u201d said Terry O\u2019Neill, president of the National Organization for Women. \u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201dMs. Yellen has been a powerful force in the Fed during the deep recession and sluggish recovery. She has argued for the central bank to provide more clarity to market participants and supported its campaign to soak up trillions of dollars of Treasury and mortgage-backed debt in order to bring down interest rates and spur investors to start spending.She has also publicly expressed concern over the problems in the American labor market. In particular, she has focused on the persistent high rate of long-term joblessness \u2014 which might scar the unemployed even after they find a job, depressing their earnings and even their children\u2019s earnings down the road.Her views have prompted speculation among market participants that Ms. Yellen \u2014 long considered a contender for the top position at the Fed \u2014 might be a stronger proponent for the Fed\u2019s extraordinary policies than Mr. Bernanke.But their views have not differed all that much. In December, Ms. Yellen joined Mr. Bernanke in supporting the Fed\u2019s decision to start tapering its purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed debt to a pace of $75 billion a month from $85 billion a month. The decision came as new data showed stronger economic growth and a significant drop in the unemployment rate, to 7 percent in November from 7.8 percent a year before. The strategic shift will likely dominate the early part of Ms. Yellen\u2019s tenure, which is expected to start on Feb. 1. Fed watchers have warned that withdrawing support from the economy comes with significant risks. Pull back too soon and the economy could face subpar growth; Wait too long and the markets could overheat.\u201cThe Fed could taper purchases now and then ramp them back up should economic results fall short,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut reversing course like that would be a difficult maneuver to execute and communicate.\u201dThere are already signs that the Fed\u2019s decision to ease up on stimulus has affected lending activity. Interest rates on 30-year mortgages jumped after Mr. Bernanke indicated that the Fed might start to reduce its asset purchases last year, although rates remain low by historical standards.In her confirmation testimony, Ms. Yellen stressed that the Fed\u2019s extraordinary measures were bolstering growth, even if the pace of the economy\u2019s expansion had been frustratingly sluggish at times. She also said that the Fed\u2019s policies had helped not only Wall Street, but Main Street.The bank\u2019s stimulus campaign has \u201cmade a meaningful contribution to economic growth,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cThe ripple effects go through the economy and bring benefits to, I would say, all Americans.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Speaks of Better Days for Economy, With Asterisk", "Date": "2014-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 Only moments after the Senate advanced an emergency extension of unemployment insurance benefits on Tuesday, President Obama stood on an East Room stage full of people without jobs and defied the traditional logic of White House strategy that normally emphasizes good news over bad. The president, who sought to dramatize the need for Congress to extend the benefits, delivered what amounts to his broader economic message for 2014: Despite an improving economy, too many people are being left behind. The tableau demonstrated the challenge for Mr. Obama as he seeks to advertise the financial recovery while arguing for action to help a still-besieged middle class.\u201cOur businesses have created more than eight million new jobs since we hit bottom,\u201d Mr. Obama said while somber-looking unemployed Americans, invited to the event by the White House, served as his backdrop. \u201cAmerica\u2019s getting stronger and we\u2019ve made progress.\u201d But the president quickly added that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to do more to make sure that all Americans share in that growth\u201d and warned that \u201cthere are still a lot of people who are struggling.\u201dA short time before Mr. Obama spoke, the Senate voted to move forward on the extension of the unemployment benefits, winning the votes of six Republicans to overcome a filibuster by a vote of 60-37. The bill still faces debate, negotiation and another vote in the Senate before possibly moving on to the House. In opposing the unemployment legislation, some Republican lawmakers found themselves arguing against their own political story line that Mr. Obama\u2019s economy was still anemic. Instead, they said that the nation\u2019s financial straits had improved to the point that an emergency extension of the benefits was no longer justified.In 2008, Senator John McCain of Arizona, then the Republican presidential nominee, tripped over a similar rhetorical challenge when he said at a rally that \u201cthe fundamentals of our economy are strong\u201d but added immediately that \u201cthese are very, very difficult times.\u201dMr. Obama, then Mr. McCain\u2019s opponent, seized on the phrase that the American economy was fundamentally strong and rode it to the White House.Now it is the president who must find a way to navigate a complex economy. White House officials say that Mr. Obama intends to focus this year on trying to narrow the gap between the rich \u2014 who have profited from rising incomes, increasing home values and a 30 percent gain in the stock market \u2014 and everyone else.To do that, Mr. Obama plans to campaign in 2014 for universal preschool, an increase in the minimum wage and an administration effort to make college less expensive for the middle class.That approach, which White House officials have foreshadowed for weeks, is rooted in statistics that are at best mixed for Mr. Obama. He is presiding over an economy that has improved sharply in the five years since 2009, when it was buckling under the weight of a severe recession, but decades-long shifts in technology and globalization have left more people out of work for extended periods than at any other time in the past 50 years.Like Mr. Obama, President Ronald Reagan also ended his fifth year with unemployment at 7 percent after a devastating recession. But Mr. Reagan was sunnier in public as the country\u2019s financial fortunes turned around, and ran for re-election in 1984 with an advertising campaign that declared \u201cIt\u2019s morning again in America\u201d for a country weary of economic distress. Mr. Obama has chosen to be more restrained in his enthusiasm.\u201cThere is a reality in politics, as in life, that you have to play the hand you are dealt,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a veteran Democratic pollster. \u201cThe question comes down to whether you think Americans have a capacity for nuance. President Obama has always operated on the presumption that they do, and that is the approach he is taking now in talking about the economy.\u201dWith congressional elections on the horizon and his legacy at stake, Mr. Obama does at times peddle economic good news like any other president, as he did at a news conference last month when he said, \u201cI firmly believe that 2014 can be a breakthrough year for America.\u201d He repeated that line on Tuesday.But to make the case for his agenda and to convince skeptical Republicans in Congress, Mr. Obama is also emphasizing how the recovery has fallen short. In a speech in December that aides described as a preview of the president\u2019s State of the Union address later this month, Mr. Obama spoke in depth about the economic problems he still confronts.\u201cThe basic bargain at the heart of our economy has frayed,\u201d Mr. Obama said.The president\u2019s language is to some degree the latest version of what critics call the muddled economic message the White House has been delivering for years. In 2009 and 2010, Mr. Obama and his top economic advisers regularly pointed to minor improvements in the economy even as they acknowledged the suffering that many felt. Now that the economic recovery is moving more quickly, the administration remains cautious about declaring victory.\u201cWe could be an administration that just comes in here and tells you nothing but the good news that\u2019s happened, or the improvement,\u201d Gene Sperling, the president\u2019s top economic adviser, said Monday. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what we\u2019re about.\u201dDavid Axelrod, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s senior adviser at the beginning of his first term, said the president had always had to confront what he called a \u201cduality\u201d in the economy.\u201cThe economy is indisputably much better than it was a few years ago and far better than it was when he took office,\u201d Mr. Axelrod said. \u201cBut there are structural ramifications that have created this long-term unemployment.\u201dMr. Axelrod said it would be wrong for Mr. Obama to try to ignore the economic struggles of so many people.\u201cI think to pretend that \u2018It\u2019s morning in America\u2019 is a misreading of the times in which we live,\u201d he added. \u201cThe great challenge for us is how do we build an economy for the future that allows for people who work hard to move up. He should not run away from that issue. He should own it.\u201dStuart Stevens, who was the chief strategist for Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign in 2012, said that Mr. Obama was trying to have it both ways by embracing the economy\u2019s improvement even as he focused on people who were not doing well.\u201cThe message seems to be,\u201d Mr. Stevens said, \u201cthe economy is great \u2014 send emergency relief!\u201dAdvertisement"}

But this doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t care about it; it\u2019s just that the French are more concerned about other statistics: the unemployment rate which, at 10.9 percent, is twice as high as Germany\u2019s, or the government\u2019s abysmal approval ratings, stuck below 30 percent. Never before has a French president been so unpopular so early in his first term. Trust in political institutions is at an all-time low, and pessimism rules: 72 percent of the French fear their children will be worse off. Which makes the lightness of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande even more puzzling. The president who, as a candidate, promised that his behavior would be \u201cexemplary\u201d \u2014 unlike that of his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy \u2014 in fact never intended his behavior to be perfect. In Mr. Hollande\u2019s mind, we now know, \u201cexemplary\u201d meant discreet; he merely assumed that he could resume the old tradition of President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s secret double life. He just forgot that in the age of Twitter and WikiLeaks, secrets can\u2019t be kept for 20 years, let alone 20 months. Perplexed by their president\u2019s economic indecisiveness since he took office, the French now learn that he is equally indecisive in his private life. And they have found out at the worst moment. After hesitating to address squarely the issue of radical economic reforms, after avoiding to cut public spending to reduce the fiscal deficit, after procrastinating on measures needed to restore the competitiveness of French companies, the president, having lost 20 months, finally decided that it was time to do all of the above. This was the message he started to deliver to the nation in his traditional New Year\u2019s Eve address. Desperately aware of the sorry state of the economy \u2014 which, to be fair, this government inherited from the Sarkozy administration \u2014 the voters seemed to approve. One poll showed that three-quarters of the electorate was ready to go along with the proposal to cut taxes for companies if that would create more jobs.The details of this major economic initiative were slated to be presented by the president at a press conference last Tuesday. Four days earlier, Closer struck. So what would Mr. Hollande do? At a packed press conference in the Salle des F\u00eates at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, he switched from \u201cMr. Normal\u201d to \u201cMr. Solemn,\u201d acknowledged \u201cpainful\u201d moments in his private life but managed to elude six mild questions about it, and focused firmly on his plans for an economic turnaround. Which is not really a turnaround, we are told, but rather an \u201cacceleration.\u201d This president is not for turning; he does zigzags better.Who is Fran\u00e7ois Hollande? In a book out just last week in France aptly entitled \u201cJusqu\u2019ici tout va mal\u201d (\u201cSo far, so bad\u201d), the political reporter C\u00e9cile Amar, who has covered Mr. Hollande for 10 years, points out that his son Thomas describes his father as \u201celusive.\u201d She also quotes a revealing answer the president made in May 2013, when asked whether he was a social-democratic reformer, as opposed to a classic socialist: \u201cYou are asking me to say who I am. This is a tough question!\u201d At last week\u2019s press conference, he finally came out, proclaiming, \u201cI am a social democrat.\u201dIn one area, though, Mr. Hollande has shown decisiveness. Last year he chose to send troops to Mali when radical Islamists threatened to take over the capital, Bamako. And in December he again decided to intervene, under a United Nations mandate, to halt massacres in the Central African Republic. People who have known Fran\u00e7ois Hollande for a long time are amazed by his self-confidence and resilience. He is a man, they say, who even when in deep trouble always thinks that there is a way out. It is quite possible that he will again find a way out of this very public private crisis. There is no doubt that his image and personal credibility have suffered, but so far reactions to his press conference show that people have chosen not to be distracted from the work to be done on the economy. I was Le Monde\u2019s correspondent in the United States during the Monica Lewinsky affair. It was a fantastic political story that kept us busy for a year. French readers loved it, as everywhere else. That year, in 1998, a little-known terrorist organization, Al Qaeda, headed by a little-known ex-mujahedeen, Osama bin Laden, attacked two United States embassies in Africa, but all eyes were turned on Washington\u2019s sordid battle. Don\u2019t blame the French for giving economic reforms priority over their politicians\u2019 pathetic private travails.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Fund Investors, the Dangers of Rarefied Air", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE stock market ended 2013 at record highs and with indicators of investor optimism near best-ever levels. The enthusiasm is understandable after a year that was the strongest for stocks in well over a decade \u2014 but whether it is wise is another matter.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 29.6 percent, to 1,848.36, capped by an especially strong fourth-quarter gain of 9.9 percent. The full-year increase was the biggest since 1997, and stock fund managers made the most of the fertile environment, achieving their best results since 1991.It was a difficult quarter for the bond market. A sharp rise in 10-year Treasury yields last year, to 3.03 percent from 1.76 percent, sent prices lower on longer-dated issues, although instruments of lower quality and with shorter maturities fared better.Treasury issues were subdued for much of the year by the threat \u2014 and then the fact \u2014 that the Federal Reserve would start to wind down quantitative easing, its purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage securities. The Fed announced in December that it intended to reduce purchases by $10 billion a month from a starting rate of $85 billion if suitable economic progress continued.Quantitative easing gave investors a reason to buy stocks all year, and the Fed\u2019s plan for a slow reduction of the program, with its promise to keep interest rates low for a long time, gave them a reason to keep buying. Although the impending announcement had been a source of dread, the market had one of its best sessions all year when it occurred on Dec. 18, and the ebullient mood lingered until year-end.An increase in profits was tepid and similarly suspect. The research service FactSet estimates that net earnings for S.&P. 500 companies increased 6.3 percent last year, barely one-fifth of the index\u2019s gain, and much of the profit growth was attributable to the very low interest expense engineered by the Fed.THAT so-so backdrop didn\u2019t hinder the desire to own stocks. But with prices seeming to outrun reality, some strategists and portfolio managers have urged investors to rein in their enthusiasm. The new year may be far less profitable than 2013, they warn, for three reasons: the reduction in Fed bond-buying makes higher interest rates more likely; earnings growth is likely to remain sluggish; and the market\u2019s spectacular run, amid those smaller earnings gains, has left stocks expensive. Now that the Fed has made its intentions clear, investors may focus more on fundamentals, and they may not like what they see. That figure comprises real gross domestic product \u2014 what the Bureau of Economic Analysis reports \u2014 and the inflation rate. Neither has been expanding all that fast consistently, Mr. Clemons noted. Beyond the economic backdrop, he says he believes that companies\u2019 ability to bolster profits without significantly increasing sales, through cost-cutting and very low interest rates, has run its course.That inauspicious combination led him to forecast profit growth at a mid-single-digit rate this year. He has continued to look for value, he said, but with stocks starting 2014 trading at roughly 18 times earnings, \u201cit\u2019s harder to find.\u201dIf there are precious few cheap stocks in this market, how about in others? Funds that specialize in foreign stocks gained 5 percent, on average, in the fourth quarter and 15.9 percent for the full year \u2014 strong by the standards of most years but barely half as great as domestic funds\u2019 performance. Europe was the best overseas region, with portfolios there rising by an average of 28.9 percent in 2013; funds invested in emerging markets were noticeably weak, up just 0.7 percent. It took Europe longer to start working its way out of the 2008-9 financial crisis than the United States, so European companies and stocks are widely seen as being in an earlier stage of recovery. Although raw economic numbers look worse in Europe, the improvement from the depths of the crisis is heartening investors.Even amid lackluster growth, corporate profits in Europe could improve substantially, he predicted, because they are coming off a low base. \u201cEuropean earnings are significantly below their peak\u201d of the mid-2000s, Mr. Webber said, \u201cand the U.S. is back to its previous peak, so there\u2019s scope for significant recovery, which I expect to come through in the next 12 months.\u201dHe still counsels selectivity, with an emphasis on industries like banking, insurance and staffing. As for countries, he prefers some with strong economies, such as Germany, but also those that may be bouncing back. Spain, for instance, \u201chas made big gains in competitiveness and has the bones of an export-led recovery,\u201d he said.Mr. Webber also encourages careful choices in China. He suggests that investors concentrate on segments of the economy that stand to benefit from an emphasis on an improving quality of life, a mix that includes retailers and businesses that help bring efficient and cleaner energy use.SELECTIVITY by bond investors last year did little good, unless investors selected high-yield or junk bonds. Those junk-bond funds, on average, rose 7.2 percent for the year, aided by a gain of 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter.\u201cIt would be better for the bond market for the Fed to write a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of checks a year than not,\u201d Mr. Gross said. With the checks set to be smaller, \u201cit\u2019s just a question of where to seek shelter.\u201dHe said he expected the Fed to keep its target for the federal funds rate, at which banks make overnight loans to one another, at 0.25 percent for at least two more years. That would lead him to stick to instruments toward the shorter end of the yield curve, coming due in two to four years.Modest economic growth \u201copens the door for credit, but not necessarily junk bonds,\u201d he added. That would encompass corporate issues of moderate to high creditworthiness. He also recommends some foreign bonds, particularly from Mexico, and closed-end municipal bond funds trading at large discounts to their intrinsic asset values. Muni mutual funds had a poor 2013, losing 3.4 percent, on average.When it comes to bonds, Mr. Clemons at Brown Brothers Harriman prefers even shorter maturities than Mr. Gross, eight months or less. As for stocks, Mr. Clemons likes stable, financially strong sectors like consumer staples as well as beaten-down niches like emerging markets. Such exceptions aside, he and his colleagues have been selling into the rally, and he advises extreme caution.\u201cI don\u2019t know if a bear market is on the way,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I know that the combination of low earnings growth, high margins, high valuations and investor complacency gives you no margin for safety.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House G.O.P. Trims Agenda, Looking to Avert Election-Year Trouble", "Date": "2014-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The \u201cdo nothing\u201d Congress is preparing to do even less.In 2013, the House was in session 118 days before November and 135 in all.House leaders are warning rank-and-file Republicans that the passage in December of the first comprehensive budget in years is unlikely to herald a return to even the once-routine task of passing all 12 of the spending bills that Congress is supposed to approve each year. And in a noted departure from previous end-of-session breaks, Republican leaders held no conference calls or large meetings in the long hiatus between adjourning on Dec. 13 and preparing to return on Tuesday. \u201cThings are slow for sure,\u201d said one House Republican close to the party leadership.Expectations for the session are so low that lawmakers say early action on White House priorities like raising the minimum wage, restoring unemployment benefits that expired and overhauling immigration laws are likely to go nowhere. Instead, Congress is likely to focus on more prosaic tasks: finishing negotiations on a farm bill that has languished for two years, agreeing on a law authorizing water projects, passing a spending bill for the current fiscal year and raising the debt ceiling by March. Only then might lawmakers move on to modest, piecemeal immigration measures.The chances are \u201crelatively low in terms of the probability that truly substantive legislation will be advanced through the House,\u201d said Representative Scott Rigell, Republican of Virginia and a critic of Congress\u2019s work pace.That is a stark departure from the last three years, each of which dawned with high expectations from Republicans for balancing the federal budget, shrinking government sharply and repealing President Obama\u2019s health care law. In a memo to House Republicans on Friday that was decidedly modest on legislative intent, Mr. Cantor promised \u201cto exercise our constitutional duty of oversight of Obamacare\u201d and to schedule a vote on a bill requiring \u201cprompt notification\u201d in the event of a data breach on the federal HealthCare.gov website. Under the \u201cappropriations\u201d heading, he wrote, \u201cThis spring, we can expect a robust season of oversight and continued emphasis on spending reforms.\u201d\u201cBig thinking has more often gotten us into trouble then led us to success,\u201d Mr. Cole said.Addressing those issues without a major breakdown could create enough good will for lawmakers to at least begin consideration of more ambitious endeavors.\u201cIf these things don\u2019t go well, other things don\u2019t happen, simple as that,\u201d Mr. Cole said.By playing it safe, House leaders hope to keep their rank and file from leading Congress into a conflagration like the 16-day government shutdown in October. Republican political prospects have roared back since then on a wave of anger at the troubled rollout of the federal insurance exchange website under the Affordable Care Act, and Republican leaders are loath to jeopardize that momentum.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear to me in the House, we don\u2019t want to make ourselves the issue,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania. \u201cWhat happened in the fall with the shutdown, that was an act of political malpractice. We will be very careful not to make those kinds of unforced errors again.\u201dBut Democrats insist they will not let doing nothing be an option. On Monday, the Senate Democratic leadership has scheduled the first legislative vote of the year, to cut off a threatened filibuster on restoring unemployment benefits that ended last month for 1.3 million Americans. On Tuesday, Mr. Obama will meet with some of the long-term unemployed now cut off from the federal lifeline.A push to raise the minimum wage will follow the unemployment showdown. And Democrats are working aggressively to neutralize the political costs of the president\u2019s health care law \u2014 or even to turn it into an asset by publicizing the millions of Americans now insured through it.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let them get away with that,\u201d Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said of the \u201cdo-nothing\u201d strategy. \u201cOne of the reasons the economy isn\u2019t as strong as it should be is the Republicans\u2019 avowed economic theory is to do nothing, and we intend to make that a central theme for 2014.\u201dMr. Dent said he might consider both of those measures but only if they were tied to priorities that Republicans say would create jobs, such as building the Keystone XL oil pipeline, repealing the health care law\u2019s tax on medical devices or changing the law\u2019s definition of a part-time worker.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quick Work on Paid Sick Leave", "Date": "2014-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe existing law, set to take effect in April, requires companies with 20 or more workers to provide at least five paid sick days a year, eventually lowering the threshold to 15 workers. The new bill applies to companies with five or more workers, protecting an estimated 360,000 more people than the existing law. It eliminates the current law\u2019s 18-month phase-in period and a trigger to delay implementation if the economy lags. Mr. de Blasio and Ms. Mark-Viverito unveiled the bill with a rally in Brooklyn, emphatically sending the message that the city\u2019s political center of gravity has shifted toward working families and the poor. A more cautious mayor might have been content to let the existing law take effect in April, wait to see how enforcement and compliance worked out and consult with the Council and business community on improving it. But the impatience of Mr. de Blasio and his allies is understandable after more than a decade of Republican mayors and sometimes tooth-and-nail battles over sensible laws like paid sick leave. Mayor de Blasio, who essentially installed Ms. Mark-Viverito as his partner in progressivism, shares with her a mission to pursue an unabashedly liberal agenda in areas like jobs, health care and housing. It\u2019s clearly in his interest to show that the change he promised is on its way. Helping workers, especially single parents, to avoid that awful choice \u2014 dragging themselves to a job from a sickbed or losing a day\u2019s pay \u2014 is not just a potent symbolic gesture, but also good policy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Security Upstarts Enter Fray", "Date": "2014-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Steve Bennett, the chief executive of the computer security company Symantec, is spoiling for a fight.Symantec is still, by a pretty long stretch, the biggest in a growing pack of tech security companies. But like Microsoft, Mr. Bennett\u2019s company is sometimes viewed as an aging, if still wealthy, outfit that can\u2019t keep up with a new generation. And no one in the technology industry likes being labeled the old, slow rich guy.The pitch from the new companies is simple: Conventional security defenses \u2014 like those that the antivirus software of Symantec and McAfee built their brands upon, as well as the network firewalls of Check Point and Cisco \u2014 have proved vulnerable to determined adversaries. The biggest problem with that older technology, they say, is that it reacts to threats rather than anticipating them.FireEye is run by Dave DeWalt, who used to be McAfee\u2019s chief executive.\u201cAntivirus products are not working right now,\u201d Mr. DeWalt said in a recent interview. \u201cCompanies are spending tens of billions of dollars of their money on a model that doesn\u2019t work.\u201dThis fight between new and old has led to an unusually fragmented market, with 50 or so competitive companies, said Lawrence Pingree, a security analyst at Gartner. In 2012, Symantec led the security software market, with 19.6 percent of it, followed by McAfee\u2019s 8.8 percent, according to Gartner. Once the final numbers are tallied for 2013, Mr. Pingree said, he expects the incumbents will have ceded ground to the upstarts.The problem with traditional antivirus technology is that security researchers, like medical researchers, must study a virus before they can create the antidote. They have to capture a computer virus, dissect it and identify its signature \u2014 unique signs in its code \u2014 before they can write a program to block it.That process can take as little as a few minutes or as long as several years. Once a virus gets blocked, it is often left to the customer to run frequent software updates. And even then, it takes just a few tweaks to the code for criminals to outwit the system.\u201cWe believe the antivirus market is hopelessly behind in being able to address the most acute problems,\u201d said Nir Zuk, the founder and chief technology officer at Palo Alto Networks. \u201cThat is not where the action is and that is not where the majority of the money is going to be.\u201d\u201cWe take a satellite view of the Internet,\u201d said David Ulevitch, OpenDNS\u2019s founder. \u201cWe don\u2019t wait for the shots to get fired, then analyze the bullet.\u201dEven among the antivirus makers themselves, \u201cantivirus\u201d has become something of a dirty word. Symantec and McAfee are aggressively rebranding and investing in new sorts of technology. Notably, \u201cantivirus\u201d does not appear once on either company\u2019s home page.\u201cEverybody still talks about us as antivirus,\u201d said Mr. Bennett, the Symantec chief. \u201cWe have more advanced threat protection in our portfolio than anybody else.\u201dHe said the key to Symantec\u2019s plans was integrating all the little pieces, from antivirus software to systems that monitor incoming Internet traffic, into one big package that can be more easily installed and controlled. In fact, he said, 50 percent of the threats Symantec blocked last year were not blocked by antivirus, but by the company\u2019s newer security protections.\u201cThe reality is that no one security technology is good enough,\u201d said Mr. Pingree, the Gartner analyst. \u201cHackers are always working to defeat the latest defense, and so you have to invest in defenses for the latest threat as well as every threat experienced in the past.\u201dLast week, Intel, which acquired McAfee in 2011, announced it was killing off the McAfee brand altogether, keeping only the company\u2019s red shield logo intact. McAfee will now be known as Intel Security.\u201cAntivirus is not what we\u2019re focused on,\u201d Michael Fey, McAfee\u2019s chief technology officer, said in an interview this week. \u201cIt\u2019s fun for younger companies to point fingers, but that\u2019s not even where we get the bulk of our revenue.\u201dMcAfee now makes more revenue selling newer network security and intrusion-prevention systems to its business customers, Mr. Fey said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of our antivirus \u2014 it is a valuable solution that catches hundreds of thousands of issues a day for companies \u2014 but under no circumstances do we think that is the future of security.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re running a marathon, not a sprint,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re at the end of the finish line, sometime in the future, we\u2019re going to be there and we\u2019re going to be smiling. And we\u2019ll see where all these shiny-new-object companies are.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about competition in the computer security market misstated the job title of Nir Zuk of Palo Alto Networks, a computer security company. He is founder and chief technology officer \u2014 not chief executive, a title that is held by Mark D. McLaughlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "1; 5,000; 500,000", "Date": "2014-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIF you\u2019re confused about all the turmoil in the Arab world and asking how the United States should respond, I find it useful to consider three questions: 1) Why is it that the Arab awakening country where the U.S. has had the least involvement, Tunisia, is where the most progress is being made toward building a consensual democracy? 2) Why are the three most important numbers to keep in mind when thinking about the Arab world today 1, 5,000 and 500,000? 3) Why does Egypt\u2019s strongman, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, have so many medals on his chest when he\u2019s too young to have fought in any of Egypt\u2019s big wars, and why might that be a worrying sign?Answer: The main religious and secular forces in Tunisia, after coming close to civil war, finally agreed to the sine qua non for the success of any Arab democracy movement \u2014 \u201cNo victor, no vanquished.\u201d Whether you\u2019re talking Shiites, Sunnis, Alawites, Kurds, tribes, Islamists or secular generals, in these pluralistic Arab states, unless all the key parties accept the principle that power will be shared and rotated, there is no chance any of these awakenings will make a stable transition from autocracy to more consensual politics.But Tunisians had another advantage, says Craig Charney, a veteran pollster in South Africa and the Middle East. Tunisia \u201calready had strong civil society institutions\u201d \u2014 like the General Labor Union, the National Business Federation, the Tunisian Bar Association and the Tunisian Human Rights League. These institutions, explained Charney, \u201cwere able to play a nonpartisan moderating role between the different political factions.\u201d And, unlike Egypt, Tunisia also did not have a politicized military with deep roots in the economy that had incentives to meddle in the political arena. Syria, Libya and Iraq had no real civil society institutions at all.And that leads to those numbers. When people in a country are ready to live together, you just need one Nelson Mandela \u2014 a unifying leader \u2014 to galvanize the political system to work productively. When people are not ready to live together but are ready to live apart \u2014 as in Bosnia or Lebanon after years of civil war \u2014 you just need 5,000 peacekeepers to police the de facto or de jure lines of partition. But when people are not ready to live together or apart \u2014 because of a lack of trust, lack of exhaustion or one or all parties still think they can have it all \u2014 then you probably need 500,000 peacekeepers to come in, remove the dictator, eliminate the most extreme elements on all sides, and protect the center for a long time while it forges a new citizenship and party system able to share power. Even then, failure is a real option.In short, what ails the Arab world is something we alone can\u2019t fix: an inability to manage pluralism in a democratic way. We can stop the worst of it as long as we are there (see: Iraq). But only they can make the best of it \u2014 and make it self-sustaining. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria is a monster. But he can only be removed in a way that won\u2019t bring more chaos if the Syrian opposition can demonstrate on the ground that it not only believes in pluralism, but has the will and ability to enforce it. Otherwise, the Syrian minorities gathered around Assad will not abandon him. Everyone urging President Obama to intervene in Syria needs to keep all this in mind.As for Egypt, I had no sympathy for the Muslim Brotherhood leaders. I wish they had been voted out office, but I understood why so many Egyptians wanted the army to get rid of them. Yet, when the army also decided to arrest decent, nonviolent, civil society youth leaders \u2014 like Ahmed Maher \u2014 for simply protesting, and eliminated the Muslim Brotherhood from Egyptian political life, not even allowing the Brotherhood to play by new restrictive rules, it felt like a return to the old model of relying on a military strongman and producing stability through suppression, not inclusion.Advertisement"}

PrimeFlight says on its website that its holding company made $330 million in revenue last year.PrimeFlight did not return a call seeking comment. Officials at United Airlines, which like all the other major airlines hires these companies, returned my call, to say they couldn\u2019t really say anything about anything.\u201cOur role at United is to make sure that vendors follow all applicable laws,\u201d a spokeswoman, Meghan McCarthy, said. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to their cost structure and works rules. I won\u2019t do that.\u201dI noted that vendors say the major airlines set the cost structure. If a union successfully organizes one company, the airlines switch to a nonunion contractor.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change my response,\u201d she said.Workers speak of renting not apartments but rooms. Mr. Echeverri rents a tiny room in a two-bedroom apartment he shares with other men.Mr. Echeverri and his wife divorced but remain close. In December, he told me she had cancer. \u201cShe loses her hair. I can\u2019t \u2014\u201d He fell silent. His ears turned red, and he rubbed at his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t help her.\u201dI called him again Wednesday. Her cancer has spread to her liver. She is returning to Colombia to take traditional medicine.\u201cPlease God, pray,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not an easy life.\u201dThe Gotham column on Thursday, about the declining earning power of airport workers, misidentified a worker who cleans planes on the overnight shift at Newark Airport. She is Gertrudes Contreras \u2014 not Yolanda Santoni, who interpreted for her.The Gotham column on Jan. 16, about the working conditions faced by airport contractors\u2019 employees, misstated the name of one such contractor. It is Airway L.L.C., not Airways.

{"Headline": "Help the Working Poor, but Share the Burden", "Date": "2014-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewAs a result, those who are worried about inequality look for more immediate ways to help workers with limited skills. Before turning to President Obama\u2019s proposal, let\u2019s consider two other possibilities. For lack of better terms, call them Plan A and Plan B: Stop reading for a moment and consider: Which of these plans would you prefer, and why? If you have a pen or pencil handy, jot down your reasons.O.K. \u2014 and now, here are my answers:To me, Plan A is distinctly better than Plan B, which suffers from two problems \u2014 one involving fairness, and one involving efficacy.First, fairness: If we decide as a nation that we want to augment the income of low-wage workers, it seems only right that we all share that responsibility. Plan A does that. By contrast, Plan B concentrates the cost of the wage subsidy on a small subset of businesses and their customers. There is no good reason this group has a special obligation to help those in need.Indeed, one might argue that this group is already doing more than its share. After all, it is providing jobs to the unskilled. Asking it to do even more, while letting everyone else off the hook, seems particularly churlish.But even putting fairness aside, there is reason to doubt the efficacy of Plan B. Taxing businesses that hire unskilled workers would alter their behavior in ways that would hurt those we are trying to help.To avoid the tax, businesses would have an incentive to hire fewer of these workers. For example, they would have greater incentive to replace workers with labor-saving machines. In addition, some of the tax would be passed on to customers in the form of higher prices. These customers, in turn, would have an incentive to spend more of their income elsewhere. Over time, these businesses would shrink, reducing the job opportunities for the unskilled.All in all, the Plan B tax-and-subsidy plan sounds like a pretty bad idea. Why, you might wonder, did I bring it up? Because it is the one favored by President Obama. He calls it an increase in the minimum wage.To be sure, the minimum wage isn\u2019t exactly a system of taxes and subsidies. But its effects are much the same as those of Plan B. Unskilled workers earn more, and the businesses that hire them pay more. The main difference between the minimum wage and Plan B is that, under a minimum wage, the extra compensation is paid directly from the business to the worker, rather than indirectly via the government.Because \u201ctax\u201d is a dirty word in Washington, politicians generally prefer regulations like the minimum wage to accomplish their goals. But many regulations work like hidden taxes. Sometimes, in the process of hiding taxes, lawmakers opt for more damaging alternatives.If, as a nation, we decide we want to do more to supplement the incomes of low-wage workers, that\u2019s fine. But let\u2019s do it openly, without artifice, and with broad participation.N. GREGORY MANKIW is a professor of economics at Harvard. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Roadblock to Brawny Bank Reform", "Date": "2014-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameRegulators made some real progress last year attacking the risks of too-big-to-fail banks. The Volcker Rule and other Dodd-Frank reforms were completed, and, perhaps even more important,\u00a0three big regulators devised a proposal for tougher capital rules intended to ensure that banks would never require a government bailout when their risky bets went bad.\u00a0But action on that last crucial bit of business has ground to a halt. Officials at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had hoped that the rule they proposed\u00a0last July along with\u00a0the Federal Reserve Board and the\u00a0Comptroller of the Currency would be set in stone by the end of the year. It was not.\u00a0Arguing for international agreement on regulations\u00a0is a time-honored stall tactic among industries interested\u00a0in thwarting tough rules. But why would the Fed or any bank overseer want to wait for other regulators?\u00a0Barbara Hagenbaugh, a spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve, says it supports a strong leverage ratio. But she adds that the regulator expects a global agreement soon on changes to an international leverage ratio established in 2010. \u201cThe definitional changes should not cause a decline in required capital at the largest banking firms compared with a U.S. leverage ratio proposal the agencies issued in the summer,\u201d she said.United States banking regulators would support incorporating these definitions into the pending proposal, she said, while retaining the higher leverage ratio than called for in the international agreement.But Jeremiah O. Norton, a member of the F.D.I.C.\u2019s board, says he thinks it is wrong to delay voting on the rule. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that the inertia of not acting will take over and win,\u201d he said. As it was proposed last summer, the leverage ratio would require big banks to increase the capital they have on hand to absorb losses by 2018.To compute a leverage ratio, a bank would divide its tangible common equity, a measure of a company\u2019s readily accessible capital, by its total assets. Under the proposed rule, the nation\u2019s largest federally insured banks would have to show leverage ratios of at least 6 percent, double the 3 percent required under international capital standards currently set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.Banks\u2019 parent companies would be required to have leverage ratios of 5 percent. Institutions failing to maintain these levels would face limits on discretionary bonus payments to employees as well as on dividends they distribute to shareholders.One of the ratio\u2019s primary benefits is that it is much harder to manipulate than other methods used to calculate capital requirements, like those based on risks associated with a particular type of asset. Before the credit crisis, for example, mortgage securities were considered relatively low-risk assets and didn\u2019t require large amounts of capital to be set aside in case of losses. We saw what happened with that.Another plus to the proposed ratio is that it would include large bank holdings that are currently excluded from required capital calculations. These include trillions of dollars in derivatives positions held by the banks as well as assets carried by related entities that do not show up on the institution\u2019s balance sheet. By holding capital against these positions, the risks they pose to the banks would be reduced.There is no doubt that a higher ratio would force the largest banks to hold more capital. As of the second half of 2013, the most recent figures available, leverage ratios at the eight largest United States banks averaged 4.3 percent; the ratio for the rest of the nation\u2019s banks was about double that.And yet a failure of banking behemoths would pose the greatest threat to our financial stability. Thomas M. Hoenig, vice chairman of the F.D.I.C. and a strong supporter of the proposed leverage ratio, noted in a speech last month in Dublin that the eight largest United States global banking firms hold nearly $15 trillion of assets, the equivalent of about 90 percent of our nation\u2019s gross domestic product. As such, he said, the nation\u2019s economy is more vulnerable than ever to these banks\u2019 mistakes or maneuverings.Leverage ratios at large foreign institutions are even lower. As of the second quarter of 2013, a group of the 16 largest overseas banks had an average leverage ratio of 3.86 percent. Clearly, foreign banks would have to add much more capital if they had to meet the more stringent American ratio rule.\u201cNine of the top 20 largest users of Fed emergency lending facilities in 2008 and 2009 were foreign banks, and 10 of the top 16 recipients of payouts in the A.I.G. rescue were foreign banks,\u201d Mr. Kelleher said, referring to the American International Group. \u201cThey want the U.S. on the hook again, backstopping the global system.\u201dLast week, Mr. Hoenig said he still hoped the proposed leverage ratio would be adopted by the end of February.\u201cIn 2006 and 2007 when many of these institutions had leverage ratios under 3 percent, what was the consequence?\u201d Mr. Hoenig asked. \u201cEnormous loss of wealth in the crisis, millions of people being put out of work because banks didn\u2019t have the capital necessary to absorb their losses.

{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Asian Lifeline", "Date": "2014-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisYahoo\u2019s core business has been eroding. It\u2019s lost ground in display advertising and in online search, and the Wall Street consensus is that its revenue declined last year.But no matter: Wall Street greeted the news of Mr. de Castro\u2019s dismissal with a shrug. Regardless of what Ms. Mayer does, the stock market loves Yahoo. Its shares doubled in value last year, outstripping the performance of highflying rivals like Google, AOL and Facebook. How is this feat even remotely possible?Yahoo\u2019s lofty valuation makes sense only if you put its American business aside, and think of the company as an investment in Asia. That\u2019s the way Wall Street sees it. From this perspective, most of Yahoo\u2019s value is found in Japan and, especially, in China, where it has a large stake in the Internet colossus Alibaba. As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.\u201cIn the United States, they are doing the best they can, and I think Marissa Mayer is doing a fine job, but their core business is challenged, to be polite, and it will likely remain that way for some time,\u201d said Victor Anthony, managing director for Internet media at Topeka Capital Markets. \u201cFor Yahoo, it\u2019s all about Asia.\u201dYahoo\u2019s 24 percent stake in Alibaba, which has been described as a combination of Amazon, eBay and PayPal, with a bit of Google thrown in, accounts for the bulk of the American company\u2019s value, Mr. Anthony calculates. In the United States, Yahoo trades at about $40, and he says he believes that at that price, it still has plenty of room to run. \u201cI think Yahoo\u2019s worth $50 to $52 a share,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s not because of its American operations.\u201d In his estimation, Yahoo\u2019s American core, damaged by sliding advertising revenue and diminished profit margins, is worth only $10 a share. Yahoo\u2019s stake in its Japanese counterpart, Yahoo Japan \u2014 which still beats Google in local search \u2014 is worth an additional $7 a share to the American company, Mr. Anthony said. The rest of the stock\u2019s value comes from Yahoo share buybacks, which are financed in large part from income derived from the Asian properties, he said. While numbers vary somewhat, many people on Wall Street make remarkably similar estimates. In a research report last Oct. 16, for example, JPMorgan Chase noted some improvements in Yahoo\u2019s Internet search metrics and in the revamping of categories like sports and weather on its website. Over all, the report said, \u201cthe core business remains challenged and we believe the focus for most will remain on the strength in its Asian assets.\u201dIn a similar vein, Brian Wieser, senior analyst at Pivotal Research in New York, said: \u201cIt\u2019s sad but you can pretty much forget about Yahoo\u2019s core. I\u2019m afraid it has no future. The Asian holdings, though \u2014 that\u2019s another story.\u201dLike many other people who follow Yahoo closely, Mr. Wieser says Ms. Mayer appears to be doing a perfectly fine job. \u201cShe\u2019s talented, but it\u2019s just that she\u2019s facing a secular decline in the company\u2019s core advertising business,\u201d he said. Mr. de Castro was supposed to bring new ad revenue to the company. But Mr. Wieser suggests that the failure to do so wasn\u2019t surprising. \u201cI don\u2019t care who runs the company right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be able to reverse that easily.\u201dFundamentally, he said, Yahoo is suffering from an ailment that afflicts \u201clegacy publishers\u201d of all kinds, including much older ones like newspapers and magazines. Yahoo, the dominant site of bygone days when the words \u201cweb portal\u201d were still fashionable, can no longer attract premium display advertising as easily as it could before the rise of Google and sites like Facebook. Mr. Wieser praised Ms. Mayer\u2019s acquisitions of Internet properties like Tumblr, the blogging service, and her hiring of prominent online talent like Katie Couric, the television host, and David Pogue, former tech writer at The New York Times. \u201cThat may all be helpful,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not moving the stock.\u201dMark May, a Citi Research analyst, said that while Ms. Mayer had made progress, much of Yahoo\u2019s stock market strength resulted from prescient investments by Jerry Yang, a Yahoo co-founder who stepped down from his leadership positions at the company in 2012. He made Yahoo an early financier of both Yahoo Japan and Alibaba and fought off repeated efforts by the Chinese company to buy out Yahoo\u2019s stake. \u201cThat\u2019s much of the value of Yahoo now,\u201d Mr. May said.Mr. Anthony of Topeka Capital Markets added: \u201cMarissa Mayer is really extremely lucky. She inherited many problems, of course, but she\u2019s still got those incredible Asian assets. And that\u2019s keeping the stock strong today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Labor Wants Its Say at Davos", "Date": "2014-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorld Economic Forum in DavosDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Philip Jennings, a union leader from working-class Wales, has been coming to this Alpine ski resort for two decades to rub shoulders with the bosses of the world. His message has not changed.\u201cThe world needs a pay rise,\u201d Mr. Jennings said on a Davos panel last year. Some executives in the room rolled their eyes, others smiled politely. Did he want to go back to the 1970s, one journalist inquired. Did he understand basic economics? Mr. Jennings, who has a master\u2019s degree from the London School of Economics, is general secretary of UNI Global Union, which represents 20 million service workers in 150 countries. This year, as he again carries labor\u2019s message to Davos, he arrives with some rhetorical wind at his back.President Obama last month called the stalling of social mobility \u201cthe defining challenge of our time\u201d and vowed to help unions \u201cto organize for a better deal for workers and better wages for the middle class.\u201dPope Francis has questioned the idea of trickle-down economics. Even John Cridland, the head of Britain\u2019s biggest business organization, the Confederation of British Industry, has scolded companies for not paying employees enough.The sponsor of the Davos convocation, the World Economic Forum, in its annual risk assessment released last week, cited the growing gap between rich and poor as its single greatest worry for 2014.And research by the International Monetary Fund suggests that the income disparity in some of the world\u2019s richest countries is not only creating social problems but could sap economic demand, impede growth and even lead to the next financial crisis.\u201cFor too long, economists looked at growth alone, but not its distribution,\u201d Christine Lagarde, the fund\u2019s managing director, wrote in an email seeking comment on the cost of inequality. \u201cWe are now more keenly aware that a more balanced distribution of income leads to more sustained growth and greater economic stability.\u201dThe balance has been getting increasingly skewed. Real wages have stagnated or declined in recent years in most rich industrialized countries, even where productivity has grown. The chief executives who assembled at the first Davos meeting in 1971 would have earned an average of about 20 times what a typical employee made, according to data from the time. C.E.O.s today now make several hundred times more than their average worker.Mr. Jennings, 60, says the only way to reduce that wage gap is for working people to again have a voice. His father, he said, was a toolmaker in a Rover car factory in Cardiff who with co-workers successfully went on strike for better pay and work conditions back in the 1950s and \u201960s. \u201cWe need to revisit some of the old struggles,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to rediscover collective bargaining.\u201dBut unions, a powerful force in improving wages and social welfare programs in the West in the 20th century, are struggling in the 21st. Their members now compete with cheap labor in emerging economies and with ever smarter, faster and cheaper machines. With the exception of the Nordic countries, union membership in most rich industrialized nations has plummeted, to 17 percent across the member countries of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.Might inequality become a rallying cry? Many experts are skeptical.\u201cAn increasingly globalized and technology-intensive system can\u2019t be counted on to bargain on behalf of labor\u201d in Western countries, said Stephen Roach, a Yale economics professor and a former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia.Indeed, at a time when not just the number of unionized workers but work itself may be getting scarcer, unions need to change as radically as the economy around them, said Andrew McAfee, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\u201cAll the old assumptions would have to go,\u201d said Mr. McAfee, co-author of \u201cThe Second Machine Age,\u201d a soon-to-be published book about technology\u2019s effect on employment. He will be attending Davos this week for the first time. In coming years, he predicts, machines will be able to do many of today\u2019s jobs, whether as driverless taxis, buses and delivery vans, or as lettuce-picking robots. Long term, the only way to keep people employed and socially mobile is to create an education system that produces digital-age workers whose skills are complementary to machine intelligence, Mr. McAfee said.Meanwhile, governments need to be open to new \u2014 and sometimes old \u2014 ideas of redistribution, he said. Maybe most important, he said, is an overhaul of a taxation system that in most countries still overwhelmingly relies on revenue from labor sources like income and payroll tax. \u201cThere is a very simple rule of economics,\u201d Mr. McAfee said. \u201cIf you want less of something, tax it. If you want more of something, subsidize it.\u201dThe Rover factory where Mr. Jennings\u2019s father worked was closed long ago. A supermarket opened in its place.It is ever harder to organize workers, Mr. Jennings acknowledged. His group, UNI Global Union, is an umbrella for 900 unions representing various categories of service workers. Most of its growth has been in emerging economies, where worker activism is on the rise, echoing earlier stages in western development.Mr. Jennings still remembers his first Davos cocktail party, in 1995. He huddled in a corner with a couple of other unionists, one from Germany\u2019s IG Metall and one from Britain\u2019s Trade Union Congress. So exotic was their presence amid the capitalist clamor, he recalled, that journalists would follow them even \u201cinto the gents.\u201dSince then, about a dozen unionists have attended each year and have become more adept at \u201cDavos speed-dating,\u201d he said. In 1999, he said, he got involved with the United Nations Global Compact Initiative, whose corporate members have committed to health, environment and labor standards.UNI Global Union affiliates have organized workers subsidiaries of Western multinationals, like the retailing giant Walmart in countries like Brazil and South Africa. But so far, the union has gotten nowhere with Walmart in the United States, Mr. Jennings said. Every time he has tried to corner a senior Walmart executive at Davos in recent years, he said, \u201cthey run the other way.\u201dThis year, though, he is scheduled to come face to face with Dan Bartlett, the company\u2019s top brand executive and former communications director for the White House under George W. Bush. Mr. Bartlett, Walmart confirmed, has agreed to participate with Mr. Jennings in an invitation-only workshop on leadership and trust.\u201cHere in Davos,\u201d Mr. Jennings said, \u201cwe do actually have a seat at the table, and they have to listen to us. At least once a year.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Leader\u2019s Policy Proposals Seek Centrist Path", "Date": "2014-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande startled the usually staid world of European economic policy with proposals to take France in a centrist direction with tax cuts for companies, reductions in public spending and a business-friendly tone.On Wednesday, the proposals drew accolades and encouragement from European Union leaders and German officials, who have long pushed for France to make structural changes in its economy. Mr. Hollande drew cautious support from French business leaders.But France\u2019s far-left and far-right parties expressed dismay, saying that the nation needed a generous government safety net.For those on the left, who have pushed to have generous social programs funded by hefty taxes, Mr. Hollande appeared to be relinquishing his position as Europe\u2019s Socialist standard-bearer and strongest opponent of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose philosophy of austerity has perhaps strengthened Germany but has yet to bring financial stability to poorer euro zone countries like Greece.Mr. Hollande, who as a candidate took a stand against European austerity policies and as president has resisted calls for deep public spending cuts, strongly rejected the accusation that he had become a free marketer, saying that he \u201chad not been won over by liberalism,\u201d a reference to economic liberalism, which in France means a market approach.\u201cI am a social democrat,\u201d he declared.And his proposals, Mr. Hollande said, \u201care not a shift\u201d in views, but \u201can acceleration on the same path.\u201dGermany\u2019s foreign minister, its president and the European Union, all praised Mr. Hollande\u2019s proposals, cautioning, however, that they could be hard to deliver on for political reasons.\u201cWhat the French president presented yesterday is, firstly, courageous,\u201d said Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the foreign minister of Germany.\u201cThat seems to me to be the right way, not only for France, but it can also be a contribution that brings Europe as a whole\u201d into a stronger position as it strives to emerge from an economic crisis, Mr. Steinmeier said. But he cautioned that similar changes had taken a long time to come to fruition in Germany because of political obstacles.Mr. Hollande\u2019s proposals include a cut in payroll taxes that he said would reduce the costs of business and independent workers by 30 billion euros ($41 billion) by eliminating the amount paid by companies and independent workers for the family allocation, a tax that finances an allowance for each child after the first as well as an array of other family benefits.The family allocation and other benefits are core elements of France\u2019s social programs and have been credited with contributing to it having one of the highest birthrates in Europe. The allowance is income blind, going to all French families.Mr. Hollande also said he would cut spending by \u20ac50 billion but did not specify where.Economic experts, while gratified that Mr. Hollande finally seemed willing to wrestle with France\u2019s intractable unemployment, which has hovered between about 10 and 11 percent for close to three years, and an economy that is barely growing, remained skeptical that he would be able to persuade his party to support the changes. The experts also said that while it is easy to talk about cutting tax revenues, the president has yet to explain what programs or benefits he would reduce or eliminate to pay for the cuts \u2014 not to mention how difficult it would be to win political support for such cuts.\u201cBut I must say its implementation is the difficult part,\u201d Mr. Gros said, adding that even with the proposed cuts, government spending in France would remain at over 50 percent \u2014 it is now at 57 percent \u2014 of GDP, making it the second highest in Europe.That is still \u201cmore than the economy can bear if it wants to remain competitive,\u201d he said.He questioned whether Mr. Hollande\u2019s Socialist Party would go along with the changes, but reflected that he might be more able to reduce social spending than a conservative leader.\u201cSometimes, as in Germany, the left can better do these social policy reforms than right,\u201d Mr. Gros said.It was Ms. Merkel\u2019s predecessor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who set the course for reducing government spending and strengthening the government\u2019s relationship with business.Although the international media from Tuesday\u2019s news conference dealt with Mr. Hollande\u2019s affair with an actress and the hospitalization of his companion, Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, who has been serving as the first lady, those in the French news media on Wednesday were focused on his economic plans, generally supportive, tempered with concern about what they would mean for France\u2019s social safety net.\u201cHe is shaking up the Socialist Party,\u201d said Pierre-Alain Furbury, a journalist who covers economic issues for Les Echos, a business newspaper.Reiterating that Mr. Hollande\u2019s plans were a real departure from his policies and his tone during the presidential campaign, when he embraced a 75 percent tax on the rich and criticized big business, Mr. Furbury said that this could be \u201cthe most important speech in his five years as president,\u201d and even change the positions embraced by his party.Ma\u00efa de la Baume contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The gain was aided by a 5.6 percent increase in petroleum exports.Imports dropped 1.4 percent, to $229.1 billion. A decrease in demand for foreign oil offset a record level of imported autos.A smaller trade deficit can lift economic growth. It typically shows that American companies are earning more from sales overseas, while consumers in the United States are buying fewer products from foreign companies.Economists raised their growth forecasts for the October-December quarter after seeing the November trade report.Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, noted that the trade gap declined in both October and November. She is forecasting growth at an annual rate of 2.4 percent. But after the trade report she said growth could end up stronger.Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist at Capital Economics, said growth could be 3 percent or higher.Through 11 months of 2013, the trade deficit is 12.3 percent lower than the same period in 2012.

The space debris that imperils the American astronauts was caused by a Russian missile. Meanwhile, on television, \u201cThe Americans,\u201d a cable drama about Soviet spies embedded in Reagan-era America, returns for a second season next month.I suspect screenwriters and studio executives have deemed Russians to be politically safe villains. No advocacy group will protest. No foreign distribution deal will be nixed. Russian moviegoers here and abroad are probably inured to seeing themselves portrayed as Boris Badenovs on screen. Why make a TV show about modern-day surveillance and wiretapping when you can do a Red-scare period piece and offend or provoke no one? If you grew up during the Cold War, you viewed Russians with a potent mix of hatred and fear, and felt in your gut that a nuclear war between our countries could erupt any second, obliterating everybody and everything. That\u2019s why movies like \u201cThe Day After\u201d and \u201cThreads\u201d were so visceral. I doubt today\u2019s teenage moviegoers are walking around with the same mixed-up feelings about the Russians. Ivan Drago, the Soviet-bred fighting machine who battled Rocky Balboa in 1985, may have been absurd but he was a fall guy for his time. Has our pop culture not moved beyond \u201cRocky IV\u201d? Movie villainy did become more globalized in the final days of the Cold War and afterward. You had South Africans (\u201cLethal Weapon 2\u201d), Germans (\u201cDie Hard\u201d), Palestinians (\u201cTrue Lies\u201d). Recently, Albanians (\u201cTaken\u201d) and Somalis (\u201cCaptain Phillips\u201d) have entered the action-film fray.

In the \u201990s, Bill Clinton had a friendly relationship with Boris Yeltsin, and it wasn\u2019t so long ago that George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin shared bro time at the ranch in Crawford, Tex. \u2014 periods that brought us the nuclear showdown flick \u201cCrimson Tide,\u201d and \u201cMiracle,\u201d about the United States victory over the Russian hockey team at the 1980 Olympics. The Russian government hasn\u2019t helped to soften its bad-guy image. Recent decisions like granting Edward Snowden asylum and supporting President Bashar al-Assad of Syria are reminders that Russia still takes positions antagonistic toward the United States. And the country\u2019s shadowy reputation for espionage was not improved when a spy ring was uncovered in 2010 in suburban New Jersey (though \u201cSalt,\u201d which starred Angelina Jolie as a Russian sleeper spy, seemed to benefit from the news, as did \u201cThe Americans\u201d). And as the world gears up for the Winter Olympics in Sochi next month, concerns surround Russia\u2019s political motives and human rights record. Nonetheless, the Slavic bad guy has become a movie clich\u00e9, and like all clich\u00e9s it lacks its former power. Hollywood, we\u2019re increasingly reminded, makes movies for a worldwide audience. Two of the greatest global threats of our time \u2014 terrorism and a financial Armageddon \u2014 are frightening, complicated subjects perfect for action thrillers. This time out, though, the filmmakers behind \u201cJack Ryan: Shadow Recruit\u201d may have chosen the right subject but the wrong villain. After all, the American economy did crash.

{"Headline": "Two Decades of Change Have Boston Sparkling", "Date": "2014-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 During the 1988 presidential campaign, Vice President George Bush famously shined a spotlight on the \u201copen sewer\u201d that was Boston Harbor. He blamed his opponent, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, for failing to clean it up and called the harbor, which was choked with sludge and contaminated with chemicals, the dirtiest body of water in the country.Today the harbor is the pride of Boston, a playground for pleasure boaters and even swimmers as it glistens like a necklace, ringed by glassy towers, upscale restaurants and pricey hotels.The transformation of the harbor from embarrassment to showcase is emblematic of the larger transformation of the city over the last quarter-century.For most of that time, one man, Mayor Thomas M. Menino, 71, has been at the helm. Although he had nothing to do with the harbor cleanup, which was ordered by the courts, he maximized its potential by encouraging nearby development. Over the two decades of his tenure, the city\u2019s progress became intertwined with his. He was an incrementalist who, with prodding and cunning and by exercising total control, nonetheless took advantage of national trends like the back-to-city migration and helped propel Boston forward.He leaves office on Monday having presided over and facilitated one of the most successful urban renaissance stories in modern American history.\u201cIn the \u201970s and \u201980s, cities were thought to be dying, when high crime, out-migration and despair were the order of the day,\u201d said Robert Sampson, an urban sociologist at Harvard. \u201cBut Boston has really blossomed,\u201d he said, even as other cities have nose-dived.\u201cMenino had an incredible opportunity, and he played his hand well,\u201d Mr. Sampson said. \u201cI give him credit, but credit is also due to the context.\u201dThe challenge of maintaining the momentum of the Menino era now falls to Martin J. Walsh, who on Monday becomes the city\u2019s first new mayor in a generation.Mr. Menino was an accidental mayor, elevated to office in 1993 when Mayor Raymond L. Flynn left for an ambassadorship. An old-school politician, Mr. Menino had little on his agenda beyond improving the neighborhoods. Even as he cemented his power, his only political ambition was to stay mayor, allowing him to focus on making the city work and earning him the title \u201curban mechanic.\u201dAt the time, Boston was limping its way out of a recession and still reeling from the crisis over school busing, which had worsened race relations in the city and accelerated white flight to the suburbs. After peaking at 800,000 in 1950, the city\u2019s population had plunged to 563,000 in 1980.By the mid-\u201980s, people started drifting back to the city. By the \u201990s, more immigrants began settling here. As people nationwide increasingly chose cities over suburbs, Boston drew graduate students, empty-nesters, urban professionals and young families.The population today is 636,000. Boston had a faster rate of growth than other magnet cities like New York and San Francisco, though housing costs were almost as high.The city\u2019s complexion has changed, too. Today blacks, Latinos and Asian-Americans in Boston collectively outnumber whites, though they have been slow to rise in the power structure. Last year\u2019s election to replace Mr. Menino included black and Latino candidates; although they did not win, their endorsements of Mr. Walsh were crucial to his election.Boston\u2019s boom was driven in part by a new dynamism among its universities and research institutions as technology expanded and the knowledge-based economy developed. Those institutions had always been here, but as Paul Grogan, the president of the Boston Foundation, which provides grants to nonprofit organizations, put it, \u201cThe world changed in a way that assigned a new value to them.\u201d \u201cWe have eight research universities and 15 teaching hospitals, and there\u2019s nothing else like it in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe innovation economy gathers around institutions like these.\u201dThe success of those institutions drew biotechnology, pharmaceutical and technology firms that sought a young, educated work force, which in turn attracted more companies and created more housing and more amenities like restaurants. The surge in commercial and residential development in the city, with its continuously altering skyline, is the most obvious and visible change over the last 20 years. Another major impetus for growth in Boston was the cleanup of the harbor. It was prompted by environmental concerns, not a push for economic development. \u201cBut it turns out to be, next to the hospitals and universities, the biggest economic driver we have had,\u201d Mr. Grogan said.The South Boston Waterfront underwent a striking overhaul. It had been a neglected industrial area pockmarked with vacant lots, boarded-up warehouses and the odoriferous output of fish-processing plants that no longer thrived, but city planners saw great potential.In 1991, after years of planning, construction began there on the Big Dig, a state and federal project to replace a deteriorating elevated artery with a vast network of underground tunnels. Despite construction flaws and cost overruns, it eased traffic congestion in downtown Boston and reconnected the city with its revitalized waterfront.One of the first big city projects in the waterfront district was the $1 billion Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, completed in 2004. Since then, the area has attracted at least 200 more businesses, including three dining spots opened by Barbara Lynch, a prominent restaurateur, and office buildings by Fidelity Investments, State Street Corporation and PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cHe didn\u2019t pay for the Big Dig or clean up the harbor,\u201d Mr. Rooney said, \u201cbut he did use the power of his office to make sure they were done right.\u201dMr. Menino\u2019s presence was felt as much in neighborhoods as in downtown, revitalizing run-down areas and faded commercial strips. The blight that afflicts many urban areas is absent here.When Mr. Menino took office, there were 98 homicides in Boston; last year, there were 38.\u201cThe new mayor will inherit a balanced budget, healthy reserves, a growing tax base and a Triple-A bond rating, the highest in Boston\u2019s history,\u201d he said.But he noted difficulties ahead: a decline in federal aid, which will hurt the city\u2019s many research centers; a growing income gap, which other cities also face; and the soaring cost of college tuition and the growth of online teaching, both of which Mr. Menino said were threats to the Boston economy.Other challenges went unmentioned. The main criticism of his tenure was the failure to improve the public schools. The surge in housing development has largely been in luxury and higher-priced units, and the gentrification of neighborhoods has priced some longtime residents out of their own market.

{"Headline": "Cuomo Proposes $2 Billion in Tax Cuts", "Date": "2014-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 Sounding a refrain that will most likely echo through his re-election campaign this year, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Monday announced a sweeping $2 billion tax relief proposal, a catchall of cuts for property and business owners, renters and upstate manufacturers. The announcement, a peek into his goals for the coming legislative session, carried an unmistakable and oft-repeated message: New York\u2019s reputation as a high-tax state cannot be tolerated, and tax reductions will be among his top priorities.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said the state would be able to pay for the tax cuts because his administration was tightly controlling increases in spending and expected growing surpluses in coming years. The plan would be phased in over three years; Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office would not provide details about how the cuts would be financed in the short term.\u201cThe commission fundamentally recognized that New Yorkers need tax relief,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cYou have got a lot of hardworking families, a lot of homeowners who are getting crushed in this state by taxation.\u201d During an hourlong presentation at the Capitol, the governor offered proposals intended to please an array of constituencies. Addressing complaints that the tax panel\u2019s recommendations did not sufficiently benefit taxpayers in New York City, he proposed an income tax credit for renters who earn up to $100,000. He also proposed a more aggressive tax cut to benefit what remains of the manufacturing industry in upstate New York, whose struggling economy he has sought to reinvigorate, calling for the elimination of corporate income taxes for manufacturers in regions north of the New York City area. Their tax rate is currently 5.9 percent, and the commission had proposed cutting it by about half.But, Mr. Cuomo said, \u201cYou can\u2019t beat zero.\u201d Eager to establish a reputation as a business-friendly tax cutter, Mr. Cuomo embraced several ideas that have been questioned by liberals, including reducing the corporate income tax rate to 6.5 percent, from 7.1 percent. He also proposed raising the estate tax exemption to $5.25 million, from $1 million, so New Yorkers would no longer \u201cleave the state to die.\u201dAnd he repeatedly called for thousands of local governments to consider consolidating with their neighbors, at one point ticking off a list of tax-collecting entities. \u201cTowns, villages, district \u2014 water district, sewer district, fire district \u2014 another district just to count the other districts,\u201d the governor said. \u201cWe were government-crazed in this state.\u201d And now, he said, \u201cThey have a life of their own.\u201d Mr. Cuomo pitched a plan proposed by the panel in which the state would provide a tax rebate equal to the increase in a homeowner\u2019s property tax bill for two years, tantamount to a freeze. His office said the rebate would save the average homeowner $350 per year. The second year would be tied to municipalities\u2019 demonstrating \u201cconcrete steps\u201d toward sharing services \u2014 though local governments say they have been aggressive in cutting costs and sharing services. Another proposal would provide a tax credit prompted by how much of a homeowner\u2019s income goes toward property taxes, an arrangement known as a circuit breaker. Homeowners earning up to $200,000 would be eligible, and the average household would save $500.Mr. Cuomo and members of the Legislature are up for re-election in November, and Republican and Democratic leaders in the State Senate and State Assembly voiced qualified support for his proposals. Still, after years of austerity budgets, some Democratic legislators are wary about Mr. Cuomo\u2019s eagerness to funnel any extra revenue into tax cuts.Michael Kink, the executive director of the Strong Economy for All Coalition, which includes powerful labor unions, said the state would be better off investing more money in education, housing and antipoverty programs.But business groups were thrilled with the governor\u2019s cuts, which would also speed up the planned elimination of a utility assessment. Randy Wolken, the president of the Manufacturers Alliance of New York State, said the plan sent \u201ca powerful message to the nation.\u201d \u201cWe need to change the environment and the perception of New York as a high-tax state,\u201d Mr. Wolken continued. \u201cAnd the governor has taken the next step, saying we don\u2019t want to tax them at all.\u201dEdmund J. McMahon, the president of the Empire Center for Public Policy, a conservative research group, said he remained unconvinced that the promised property tax measures would have any substantial economic impact. \u201cThese are tiny marginal temporary savings,\u201d Mr. McMahon said. \u201cThey won\u2019t do anything to speak of for the economy. They are meant to increase the ability of the governor and Legislature to say they reduced your property taxes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Majority of New York Voters Say They Would Re-elect Cuomo, Poll Finds", "Date": "2014-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith his re-election campaign looming, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has enviable approval ratings from New York voters and general support for many of his newest proposals, including legalizing medical marijuana, according to a new poll released on Monday. But his specific plan for the drug \u2014 to use an obscure law, and not new action by the State Legislature, to provide it to patients \u2014 is much less popular.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, also had a much better reputation among voters than two of his possible Republican opponents. The poll found that Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive, was largely unknown by state voters and would be handily defeated in a head-to-head matchup with Mr. Cuomo. And Donald J. Trump, the real estate developer and reality television star, was very well known, but largely disliked; the poll found 57 percent had an unfavorable impression of him. Mr. Cuomo would defeat Mr. Trump with 70 percent of the vote, the poll said.The governor seemed to have wide support for a number of initiatives he proposed this month in his annual State of the State address to the Legislature, including a $2 billion bond act for schools, universal prekindergarten for the state, increased penalties for texting while driving and a variety of tax cuts.However, the rosy outlook for Mr. Cuomo did not necessarily carry over to specific issues that were addressed by the poll. Asked whether the governor\u2019s policies had made for a better business climate, more voters said he had had only a little effect. Less than 30 percent of voters said the state\u2019s economy was \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood,\u201d with 69 percent describing its fiscal condition as \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cfair.\u201dAnd when it comes to the governor\u2019s recent embrace of marijuana as medicine, voters strongly support the general idea but are not happy with Mr. Cuomo\u2019s methods of making it happen. He wants to use a little-known 1980 law to provide marijuana through 20 hospitals across the state; some advocates for medical marijuana fear the law is too cumbersome to be an efficient basis for a statewide program, but the governor disagrees. Fifty-five percent of those polled, though, said New York lawmakers should instead pass a law allowing medical marijuana, as other states have done.But legalizing recreational use of marijuana was another story. Fifty-four percent of voters said they opposed that idea, the poll found.New York voters were also not particularly fond of the recent activities of New Jersey\u2019s governor, Chris Christie, a Republican, who has been embroiled in a controversy involving a traffic jam in Fort Lee, N.J., that has been linked to his top aides. The poll found Governor Christie\u2019s favorability rating among New York voters had fallen to 49 percent, from 63 percent, since November, when voters in New Jersey overwhelmingly elected him to a second term.The poll, which was released on Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday, showed a pessimistic attitude about race relations in the state, with more than half of voters describing them as \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cpoor.\u201dThe poll of 808 New York voters had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leaders Begin City\u2019s Left Turn With Sick Pay Proposal", "Date": "2014-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York City\u2019s top elected officials said on Friday that they would greatly expand the reach of a measure mandating paid time off for sick workers, a cherished cause of the national left that had long been resisted by local business leaders.The plan, a stark show of force by the city\u2019s new liberal establishment, is the first in a series of labor- and immigrant-friendly laws that Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to champion, including higher pay for employees on many city-sponsored projects.For the mayor, who has been in office for two and a half weeks, the sick-leave effort carried a potent symbolic weight, offering a chance to show early action on his campaign promise to close the gap between the city\u2019s working class and its elite.A bill unveiled on Friday would require businesses with five or more employees to provide up to five compensated days off to full-time workers if they, or their family members, fell ill. The benefits would accrue for 360,000 more New Yorkers, and affect 40,000 more employers, than under a weaker version that passed last year, which included only companies with staffs of 15 or more. The revised measure, which also requires workers be paid on days spent caring for sick siblings, grandchildren and grandparents, would put New York closer in line to more stringent measures enacted in Portland, Ore.; Seattle; and Washington, D.C. It must be approved by the City Council, a likely outcome since Mr. de Blasio helped elect its new speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito. In stagecraft and in substance, the announcement amounted to a direct jab from the city\u2019s ascendant liberal leaders at the business-friendly, centrist politicians they have supplanted, who blocked action on a sick-leave measure for years, arguing its requirements would be financially onerous.\u201cPolitics matter, and elections have consequences,\u201d said Letitia James, the city\u2019s new public advocate, in a pointed declaration that earned a broad smile from Mr. de Blasio and loud cheers on a mobbed sidewalk outside a Brooklyn restaurant, where officials introduced the measure.The event, organized by the mayor\u2019s office, was more like a raucous political rally than a formal news conference. Mr. de Blasio stood before a campaign-style banner featuring the slogan \u201cOne New York,\u201d a play on his ubiquitous \u201ctale of two cities\u201d theme. Through loudspeakers, union officials and liberal activists chanted \u201cSi, se puede!\u201d as the mayor, at the lectern, conducted with a wave of his index finger.\u201cIt may have taken awhile, brothers and sisters, but you never gave up the fight,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said as he took the stage, acknowledging grass-roots advocates and council members gathered in the crowd.\u201cThis City Hall is going to be on the side of working families all over this city,\u201d the mayor said.Liberal groups, led by the Working Families Party, had fought for years to enact sick-leave legislation in New York City, only to be stymied by Mr. de Blasio\u2019s predecessor, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and the previous Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who said businesses were too overburdened to withstand the added requirements. Mr. de Blasio has long supported sick-leave laws, but he became more outspoken as the issue came to the forefront in the mayoral race, when he started hammering Ms. Quinn, a chief rival for the Democratic nomination, over her refusal to allow a vote on the measure. Under pressure, she eventually allowed a compromise bill to pass the Council. At the time, the city\u2019s leading business groups, who had a sympathetic ear with Mr. Bloomberg, virulently protested the passage of the bill.Signaling New York\u2019s political turn, those same groups on Friday issued only tepid statements, saying they hoped to work with legislators in shaping the final form of the measure.In interviews, small-business owners offered mixed reviews when told of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s plans.Sunny Singh, the manager of Market Deli in Midtown Manhattan, said he employed six workers and was fearful that the requirements would be financially harmful.\u201cSmall businesses, they cannot afford it,\u201d said Mr. Singh, who was overseeing a busy lunch hour, adding that he did not have enough money to pay employees who were unable to come to work. \u201cWhen they are sick, they don\u2019t get paid. It\u2019s usually like this.\u201dAt a Manhattan branch of the nutrition retailer GNC, Sandra Cesar, the manager, said she believed her six employees deserved the benefits included in the measure. \u201cEverybody is entitled to get sick and get paid for it,\u201d she said. But Ms. Cesar said she also worried that workers eager to avoid shifts could exploit the measure. \u201cThey might take advantage of it,\u201d she said.In other cities, including San Francisco, where sick-leave laws are already in effect, there have been few reports of businesses forced to close or lay off workers because of the requirement. In Washington, which passed a law in 2008 requiring even the smallest businesses to provide three paid sick days a year, an audit last year found that the law had not discouraged new businesses from opening, although some local employers reported cutting back on workers\u2019 hours.Despite the celebratory atmosphere of the event on Friday, Mayor de Blasio and Speaker Mark-Viverito said they would hear out the concerns of business leaders who remain anxious about the measure. \u201cThere is going to be a deliberative process,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cThere is going to be an opportunity to hear the voices of small business.\u201dBut Mr. de Blasio added that advocates had already spent several years debating the measure with business groups.And Ms. James, who as public advocate presides over Council meetings, began her remarks on Friday by pantomiming a roll-call vote on the measure, joking that she would immediately move the bill, and declaring it passed when the council members gathered at the event shouted, \u201cAye.\u201dThe expanded sick-leave bill would take full effect in April, unlike the measure passed last year, which was set up to be phased in over a period of 18 months beginning in April. And Mr. de Blasio\u2019s plan would remove several provisions included to placate corporate leaders, including a clause that would eliminate the sick-day requirements if the local economy were to erode.Nancy Alzokari, who works at Danice, a clothing store in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, said the new measure sounded like \u201ca great step.\u201dA single mother, Ms. Alzokari said she was not compensated for sick days and often looked for a friend to take care of her three children if one of them was ill.Even if someone becomes sick, she said, \u201cthe bills still got to be paid.\u201dEli Rosenberg and Rachel L. Swarns contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If Couples Could Be Corporations", "Date": "2014-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJUST before New Year\u2019s, I attended a lovely wedding back in Texas, my home state. It couldn\u2019t have been nicer: The couple exchanged vows out on a ranch under a perfect sky, and the barbecue and buffalo burgers served in the barn after the ceremony were mighty tasty. There was only one problem: It wasn\u2019t actually a wedding. Texas is one of 32 states that don\u2019t recognize same-sex marriage, and my niece, Bitsy, was marrying a gal named Kate, not a guy named Nate. So while it was a sweet event, the happy couple didn\u2019t end up with the legal rights that Texan men and women have when they marry.Many people, of course, are upset about this disparity, while many others are upset about the people who are upset, because they believe that marriage should be between only a man and a woman. These are the kinds of questions that are settled in legislatures and courts, not in the Mutual Funds & E.T.F.\u2019s section, and thank goodness for that. I just wondered why Bitsy and Kate didn\u2019t go to some loosey-goosey liberal state where same-sex marriage was already legal \u2014 you know, like Utah.(A federal judge opened the window for same-sex marriage there last month, but the window has closed again during appeals.)I was thinking about all of this on the flight back to the Northeast, and was struck by a thought so clear and exciting that it would either make me rich or get me invited to spend quality time in a locked ward. (My best ideas are like that.) Mergers give corporations many of the kinds of benefits that go with marriage: they gain important legal rights and get to mingle their assets without any state attorney general scoffing at their relationships. The federal government sometimes steps in if a merger is too big, but everything\u2019s bigger in Texas. And the Lone Star State is very business-friendly, after all. If Bitsy and Kate had tried to file with the secretary of state instead of a county clerk, things might have gone a lot better. And imagine the darling little spinoffs they\u2019ll have. Heck, in Texas, people pronounce \u201cmarriage\u201d pretty much like \u201cmerge\u201d anyway. Who will know the difference?I mean, why should corporations have all the fun? They\u2019ve really been on the march lately. Increasingly, their free-speech rights are being recognized: the Supreme Court of the United States has been very supportive of the First Amendment rights of corporations in cases like Citizens United, which allows them to spend with abandon on elections. Back in the last presidential election season, Mitt Romney said \u201ccorporations are people, my friend\u201d \u2014 and how right he was. Corporations have got it made in this country, and maybe flesh-and-blood people should start being treated as well as business entities are. (Mr. Romney\u2019s handlers argued that what he meant was that because corporations are made up of people, what affects them affects their employees. But to me, the first interpretation sounds prescient.)And why just go out on a limb when it\u2019s more fun to jump up and down on a leaf? Let\u2019s go full circle: If we\u2019re going to let people merge the way corporations do, we should also let corporations marry the way people do. If corporations can speak and have deeply held religious convictions, can\u2019t they also love? Of course they can. Married corporations could end up with some marriage rights that don\u2019t quite fit the business mold but that make a lot of sense, like the ability to make health care decisions for each other. Certainly there are ailing industries out there \u2014 cough-cough, newspapers, cough \u2014 as well as companies that are nearing the end of life. Isn\u2019t it time for a little compassion at the bedside?Look at the way political campaign spending bloomed after the Supreme Court set companies free to express their opinions. Now just imagine what corporations will do with the power of love, and how much they will be willing to spend to ensure that their special day is just perfect \u2014 Bridezillas have got nothing on Corp-zilla.Companies already spend big on conferences and retreats, and generally those don\u2019t involve limos and champagne. Corporate wedding announcements will fill out the bridal pages of newspapers, helping even my own sector of the business world. Love is indeed grand.Smart investors may make a killing in the corporate-weddings world if they invest in marriage-oriented web companies like the XO Group or in bridal stores, florists and formal-wear providers. Any financial services companies that set up mutual or exchange-traded funds focused on these industries will end up with quite a dowry themselves. It\u2019s going to be huge, I tell you. I just hope they don\u2019t expect us to buy them presents. Advertisement"}

The official spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the ministry\u2019s media policy.The ministry, which has launched an emergency task force to deal with the abduction, issued a warning against traveling to Libya and asked the 551 South Korean nationals living there to leave.Mr. Han\u2019s kidnapping came as Western governments fear a deepening instability in Libya, where the government has had difficulty containing heavily armed militias, tribesmen and Islamists.The South Korean trade agency has offices in 121 countries around the world promoting trade with South Korea, whose economy depends heavily on exports. Two-way trade with Libya stood at $1.8 billion in 2012, with automobiles making up more than half of South Korean exports to the North African country.Mr. Han has been working in Tripoli since 2012 with six local employees, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported.In 2004, a South Korean employee of a military goods supplier was kidnapped and killed by gunmen in Iraq.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tunisia\u2019s Remarkable Achievement", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAfter the final articles of Tunisia\u2019s new constitution were approved on Sunday, legislators rose to their feet, flashing victory signs and applauding before singing the national anthem. They have good reason to celebrate. After a long and often fraught process, Tunisia has managed to produce the most liberal constitution in the Arab world, and it has done so through consensus.The Arab Spring began in Tunisia three years ago when a desperate fruit vendor set himself on fire, unleashing a wave of protests by angry citizens against tyrannical regimes across the Middle East. Egypt, Yemen and Libya remain mired in the turmoil that followed. Tunisia also traversed hard times, including deep political divisions, the assassination of two opposition political leaders and terrorist threats. But legislators across the political spectrum never gave up on their country\u2019s future, taking more than two years to hammer out every article of the new constitution until nearly everyone could back it. In the end, the constitution was approved by an overwhelming 200 of Tunisia\u2019s 216-member National Constituent Assembly. While Tunisia\u2019s new constitution names Islam as the country\u2019s religion, it guarantees freedom of worship and a secular rule of law. The constitution also bans torture, and guarantees women parity in political bodies. Power has been handed over to a caretaker government led by Mehdi Jomaa, a former minister of industry and an engineer by training. Elections are expected to be held later this year.Tunisia still faces challenges. Its economy is in tatters and unemployment seems stuck at 17 percent. Riots over economic conditions broke out earlier this month. Not all the Islamists are happy with the concessions they had to make. Western governments, human rights and civil society groups gave Tunisia valuable support through the process of forging its new constitution. This is not the time for international lending institutions, eager for Tunisia to cut public spending and reduce its deficit, to lean too hard. The last thing Tunisia\u2019s government needs is a new reason for long-suffering citizens to hit the streets again in protest. Tunisia\u2019s remarkable achievement proves that consensus among bitterly divided political rivals is possible, and that respect for democratic rights and freedoms is compatible with deeply held religious beliefs and cultural values. That is a valuable lesson for the rest of the Arab world, and beyond.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As China\u2019s Economy Slows, the Pain Hits Home", "Date": "2014-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Piles of unsold coal line rural roads in north-central China. Some iron ore mines near Beijing are operating at a fraction of capacity. Chinese farm products are even increasingly scorned by the Chinese consumer.While China remains nearly self-sufficient in all these categories, it is importing more from other emerging markets. Economists and investors around the world have been fretting in recent days about the effects on smaller emerging markets if China\u2019s economic slowdown worsens. Those concerns have driven down share prices and currencies from Jakarta to Istanbul to Buenos Aires, although emerging markets staged a partial recovery on Wednesday. They helped to prod the central banks of Turkey and India to raise benchmark interest rates unexpectedly on Tuesday.Yet the most vulnerable producers these days may not be the coal mines in Indonesia, palm oil plantations in Malaysia or soybean farms in Brazil, but the farms and particularly the mines in China itself.China\u2019s role as the largest buyer of a long list of commodities, from iron ore to palm oil, means that emerging markets are heavily exposed to any economic slowdown. But their ability to capture ever-larger shares of the Chinese market at the expense of China\u2019s commodity producers has limited at least somewhat the exposure of emerging markets.China\u2019s steadily strengthening renminbi, persistent inflation and soaring blue-collar wages have combined to erase much or all of the cost advantage of domestic production for a long list of commodities. At the same time, tightened pollution regulations have made it harder for steel mills to use China\u2019s low-grade iron ore reserves or for power plants to burn China\u2019s low-quality coal.\u201cWith the increasing focus on the environment and high costs in some industries in China, China seems to be importing more of the key commodities they need,\u201d said Bruce Diesen, an analyst at the Oslo-based investment bank Carnegie.Another profound change in Chinese society is also having an impact. Hundreds of millions of Chinese are eating more meat and drinking more milk. The extra animal feed, as well as chicken, beef and dairy products, for that shift is coming increasingly from farms as distant as Uruguay and Argentina. Chinese farms have grown uncompetitive because they tend to be small and inefficient and have a reputation for contaminated food.Charter rates for bulk freighters, often a good leading indicator of China\u2019s commodity imports, have stayed strong. The shipping industry is betting that even when long-distance freight charges are included, new mines opening in Brazil and Australia will outcompete mines in China.\u201cThat new capacity will probably squeeze out more expensive domestic capacity for iron ore and coal,\u201d said Timothy Huxley, chief executive of Wah Kwong Maritime Transport Holdings, a Hong Kong shipping company.Emerging markets face many more pressures right now than the strength of China\u2019s demand for commodities. A gradual tapering in the pace of monetary stimulus by the United States Federal Reserve, where policy makers were concluding a two-day meeting on Wednesday, has sent interest rates drifting higher in America, drawing in investment dollars that might have previously gone to Bangkok or Rio de Janeiro.Rising exports to China by emerging markets also mean that if a downturn in China is severe enough, emerging market exporters will be affected along with Chinese producers. China could also adopt a variety of measures to keep out imports during a downturn, like providing government subsidies to domestic producers \u2014 although many of these possible steps would violate China\u2019s commitments to the World Trade Organization.Many emerging markets, including India, have fought losing battles with inflation for years and are now struggling to maintain the value of their currencies. After announcing this month a two-year plan to slow inflation in consumer prices, the Reserve Bank of India announced on Tuesday that it was pushing up its benchmark short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point.Raghuram G. Rajan, the central bank\u2019s governor, acted even though his country\u2019s manufacturing sector, heavily dependent on borrowing and sensitive to any increase in rates, is already slowing. \u201cIt is only by bringing down inflation to a low and stable level that monetary policy can contribute to reviving consumption and investment in a sustainable way,\u201d he said in a statement.The Turkish central bank raised its benchmark interest rate a surprisingly steep 4.25 percentage points on Tuesday in an attempt to defend the nation\u2019s currency.If China\u2019s economy slows further in the coming months, that would not just hurt demand and world prices for raw materials. It would also reduce demand and prices for a range of industrial materials, like steel, produced in many emerging markets.An HSBC survey last week found considerable gloom among many Chinese manufacturers, and an updated survey early Thursday confirmed that the industry was beginning to contract. Some wholesalers and retailers in China say that they also see signs of weakness in the crucial shopping period ahead of Lunar New Year celebrations beginning on Friday. The period is nearly as important for Chinese retailers as Christmas is for many Western retailers.\u201cBusiness this month is down 20 percent over the previous few months. I don\u2019t really know why, but people\u2019s desire for spending is just not there,\u201d said Michael Liu, a wholesaler of photo frames, bangles and other crafts in Guangzhou.Yet the prospects for emerging markets are not entirely grim. Many economists have focused on slowing growth in the value of Chinese imports, and warned about troubles in emerging markets. That partly reflects that commodity prices have been falling. But the tonnage of Chinese commodity imports has kept rising. In December, China\u2019s imports were up only 4.3 percent in dollar terms compared with a year earlier. But they were up nearly twice as much, 7.8 percent, in terms of tonnage, according to China\u2019s General Administration of Customs.The rising tonnage of imports has been hurting domestic production. China\u2019s coal imports have doubled in the last three years, even as many new open-pit mines have begun production in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang. That is causing considerable hardship and closings at underground coal mines in traditional mining provinces like Shanxi and Shaanxi, just as many underground coal mines closed in Wales and Appalachia in the 1970s and 1980s when they could not compete with open-pit mines in emerging markets or Montana.The iron ore industry in Hebei Province, near Beijing, has also been struggling as growth in steel production has stalled even as iron ore imports pour in from South Africa, Iran, Brazil and Australia.Chinese statistics show that annual growth in the mined tonnage of iron ore slowed to 6 percent last year after hovering around 20 percent for a decade. Even the modest increase last year overstates the actual increase in iron extracted, because China is having to shift to lower-grade ore reserves as high-grade reserves are exhausted.\u201cYou\u2019re moving more dirt to get the same amount of useful product,\u201d said Ephrem Ravi, the head of Asian metals research at Barclays.The weakening value of iron ore production, together with low prices and costly pollution controls in the steel sector, is affecting the entire economy in Hebei.\u201cBusiness has not been good during the past few months, it is down 20 percent compared to the same period a year ago,\u201d said Yi Jinwei, marketing manager of a construction materials wholesaler in Handan City. \u201cThe economy is just not what it used to be.\u201dHilda Wang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Schumer on Thursday called on Democrats to try to reduce the Tea Party\u2019s political influence by driving a wedge between the movement\u2019s elite leaders and its middle-income followers who depend on popular government programs like Medicare.He said that since the Tea Party\u2019s rise in 2009, Democrats have allowed the groups to employ friendly media to exploit anxiety about changes in society and a struggling economy for their own purposes, like avoiding taxes and government regulation.\u201cThe Tea Party elites, with little rebuttal, have been able to make government the boogeyman,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cThey have convinced too much of America that government is the explanation for their ills.\u201dMr. Schumer, who led successful efforts to expand the Democratic ranks in the Senate in 2006 and 2008, said the party needed to embrace and push the message that government is a positive force in most American lives.

{"Headline": "Labor Tactic Raises Fear for France", "Date": "2014-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Negotiations broke down last weekend at a Goodyear tire factory scheduled for closing in northern France, so employees resorted to a brazen tactic: They kidnapped the bosses.On Tuesday, union leaders and hundreds of employees were holding two senior executives captive, threatening to detain them until the company agreed to pay out \u201chuge amounts of money\u201d to nearly 1,200 workers about to lose their jobs.The men were released later in the afternoon only after police intervened.While this standoff was short-lived, the revival of the boss-napping tactic, a sort of guerrilla theater that was used several years ago at a number of multinational companies\u2019 French operations, is unlikely to allay the concerns of multinationals about France as a place to do business. As a debate resurfaces over whether France is in danger of becoming the next sick man of Europe, the Goodyear factory has become one of the most potent symbols of the challenges companies face in France.\u201cThis happened because workers were desperate,\u201d said Jean-Paul Fitoussi, a professor of economics at the Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques de Paris. \u201cBut it is still an act that will underline the perception that it\u2019s difficult to do business in France.\u201dTension at the Goodyear plant flared last year after the chief executive of an American tire company, Titan International, touched off a furor in France by colorfully rejecting a government appeal to step in and buy the plant.\u00a0\u201cHow stupid do you think we are?\u201d Maurice M. Taylor Jr., the head of Titan, responded in a letter to Arnaud Montebourg, the country\u2019s industry minister.Mr. Taylor, who had wanted to buy some of the operation, said he had had numerous confrontations with unions over the plant\u2019s workers, whom he described as loafers of minimal productivity.Once he withdrew, there was no other buyer, and the factory was eventually earmarked for closing, meaning the loss of all 1,173 jobs.France\u2019s rigid labor market and the influence that labor unions hold over the workplace has long been a source of aggravation to employers. The country\u2019s 3,200-page labor code embodied what the government acknowledged was a \u201ccult of regulation\u201d that choked business. Procedures for shedding workers when economic conditions deteriorate are often lengthy and expensive, and businesses pay high taxes to help fund France\u2019s social welfare system. For an employee earning 1,200 euros a month, for instance, employers pay an additional \u20ac1,000 in tax and pension costs.Despite the regulations, France remains one of the Continent\u2019s top destinations for foreign direct investment. But conscious of the stigma, the country\u2019s Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, took steps last year to enhance the business environment after a report commissioned by his government urged him to administer a \u201ccompetitiveness shock\u201d needed to avoid long-term industrial decline.Mr. Hollande pushed through a series of changes to French labor laws, including making it easier for companies to fire workers or reduce their pay and work hours in an economic downturn. He also introduced \u20ac20 billion, or $27 billion, worth of tax breaks for businesses.Still, the imminent closing of the Goodyear factory, the latest in a series of mass layoffs at large companies across France, underscored the economic consequences for workers in a country that is grappling with a high \u2014 and climbing \u2014 unemployment rate. The country is on the verge of slipping into a second recession in two years. While other big economies in Europe are showing at least glimmers of growth, France\u2019s appears to be heading in the opposite direction.Unions at the Goodyear plant had been demanding higher-than-usual severance packages of \u20ac80,000, or about $110,000, plus \u20ac2,500 for each year worked. \u201cIt will take years for these workers to find new jobs, and the older ones will have almost no chance,\u201d said Professor Fitoussi. While boss-nappings have taken place in other countries \u2014 workers at a medical device factory in China held the American owner for nearly a week last year before he met their wage demands \u2014 the tactic has become associated with France.In 2009, French employees took executives of Caterpillar hostage temporarily when talks over revamping the company\u2019s operation broke down. Workers trapped Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of Kering, the group that owns Gucci and was then known as PPR, in his car that same year. Bosses at 3M and Sony were also held against their will in an attempt to get bigger severance packages.Before they were released, the two executives \u2014 Bernard Glesser, the director of human resources at the Amiens plant, and Michel Dheilly, the director of production \u2014 were filmed by journalists and spoke with their families. They appeared mostly at ease, smiling and consulting their cellphones. But as workers milled about and occasionally shouted at them, the executives were not casually accepting their situation.\u201cWhen we are kept against our will and forced to submit to humiliations and insults, we are not being well treated,\u201d Mr. Glesser said in a video posted on the French business news site BFM.Goodyear said it would not negotiate with the unions while they held its executives, but it may not have a lot of leeway. While Goodyear\u2019s French tire factory was not as profitable as operations elsewhere, French courts tend to assess a company\u2019s plans to close based on overall group performance. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Goodyear had net income of $372 million. France\u2019s high court has ruled that if a company is flagging, \u201cif you\u2019re making money on an international level for that particular activity, then that should be taken into consideration in order to see if downsizing is justified,\u201d said Laurent Guardelli, a partner at Field Fisher Waterhouse in Paris who specializes in French employment law.Boss-napping is considered a hard-line negotiating tactic, and often the police do not intervene immediately so as not to aggravate the situation, Mr. Guardelli said.Although criminal charges could still be issued in the Goodyear case, Mr. Guardelli said that \u201cjudges are reluctant to impose severe sanctions, because they also take into account that people have been going through some hard times, and that these are more of an act of desperation rather than a voluntary violent act of abduction.\u201dThe future of the plant is hazy. Late last year, Mr. Montebourg, then the country\u2019s industry minister, again reached out to Mr. Taylor, the industrialist who is nicknamed \u201cthe Grizz\u201d by Wall Street analysts for his abrasive negotiating and management style. But Mr. Taylor has so far not made a firm commitment, and Goodyear recently began issuing layoff notices.Late Monday, Mr. Taylor said he was appalled by the latest vigilante action at the factory, in which workers rolled giant farm-tractor wheels in to block the doors to the room where the managers were being held.\u201cIn the United States, we call this a kidnapping,\u201d he told Europe 1 Radio. \u201cThese people would be arrested and prosecuted. This is a very serious crime, you would risk life imprisonment. But in France, your government does nothing \u2014 it\u2019s crazy.\u201dAmong the public, however, there is a certain sympathy with workers who see their livelihoods eroded.\u201cWe must acknowledge that the life of these people is going to stop,\u201d Pierre Laurent, the national secretary of the French Communist Party, told the radio station RTL. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about families with children, people who won\u2019t have any more revenue, and older people who will never find new work, \" he said. \u201cThey have enriched the country, they have worked for France. We can\u2019t just throw them outside with nothing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Kerry Is Scary", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEL AVIV \u2014 It is pretty clear now that Secretary of State John Kerry will either be Israel\u2019s diplomatic salvation or the most dangerous diplomatic fanatic Israel has ever encountered. But there isn\u2019t much room anymore for anything in between. This is one of those rare pay-per-view foreign policy moments. Pull up a chair. You don\u2019t see this every day.That is, has Israel become so much more powerful than its neighbors that a symmetrical negotiation is impossible, especially when the Palestinians do not seem willing or able to mount another intifada that might force Israel to withdraw? Has the neighborhood around Israel become so much more unstable that any Israeli withdrawal from anywhere is unthinkable? Has the number of Israeli Jews now living in East Jerusalem and the West Bank become so much larger \u2014 more than 540,000 \u2014 that they are immovable? And has the Palestinian rhetoric on the right of return become so deeply embedded in Palestinian politics? So when you add them all up, it becomes a fantasy to expect any Israeli or Palestinian leader to have the strength to make the huge concessions needed for a two-state solution?President Obama is letting Kerry test all this. Kerry has done so in a fanatically relentless \u2014 I\u2019ve lost count of his visits here \u2014 but highly sophisticated way. After letting the two sides fruitlessly butt heads for six months, he\u2019s now planning to present a U.S. framework that will lay out what Washington considers the core concessions Israelis and Palestinians need to make for a fair, lasting deal.The \u201cKerry Plan,\u201d likely to be unveiled soon, is expected to call for an end to the conflict and all claims, following a phased Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank (based on the 1967 lines), with unprecedented security arrangements in the strategic Jordan Valley. The Israeli withdrawal will not include certain settlement blocs, but Israel will compensate the Palestinians for them with Israeli territory. It will call for the Palestinians to have a capital in Arab East Jerusalem and for Palestinians to recognize Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people. It will not include any right of return for Palestinian refugees into Israel proper.Kerry expects and hopes that both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will declare that despite their reservations about one or another element in the U.S. framework, they will use it as the basis of further negotiations.This is where things will get interesting. U.S. and Israeli officials in close contact with Netanyahu describe him as torn, clearly understanding that some kind of two-state solution is necessary for Israel\u2019s integrity as a Jewish democratic state, with the healthy ties to Europe and the West that are vital for Israel\u2019s economy. But he remains deeply skeptical about Palestinian intentions \u2014 or as Netanyahu said here Tuesday: \u201cI do not want a binational state. But we also don\u2019t want another state that will start attacking us.\u201d His political base, though, which he nurtured, does not want Netanyahu making a U-turn. Which is why \u2014 although Netanyahu has started to prepare the ground here for the U.S. plan \u2014 if he proceeds on its basis, even with reservations, his coalition will likely collapse. He will lose a major part of his own Likud Party and all his other right-wing allies. In short, for Netanyahu to move forward, he will have to build a new political base around centrist parties. To do that, Netanyahu would have to become, to some degree, a new leader \u2014 overcoming his own innate ambivalence about any deal with the Palestinians to become Israel\u2019s most vocal and enthusiastic salesman for a two-state deal, otherwise it would never pass. \u201cNothing in politics is as risky as a U-turn or as challenging as a successful one,\u201d says Gidi Grinstein, the president of the Reut Institute, a leading Israeli strategy group. \u201cIt requires a gradual disengagement from one\u2019s greatest supporters, who slowly turn into staunchest enemies, while forming a new coalition of backers, made up of former opponents. In a cautious dance of two-steps-forward, one-step-back, U-turning leaders must shift their political center of gravity from the former base to their future platform.\u201d If and when that happens, Israel, which controls the land, would have to either implement a unilateral withdrawal, live with the morally corrosive and globally isolating implications of a permanent West Bank occupation or design a new framework of one-state-for-two-people.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama to Nominate 3 to the Board of the Fed", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama plans to nominate three people to the Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors, including Stanley Fischer, former head of the Bank of Israel, as the Fed\u2019s next vice chairman, the White House said on Friday.Mr. Obama also plans to nominate Lael Brainard, a former Treasury Department official, to an open seat on the seven-member board, and to nominate the Republican financier Jerome H. Powell, on the board since 2012, to a new term.\u201cThese three distinguished individuals have the proven experience, judgment and deep knowledge of the financial system to serve at the Federal Reserve during this important time for our economy,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a statement.The recent move by Senate Democrats to prevent filibusters of presidential nominees clears the way for a relatively quick confirmation process.The nominations would replenish the Fed\u2019s board with officials who are seen as generally supportive of the Fed\u2019s incoming chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and of the Fed\u2019s continuing campaign to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment.The Fed must decide in the coming months how quickly to retreat from that stimulus campaign, a process it began in December. The economy remains weak \u2014 unemployment is high, inflation is low \u2014 but officials increasingly are concerned about the harmful side effects of their long-running effort to address those problems by suppressing borrowing costs and encouraging financial risk taking.Mr. Fischer, 70, would succeed Ms. Yellen in her current role. The Senate confirmed Ms. Yellen as the Fed\u2019s new chairwoman this week. She will take over from the current chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, in February.Mr. Fischer has had an influential career as an academic and a policy maker. As a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he mentored many of the current crop of economic policy makers, including Mr. Bernanke and Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank. As the head of the Bank of Israel during the financial crisis, he drew praise for his success in sheltering the Israeli economy from the worst effects of the global recession that followed the crisis.He also worked as a senior Citigroup executive from 2002 to 2005.In recent public comments, Mr. Fischer has described the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign as necessary but risky. He has also questioned the value of a crucial element of the Fed\u2019s strategy, known as \u201cforward guidance.\u201d The Fed has sought to hold down interest rates by telling investors that it expects rates to remain low. Mr. Fischer has said that investors are right to regard such predictions with skepticism because circumstances could require a central bank to abandon its intentions.Mr. Fischer, born in present-day Zambia, holds American and Israeli citizenship.He said in a statement that he was \u201cdeeply honored\u201d by the nomination.Another nominee, Ms. Brainard, 51, joined the Obama administration in 2010 as Treasury under secretary for international affairs \u2014 in effect a senior diplomat for the nation\u2019s financial interests. She stepped down in November. That expertise could prove valuable to the Fed as it navigates the global impact of its actions and seeks to foster international coordination on issues of monetary and regulatory policy.Mr. Obama praised her as \u201cone of my top and most trusted international economic advisers during a challenging time not just at home, but for our global economy.\u201dAnd Mr. Powell, 60, joined the Fed\u2019s board in 2012 to serve out an uncompleted term. An expert on fiscal policy, he was a Treasury under secretary during the administration of President George H. W. Bush. He later worked for a decade as a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. He would remain the member of the Fed\u2019s board with the greatest practical experience of financial markets.Mr. Obama still needs to appoint a successor to the Fed governor Sarah Bloom Raskin, who is awaiting confirmation as deputy Treasury secretary. And another member of the board, Jeremy C. Stein, must return to Harvard this year if he wants to retain his status as a tenured professor of economics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Loan Monitor Is Accused of Ruthless Tactics on Student Debt", "Date": "2014-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStacy Jorgensen fought her way through pancreatic cancer. But her struggle was just beginning.Before she became ill, Ms. Jorgensen took out $43,000 in student loans. As her payments piled up along with medical bills, she took the unusual step of filing for bankruptcy, requiring legal proof of \u201cundue hardship.\u201dThe agency charged with monitoring such bankruptcy declarations, a nonprofit with an exclusive government agreement, argued that Ms. Jorgensen did not qualify and should pay in full, dismissing her concerns about the cancer\u2019s return.\u201cThe mere possibility of recurrence is not enough,\u201d a lawyer representing the agency said. \u201cSurvival rates for younger patients tend to be higher,\u201d another wrote, citing a study presented in court.There is $1 trillion in federal student debt today, and the possibility of default on those taxpayer-backed loans poses an acute risk to the economy\u2019s recovery. Congress, faced with troubling default rates in the past, has made it especially hard for borrowers to get bankruptcy relief for student loans, and so only some hundreds try every year. And while there has been attention to aggressive student debt collectors hired by the federal government, the organization pursuing Ms. Jorgensen does something else: it brings legal challenges to those few who are desperate enough to seek bankruptcy relief.Founded in 1994, just after the largest agency backstopping federal student loans collapsed, Educational Credit is now facing concerns that its tactics have grown ruthless. A review of hundreds of pages of court documents as well as interviews with consumer advocates, experts and bankruptcy lawyers suggest that Educational Credit\u2019s pursuit of student borrowers has veered more than occasionally into dubious terrain. A law professor and critic of Educational Credit, Rafael Pardo of Emory University, estimates that the agency oversteps in dozens of cases per year.Others have also been highly critical.A panel of bankruptcy appeal judges in 2012 denounced what it called Educational Credit\u2019s \u201cwaste of judicial resources,\u201d and said that the agency\u2019s collection activities \u201cconstituted an abuse of the bankruptcy process and defiance of the court\u2019s authority.\u201dRepresentative Steve Cohen, a Tennessee Democrat who has introduced a bill to limit predatory tactics, said, \u201cThe government should hold its agents to the highest standards, and I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve been doing that.\u201dHe added that the government has a special responsibility to use \u201ca standard that\u2019s reasonable.\u201dThe case that caused the bankruptcy judges to accuse the agency of abuse concerned Barbara Hann, who took a particularly drawn-out beating from Educational Credit. In 2004, when Ms. Hann filed for bankruptcy, Educational Credit claimed that she owed over $50,000 in outstanding debt. In a hearing that Educational Credit did not attend, Ms. Hann provided ample evidence that she had, in fact, already repaid her student loans in full.But when her bankruptcy case ended in 2010, Educational Credit began hounding Ms. Hann anew, and, on behalf of the government, garnished her Social Security \u2014 all to repay a loan that she had long since paid off.When Ms. Hann took the issue to a New Hampshire court, the judge sanctioned Educational Credit, citing the lawyers\u2019 \u201cviolation of the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s discharge injunction.\u201dEducational Credit went on to appeal the sanctions twice, earning a reprimand from Judge Norman H. Stahl of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, who agreed with the bankruptcy judges that the agency \u201chad abused the bankruptcy process.\u201dAsked for comment, Educational Credit responded that the case was not related to undue hardship and that it was based on \u201ccomplicated issues of legal procedure.\u201dAnother case dating from 2012 involved Karen Lynn Schaffer, 54, who took out a loan for her son to attend college. Her husband, Ronney, had a steady job at the time.But Mr. Schaffer\u2019s hepatitis C began to flare up, and he was found to have diabetes and liver cancer. He became bedridden and could no longer work.Ms. Schaffer said she did her best to cut expenses. She began charging her adult son rent, got loan modifications for her mortgages and cut back on watering the yard and washing clothes to save on utilities. She woke up at 4 every morning to take care of her husband before leaving for a full day at a security job.But Educational Credit said Ms. Schaffer was spending too much on food by dining out. According to Ms. Schaffer, that was a reference to the $12 she spent at McDonald\u2019s. She and Mr. Schaffer normally split a \u201cvalue meal,\u201d a small sandwich and fries.\u201cI was taking care of Ron and working a full-time job, so lots of times I didn\u2019t have time to fix dinner, or I was just too darn tired,\u201d Ms. Schaffer said in an interview. The lawyers also suggested she should charge her son for using their car, require him to pay more in rent and rent out the other room in their house.Asked for comment, Educational Credit said that Ms. Schaffer \u201cdid not meet the legal standard for undue hardship,\u201d and that she declined an income-based payment plan. Her lawyer argued that the plan would treat any forgiven loans as taxable income at the end of the repayment period so it was not a viable option.Supporters of the agency\u2019s tactics say they are necessary to hold borrowers accountable. \u201cFor every dollar that the aggressive debt-collection firm fails to recoup, that\u2019s a dollar that someone else is going to have to pay,\u201d said G. Marcus Cole, a law professor at Stanford University.Professor Cole added that if it were easy to discharge student loans in bankruptcy, lenders would simply not lend money to students without clear assets or prospects. \u201cWe need a standard like that to be able to allow students who can\u2019t afford an education to be able to borrow,\u201d he said.The Educational Credit Management Corporation is the product of a scandal that almost brought down the government\u2019s student loan program two decades ago. In 1990, the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, the nation\u2019s largest student loan guarantee agency for federal loans, announced that it had become insolvent, evidence that no one was paying very close attention to where student loans went, and whether they were ever paid off.\u201cThe high default rates had a particularly high impact with the press,\u201d said Frank Holleman, deputy secretary of education at the time.Lawmakers began arming the Department of Education with a set of unprecedented collection tools, including the ability to garnish debtors\u2019 wages and Social Security, and appropriate their tax rebates.The changes helped cut default rates from a high of 22 percent in 1990 to around 10 percent in the 2011 fiscal year.But critics of Educational Credit said it had stepped over a line between legitimate efforts to collect on defaulted loans and legal harassment.\u201cWe should be outraged when a student-loan creditor like E.C.M.C. can use bulldog tactics to scare away someone who has a legitimate claim for relief,\u201d said Professor Pardo, who has analyzed hundreds of adversary proceedings involving the nonprofit. \u201cPart of the outrage is that ultimately E.C.M.C. is defending the federal government\u2019s interest.\u201dProfessor Pardo called the agency\u2019s tactics a \u201cwar of attrition, death by a thousand cuts.\u201dAsked to respond, Educational Credit issued a statement saying that its practices strictly follow federal law and that it strives to avoid lengthy court proceedings by working with borrowers to help them apply for income-based repayment plans. When appropriate, it said it \u201cconsents to a discharge as an undue hardship.\u201d It acknowledged that some cases are \u201cclose calls.\u201dChris Greene, a spokesman for the Department of Education, said that the department offers flexible repayment options and believes that Educational Credit complies with the law and government policies. He said that if there was evidence of wrongdoing, the department would investigate.One of the places where Educational Credit has had the biggest impact has been to shape the meaning of the phrase \u201cundue hardship,\u201d the standard required since the 1970s for relief from student debt. In 2009, for example, the agency persuaded the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to adopt stricter standards. One argument it made was that if student borrowers seeking bankruptcy could qualify for a repayment plan tied to their incomes they were, by definition, ineligible for relief.The dissenting judge, Kermit E. Bye, said the decision \u201cimproperly limits the inherent discretion afforded to bankruptcy judges when evaluating requests\u201d for relief. He also said the new standards subjected debtors to a higher burden of proof than was actually required by law.These and other changes have been regretted by others as well.\u201cWe thought we were doing God\u2019s work,\u201d said David A. Longanecker, a former Department of Education official, referring to efforts to strengthen collection. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realize the full extent to which our actions would lead to some activities that would be unfair to borrowers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Cracks Open the Door for Video Game Consoles, but Doubts Abound", "Date": "2014-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 For years, the Big Three makers of video game consoles \u2014 Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo \u2014 have coveted access to China, a potentially huge but mostly closed market. Finally, China has cracked open the door, but industry experts say console makers may still struggle to break through to the next level.The Chinese government published rules this week allowing foreign companies to make and sell video game equipment in a Shanghai free trade zone that was established last year. The notice, which elaborated on an announcement made in September, relaxes a ban on the sale of consoles, which Beijing imposed in 2000 in an effort to protect children from what were perceived to be the corrupting influences of video games.In theory, the change could give foreign companies access to a large and potentially lucrative market. By the end of 2013, China had about 490 million players of electronic and online games, an increase of 20.6 percent from the same time a year earlier, according to a state-run trade organization. Game industry revenue in China totaled 83.2 billion renminbi, or $13.8 billion, last year, up 38 percent from 2012, the group said. In the United States, by contrast, the business has been shrinking. Sales of games, excluding hardware, fell to $14.8 billion in 2012 from $16.3 billion in 2011, according to NPD, a research firm. While console systems remain popular in the United States and other Western markets, the vast majority of Chinese players use personal computers and mobile phones or other handheld devices. That, analysts say, is unlikely to change even though Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo may now get their long-awaited entr\u00e9e.\u201cIt\u2019s not like the kids are going to walk into the candy store and see that they\u2019ve suddenly invented chocolate,\u201d said Lisa Cosmas Hanson, managing partner at Niko Partners, a research firm that specializes in the Asian video game business.Game consoles like Sony\u2019s PlayStation, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox and Nintendo\u2019s Wii are already widely available in China. Despite the official ban, smuggled or counterfeit versions are sold openly at some electronics stores. Yet sales of console games generated only $15 million last year in China, according to the game makers\u2019 association. Most Chinese players prefer to play online games, which are often free initially. Game publishers then earn money from sales of additional game features or advertising. While this business model, called \u201cfreemium,\u201d is growing elsewhere, too, the sale of packaged games for consoles remains more prevalent in the West.Console makers often lose money on hardware, at least early in the release cycle for new systems, and then recoup it through sales of games. Given the primacy of the freemium model and the prevalence of media piracy in China, analysts say, console makers will be cautious about entering the country despite the relaxation of the ban. Or they might have to adopt a new approach, embracing the freemium approach for consoles so that these systems would resemble PC or mobile gaming.\u201cUntil regulations change to enforce copyright, these changes don\u2019t matter,\u201d said Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies, a brokerage firm. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t move the needle whatsoever. The era of consoles is over anyway. The real action is in mobile gaming.\u201dWhile copyright enforcement remains patchy in China, content regulations are tight, and this is another reason, analysts say, why console gaming is unlikely to take off quickly there. Many Western console games, especially those with violent, sexual or politically sensitive material, are unlikely to clear Chinese censors. And domestic game developers have focused on PC and mobile gaming, so console makers would face a shortage of games for Chinese players, at least initially.The rules, issued by the State Council, the central government\u2019s cabinet, say that \u201cgaming entertainment equipment that passes vetting of content by the cultural authorities may be sold into the domestic market.\u201d But no guidelines were provided about what kinds of material would be deemed acceptable.Peter Warman, chief executive of Newzoo, a video game research firm, said that rather than a liberalization, the change in the rules might actually be a move to clamp down. \u201cThe fact that consoles and most probably individual games will have to go through an approvement process could give the government a bigger stick to regulate console and console game sales,\u201d he said.The government has also not explained how much of their production or development foreign game companies would have to do in the Shanghai free trade zone to take advantage of the rule change.That helps explain the cautious reaction to the news from console makers. \u201cWe recognize that China is a promising market, and we are studying developments there, but at this point we cannot comment further,\u201d said Satoshi Nakajima, a spokesman for Sony Computer Entertainment, the company\u2019s video game unit. Nintendo could not immediately be reached for comment.Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft do not currently make consoles in Shanghai. Microsoft, however, last year set up a video game joint venture with BesTV New Media, a Chinese Internet TV company.Microsoft said the venture \u201ccombines our strengths in entertainment and technology to foster a new development ecosystem within China,\u201d adding that it would provide details at a later date.\u201cOur goal is to deliver a new generation of innovative family entertainment experiences for people in China and around the world, as well as contributing to the local economy in Shanghai,\u201d Microsoft said in a statement attributed to Ralph Haupter, its chief executive for greater China.Despite the uncertainties over the rule change, the news has generated considerable excitement in China. Suning, a leading electronics retailer, said on Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site, that it had already dispatched sales teams to meet with makers of consoles and planned to offer them as soon as possible.But even some Chinese observers seemed unsure about how to react. \u201cNow there\u2019s no need for either celebrations or panic,\u201d said a commentary on the game industry news section of the Sina.com news website. \u201cThese are just the principles. There\u2019s still some way to go from principles to detailed rules.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Britain, Big Decisions on Identity", "Date": "2014-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From EuropeLONDON \u2014 On one of the highbrow radio talk shows that mold the political agenda here, a host heralded the New Year this week by saying 2014 would force Britons to confront a single overwhelming question: Who do they think they are?Indeed, for some in this debate over a nation\u2019s identity \u2014 100 years after the start of World War I, which honed Britain\u2019s imperial reflexes \u2014 the next 12 months could begin writing the final chapters of the empire\u2019s decline.The sequence began on New Year\u2019s Day, when the last restrictions fell away on Bulgarians and Romanians entering the European Union\u2019s labor markets, including Britain\u2019s.In September, Scots are to vote in a referendum on independence, potentially shrinking the United Kingdom to a rump embracing England, Wales and Northern Ireland. And \u2014 the final tripwire \u2014 whatever Britons remain may well vote in 2017 on whether to leave the European Union altogether.Will Britain thus emerge from this cascade of challenges as a reinvigorated player in a broadening Europe, or as a footnote to its onetime global reach?In the 24-hour news cycle, the issue that dominated the week was the long-heralded shift in regulations that permitted citizens of Bulgaria and Romania \u2014 the European Union\u2019s poorest lands, which joined the bloc in 2007 \u2014 to look for work in Britain.At 7:40 a.m. at Luton Airport north of London, when the first flight from Romania landed on Wednesday, crowds of reporters and a sprinkling of politicians gathered to determine whether the nation faced a flood or a trickle of new migrants.As it turned out, the 180-passenger aircraft from Targu Mures, Romania, had only 140 people on board, most of whom were already living in Britain, despite the previous restrictions.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen no evidence of people who have rushed out and bought tickets in order to arrive because it\u2019s the first of January,\u201d Keith Vaz, a senior lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, told reporters at Luton. \u201cWe\u2019d be surprised if they did so. This is, after all, only a snapshot.\u201dThe point of the airport vigil, however, lay elsewhere.At a time of hardship, austerity and government efforts to curb the once-munificent welfare state, the question of immigration draws on a fissile blend of economic fear, ethnic stereotyping and political maneuver.In the debate, the familiar economic argument \u2014 does immigration drain or bolster economies? \u2014 comes a distant second to the scramble for votes.Depending on your newspaper, immigrants from Romania and Bulgaria are either work-shy scroungers, benefit frauds, pickpockets and panhandlers or the harbingers of hard-working renewal in jobs Britons are either unwilling or unqualified to take \u2014 or even both: A person shampooing clients\u2019 hair at a north London salon the other day vouchsafed that she held a degree in economics from a Romanian university.As the Jan. 1 deadline approached, The Sun tabloid dispatched reporters to Romania to join a busload of migrants heading out on the three-day trip to the supposed British El Dorado. Some were quoted as saying they would beg, steal or swindle to tap into Britain\u2019s relative wealth. \u201cCheeky Beggars,\u201d the newspaper headlined its report.The reality is that no one really knows what the changes will bring. Much of the discussion here is driven by Britain\u2019s underestimation of an earlier surge of immigrants from Eastern Europe in 2004 and by the political imperative of claiming credit for preventing a new tsunami in advance of Britain\u2019s national elections next year.\u201cMost of those who want to work in the U.K. are probably here already,\u201d The Guardian newspaper said. But that may not stop the government from \u201cclaiming credit for slaying a monster that never existed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Speech, Cuomo Pledges Lower Taxes and Statewide Pre-K", "Date": "2014-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, entering an election year with no formidable opponent and an improving economy, claimed on Wednesday to have brought New York State back from the brink of financial ruin and unveiled proposed tax cuts and a promise of statewide prekindergarten classes, telling lawmakers that when he became governor, New York was \u201cliterally a joke on late night TV.\u201dIn his State of the State address, which governors have typically used to lay out their past accomplishments and future priorities, Mr. Cuomo sought to put his record in the best possible light. His staff even provided reporters the number of times he was applauded (65). He said the upstate economy had improved, unemployment had fallen in every region and taxes for every New Yorker were down. He mentioned the word tax or taxes about 40 times, mostly to assert that he had managed to drive them down.\u201cWe were on the precipice of an abyss,\u201d Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, told the hundreds of people who filled the Empire State Plaza Convention Center. \u201cWe did what we said we were going to. We changed the direction of the state for the better.\u201dThe governor, who has strong favorability ratings, ample campaign money and hopes of securing a second term in November, delivered the speech, just over an hour long, to a mostly supportive crowd. One of the more intriguing audience members was Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, who had traveled to Albany on the first official visit of his administration; Mayor de Blasio met with Democratic leaders and received an admiring reception. The greeting was not so warm outside the hall where Mr. Cuomo delivered his speech, as protesters opposing issues like hydraulic fracturing, the gas extraction method also known as fracking, gathered amid heavy security. And many groups had many complaints. Retirees were irritated at the lack of any mention of support for care givers. Environmentalists pointed out that nothing in the speech dealt with sustainability. Advocates for the poor noted there was little mention of antipoverty initiatives. Drug reform groups wanted Mr. Cuomo to talk more about marijuana. The speech capped a busy few days in Albany. On Monday, Mr. Cuomo announced a sweeping $2 billion tax relief proposal \u2014 a grab bag of cuts for renters, property and business owners and upstate manufacturers. On Tuesday, joined by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the governor identified the many ways New York would spend over $16 billion in federal disaster aid on items like high-tech weather stations and seals for entrances to subway stations. He also disclosed his support for loosening restrictions on marijuana, saying he planned to use an executive action that would allow limited use of the drug by those with serious illnesses.Mr. Cuomo recalled many past accomplishments. Still, some new proposals did emerge, including the state\u2019s assumption of management responsibility for construction projects at Kennedy and La Guardia Airports. A comment by Mr. Cuomo that La Guardia was ranked the worst airport in the country drew snickers from the crowd. Mr. Cuomo also said he would lend his support to an expansion of the Metro-North Railroad by opening four stations in the Bronx and linking the New Haven line to Pennsylvania Station.The governor said he would develop plans to raise the age of criminal responsibility in New York from its current level of 16, the lowest in the nation. Mr. Cuomo also said he wanted to pay top teachers performance bonuses and announced plans for a $2 billion bond referendum in the fall that, if passed by voters, would be used to upgrade public schools and provide them better equipment. The governor spent a fair bit of time talking about education, as Mr. de Blasio looked on. The mayor has made universal prekindergarten classes a priority, promising to pay for the program with a tax on city residents earning $500,000 or more, an issue he pressed in comments to reporters.Mr. Cuomo affirmed the state\u2019s commitment to early childhood education, and made a promise to deliver full-day prekindergarten, but he did not say how much it would cost. After the speech, Mr. de Blasio, who needs legislative approval for his proposed tax increase, praised the governor for presenting what he called \u201ca progressive, proactive agenda for the future of our state,\u201d and called the governor\u2019s goal of expanding prekindergarten statewide \u201ca fantastic statement.\u201dThe leader of the Senate Republicans, Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, praised Mr. Cuomo\u2019s focus on cutting taxes and said he sounded like \u201ca good moderate Republican.\u201dFor the most part, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s speech took on the tones of a business presentation, though he did sound notes of passion when he said he would push for several issues \u2014 abortion rights, campaign finance and ethics reforms \u2014 that dominated the debate during the 2013 legislative session. Bills on those issues were unsuccessful, and all will face steep climbs to pass this year as well. But he said he would try again, urging legislators to \u201cstop playing politics with women\u2019s rights\u201d and promising success on new ethics laws. He proposed amending state law to address what he called a \u201creally troubling\u201d situation in which numerous state agencies were unaware of the allegations of pervasive anti-Semitism.

{"Headline": "Russians Debate Sticker Price of Sochi Games", "Date": "2014-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOthers, though, say those figures are grossly understated.Mr. Putin\u2019s figure was, Mr. Navalny said, \u201ca lie of an absolutely absurd scale.\u201d It is not only one-tenth of the spending that has been widely reported, but it is also less than the $12 billion Mr. Putin pledged in 2007 to spend on the games when he personally appealed to the International Olympic Committee to choose Sochi as the host.That Russia\u2019s first Winter Olympics would be an expensive undertaking has been a given since the government first broke ground on the projects in and around Sochi, which Mr. Putin called \u201cthe biggest building site on the planet.\u201d For the first time, though, the cost issue appears to have become politically sensitive for the Kremlin.Officials here once boasted of Russia\u2019s ability to spend so lavishly, but of late they have embraced Mr. Putin\u2019s more frugal tone, and have sought to defend the outlays by redefining what constitutes spending on the Olympics. They have argued that the billions poured into projects like the huge new power plant on the edge of the Olympic Village or the adjacent new railroad station should not be counted as Olympic expenditures, but rather as part of a broader economic stimulus project to rebuild the sea-meets-the-mountains resort on the Black Sea.\u201cIt\u2019s just senseless to take the cost of everything built in Sochi \u2014 and the building of roads in Sochi \u2014 and ascribe it to the Games,\u201d Aleksandr D. Zhukov, the deputy speaker of the lower house of Parliament and the chairman of the Russian Olympic Committee, said in an interview. \u201cWere you in Beijing for the Games? They made boulevards twice as wide \u2014 built new roads there. What did that have to do with the Olympics?\u201dTo critics like Mr. Navalny, however, Sochi has turned into an unaffordable personal vanity project, intended to cement Mr. Putin\u2019s legacy as the driving force of the country\u2019s restoration after the collapse of the Soviet Union more than two decades ago.\u201cIt actually seems like some small, spiteful pharaoh is building himself the greatest pyramid in the world,\u201d Mr. Navalny said in his organization\u2019s new headquarters in southeastern Moscow, which hummed late into the evening last week with people still crunching the numbers for the report. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way to explain the gigantomania,\u201d he said.According to the group\u2019s calculations, Russia has spent more than 1.5 trillion rubles on the Olympics, which at today\u2019s suddenly declining exchange rate would amount to at least $48 billion \u2014 more than China spent for the far larger Summer Olympics in 2008.The website \u2014 in Russian and English \u2014 documents thousands of expenses salted through Russian federal budgets since the country first applied to host the games. Mr. Navalny said the work was made difficult by the way spending was scattered in myriad accounts. \u201cThere is no single source for the figures,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery project requires its own investigation.\u201dMr. Navalny challenged the Kremlin\u2019s assertions that much of the spending was private, not government. When Mr. Putin said that less than half of the figure he cited was federal money, he sidestepped the fact that many of the largest \u201cprivate\u201d expenditures were made by companies that are state-owned, like Russian Railways, the state bank and Gazprom, Mr. Navalny said. According to his organization\u2019s analysis, less than 4 percent of the overall spending came from truly private companies.Mikhail G. Delyagin, an economist in Moscow, said in an interview that as a rule, the Olympic Games rarely prove to be the engines of economic revival that officials claim. \u201cThe situation in Sochi is indeed positive, because there wasn\u2019t even a normal sewer system there,\u201d he said, \u201cbut one shouldn\u2019t expect that these resorts will recoup the cost.\u201dMr. Navalny argued that beyond the most visible projects, like the stadiums and arenas, the government also spent heavily on buildings that had nothing to do with the Olympics or even with future tourism in Sochi. They include new residences for Mr. Putin, a church at the Olympic Village, and resorts for various agencies like the prosecutor\u2019s office and the Federal Security Service, all classified in the annual budgets as Olympic projects.\u201cUnder the guise of the Olympics, they made themselves a super-magnificent resort for those who have ended up on the \u2018Magnitsky List\u2019 and cannot leave the country,\u201d he said, referring to American sanctions that bar travel and investments abroad for certain Russian officials accused of human-rights abuses.The Sochi Olympics are seen as such a national priority \u2014 and a personal one for Mr. Putin \u2014 that there has been little official debate about the preparations and the costs. The Parliament has not held hearings. The state auditing chamber has compiled a report on spending, but it has not disclosed its findings and would not do so until after the Games, a spokesman said.What criticism there has been of the spending has come from a handful of news organizations and bloggers. Online critics in particular have enthusiastically questioned the building projects and the chronic delays, delved into accusations of cronyism and corruption and mocked absurdities they uncovered.Andrey Miroshnichenko, an independent media analyst, questioned whether Mr. Navalny\u2019s report would at last spur a meaningful political debate, and noted that excessive spending and corruption are taken for granted in Russia. \u201cEveryone knows how business is done here,\u201d he said. \u201cExpensiveness is considered a way to redistribute the state\u2019s wealth.\u201dDmitri A. Medvedev, the former president and now prime minister, acknowledged in an interview with CNN on Wednesday that the larger figure of nearly $50 billion was accurate, but he disputed accusations of excessive waste or corruption. \u201cThere is no data on whether the corruption related to the Olympics,\u201d he explained, \u201cis much higher than the average level of corruption in the country.\u201dAn earlier version of the picture caption atop this article misspelled the name of the cross-country ski and biathlon center. It is the Laura ski center, not Lauea.Andrew Roth contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Two weeks ago, after waiting for six years for Israel to review my application for refugee status \u2014 something it has repeatedly refused to do \u2014 I joined thousands of other Africans in a strike to force the government to recognize our basic human rights.I am not in Israel on a whim. I had no choice but to leave Eritrea, where arrest, forced labor and indefinite military conscription are facts of daily life. In 2008, after four years in the military \u2014 which often contracted me out to private companies as an unpaid construction worker \u2014 I asked when I would be discharged. The military refused to answer.Shortly after, I was warned that I was about to be thrown in prison. My brother had already escaped the military into Ethiopia, and though my mother had been imprisoned for six months as a result, I decided to flee as well. I left, not knowing where I would end up; I only knew that I could not stay.I traveled with several others through Sudan, fearing that the Eritrean Army would catch us, and through Egypt, where half our group was caught by the Egyptian police and sent back to Eritrea. I was shot at by Egyptian soldiers at the Israeli border, and spent two days alone in the desert before I was found by an Israeli soldier and brought to a hospital.I have encountered great moments of individual kindness here in Israel. If it were not for an Israeli family that took me in after seeing me homeless and injured in south Tel Aviv, my story might have ended there.And yet the government has repeatedly denied the fundamental reality of my situation. Much of the world would consider me a refugee, and I would not have risked my life unless I thought so as well. But Israel has refused to determine my refugee status in any systematic or transparent manner, leaving me in a legal limbo, unable to work on the books and unsure of whether I will be allowed to stay.I am not alone: More than 50,000 refugees reside in Israel, but only a handful have been given refugee status.The Israeli government may not know what to do with us, but the Israeli economy does: We are busboys and construction workers, labor that countless businesses could not do without. While I was trained as an engineer in Eritrea, in Israel I washed dishes and worked as a cook.Meanwhile, we live in fear of the arbitrary summons that sends asylum seekers to prison facilities, where we can be detained without trial. Israel claims that these facilities are \u201copen,\u201d with detainees free to leave, but they are isolated \u2014 one new facility is far out in the Negev Desert. There is nowhere to go. While I have not received a summons yet, many of my friends have been less lucky.Instead of trying to understand our situation and work toward a solution, many members of the Israeli Parliament would rather demonize us, calling us \u201cinfiltrators\u201d and criminals. This language has crept into the news media and become mainstream in a culture already suspicious of \u201cthe other.\u201d Though they hardly know us, Israelis are taught to hate us, to think of us as outsiders coming to take their jobs or, worse, to harm them.Drawing inspiration from their brave actions, a few weeks later the larger community of asylum seekers in Israel \u2014 mostly Eritrean and Sudanese \u2014 announced a general strike, demanding that Israel finally adhere to its obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention and undertake an honest, thorough determination of our refugee status. The convention, which Israel not only signed but helped write, states that those identified as refugees are guaranteed safe haven and the right to work in their host countries.And we have done more than strike. A week ago, more than 25,000 of us gathered in Tel Aviv\u2019s Rabin Square shouting, \u201cWe are refugees!\u201d The next day, I stood outside the American Embassy with many thousands of my fellow asylum seekers; others went before the British, Canadian, French and Italian Embassies. No one came out to greet us, but they most certainly heard our chants. Meanwhile, more than 10,000 refugees traveled from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to protest in front of the Israeli Parliament. Even more would have gone, but we didn\u2019t have enough buses.I do not want to stay in Israel any longer than I have to. If I could return to a peaceful Eritrea, I would. I want to see my family, and to return to my engineering job.Until then, however, I must make the best out of what is sometimes an unbearable situation. Until then, the Israeli government must recognize our right to live and work in this country. And until then, the international community must insist that Israel drastically shift its policy regarding refugees. Ghirmay Birhane is awaiting refugee status in Israel.

{"Headline": "After 3 Months of Drops, Home Resales Edge Up 1%", "Date": "2014-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a sign of resilience in the housing market recovery despite higher mortgage rates, home resales in the United States rose in December after declining for three straight months.While other data on Thursday showed a marginal rise in first-time applications for unemployment benefits last week and a slowdown in factory activity this month, the deterioration was not enough to change the picture of an improving economy.\u201cWe have an economy that is firing on almost all cylinders, and we expect to see a noticeable pickup in growth in 2014,\u201d said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh.Sales of previously owned homes rose 1 percent last month, to an annual rate of 4.87 million units, the National Association of Realtors said. The sales pace, however, was slower than economists had forecast. Sales fell in the Northeast and the Midwest, which suffered the brunt of cold weather in December.\u201cWe generally expect housing market activity to accelerate in subsequent months,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits ticked up 1,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 326,000.The four-week average for new claims, considered a better measure of underlying labor market conditions as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,750, to 331,500. Last week\u2019s claims report covered the survey period for January nonfarm payroll data. Employers added only 74,000 new jobs to their payrolls in December after creating 241,000 positions in November. That was at odds with other employment indicators that suggested a brisk pace of hiring in December.The jobless claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid rose to a six-month high in the week that ended Jan. 11. But it also showed 1.35 million long-term unemployed Americans dropped off the rolls the week before, after their benefits expired.Economists expect the expiration of these extended benefits to push the unemployment rate, at 6.7 percent, down by as much as half a percentage point. Should the unemployment rate drop because former recipients of jobless benefits have dropped out of the labor force, that could pose problems for the Federal Reserve.The Fed has said it will hold interest rates near zero at least until the jobless rate drops to 6.5 percent. But if a big part of the decline reflects people dropping out of the labor force, that could be seen as a sign of weakness, not strength.Fed policy makers are to meet Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss monetary policy and the outlook for the economy.Separately, the financial data firm Markit said its preliminary manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to 53.7 early this month, from 55.0 in December. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. Activity was apparently held back by a slowdown in new orders and a contraction in export orders. Some cooling off is expected in manufacturing after strong growth in the fourth quarter. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Report Opens Way to Approval for Keystone Pipeline", "Date": "2014-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The State Department released a report\u00a0on Friday\u00a0concluding that the Keystone XL pipeline would not substantially worsen carbon pollution, leaving an opening for President Obama to approve the politically divisive project.The department\u2019s long-awaited environmental impact statement appears to indicate that the project could pass the criteria Mr. Obama set forth in a speech last summer when he said he would approve the 1,700-mile pipeline if it would not \u201csignificantly exacerbate\u201d the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. Although the pipeline would carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Canada to the Gulf Coast, the report appears to indicate that if it were not built, carbon-heavy oil would still be extracted at the same rate from pristine Alberta forest and transported to refineries by rail instead.The report sets up a difficult decision for Secretary of State John Kerry, who now must make a recommendation on the international project to Mr. Obama. Mr. Kerry, who hopes to make action on climate change a key part of his legacy, has never publicly offered his personal views on the pipeline. Aides said Mr. Kerry was preparing to \u201cdive into\u201d the 11-volume report and would give high priority to the issue of global warming in making the decision. His aides offered no timetable.\u201cHe\u2019ll deliberate and take the time he needs,\u201d said Kerri-Ann Jones, the assistant secretary of state for oceans and international affairs.Environmentalists said they were dismayed at some of the report\u2019s conclusions and disputed its objectivity, but they also said it offered Mr. Obama reasons to reject the pipeline. They said they planned to intensify efforts to try to influence Mr. Kerry\u2019s decision. For more than two years, environmentalists have protested the project and been arrested in demonstrations against it around the country.\u00a0But many Republicans and oil industry executives, who support the pipeline because they say it creates jobs and increases supplies from a friendly source of oil, embraced the findings.The State Department is expected to shortly release the results of an inspector general\u2019s investigation into the preparation of an earlier draft of the environmental impact report. The investigation was ordered after an environmental group obtained documents indicating that some consultants for the firm that wrote the draft report had previously done work for TransCanada, the company seeking to build the pipeline. If investigators determine a conflict of interest in the preparation of that draft, the State Department may have to conduct a new environmental review.In light of the investigation, environmentalists were particularly critical of the report released on Friday.Some environmentalists saw reason for optimism in the review, which models several possible future oil market possibilities. Most involve a future of high oil prices and robust demand, in which the oil sands crude is rapidly developed with or without the Keystone pipeline. However, the report offers one alternative sequence, in which oil prices and demand are low. In that case, not building the pipeline might slow development, and thus slow carbon emissions. That possibility is unlikely, but it could provide the administration something to point to should it deny the project.\u00a0The oil industry applauded the review.There are political and strategic advantages to approving the pipeline: It would strengthen relations with Canada and provide a conduit for oil from a friendly neighbor. If the pipeline is approved this year, it could also help the re-election campaigns of two vulnerable Democratic senators from oil-rich states \u2014 Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Begich of Alaska \u2014 while silencing critics who for years have urged the president to move ahead with the pipeline.Although the pipeline is a potent political symbol, its true impact on both the environment and the economy would be more limited than either its supporters or its opponents suggest.The new State Department report concludes that the process used for producing the oil \u2014 by extracting what are called tar sands or oil sands from the Alberta forest \u2014 creates about 17 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than traditional oil. But the report concludes that this heavily polluting oil will still be brought to market. Energy companies are already moving the oil out of Canada by rail.\u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s a consensus among most energy experts that the oil will get shipped to market no matter what,\u201d said Robert McNally, an energy consultant who was a senior energy and economic adviser to President George W. Bush. \u201cIt\u2019s less important than I think it was perceived to be a year ago, both politically and on oil markets.\u201dThe new State Department analysis took into account the growing global demand for oil and the rapidly growing practice of moving oil by rail in areas where pipelines have not been built. \u201cGiven the anticipated outlook of oil prices and the cost of development, no single project will likely affect the rate of extraction,\u201d said a senior State Department official, who asked not to be named under the ground rules imposed by the department.But moving oil by rail has its own hazards. As the practice has increased in recent years, so have incidents of explosions of rail cars carrying oil.Privately, people close to Mr. Obama say that although he is committed to building a climate legacy, he does not see the pipeline as a central part of that effort. Instead, the president is moving forward with a set of Environmental Protection Agency regulations on coal-fired power plants, the nation\u2019s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions.Those regulations do not have the potent political symbolism of the pipeline, but could have a far greater impact on the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by freezing construction of new coal plants and closing hundreds of existing ones.Ahead of making his decision, Mr. Kerry will take counsel from the leaders of eight other government agencies: the Departments of Defense, Justice, Interior, Commerce, Transportation, Energy and Homeland Security and the E.P.A. It is unclear when the decision might be made, but some close to the process say it could take as long as a year.Environmentalists are preparing to influence the next stages of the decision-making process.\u201cThis is the most scrutinized pipeline in the nation\u2019s history,\u201d said Brigham A. McCown, a former administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s lasted as long as it has means one of two things. They\u2019ve either done a very good, thorough job, or they\u2019ve slowed it down due to political pressure.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the agency with which Susan Casey-Lefkowitz is affiliated. It is the Natural Resources Defense Council, not the Natural Resources Defense Center.\u00a0Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Anxious Youth, Then and Now", "Date": "2013-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorFOR years now, we\u2019ve heard the gripes by and about millennials, the offspring of the Great Recession, caught between childhood and adulthood. Their plight seems so very 21st century: the unstable careers, the confusion of technologies, the delayed romance, parenthood and maturity.Many of the same concerns and challenges faced the children of the industrial revolution, as the booms and busts of America\u2019s wild 19th century tore apart the accepted order.Each New Year\u2019s, young men and women filled their diaries with worries that seem very familiar today: They found living with their parents \u201chumiliating indeed\u201d and felt \u201cqualified for nothing.\u201d Others moaned: \u201cI am twenty-five and not in love yet.\u201d Gathering over beer or cigars, they complained about how far they were from marriage, how often they switched jobs.The idea that millennials are uniquely \u201cstuck\u201d is nonsense. Young Victorians grasped for maturity as well, embarrassed by the distance between their lives and society\u2019s expectations.These Americans were born into an earthquake. During the 1800s America\u2019s population exploded from 5 million to 75 million. By 1900 nearly as many people lived in New York City as had lived in the entire country during the Revolution. The nation went from a rural backwater to an industrial behemoth \u2014 producing more than Britain, Germany and France combined \u2014 but every decade the economy crashed. America saw the kind of wild change we see today in China, and in a new society with little to stabilize it.For rootless 20-somethings, each national shock felt intimate, rattling their love lives and careers. Many young adults could not accept that their personal struggles were just ripples of a large-scale social dislocation. So each New Year\u2019s, they blamed themselves. In a Jan. 1, 1859, entry in her journal, 19-year-old Mollie Dorsey, stuck on a Nebraska homestead in the middle of a recession, castigated herself for not being \u201cany better than I was one year ago.\u201dRomance worried them above all. Today some fret about the changing institution of marriage, but we are used to such adjustments; 19th-century Americans were blindsided when the average age of marriage rose precipitously, to 26 \u2014 a level America didn\u2019t return to until 1990. In a world where life expectancy hovered below age 50, delaying marriage until 26 was revolutionary.Cities brimmed with bachelors and unmarried ladies in their mid-20s, once a rare sight. In their New Year\u2019s reflections, men and women noted that their parents had had children by their age. One typical Union Army soldier wrote home wondering, \u201cDo you think I will be married before I am thirty?\u201dThis social change brought personal turmoil, especially for young women. Marriage meant love and family, but in a society that discouraged ladies from working, young women were dependent on their husbands. Remaining single meant economic and legal instability, and the perception of childishness. When the mother of one diarist, Emily Gillespie, scolded the Midwestern farm girl by saying, \u201cyou are twenty years old and not married yet,\u201d it hardly mattered that Emily was in line with her generation.While some looked for love, others looked for jobs. Before the modern era, young people found work within family networks, laboring at home or on a farm, pausing for \u201celevenses\u201d (a late-morning whiskey break) or an afternoon nap. The industrial economy changed that.The good news was that there were more jobs; the bad news was that they were isolating and temporary. Work now meant small factories or lumber camps or railroad crews of strangers. They were monitored like machines, with pressure to increase productivity replacing the slower pace of preindustrial labor.For young people this meant chronic instability. A young man might brag about his new job one week and find himself begging for money from his father the next. Frustrated youths worried that their jobs did not reflect their age or ability: One brilliant young speaker complained about working in a cramped Philadelphia boot factory, nailing soles when he should have been climbing a soapbox.While 19th-century young adults faced many of the anxieties that trouble 23-year-olds today, they found novel solutions. The first was to move. Young men and women were notoriously transient, heading out on \u201cwander years\u201d when life at home seemed stalled. In one Wisconsin county, 90 percent of those present in 1870 were gone by 1880. Most set out with no plan, few connections and a small carpetbag of personal possessions.Another solution was to find like-minded young adults, to share, as one later put it in his memoir, their \u201cbaffling discouragements and buoyant hopes.\u201d Nineteenth-century young people were compulsive joiners. Political movements, literary societies, religious organizations, dancing clubs and even gangs proliferated. The men and women who joined cared about the stated cause, but also craved the community these groups created. They realized that while instability was inevitable, isolation was voluntary.Today\u2019s young adults are constantly rebuked for not following the life cycle popular in 1960. But a quick look at earlier eras shows just how unusual mid-20th-century young people were. A society in which people married out of high school and held the same job for 50 years is the historical outlier. Some of that era\u2019s achievements were enviable, but they were not the norm.The anxieties that 19th-century young people poured into their New Year\u2019s diary entries are more common. Americans considered young adulthood the most dangerous part of life, and struggled to find a path to maturity. Those who did best tended to accept change, not to berate themselves for breaking with tradition. Young adults might do the same today. Stop worrying about how they appear from the skewed perspective of the mid-20th century and find a new home, a new stability and a new community in the new year.An Op-Ed article on Wednesday about young people\u2019s anxieties in the 19th century misstated a diarist\u2019s surname. She was Mollie Dorsey when she wrote the diary entry quoted in the article; she was not yet known as Mollie Sanford.Jon Grinspan, a postdoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian Institution, is writing a book on young people and 19th-century American politics.

Among (many) other things, he founded the first company to sell virtual reality products. Another of his start-ups was sold to Google. As a consultant, he has had assignments with \u201cWal-Mart, Fannie Mae, major banks and hedge funds,\u201d as he notes in \u201cWho Owns the Future?\u201d But unlike most of his fellow technologists, he eventually came to feel that the rise of digital networks was no panacea.On the contrary: \u201cWhat I came away with from having access to these varied worlds was a realization that they were all remarkably similar,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe big players often gained benefits from digital networks to an amazing degree, but they were also constrained, even imprisoned, by the same dynamics.\u201d Over time, the same network efficiencies that had given them their great advantages would become the instrument of their failures. In the financial services industry, it led to the financial crisis. In the case of Wal-Mart, its adoption of technology to manage its supply chain at first reaped great benefits, but over time it cost competitors and suppliers hundreds of thousands of jobs, thus \u201cgradually impoverishing its own customer base,\u201d as Lanier put it to me. The N.S.A.? It developed computer technology that could monitor the entire world \u2014 and, in the process, lost control of the contractors it employed. As for Facebook, Google, Twitter, Amazon et al., well, in Lanier\u2019s view, it\u2019s only a matter of time before their advantages, too, disintegrate.Which leads nicely to Lanier\u2019s final big point: that the value of these new companies comes from us. \u201cInstagram isn\u2019t worth a billion dollars just because those 13 employees are extraordinary,\u201d he writes. \u201cInstead, its value comes from the millions of users who contribute to the network without being paid for it.\u201d He adds, \u201cNetworks need a great number of people to participate in them to generate significant value. But when they have them, only a small number of people get paid. This has the net effect of centralizing wealth and limiting overall economic growth.\u201d Thus, in Lanier\u2019s view, is income inequality also partly a consequence of the digital economy.Lanier\u2019s ideas raise as many questions as they answer, and he makes no pretense to having it all figured out. \u201cI know some of this will turn out to be wrong,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut I just don\u2019t know which part.\u201dStill his ideas about reformulating the economy \u2014 creating what he calls a \u201chumanistic economy\u201d \u2014 offer much food for thought. Lanier wants to create a dynamic where digital networks expand the pie rather than shrink it, and rebuild the middle class instead of destroying it. \u201cIf Google and Facebook were smart,\u201d he said, \u201cthey would want to enrich their own customers.\u201d So far, he adds, Silicon Valley has made \u201cthe stupid choice\u201d \u2014 to grow their businesses at the expense of their own customers.Lanier\u2019s message is that it can\u2019t last.

{"Headline": "House Votes to Restrict Payments for Abortions", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to impose tighter restrictions on federal payments for abortions, thrusting the issue of a woman\u2019s right to terminate a pregnancy into the polarizing politics of an election year.The bill stands no chance of being passed by the Democratic-controlled Senate. But that mattered little to members of both parties, who seemed to relish the chance to accuse their opponents of blatantly twisting the issue to their political advantage.The House vote was 227 to 188, mainly along party lines. Six Democrats voted yes, one Republican voted no and another voted present.\u201cHere we go again,\u201d said Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California. \u201cIt\u2019s another battle in the war on women.\u201d Republicans, bristling at accusations that they are hostile to women\u2019s rights, said Democrats were unfairly characterizing their motives. \u201cI will say it again,\u201d said Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, irritation apparent in her voice, \u201cwe are not attacking women\u2019s health care.\u201dExisting law like the Hyde Amendment already restricts federal financing for abortion services. But because the Hyde Amendment must be renewed every year, Republicans said their proposal would only codify what has been the law of the land.But the issue has become considerably more challenging for Republicans, both because of comments from Republican men, on and off the campaign trail, and an aggressive effort by Democrats to portray the party as anti-women.The timing of the vote was telling. Notably, the House leadership chose to bring the measure up on a day when all of Washington was consumed with President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address. Republican leaders also decided to make the bill one of their first orders of business this year, disposing of it nearly 10 months before Election Day. A senior aide to Republican leadership said it would probably be the only time an abortion-related bill would come up this year.Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, noted how the current legislation had moved through the House almost exclusively with the votes of Republican men. On the House Judiciary Committee, where the bill was approved two weeks ago, the 22 Republicans are all men. \u201cThis has been the problem for a long time: men in blue suits and red ties determining what women should do,\u201d Ms. Slaughter said.Some Republicans said on Tuesday that they would rather be talking about other things, like jobs, and problems with the Affordable Care Act.\u201cI\u2019ve always said that we ought to avoid taking on these hot-button social issues; they don\u2019t do us any good,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania. Mr. Dent voted for the abortion bill, but he noted how some of his colleagues were so ill-equipped to talk about women\u2019s health issues that the party leadership has had to advise its members how to approach the topic more delicately.\u201cHere\u2019s my suggestion for a communications strategy for some of these guys,\u201d Mr. Dent said. \u201cFour words: Shut the bleep up.\u201dRepublicans gave the bill an unremarkable title \u2014 the \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act\u201d \u2014 which they said was intended to convey an uncontroversial and popular goal. But Democrats have argued that the act is a deceptive assault on women\u2019s rights that would further restrict coverage for abortion among federal employees, low-income women and those who visit military hospitals overseas, among others.Over and over, Democrats on Tuesday used the words \u201cwar on women\u201d to describe Republicans\u2019 actions, a line of attack that was potent for them in the 2012 elections. It is a line they plan to repeat often in this year\u2019s midterm elections.But not all Democrats think that their party is well served by attacking the Republicans as anti-woman, especially with the economy foremost on voters\u2019 minds.\u201cI\u2019m a skeptic,\u201d said Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont. \u201cThe people we represent need jobs, need better incomes and want us to focus on the economy. To the extent that we get involved in issues that take us away from that, it legitimately undercuts our credibility.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In the Ghost With the Most, Drivers May Haunt the Back Seat", "Date": "2014-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Rolls-Royce Ghost Extended Wheelbase.It\u2019s a great time to sell fancy cars. At the Hilton Head Island Concours d\u2019Elegance last fall, I met a Rolls-Royce salesman who was on his way to Atlanta to deliver a Wraith to a customer. The factor that limits sales of Rollses, he told me, is the factory itself: It literally can\u2019t build them fast enough to satisfy demand. Last year, Rolls-Royce sold 3,630 cars, the most in its long history. Make Ghosts while the sun shines, as they say.Into this exuberant atmosphere sails the Ghost Extended Wheelbase, a car that seemingly contradicts its own mission. The Ghost, you see, is the sportier \u201centry level\u201d Rolls sedan, the one that you\u2019re expected to drive for yourself \u2014 as opposed to the Phantom, which might as well come straight from the factory with a chauffeur installed behind the steering wheel. The Ghost Extended Wheelbase adds 6.7 inches to the length of the standard car, resulting in a back seat with enough room for lawn bowling, board meetings and medium-scale military exercises. If you\u2019re shelling out $300,000 for a sedan the size of a Chevy Suburban, you\u2019ll probably want to ride back there, thus freeing you from the banality of driving the Rolls that you\u2019re supposed to enjoy driving. Don\u2019t worry, it all makes sense if you\u2019re really rich.That Suburban comparison, by the way, isn\u2019t just figurative. One night I parked next to a 2005 Chevrolet Suburban, and the Ghost Extended Wheelbase looked every bit as long. Later I looked up the numbers and discovered that this Ghost measures 219.3 inches from bumper to bumper, which happens to be the exact length of a 2005 Suburban. That\u2019s a whole lot of sedan.The huge Rolls flows from point to point with imperial aloofness, the body unconcerned with the petty grievances of the road. With the 6.6-liter V12 heaving out 575 pound-feet of torque at only 1,500 r.p.m., a light touch of throttle produces what might be described as dignified haste.\u00a0The 8-speed ZF transmission favors early upshifts, though how early is hard to say because the Ghost lacks a tachometer. Instead there\u2019s a gauge that speaks a language owners can understand: power in reserve.Prod deeper\u00a0into the throttle\u00a0and the 563 horsepower will let you surprise a Mustang or two with your 5,556-pound land yacht \u2014 \u201cHey, did I just get dusted by a luxury condominium?\u201dThe time it takes the regular Ghost Extended Wheelbase to cover a quarter mile \u2014 13 seconds \u2014 is not to be scoffed at, but a new V-Specification version raises the output to 593 horsepower, for those who like to throw a few extra coals on the fire. My test car started at $298,000 but rang in at $356,770 as tested, with options including \u201crear theater configuration,\u201d with screens built into the seatbacks ($6,600), natural grain leather ($4,795), black-stained ash trim ($6,825) and the Rolls-Royce monogram on all headrests ($775).There\u2019s also a $2,100 gas guzzler tax, necessitated by mileage comparable to that of a large truck: The federal economy rating is 13 miles per gallon in the city and 21 m.p.g. on the highway. Despite the fact that this is the Rolls for pragmatists, the Ghost still flaunts wildly over-the-top luxury just about everywhere you look. The power-operated rear doors are rear-hinged, for maximum drama. Teflon-coated umbrellas are hidden inside the front doors. All the wood trim in a given vehicle comes from the same tree, which helps to ensure that it all ages at the same rate. Seats and interior panels are signed by the person who created them, which sounds either charming or nefarious, depending on your world view. (\u201cThat slab of dash trim is not to my liking. Pry it off and find out who\u2019s responsible!\u201d) And yes, of course the hood ornament is power-operated. We\u2019re not savages.It\u2019s a thoroughly impressive car, the Ghost Extended Wheelbase. If this were Rolls-Royce\u2019s only sedan, I doubt many people would ask, \u201cShouldn\u2019t they make something bigger and more luxurious?\u201d And yet they do, with the Phantom lineup culminating in the Phantom Extended Wheelbase, a machine that\u2019s about a foot and a half longer than this leviathan. I suppose the Ghost is the car you buy when you make your first $10 million and the Phantom is for when you make your first $100 million. The irony is that the Ghost is actually the better car, far quicker and essentially just as luxurious. And, in the case of the Ghost Extended Wheelbase, there\u2019s an added element of versatility \u2014 it\u2019s a sport sedan when you\u2019re in the mood, a limo when you feel like outsourcing the driving duties. As an added bonus, the Ghost\u2019s relative aesthetic restraint means that it\u2019s slightly less likely to get egged by hordes of angry proles during the Great Crash of 2016. I suppose any sedan that costs $300,000 is a fundamentally irrational machine, given that you could buy a supercharged Jaguar XJ that would serve the same purpose at roughly a third of the price. But the Ghost Extended Wheelbase almost makes sense. Almost. Advertisement"}

The Blums have since 2009 run a website promoting small businesses \u2014 mechanics, real estate brokers, caterers, etc. \u2014 in the settlements generally viewed as illegal under international law, and last fall they unveiled an online boutique selling settler art. Their approach is an attempted antidote to the \u201cBoycott, Divestment and Sanctions\u201d movement that has been gaining ground lately \u2014 buy local, invest, celebrate.\u201cWe wanted to use that same tool everybody else is using against us, for us,\u201d said Mr. Blum, 35.

Further details about the settlement economy are something of a state secret: An official at a large West Bank industrial park declined to provide numbers because she did not \u201cwant to awaken any demons.\u201dSouth Africa issued regulations in 2012 requiring the labeling of settlement products, and British supermarket chains are among those that use ZIP codes to delineate items made in Israel proper from those in the West Bank. A Dutch pension fund recently withdrew funds from five Israeli banks because they do business in the settlements. David Alhayani, head of the Jordan Valley settlers\u2019 council, said recently that Europeans were shunning his farmers\u2019 herbs and vegetables, though some in Saudi Arabia and Qatar want their dates \u2014 so long as they are not labeled.Tzipi Livni and Yair Lapid, centrist Israeli ministers, have been sounding the boycott alarm. \u201cThe status quo will hit each of us in the pocket,\u201d Mr. Lapid warned this month. \u201cWe are export-oriented, and this depends on our global standing.\u201dThe Blums have not been deterred. Their operation is admittedly small bore and symbolic. The \u201cOrange Pages\u201d \u2014 the color is taken from the campaign opposing the 2005 evacuation of Gaza Strip settlements \u2014 gets 1,000 hits a day. It lists 2,000 businesses, 700 of which pay about $14 a month for more prominent play. Mrs. Blum, who is 30, said some settler leaders told her \u201cdon\u2019t promote us, just keep quiet,\u201d but that only a handful of companies had ever declined to be listed.The new art boutique has sold a dozen prints and one original, totaling $4,500. Profits are put into the Orange Pages \u2014 as Mr. Blum put it, \u201ca man from Alabama buys a painting from Hebron and enables a plumber from Shilo to get more exposure.\u201d Like many settlers, the Blums think Israel should annex the West Bank.\u201cIf you created a time machine and you went back 2,000 years, the center of Jewish life was here, it was Judea and Samaria, it wasn\u2019t Tel Aviv,\u201d Mr. Blum said, using the biblical names for the territory. \u201cIf we don\u2019t want to fight for this land \u2014 I mean fight as in living and building \u2014 we\u2019re erasing our history.\u201dMrs. Blum moved at age 5 to Efrat, a settlement south of Jerusalem. Mr. Blum grew up secular in New Jersey, and came to Israel in 2000 on the first free trip for young diaspora Jews run by Birthright. When he came back with Birthright in 2003, she was one of two Israeli volunteers greeting the plane with rugelach from the famed Marzipan bakery. He decided that day they should marry. They run the websites from their modest home, where Mrs. Blum\u2019s paintings \u2014 of an archway in Safed and a Kabbalistic interpretation of creation \u2014 adorn the walls and the children, ages 2, 4, 6 and 8, wander in and out. \u201cThe message for our children is, you see something wrong, you fix it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe saw a boycott, we see injustice, then you do something about it.

{"Headline": "Slavery as New Focus for a Game", "Date": "2014-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookIn what sounds like a joke by a stand-up comic \u2014 Chris Rock? Dave Chappelle? \u2014 with a fondness for PlayStation, the greatest black heroine in the history of video games was forced to live for more than a year in the ghetto of Sony\u2019s faltering hand-held console, the Vita.This month, however, Aveline de Grandpr\u00e9, a Creole who is the daughter of a Frenchman and an African woman, has been granted the wider audience she deserves. The game she stars in, Assassin\u2019s Creed: Liberation, has been given a high-definition makeover as a downloadable title for far more popular platforms: the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and personal computers. In a further twist to the cruel joke that has been played on Aveline, Assassin\u2019s Creed: Liberation is not very good, even in its new form. Its setting \u2014 18th-century New Orleans and the surrounding bayou \u2014 is not as fully realized or as beautiful as the historical backdrops (Renaissance Italy, the Golden Age of Caribbean piracy) for other Assassin\u2019s Creed games with larger development teams and bigger budgets. Its story is convoluted in ways that are typical for the series (a Dan Brown approach to history that involves secret societies that feud and murder across centuries) and atypical (the plot and characters are inscrutable, even for an Assassin\u2019s Creed game). The acting is poor. Many of the missions that Aveline is asked to carry out are dull.And yet the unblinking focus on slavery in the Americas makes the game remarkable, nonetheless. In particular, it deftly uses the mechanics of play to interpret Aveline\u2019s relationship to the culture of colonial New Orleans under French and Spanish rule. In the opening sequence, Aveline, as a young girl, stumbles onto a slave market and mistakes a white woman for her mother. Later, she infiltrates plantations to gather intelligence from enslaved people. She incites slave riots. She fights an overseer, disarms him of his whip and then uses it against other would-be masters. No game I\u2019ve played deals this directly with the history and imagery of slavery in the New World, much less does it with sensitivity and intelligence.Black Flag does give its white protagonist a black first mate, Ad\u00e9wal\u00e9, who stars in an expansion to the game, called Freedom Cry, that involves liberating slaves in Haiti. But the developers of the core game also acknowledge their soft-pedaling of the issue in a small joke, a parenthetical footnote to a description of a plantation in Kingston, Jamaica. \u201cDo we have to mention slave trading?\u201d the note reads, part of a fictional conversation between two of the game\u2019s developers. \u201cIt\u2019s such a downer.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never played as a black video game character who\u2019s made me feel like he was cool,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, whose parents were born in Haiti, wrote almost two years ago in a Kotaku post headlined \u201cCome On, Video Games, Let\u2019s See Some Black People I\u2019m Not Embarrassed By.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Car Sales Ended Year on High Note, Sort Of", "Date": "2014-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 European car sales ended 2013 on a strong note, raising hopes of a market rebound, despite another year of contraction.The annual decline of 1.7 percent last year was much smaller than analysts had anticipated after a dismal start, and the December gain of 13.3 percent from a year earlier was the biggest monthly increase since 2009.Car sales have bounced back in the United States since the financial crisis and remained strong in China, but Europe has been battered by a punishingly high jobless rate. That rate is a hangover from the euro zone sovereign debt crisis, and a cultural shift has left young people less interested in driving than their parents\u2019 generation was.\u201cWe believe the market bottomed last year and the worst is behind us,\u201d said Peter Fuss, of the Ernst & Young Global Automotive Center in Frankfurt. He estimated that sales this year would rise by as much as 4 percent.Consumer confidence is improving, but remains weak, he said. And he pointed out that car sales had received significant \u201cartificial\u201d support, including from manufacturer discounts and trade-in incentives for older cars in Spain. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait for 2015 to see what true demand is,\u201d he said.Even with a rebound in 2014, \u201cthe crisis will still be felt for a long time,\u201d Carlos Da Silva, an analyst at IHS, wrote in a research note. \u201cTo put it directly, we do not think that the E.U. market will return to its 2007 peak ... ever.\u201dThe association\u2019s data showed that Volkswagen, the largest European automaker, managed to hold the line with a slight decline in 2013, thanks to strong sales of its Seat and Skoda brands.Its French rival, Renault, managed a small increase in sales, thanks to the runaway performance of its low-cost Dacia brand, which posted a 23.3 percent gain in 2013 \u2014 by far the biggest increase of any brand in Europe.Other strong gains were posted by Mazda and Jaguar, while Chevrolet and Lexus had among the steeper declines.General Motors and Ford Motor had another tough year in Europe, even as their business improved in the United States and in other overseas markets. Fiat, the Italian automaker that is taking full ownership of Chrysler, posted a 7.1 percent decline.There was significant variation between markets, as well. Britain\u2019s was the strongest of the major European Union nations, growing nearly 11 percent in 2013, but that had more to do with easy financing terms than the country\u2019s relatively strong economy. Spain, despite suffering from depression-level unemployment, managed 3.3 percent growth on the basis of government-sponsored trade-in incentives. Sales in Germany, the engine of the European economy, slid 4.2 percent.BMW\u2019s mainstay premium lineup was almost unchanged, but its overall sales dropped as its Mini brand faltered.Mr. Fuss said a crucial question in the new year would be whether President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s new economic policy initiatives would bring down the French jobless rate and reinvigorate a market that shrank by 5.7 percent in 2013.Philippe Houchois, head of European auto industry research at UBS in London, said it was hard to say just how much of the year-end demand reflected artificial support and how much was real demand.\u201cWe don\u2019t really know how healthy the market is,\u201d Mr. Houchois said. But with annual sales 24 percent below the 2007 peak, he added, \u201cit has probably shrunk enough.\u201dMr. Houchois said that the biggest potential recovery was in countries like Spain and Italy that had been particularly hurt by the financial and sovereign debt crises and where demand had fallen the most. If they bounce back, he noted, that would benefit companies like Renault and Peugeot that sell the types of cars that are most popular there.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Banking Regulators Agree to Ease Capital Rule", "Date": "2014-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Global banking regulators agreed on Sunday to ease a new rule, meant to rein in risky balance sheets starting in 2018, in an effort to avoid tightening financing for the world\u2019s economy.The decision by the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision is the latest sign of how regulators have become more willing to accommodate banks as the focus switches to helping economies recover.The relief to lenders may, however, be temporary as the regulators signaled there is still no agreement on the final level of the new leverage ratio, which measures how much capital a bank must hold against its loans and other assets.The ratio was initially set at 3 percent of bank capital, but regulators from the United States, Britain and elsewhere are pushing for a higher number.The ratio acts as a backstop to a lender\u2019s core risk-weighted capital requirements. A ratio of 3 percent means a bank must hold capital equivalent to 3 percent of its total assets.The rule is part of the Basel III accord endorsed by world leaders in response to the 2007-09 financial crisis, which forced taxpayers to bail out undercapitalized and failing banks.On Sunday, the Basel Committee\u2019s oversight body, which is led by the European Central Bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, backed key changes to the leverage ratio. \u201cThe final calibration, and any further adjustments to the definition, will be completed by 2017,\u201d the group said in a statement after its meeting in Basel, Switzerland.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Talk of Tighter Restrictions on Fishing Raises Questions", "Date": "2014-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneCatching spotted sea trout and flounder along the Gulf Coast is more than just a point of pride for outdoorsmen in Texas. The pastime attracts sporting fishermen from around the world, part of a renowned saltwater recreational fishing industry that adds $2 billion to the Texas economy each year. So the mere suggestion of new restrictions being placed on the saltwater fish has generated heated discussion along the coast \u2014 with some claiming that small-time fishermen will be pushed out to make way for richer anglers.\u201cIt\u2019s a big emotional deal,\u201d said Andrew Sansom, who led the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department from 1990 to 2001 and is now executive director of the Meadows Center for Water and the Environment at Texas State University. (The Texas State University System is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.) Flounder and spotted trout have been the subject of strict regulation for 30 years, when their decimated populations prompted state officials to all but ban their commercial harvest. Only a few dozen commercial licenses to fish flounder exist today.Last week, officials with the Parks and Wildlife Department discussed the possibility of imposing additional restrictions on the two fish, which are among the most sought after in Texas. In November, during flounders\u2019 spawning season, fishermen can catch only two fish per day. The department is considering lengthening that period of such a low \u201cbag limit,\u201d or maximum allowable catch. In addition, the bag limit for spotted trout may be reduced to 5 from 10 year-round. \u201cIt\u2019s really about what we call helping the bag distribution, trying to get people to be able to harvest more fish,\u201d a statistician for the department, Jeremy Leitz, said. He said that when it came to trout, \u201cnot many people catch the current bag limit at 10.\u201d Not everyone agrees. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to show that changing these bag limits has increased the pleasure, has increased the numbers, increased anything,\u201d said Johnny Valentino, whose family manages a fishing camp on Galveston Bay that is popular with saltwater trout anglers. \u201cIt\u2019s all about \u2018trophy trout\u2019 fishing,\u201d he added, referring to putting sport fishermen who want to catch the biggest fish ahead of anglers who just want to enjoy the sport and put some fresh food on the table. Strong opposition to new regulations has been voiced from around Galveston Bay. That is understandable, given that the bay is one of the most successful spots for landing trout, said Everett Johnson, a retired fishing guide who is now the editor and publisher of the Texas Saltwater Fishing Magazine. \u201cThey have substantially more freshwater inflow by virtue of their geography,\u201d Mr. Johnson said of Galveston Bay. \u201cTrout do better in fresher water,\u201d so anglers there are the most likely to see no need for limiting an already-stellar catch. But Galveston Bay might also represent a culture of fishing that has been slowly disappearing \u2014 the angler who fishes for food, Mr. Sansom said. Putting limits on their catch \u201cis a cultural assault.\u201d Mr. Sansom agrees that such anglers would be hurt by additional regulation. But the threat to saltwater fish in Texas from severe weather and increasingly advanced and better fishing techniques is real, he said, and regulators should not wait until it is too late to protect them. \u201cRemember that all of these animals have to live in an environment that sustains them,\u201d Mr. Sansom said. \u201cYou can\u2019t affect the climate, and the state hasn\u2019t been very forthcoming in setting rigorous inflow standards\u201d for freshwater, so lowering the bag limit is \u201cwhat you\u2019re left with.\u201dnsatija@texastribune.org Advertisement"}

Hundreds of thousands of people who lost work, and many young people entering the work force, are finding that their skills are ill suited to a huge crop of innovation-based jobs springing up across the Continent.\u201cIn all countries, there is an expectation that many of the new jobs created will be in the knowledge-intensive economy,\u201d said Glenda Quintini, a senior labor economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \u201cBut we are seeing a worrisome skills mismatch that means a large number of unemployed people are not well prepared for the pool of jobs opening up.\u201dThe International Labor Organization went further, warning that the gap might contribute to extended spells of unemployment and might reduce the effectiveness of policy interventions to stimulate growth. In the United States, the phenomenon has also helped contribute to a rise in long-term joblessness, the organization said.Around two million job vacancies around the European Union are languishing unfilled, about the same number as in 2010, in sectors ranging from hotel work to computer programming, according to Eurostat, the statistics office of the European Union.Governments and companies around Europe are fast-tracking efforts to retrain the unemployed for a burst of technology-related jobs. They are also stepping up campaigns to lure university students to mathematics, engineering and science in place of popular courses in the humanities and social sciences.In Ireland, the government introduced a series of retraining and higher-education programs and sought to polish the allure of mathematics degrees as alarm bells sounded over the issue a couple of years ago. At the time, unemployment was around 14 percent after an economic collapse that destroyed jobs in the construction sector, which had employed around a quarter of the young men in the country.Multinational technology and social media companies kept investing, lured by Ireland\u2019s ultralow 12.5 percent corporate tax rate and an English-speaking work force. But many have been forced to look outside the country for employees with the right skills, even with 282,900 unemployed in Ireland and a jobless rate of around 12.5 percent.The issue peaked last summer, when PayPal\u2019s chief executive in Ireland, Louise Phelan, stoked controversy by acknowledging that the company had recruited from 19 other countries for 500 positions in its operations center in Dundalk because of a lack of foreign-language skills among Irish nationals. This summer, Fujitsu, which employs 800 people in Ireland, revealed that it had had to hire most of its Ph.D.-level experts from abroad.Part of the problem for all countries, not only Ireland, was that technology-related university training lost appeal after the dot-com bust in the early 2000s, said Regina Moran, the executive director of Fujitsu in Ireland. In Ireland, people flocked to construction or tourism work, which blossomed in the middle of the decade.Ian Sharpe was one of them. He spent nearly 15 years working in the hotel industry until Ireland\u2019s banking crisis strangled the Celtic Tiger and left him jobless in 2010. He languished on benefits as he tried fruitlessly to find new work.But last year he latched on to back-to-work programs that the government had introduced with businesses.Recently, 182 candidates \u2014 most of them unemployed, with backgrounds in fields including farming, construction and even astrophysics \u2014 went through retraining. One company, VMware, hired 82 people, and other companies hired nearly everyone else \u2014 including Mr. Sharpe.On a recent weekday, he was huddled with a team of technicians in the Cork-based offices of VCE, a joint venture between VMware, Cisco, EMC and Intel that provides cloud and virtualization software and services.After six months as an intern, he was hired full time to help manage a data center, with an annual salary of around 30,000 euros, or about $40,000 \u2014 about what he was making as a hotel manager.The initiatives are not without flaws. For example, as part of the JobBridge internship program, people continue to collect unemployment and receive a modest \u20ac50 stipend per week. For many, that barely covers transportation and food. Stories have littered the Irish press of abuses by companies in the program, such as giving interns either menial tasks or fully fledged professional work with no pay, and with no job ultimately materializing.Such talk was so widespread that Mr. Sharpe said that people had urged him not to enter the program. But he wanted to avoid the fate of a number of his friends who had fallen into a rut, where the longer they were unemployed, the less likely they were to get back into the job market.\u201cI know people who had to get medication for being depressed, because they don\u2019t see anything coming,\u201d he said.He now has an air of hope. \u201cI\u2019ve gone from someone who had never been professionally involved in I.T. to getting an engineering position just nine months later,\u201d Mr. Sharpe said.\u201cYou can see where you\u2019re going,\u201d he added. \u201cFinally, there\u2019s something to aim for.\u201dAn article on Saturday about a shortage of skilled workers in Ireland to fill that country\u2019s growing number of technology jobs misstated the number of unemployed in Ireland. According to the Central Statistics Office, the figure stood at 282,900 in the third quarter of 2013, not 391,500.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "IBM Is Betting That Watson Can Earn Its Keep", "Date": "2014-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIBM wants to build a large and profitable business from what has mostly been a triumph of computing bragging rights, so it is giving Watson $1 billion and a nice office.So far, however, Watson has not delivered a lot of revenue for IBM.The company says a new division, the Watson Business Group, will have 2,500 employees, including programmers, researchers and experts in various industries. It will be located near the East Village in New York City, and about $100 million of the group\u2019s funding will be for venture investments related to Watson\u2019s so-called data analysis and recommendation technology.IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., appears to be betting that Watson was simply a little ahead of its time, and that its kind of data analysis has a future on a par with computer hardware, software and services, IBM\u2019s other major groups. \u201cWe believe a major shift is underway\u201d in the computing business, Virginia M. Rometty, IBM\u2019s chief executive, said in remarks prepared for a formal announcement on Thursday. \u201cWatson does more than find the needle in the haystack. It understands the haystack. It understands context.\u201dWatson, she added, \u201clearns from its own experiences and from our interactions with it \u2014 and as it does, it keeps getting smarter. Its judgments keep getting better.\u201d IBM has collaborated with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the insurer WellPoint and the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University on ways to teach and practice medicine. Commercially, companies like Nielsen and DBS Bank have worked with Watson. So far, however, revenue from all these efforts has been relatively slight.\u201cWhat we showed on \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 was just the tip,\u201d Mr. Rhodin said. \u201cThis is a platform that can understand questions, reason, use math and help make decisions.\u201dIBM\u2019s elevation of Watson is the biggest illustration yet of the technology industry\u2019s faith that so-called Big Data holds promise for the economy \u2014 and the failure so far to meet that promise.Likewise, IBM will have to sharpen its focus and what it delivers, said Henry D. Morris, an analyst at the consulting company IDC. \u201cBig Data by itself isn\u2019t value, it has to deliver recommendations about what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to show people not just analysis, but action. They understand that there are challenges ahead.\u201dAnother element that has yet to be settled is how other recent IBM initiatives will cohere with the Watson Group. Under IBM\u2019s previous chief, Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM had initiatives like Smarter Planet, which involved deploying lots of sensors, computers and data-analysis software to do things like help cities work more efficiently.IBM may also have to adjust some of its professional relationships. Currently, the company is a partner with SAP of Germany in sales of HANA, SAP\u2019s fast-growing data-analysis tool.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "World Bank Is Expecting Widespread (if Still Possibly Turbulent) Growth for 2014", "Date": "2014-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After years of recession, financial crisis, fiscal wars and a patchwork recovery, there are relatively few dark clouds on the horizon for the global economy.That is the conclusion of the World Bank\u2019s latest global growth forecast, released on Tuesday. The bank\u2019s economists expect growth over all to increase from 2.4 percent last year to 3.2 percent in 2014, and to maintain that level for the next two years.\u201cThe performance of advanced economies is gaining momentum, and this should support stronger growth in developing countries,\u201d Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, said in a statement.Indeed, in the latest sign that even battered Europe is on the mend, Eurostat reported on Tuesday that factories in the euro zone ramped up output in November after two months of decline. Industrial production rose 1.8 percent from October, which itself was revised upward to show a smaller monthly drop.Still, it is not necessarily all clear sailing ahead. The Federal Reserve\u2019s slow retrenchment of its economic stimulus campaign \u2014 which served to push down interest rates the world over \u2014 poses one of the most significant risks for the global economy this year, the bank said.Some lower-income economies may suffer from reduced inflows of investment if interest rates rise, the bank warned, as it has for months. That could lead to defaults and economic turbulence. Even so, the bank\u2019s economists do not see the Fed\u2019s so-called tapering as pushing global growth off its path.\u201cWhatever negative effect the taper might have, that\u2019s going to be offset by the stronger growth in high-income countries,\u201d Andrew Burns, the lead author of the report, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not a doom-and-gloom scenario.\u201dThe bank expects that developing economies will grow in 2014 by what would be a relatively moderate pace for them of 5.3 percent. That would be significantly slower than in the boom years that preceded the global recession. But the bank\u2019s economists said they believed that slower growth might be healthier and more stable, driven by improving economic fundamentals rather than cheap money and financial bubbles.The emerging-market giants China and India should see stronger growth this year, the bank said. But concerns remain: India has struggled with inflation and currency depreciation, and China with a vulnerable banking sector and overinvestment. \u201cIt is important to avoid policy stasis so that the green shoots don\u2019t turn into brown stubble,\u201d said Kaushik Basu, the bank\u2019s chief economist.This year, global momentum should benefit from a growing United States, a bottomed-out Europe and a revitalized Japan, the report said.The beleaguered euro area seems to have turned a corner, the report said, and policy and financial uncertainty in the region has significantly eased. Ireland, Portugal and Spain have started growing again, and the pace of contraction seems to have slowed in Greece and Italy.The monthly Eurostat report showed that Ireland, which has just exited its bailout program, led all European Union nations, with a sharp 11.7 percent gain in industrial production in November, bouncing back from a 6.3 decline in the previous month. Germany, the largest European economy, reported a rise of 2.4 percent, while France managed a gain of 1.4 percent.The entire European Union, which includes 11 countries beyond the 17 nations that shared the euro last year, reported a 1.5 percent increase in industrial output in November, putting it 3 percent ahead of the same month a year earlier.In the United States, federal budget cuts should have a smaller effect on growth in the future, the bank said. And uncertainty stemming from Washington, capped last fall when the federal government shut down over a budget impasse, should pose less of a problem, too.The bank expects growth in the United States of about 2.8 percent in 2014, up from 1.8 percent last year.And even Japan has been jolted out of its long slump by aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus in Japan \u2014 often called \u201cAbenomics,\u201d after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \u2014 that is helping bring more balance to the global economy.\u201cThe high-income countries are growing,\u201d Mr. Burns said. \u201cFor the first time in five years, we have two engines at the head of the train of global growth.\u201dDavid Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Enemies of Mexican Drug Gangs Pose a Security Challenge", "Date": "2014-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The scenes are incongruous. Inside the heavily guarded colonial state government building in Michoac\u00e1n on Monday, a solemn lineup of officials vowed that the federal government would restore authority to a region that has descended into lawlessness.But a couple of hundred miles away, in Michoac\u00e1n\u2019s agricultural lowlands, pickup trucks filled with armed men calling themselves self-defense forces have been careening down country roads for the past week, advancing on towns encircling the region\u2019s main city, Apatzing\u00e1n. They have promised to seize the city, the stronghold of the Knights Templar, the state\u2019s powerful drug gang.Security analysts have said, however, that these self-defense forces themselves are murky and may even include members of other gangs. In Morelia, the capital of Michoac\u00e1n, the Mexican interior minister, Miguel \u00c1ngel Osorio Chong, said Monday that the federal government would take charge of security in the \u201cTierra Caliente,\u201d the region around Apatzing\u00e1n. \u201cRest assured that we will contain the violence in Michoac\u00e1n,\u201d he said, flanked by the secretary of defense and the state governor, who had conceded that the state and local police could not re-establish order.He also called on the vigilantes to disperse and go home, promising that federal institutions would take charge.Over the last several days, the government has been sending more and more federal troops and police into the state, in the western part of the country.But Hip\u00f3lito Mora, one of the leaders of the self-defense groups, told the local news media that first the government must arrest the leaders of the Knights Templar. \u201cWe will hold out,\u201d Mr. Mora told the newspaper El Universal on Monday. \u201cI agree that one day we will have to lay down our weapons, and I would love to go back to work.\u201d He added, \u201cBut the government should recognize that this is their failing.\u201dA year ago, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto planned to steer public attention away from the campaign against the narcotics rings, which had consumed his predecessor, President Felipe Calder\u00f3n. Beyond a promise to place more attention on social issues and work toward withdrawing the military from the drug war, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto barely mentioned the issue.Yet in Michoac\u00e1n, the state where Mr. Calder\u00f3n first escalated Mexico\u2019s drug war seven years ago, vigilantes began organizing to confront the cartels. Parts of the state \u2014 which have a long history of rebellion against central authority \u2014 seem to be in the control of a combustible mix of armed groups, and it is unclear where they come from and where their loyalties lie.\u201cThe complexity of the problem lies in the fact that no one knows who is involved in the conflict anymore,\u201d said Esteban Barrag\u00e1n, a professor at the Center for Rural Studies at the College of Michoac\u00e1n in Zamora. \u201cWho is a genuine vigilante, and who is a member of the Knights Templar cartel or who is just taking advantage of the chaotic situation for a personal vendetta?\u201dMr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto first sent troops to Michoac\u00e1n last May to battle drug violence, and in November the Navy took over operations at the Pacific port of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, where the Knights Templar had established control.\u201cTierra Caliente has become a no man\u2019s land full of personal vendettas, serial kidnappings, forced disappearances, and murders that come and go unnoticed, every day,\u201d Mr. Barrag\u00e1n said. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s \u201cpromises not to militarize have fallen by the wayside,\u201d said Bruce M. Bagley, a professor at the University of Miami\u2019s department of international studies. \u201cThis requires troops, firepower, resources and sustained attention despite what Pe\u00f1a Nieto says about not wanting to militarize any further.\u201dMr. Bagley said the vigilante groups had emerged to fill the \u201cvacuum or void in which citizen security is so precarious\u201d that any armed group can step in.And he said there were \u201crumors swirling\u201d that the vigilantes were connected to the Sinaloa Cartel. \u201cIt is my firm suspicion that there is a struggle over turf, territory and trafficking,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think we could explain how they could obtain their level of firepower so quickly.\u201dBut vigilante leaders have repeatedly argued that they are merely trying to defend their communities.

{"Headline": "Britain's Poles Are Paying Their Way", "Date": "2014-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 \u201cYou are not from here,\u201d I heard during a recent visit to my hometown, Wroclaw, in Poland, while I was out for a drink one evening with friends. \u201cWhat do you mean? I was born here,\u201d I said, surprised.\u201cYou speak Polish,\u201d said my interlocutor, thoughtfully, \u201cbut there\u2019s something strange about you, something different.\u201dIt left me wondering if I was in danger of becoming an immigrant in my own country. Or even whether I would discover \u2014 back home in London \u2014 that I wasn\u2019t really Polish anymore.For migrants everywhere, the question of belonging is often fraught, sometimes vexing. Like many Poles, I am dismayed by recent remarks about immigration from Britain\u2019s prime minister, David Cameron. Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union meant that restrictions on the free movement of workers from the newer member states Bulgaria and Romania were lifted on Jan. 1. In response, Mr. Cameron introduced a series of measures \u2014 with rhetoric to match \u2014 aimed at discouraging a fresh round of immigration.\u201cThe hard-working British public are rightly concerned that migrants do not come here to exploit our public services and our benefits system,\u201d he said last month. The theme continued, when the prime minister told the BBC last week: \u201cThere are other European countries who, like me, think it\u2019s wrong that someone from Poland who comes here, who works hard \u2014 and I am absolutely all in favor of that \u2014 but I don\u2019t think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in Poland.\u201dWith the barbarian hordes from Bulgaria and Romania still massing at the border, it seems that Britain\u2019s Polish community is a convenient stand-in for Mr. Cameron\u2019s populist turn. His words drew a series of stinging ripostes. He received a letter of remonstration from Poland\u2019s former prime minister, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, and a warning from our former president, Lech Walesa, that Britain was acting \u201cirrationally and shortsightedly.\u201d Our ambassador to London, Witold Sobkow, published an article protesting that \u201cthere is no need to single out, to stigmatize Poles,\u201d who come to Britain \u201cto work hard, not to abuse the system or grab the benefits.\u201dI began to wonder where this sudden hostility toward immigrants in Mr. Cameron\u2019s words came from. My British partner, of Jamaican parents who arrived in Britain in the 1960s, said angrily: \u201cEverybody is an immigrant here. It\u2019s an island for God\u2019s sakes.\u201dBack in 2003, I relocated to London for love, rather than the promise of earning more money than I could make in Poland. In that respect, perhaps, I was unrepresentative of the majority of Poles who immigrated after Poland joined the European Union in 2004, yet I took my part in what has become Britain\u2019s second largest immigrant group (after Indians). Recent data from the Office for National Statistics reveals that 521,000 Poles now live here.During the first few years, I did not spend much time with other Poles in London. I was enthralled by the cultural diversity. My partner was right: In London, the most ethnically diverse city in Britain, 37 percent of residents were born abroad; more than 300 languages are spoken.For middle-class Britons, the Polish influx was generally welcome. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to learn that the Camerons themselves had employed a proverbial \u201cPolish plumber\u201d \u2014 and marveled at the quick work and modest charge. But it is no secret that the post-2004 immigration did, in some places, have an impact on low-paying jobs, driving hourly rates down, especially in industries like construction or in the service sector. The situation has gotten only worse since the recession.\u201cYou see a truck with immigrants arriving and they will work for 5 pounds an hour, with no experience or papers. What am I to do?\u201d asked a British friend who is a certified carpenter yet struggles to find enough work.With the British economy still striving for recovery, the complex issue of immigration for such a small island will inevitably worry many. If I were the prime minister, I would be concerned, too. It\u2019s no secret that Mr. Cameron\u2019s Conservative Party faces a tough fight before the 2015 general election. The surge of support for the right-wing populist U.K. Independence Party is surely on Mr. Cameron\u2019s mind. What better way to win back lost voters than to demonize immigrants \u2014 even if that means conveniently putting aside the facts.According to the migration research unit of University College London, \u201cthe recent immigrants were 45 percent less likely to receive state benefits or tax credits than U.K. natives over the period 2000-11.\u201d So much for benefit-grabbing Poles. People from the European Economic Area also pay about 34 percent more in taxes than they receive in benefits and have made a staggering net contribution of \u00a325 billion ($41 billion) to Britain\u2019s public finances.Data provided by the London School of Economics has also revealed that \u201cimmigrants are younger and better educated than their U.K.-born counterparts.\u201d That ought to come as a relief to Mr. Cameron \u2014 considering the problem Britain faces of finding the future tax revenues to support an aging population.Of course, every country has its right to control its borders and the flow of immigration. But inciting fear about immigrants is a cheap, and scary, practice. Mr. Cameron should beware the damage it will do to Britain and its international standing.One evening recently, I called my parents on Skype.\u201cYou know, you can always come back,\u201d my mother said, hoping I would change my mind. We\u2019ve had this conversation many times over the last 10 years, but this time it seemed different.\u201cLondon is my home, Mum,\u201d I said, \u201cwhatever the politicians want us to think.\u201dBy \u201cus,\u201d I meant other immigrants. And, as usual, we left it at that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deadly Attack at Kabul Restaurant Hints at Changing Climate for Foreigners ", "Date": "2014-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 As country director for the International Monetary Fund, Wabel Abdallah spent years navigating the shoals of scandal in Afghanistan\u2019s financial sector. Vadim Nazarov, a top political officer at the United Nations, dedicated himself over the past nine years to looking for a peaceful solution to the Afghan war. Dhamender Singh Phangurha, a British candidate in the coming elections for the European Parliament, was here on a consulting contract.All three happened to be dining Friday at a popular Lebanese restaurant in downtown Kabul, where they were among 21 people killed in an attack for which the Taliban has claimed responsibility. Among the foreigners here, now roughly a few thousand, the attack underscored a shifting reality as the war winds down: life for international workers may be becoming more dangerous and circumscribed.For years, foreigners have enjoyed relatively unrestricted activity in the capital, including access to a handful of Western-style restaurants and weekly parties brimming with music and alcohol. Though attacks were common enough, they rarely targeted Western civilians, and the danger could be ignored as the presence of the Western military coalition persevered and even expanded. Kabul during the Afghan war never grew as violent as Baghdad during the Iraq war. But as the coalition\u2019s gradual withdrawal becomes more apparent with each passing month, it has grown harder to dismiss the obvious vulnerabilities of life here. While the insurgents have largely focused their anger on military installations and government institutions, the attack on the restaurant, Taverna du Liban, a mainstay of the Kabul social scene that catered mainly to foreigners but also to well-to-do Afghans, showed a frightening willingness by the insurgents to strike noncombatants and civilian targets.Western officials questioned the Taliban\u2019s stated motive for the coordinated attack, which would have required extensive planning but occurred just two days after the airstrike. A suicide bomber cleared a path for two gunmen who stormed in and fired on diners, the police said.Apparently, the only people who escaped were local employees of the restaurant, some of whom jumped to safety from the building\u2019s roof. The rest were shot by the two gunmen, who made their way through the restaurant armed with AK-47s, firing on a crowd of patrons stunned by the initial explosion.President Hamid Karzai, whose relationship with the Americans has been strained recently by negotiations over a long-term security contract, expressed sympathy for the victims of the attack but also seemed to use Wednesday\u2019s airstrike to criticize his NATO allies over the issue of civilian casualties.\u201cThe war on terror will bear fruit when victims and terrorists are distinguished from each other and the elements of terror are fought against,\u201d said Mr. Karzai, who appointed a committee to investigate the civilian casualties from the airstrike. \u201cIf NATO, led by the United States, wants to be the Afghan people\u2019s ally, they should target terrorism.\u201dAn American military official said that the airstrike had been called in by Afghan and American forces who were under fire from Taliban fighters. \u201cThe operation was requested by the Afghans and approved by the Afghans,\u201d the official said.It is too early to tell whether life in Kabul will permanently change. Often after similar attacks, enough time passes that the worst is forgotten and a semblance of normality returns. But by Saturday morning, practically every international organization in Afghanistan, including the United Nations, was re-examining its safety policies.Most have tightened security, clamping down on the number of restaurants and guesthouses their staff members can visit and limiting approved social activities. United Nations officials, meeting privately, said they would also review approved locations. Still, senior officials vowed not to adopt a bunker mentality in response to the attack, which claimed the lives of four of its personnel, including two women from the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund.\u201cNot ducking under our covers is not the same as being out in the open and living in Afghanistan like we do everywhere else in the world,\u201d said a European official, who asked not to be identified while discussing security precautions. \u201cThere are dinners I think people are probably going to skip. How much do you lose? Can we measure that? I don\u2019t know.\u201dNews organizations, too, are likely to endure temporary restrictions on social events, at least until it becomes clearer whether the attack was an isolated episode or the beginning of a new reality for foreigners living in Kabul. That, in some respects, is most worrisome to many involved in the worlds of diplomacy, aid and the media. The more such attacks occur, the less free they are to interact with the population they work with.Restrictive measures have already been in place at a number of embassies in Kabul, including those of the United States and Britain. Their security requirements often keep diplomats from leaving their heavily fortified compounds, even to visit programs they are funding. The attack in some respects vindicates a policy that has been criticized for being too cautious.In some ways, social life in Kabul has tracked the war itself.In the early years, Western civilians were a small presence in Kabul. Even American soldiers were left relatively unharmed \u2014 troops based at Bagram Air Base north of Kabul, for instance, used to drive to the city for a break from military life. As recently as 2010, top generals with the NATO-led coalition would sometimes swap their uniforms for khakis and button-down shirts and head to dinner at restaurants in Kabul, including Taverna. But the mood in Afghanistan was already shifting by then. The American surge in 2009, which injected billions of dollars into the local economy, drew thousands of new foreign civilians to Kabul. Local attitudes began to change. For Afghans, the Westerners in Kabul went from being an occasional nuisance \u2014 some drove too aggressively, others drank too publicly \u2014 to being a daily reminder of a war and an occupation that they resented. The Taliban, meanwhile, were stepping up their campaign against coalition forces and the civilian officials tied to the mission.But apart from an attack in early 2011 on a Kabul supermarket that catered to Westerners, there were few other obvious attempts to attack foreigners in the capital in recent history. Most assumed that as long as they stayed out of the vast rural areas controlled by the Taliban, the insurgents would leave them alone. The uncertainty now clouding their efforts to remain safe but engaged is perhaps most clearly illustrated by the deaths of Mr. Abdallah and Mr. Nazarov, both of whom had dedicated years to the country.

{"Headline": "Do Not Adjust Your Set: Super Bowl Snow May Be Real", "Date": "2014-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor months, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell has urged football fans to \u201cembrace the cold\u201d and has all but dared the weather gods to make it snow on Super Bowl Sunday.Goodell may get his wish, at least according to the 10-day forecasts released Friday ahead of the game on Feb. 2, which is also Groundhog Day.While hedging their bets because a lot can change, meteorologists say that the New York metropolitan area will probably endure freezing temperatures nearly every day through game day and that several storms may bring some snow, including during the game.\u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science: You have cold air, you have increased chance of snow,\u201d said Bernie Rayno, a senior meteorologist at Accuweather.com. \u201cThis will be the most talked-about Super Bowl weather. It\u2019s going to be a very busy week for meteorologists across the country.\u201dThe N.F.L. and businesses across the New York area are hoping it is a busy week for them, too. Hotels, restaurants, bars, shops, theaters and tourist venues are banking on hundreds of thousands of visitors eating, drinking and taking in the football-related festivities in their establishments.The weather will play a role in determining how often visitors leave their homes and hotels and spend freely, or stay in their rooms or on their barstools to keep warm and dry.And how fans behave in New York and New Jersey could help determine whether N.F.L. owners decide to host the Super Bowl outdoors in another cold-weather climate like Boston, Chicago or Denver. The N.F.L. is prepared to play the game on another day if the weather is so bad that fans cannot get to MetLife Stadium on Feb. 2 and local airports are closed. For now, moving the game to Monday appears to be the best worst-case scenario because moving it to Friday or Saturday would potentially shut out fans who had not yet arrived in New York.Either way, the league \u2014 mindful that television ratings would fall dramatically if the game were played on Monday instead of Sunday \u2014 would do that only if an extreme storm hit the region.\u201cIf the field is playable, they will play because there are 100 million viewers at home,\u201d said Rick Gentile, who teaches sports business at Seton Hall and used to work at CBS Sports. \u201cThere\u2019s no way they\u2019re going to want to move this game.\u201dFew meteorologists predict a blizzard that would significantly disrupt traffic at airports, train stations and on highways in the area. But they said snow might fall this weekend, on Monday, midweek and into the next weekend.All this is in keeping with the seasonal patterns that show the period between mid-January and mid-February is the coldest time of the year and the most prone to winter storms.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a pattern that shows pure cold, then frigid, then slight moderation with the possibility of snow on Sunday,\u201d Feb. 2, said Irv Gikofsky, who is known as Mr. G to television viewers in the New York area.When N.F.L. owners voted in 2010 to hold the Super Bowl in New Jersey, they no doubt calculated that while it was bound to be cold, the game was only one day during what is frequently the coldest stretch of the year, and the odds of a snowstorm hitting on that one day were extremely remote.But throughout the years, the Super Bowl has evolved from a game into a weeklong football industry convention and fanfest that cities fight to host. In Dallas in 2011, an ice storm on the Monday night before the Super Bowl put a damper on travel in the area, no doubt hurting businesses.For that reason, the impression of whether this year\u2019s Super Bowl is a triumph will have as much to do with how freely fans spend in New York and New Jersey as it will with the weather at kickoff.\u201cIf it\u2019s 5 degrees and snowing, fans are not going to be out on Broadway,\u201d said Glenn Gerstner, chairman of the Division of Sport Management at St. John\u2019s.Still, the economy in the New York area is large enough that any dip in spending would not be a disaster, and as long as the game is played on Sunday, as scheduled, the league will deem its experiment a success.\u201cIf the N.F.L. was really worried about the weather, they wouldn\u2019t have scheduled the game here,\u201d Gerstner said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Obama Can Bounce Back in 2014", "Date": "2014-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 Even with no real scandal and only one demonstrable policy blunder, the health care rollout, President Obama had a miserable 2013 as his public standing plummeted. History suggests that it is tough for a second-term president to rebound. Here are five ways Mr. Obama could defy those odds:\u2022 Open up the wagons: Ingrained habits are hard to change, and the 52-year-old incumbent isn\u2019t going to transform himself. Still, he may appreciate how much his insularity hurt him last year. Over the past month, there have been three important additions to the White House ranks: Serving as counselor is John D. Podesta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, who, other than Jim Baker in Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration, was the most effective occupant of that position. Two others with considerable credibility are Phil Schiliro, as health care adviser, and Katie Beirne Fallon, who starts as congressional liaison.Will the president listen to them in the crunch? It will be instructive to see whether Mr. Podesta has a wide-ranging portfolio or will be limited to energy and environmental matters, as the White House initially suggested. One encouraging sign, some Democrats say, is that Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, realizes the value of broadening the inner circle.\u2022 Mend health care: The president and Democrats are paying a huge price for the dreadful rollout of the Affordable Care Act and HealthCare.gov. The goal of seven million enrollees by April 1 is beyond reach. There must, however, be a substantial number \u2014 say five million, with a quarter of those young people \u2014 to keep the support of the insurance industry and prevent an explosion in premiums.Mr. Obama had to enlist an expert to fix the website. The crucial question in 2014 will be whether a chief executive will be appointed to run the entire program. If White House resistance persists, look for more problems and controversies that will make the website glitches seem tame.\u2022Go on the offensive: On health care, the best the White House can do is to neutralize the issue. The president\u2019s camp knows it needs to put the Republicans on the defensive elsewhere: by pushing an extension of unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless and raising the minimum wage. The president also plans to emphasize the one issue that scares mainstream Republicans: an immigration overhaul, which House conservatives threaten to kill.The improving economy affords the president an opportunity to challenge Republicans on income inequality. Critics will yell about class warfare. Yet the incongruity of the recovery \u2014 good for the well-to-do, not so good for the working class \u2014 is beyond dispute, as was well documented recently by Steven Rattner, a former Wall Street executive who led the restructuring of the auto industry in 2009 .\u2022 Beyond the water\u2019s edge: One of the few bright spots for Team Obama last year was Secretary of State John Kerry. Like most second-term presidents, Mr. Obama views geopolitical achievements as a way to burnish his legacy.A nuclear deal with the Iranians would be one such success; less likely, though conceivable, is genuine progress on the Israeli-Palestinian front. Foreign policy achievements, however, rarely elevate a second-term president\u2019s popularity. Failure with Iran or a conflict in the South China Sea could undermine him further.\u2022 Luck: Events beyond a president\u2019s control can shape his destiny. Last year\u2019s deal over Syria\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile was more due to luck, with the unexpected help of Russia, than skill. The outcome was much better than the alternatives. Mr. Obama may not be so lucky next time.The economy, as always, will be crucial. With the House controlled by Republicans, the president is devoid of realistic policy options to accelerate growth. But the psychology and perceptions may matter a lot.The odds remain against a recovery for the president. If most of the boxes above are checked off, or if the not-so-loyal Republican opposition reverts to self-destruction, Mr. Obama\u2019s good fortune may continue. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scandal in France", "Date": "2014-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI haven\u2019t paid much attention to Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the president of France, since it became clear that he wasn\u2019t going to break with Europe\u2019s destructive, austerity-minded policy orthodoxy. But now he has done something truly scandalous. I am not, of course, talking about his alleged affair with an actress, which, even if true, is neither surprising (hey, it\u2019s France) nor disturbing. No, what\u2019s shocking is his embrace of discredited right-wing economic doctrines. It\u2019s a reminder that Europe\u2019s ongoing economic woes can\u2019t be attributed solely to the bad ideas of the right. Yes, callous, wrongheaded conservatives have been driving policy, but they have been abetted and enabled by spineless, muddleheaded politicians on the moderate left.Modern Europe is a much better place, morally, politically, and in human terms. A shared commitment to democracy has brought durable peace; social safety nets have limited the suffering from high unemployment; coordinated action has contained the threat of financial collapse. Unfortunately, the Continent\u2019s success in avoiding disaster has had the side effect of letting governments cling to orthodox policies. Nobody has left the euro, even though it\u2019s a monetary straitjacket. With no need to boost military spending, nobody has broken with fiscal austerity. Everyone is doing the safe, supposedly responsible thing \u2014 and the slump persists.It\u2019s true that the latest data show France failing to share in Europe\u2019s general uptick. Most observers, including the International Monetary Fund, attribute this recent weakness largely to austerity policies. But now Mr. Hollande has spoken up about his plans to change France\u2019s course \u2014 and it\u2019s hard not to feel a sense of despair.For Mr. Hollande, in announcing his intention to reduce taxes on businesses while cutting (unspecified) spending to offset the cost, declared, \u201cIt is upon supply that we need to act,\u201d and he further declared that \u201csupply actually creates demand.\u201dSo what\u2019s the significance of the fact that, at this of all times, Mr. Hollande has adopted this discredited doctrine?As I said, it\u2019s a sign of the haplessness of the European center-left. For four years, Europe has been in the grip of austerity fever, with mostly disastrous results; it\u2019s telling that the current slight upturn is being hailed as if it were a policy triumph. Given the hardship these policies have inflicted, you might have expected left-of-center politicians to argue strenuously for a change in course. Yet everywhere in Europe, the center-left has at best (for example, in Britain) offered weak, halfhearted criticism, and often simply cringed in submission.When Mr. Hollande became leader of the second-ranked euro economy, some of us hoped that he might take a stand. Instead, he fell into the usual cringe \u2014 a cringe that has now turned into intellectual collapse. And Europe\u2019s second depression goes on and on. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Florida\u2019s Site Said to Delay Millions in Aid to Jobless", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 The botched rollout of Florida\u2019s online system for unemployment claims may have kept jobless Floridians from receiving $20 million in benefits in October and November, according to an informal analysis by a workers\u2019 rights group. State officials question whether the drop in benefits would have been that drastic. But three months after the introduction of a system that required applicants to sign up online for unemployment benefits, Florida officials are still scrambling to get it working effectively amid political jousting over what went wrong.The analysis, first reported by The Orlando Sentinel on Thursday, focused on a drop in weekly unemployment claims from September through November. Typically, unemployment claims remain relatively steady, with small increases and declines, according to the data. But the proportion of jobless workers in Florida who claimed unemployment insurance benefits dropped sharply during that period, from 17.2 percent in September \u2014 before the new system was introduced \u2014 to 13.4 percent in November.If the rate had remained at 17 percent, Florida would have processed an additional 290,000 weekly claims worth an estimated $20 million in benefits, the analysis concluded.\u201cIt seems fairly obvious that there are tens of thousands of unpaid unemployment claims in Florida that belong to individuals who were eligible for benefits until the system broke,\u201d said George Wentworth, a senior staff lawyer for the employment law project.Jessica Sims, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, said in a statement that the agency had been told to expect an \u201cinitial decrease\u201d in claims as the system switched over. This occurred in other states that have changed their systems, she said, as many people waited to file their claims until after the initial rush. Ms. Sims said a reduction in the state unemployment rate also might explain the drop in claims. She also cited the unreliability of the data the state has sent to the federal Labor Department. \u201cThe reporting function is still not working properly,\u201d Ms. Sims said of the system. \u201cWe have alerted the U.S. Department of Labor to this, and they have asked us to submit the information as is, and correct it later.\u201dSince Oct. 15, more than 1.2 million claims have been filed using the new website and at least $349 million has been paid out in benefits, the state\u2019s job agency said.The agency has said that faulty work by Deloitte Consulting, the company that devised the new system, led to the failures. Deloitte has had problems with unemployment claims systems in other states, including California and Massachusetts. But the company has defended its work, saying most jobless Floridians have filed for benefits without trouble. It recently hired 10 more programmers to repair the problems that remain.Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, has renewed his call for an investigation into the system\u2019s problems. In a letter on Tuesday to Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez, Mr. Nelson questioned whether Florida is violating the Social Security Act and requirements that states make timely unemployment payments. He requested a reply from Mr. Perez by next Tuesday.\u201cAny continuing problems in processing unemployment claims only delays financial help to those who need it most due to misfortune,\u201d Mr. Nelson wrote.Gov. Rick Scott of Florida accused Mr. Nelson of politicizing the issue and responded in a statement that the jobs agency is \u201cgoing to get this fixed.\u201d\u201cWe will absolutely make sure every claimant entitled to benefits gets them,\u201d said Mr. Scott, a Republican.Hoping to assuage its critics and to more quickly deliver benefits to the jobless, the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity is hiring another contractor, Capgemini, to examine the system\u2019s flaws. Capgemini could begin working on the project as early as next week, the agency said.The state has hired nearly 300 workers to adjudicate cases and answer phone calls until the problems are fixed. It is using federal funds to pay the $164,700 a week that the new staff will cost. Seeking to hold Deloitte accountable, the Florida jobs agency issued $6 million in penalties against the company, withheld a $3 million payment and on Dec. 23 began fining it $15,000 a day until the problems are fixed.Mr. Wentworth said he was disappointed in how Florida was handling the claims. In California, he said, state officials recognized the depth of the problem and chose to honor unemployment claims without drawing out the application process. In Florida, all cases are being adjudicated before payments are made, which is adding to the delays, he said.\u201cFlorida seems to have made a purposeful decision to continue to whittle away at a backlog over a matter of months while people who are clearly entitled to unemployment insurance are going without,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "End the Corporate Tax?", "Date": "2014-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersReaders respond to an Op-Ed essay that said abolition of the tax would benefit workers.For decades corporate income taxes have dropped without benefiting working and middle-class America. Chief executives now make 270 times more than the average American worker, whose real wages have fallen since their peak in the 1970s.As most workers in America have seen their hours, wages and benefits shrink, corporate taxes have gone down, job creation and growth have gone down, and corporate profits and executive compensation have skyrocketed.So why does Mr. Kotlikoff think that it will be different this time around? For whom does he think that it will be better? If the past predicts the future, it will not be the American workers or the middle class who benefit.\u00a0First, the personal income tax would have an enormous loophole for the rich if we didn\u2019t also have a corporate income tax. A corporation can hold on to its profits for years before paying them out as dividends. With no corporate income tax, rich people could create shell corporations to defer paying individual income taxes on much of their income indefinitely.Second, even when corporate profits are paid out (as stock dividends), only a third are paid to individuals rather than to tax-exempt entities not subject to the personal income tax. If not for the corporate income tax, most corporate profits would never be taxed.Third, the corporate income tax is ultimately borne by shareholders and is therefore a very progressive tax, which means that repealing it would result in a less progressive tax system. The Treasury Department concludes that 82 percent of the corporate tax is borne by the owners of stocks and business assets, who mostly have very high incomes.\u00a0President Obama, Speaker John A. Boehner and leaders in both parties have called for reforming America\u2019s corporate tax code to lower the world\u2019s highest rate of 35 percent to a competitive level and to simplify the system. As the recent budget agreement between Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat, and Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Republican, shows, the country is hungry for bipartisan agreement, and there is no better opportunity than the simplification of the corporate tax code.Labor and business, left and right, have come together before to reach deals that have boosted America\u2019s economy and created jobs. Mr. Kotlikoff is right that jobs don\u2019t come out of thin air. Now is the time for compromise that leads to sustainable economic growth, higher employment and creation of those jobs.Mr. Pinkerton is a former domestic policy adviser to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. Ms. Kamarck is a former adviser to President Bill Clinton and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. They are co-leaders of the RATE Coalition (Reforming America\u2019s Taxes Equitably).\u00a0\u00a0What would really help working families is having corporations once again pay their fair share of taxes, so that we can adequately finance new investments in education, medical research and infrastructure repair to grow the economy. That means closing offshore tax loopholes that reward corporations for hiding profits and shipping jobs overseas.In the 1950s, corporate tax receipts represented about a third of federal revenue; now they make up only 10 percent. When corporate taxes decline, everyone else pays more to make up the difference, or loses valuable services and benefits. American workers win when corporate tax loopholes get closed.\u00a0Given these associations, Mr. Kotlikoff\u2019s proposal, which sounds like the discredited trickle-down economic theories of the \u201980s, can hardly be characterized as nonpartisan, nor, it seems, is he.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "50 Years Later, War on Poverty Is a Mixed Bag", "Date": "2014-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWashington MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 To many Americans, the war on poverty declared 50 years ago by President Lyndon B. Johnson has largely failed. The poverty rate has fallen only to 15 percent from 19 percent in two generations, and 46 million Americans live in households where the government considers their income scarcely adequate.But looked at a different way, the federal government has succeeded in preventing the poverty rate from climbing far higher. There is broad consensus that the social welfare programs created since the New Deal have hugely improved living conditions for low-income Americans. At the same time, in recent decades, most of the gains from the private economy have gone to those at the top of the income ladder.For poverty to decrease, \u201cthe low-wage labor market needs to improve,\u201d James P. Ziliak of the University of Kentucky said. \u201cWe need strong economic growth with gains widely distributed. If the private labor market won\u2019t step up to the plate, we\u2019re going to have to strengthen programs to help these people get by and survive.\u201dStill, a broad range of researchers interviewed by The New York Times stressed the improvement in the lives of low-income Americans since Mr. Johnson started his crusade. Infant mortality has dropped, college completion rates have soared, millions of women have entered the work force, malnutrition has all but disappeared. After all, when Mr. Johnson announced his campaign, parts of Appalachia lacked electricity and indoor plumbing.Many economists argue that the official poverty rate grossly understates the impact of government programs. The headline poverty rate counts only cash income, not the value of in-kind benefits like food stamps. A fuller accounting suggests the poverty rate has dropped to 16 percent today, from 26 percent in the late 1960s, economists say.Both economic and sociological trends help explain why so many children and adults remain poor, even putting the effects of the recession aside. More parents are raising a child alone, with more infants born out of wedlock. High incarceration rates, especially among black men, keep many families apart. About 30 percent of single mothers live in poverty.In some cases, government programs have helped fewer families because of program changes and budget cuts, researchers said. For instance, the 1996 Clinton-era welfare overhaul drastically cut the cash assistance available to needy families, often ones headed by single mothers. \u201cAs of 1996, we expected single mothers to go to work,\u201d Professor Ziliak said. \u201cBut if they\u2019re shelling out most of their weekly pay in the form of child care, they can\u2019t make sense of doing it.\u201dEconomists remain sharply divided on the reasons, with technological change, globalization, the decline of labor unions and the falling value of the minimum wage often cited as major factors. But with real incomes for a vast number of middle-class and low-wage workers in decline, safety-net programs have become more instrumental in keeping families\u2019 heads above water.Above all, the government has proved most successful in aiding the elderly through the New Deal-era Social Security program and the creation of Medicare in the 1960s. The poverty rate among older Americans fell to just 9 percent in 2012 from 35 percent in 1959.But for working-age households, both conservatives and liberals agree that government transfer programs alone cannot eliminate poverty. The answer, the White House has said, is in trying to improve households\u2019 earnings before tax and transfer programs take effect.\u201cGoing forward, the biggest potential gains that could be made on poverty would be in raising market incomes,\u201d said Jason Furman, the chairman of Mr. Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cIn the short run, that means things like the minimum wage, and in the long run, things like early education.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That number was unchanged from 2012, but well below the double-digit numbers of much of the last three decades.Industrial production and retail sales data for December, also released Monday, also painted a picture of steady, unexciting growth: Industrial output rose 9.7 percent from a year earlier, a touch below the 10 percent pace recorded in November, while retail sales growth, an indicator of domestic consumption, was virtually unchanged, at 13.6 percent.China is undergoing a major economic overhaul, as the authorities in Beijing try to create efficient, sustainable expansion and wean the economy off reliance on state-driven investment, heavy industry and exports.The goal is to increase domestic consumption, private industry and the service sector as engines of growth.

{"Headline": "Dark Side of Capital in Emerging Markets", "Date": "2014-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceIt is no fun to be a central banker in an emerging-market country when investors suddenly grow doubtful.If you don\u2019t do what the foreign investors say you should do, your currency and your markets will be punished. And if you do what you are told, well, they could be punished anyway.Turkey\u2019s central bank set out this week to show that it was changing its ways. After months of watching the country\u2019s currency lose value, and of refusing to raise interest rates despite receiving lots of advice from overseas to do so, it called a news conference for midnight Tuesday, hinting that it would raise rates. It not only raised them, it sent them soaring. One rate \u2014 the central bank has a lot of them \u2014 rose to 10 percent from 4.5 percent. That was enough to quiet the talk that the bank was subservient to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had loudly opposed any rate increase.It impressed the currency market \u2014 for a few hours. But by the end of the day Wednesday, the bounce was gone. As a result, noted Michael Shaoul of Marketfield Asset Management, Turkey is receiving \u201cthe worst of both worlds.\u201d The higher rates will dampen local economic activity, \u201cwhile foreign investors are hardly likely to be enticed by increased yields given the volatility and downside potential of the currency. The local crisis would seem to have room to run, and the question for global investors is the degree of international contagion that can be anticipated from Turkey\u2019s woes.\u201dNot that long ago, Turkey seemed to be a rousing economic success story. Economic growth was impressive and foreign capital was coming in rapidly. Now inflation seems to have taken off, and the Turkish lira is down about 20 percent since the end of 2012. The Turkish stock market has lost a third of its value in lira since last spring.Turkey\u2019s problems are not entirely economic. The government, which is in the middle of a corruption investigation that forced three ministers to resign and seemed to be pointing at the prime minister, decided to replace the police who were investigating it. Much of the country\u2019s growth has come from construction in Istanbul, and the investigation relates to possible bribes to change zoning rules.The widespread worry about emerging markets \u2014 investors are also nervous about Brazil, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia, to name a few \u2014 can in some ways be traced to the fact that they did remarkably well during the credit crisis that began in 2008. Many of them had hefty foreign currency reserves, and their growth attracted foreign investment.That investment helped to push up local asset prices, which intensified the boom and brought in more capital. Eventually, money flowed in from investors chasing performance, a sort of \u201cWhat goes up must keep going up\u201d attitude. The currencies appreciated, and countries began to buy more things from abroad while their industries were losing competitiveness. Current-account deficits began to soar, but that did not immediately matter because the capital was still coming in.When the cycle turns, as it eventually must, investors who were clamoring to invest can suddenly demand to get out. How much a country is hurt may depend on what form that capital infusion took. Foreign direct investment, like building plants or buying local companies, cannot be quickly or easily reversed. But bank loans can fade away, and those who bought stocks on the local market can sell quickly. The worst problem can come from short-term debt to foreigners, who can get cold feet at the worst possible time. That is why capital controls can make sense when times are good. Countries that have easy access to loans may be better off not taking them.Morgan Stanley, which has been among the most bearish on emerging markets in recent months, looked at a variety of indicators this week and concluded that the most exposed countries were Brazil, South Africa, Ukraine and Turkey. It pointed out that a third of Turkey\u2019s external debt was short term and that the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were smaller than the amount of its short-term external debt.Emerging markets swooned last spring after the Federal Reserve began to talk about pulling back on its purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage securities. The fear was that money would flow out of emerging markets as United States interest rates rose. They got over that when it became clear that scaling back was not going to immediately have a huge effect on markets.But that plunge, even though many markets recovered, seems to have reminded investors that they needed to focus on market fundamentals and structural issues. And some countries appeared worse than others.David A. Rosenberg, the chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, a Canadian research firm, looked at six indicators \u2014 large current-account deficits, large capital inflows from 2010 to 2012, relatively high levels of fixed investment, slowing economic growth, rising inflation and weak productivity growth.He found eight countries that he considered vulnerable on at least four of those measures: Brazil, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Thailand, Taiwan, Russia and Malaysia.What, he asked, happened to all that capital that poured in? \u201cOne can reasonably draw the conclusion that, as we have seen time and again, the foreign capital inflow was squandered either on conspicuous consumption or noncompetitive investments,\u201d he wrote. The last big crisis in the developing world was in Asia in the late 1990s. This one does not seem similar, simply because the lesson most countries learned was that fixed exchange rates were extremely dangerous. (Someone should have told Europe, which was then ramping up for the creation of the euro.)Now currencies are generally allowed to float, and most of the countries viewed as vulnerable have experienced substantial currency depreciation, which will help their exporters grow more competitive. In 1998 and 1999, some countries lost huge sums trying to defend their currencies, which eventually crashed. Such sudden losses seem less likely now, although some countries have tried to slow the depreciation of their currencies.The world leader in wasted investment is probably China, the home of easy credit in recent years \u2014 credit that was often hidden from official statistics. That country has enough foreign exchange to weather a lot of write-offs, but if it does get into severe difficulties \u2014 something that has been predicted for years by some bearish investors \u2014 that could have significant consequences. Morgan Stanley now figures that countries that export a lot to China are more vulnerable than those that do not.Morgan Stanley warns of a possible \u201csuddEM stop\u201d for one or more economies, a play on the abbreviation for emerging markets. But even if you are sure that is going to happen, forecasting the timing is far from easy.Early in 1994, Rudi Dornbusch, an M.I.T. economist, wrote a prescient paper arguing that the Mexican peso would have to be substantially devalued. But the peso held its own until December, only to lose a quarter of its value in a few days. \u201cThe crisis takes a much longer time coming than you think,\u201d he later said, \u201cand then it happens much faster than you would have thought, and that\u2019s sort of exactly the Mexican story. It took forever and then it took a night.\u201d Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Half of Congress Members Are Millionaires, Report Says ", "Date": "2014-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It is hardly the kind of news that lawmakers in Congress would want to highlight during a week when unemployment benefits expired for more than a million Americans. But Congress has achieved something of a milestone. Over all, at least 268 of the 534 current members of Congress had an average net worth of $1 million or more in 2012, which is the year covered by the reports that each lawmaker had to file in 2013.The poorest was Representative David Valadao, Republican of California, who listed debts of about $12.1 million, mostly from loans on a family dairy farm.Democrats and Republicans in Congress were about equally wealthy, with Democrats boasting a median net worth of $1.04 million, compared to $1 million for congressional Republicans. The averages in both cases were up compared with the previous year, when the numbers were $990,000 and $907,000, the analysis showed.\u00a0Many of the members of Congress who were first elected in 2012 were unusually wealthy, helping drive up the overall standard of living among representatives and senators.But the change in the average wealth also tracks overall changes in the well-being of higher-income Americans nationwide, as stock markets have recovered from the recession. The biggest stock holding among members of Congress is General Electric, followed by Wells Fargo and Microsoft, according to the analysis.The growing divergence may help explain why Congress, beyond the politics involved, would allow unemployment benefits to expire, critics said.Advertisement"}

Healthier consumer spending, including the strongest annual increase in automobile sales since 2007, spurred by a booming stock market and an improving housing sector. And a slow but steady pickup in job creation that has pushed unemployment to its lowest level since 2008.The confluence of all these forces in recent weeks has prompted economists to sharply revise their expectations for growth in late 2013 and early 2014, and prompted hopes that a more sustained economic expansion has finally arrived.Plenty of caution is in order. It is a refrain that has been heard several times since the end of the Great Recession, and frustrated job seekers and income-stretched workers have plenty of reasons to be dubious about the upbeat forecasts. Still, a series of arrows from disparate parts of the economy in both the United States and elsewhere around the world are finally pointing in the right direction, experts and policy makers say.\u201cFalse dawns notwithstanding, it seems like a number of headwinds are fading,\u201d said Michael Hanson, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cWe\u2019re growing more optimistic, and the risks are now more to the upside than the downside. It\u2019s the first time in a long time that we could say that.\u201dThe newfound optimism will face its first test on Friday, when the Labor Department reports the latest data on unemployment and job creation in December. Joblessness sank to its lowest level in five years in November, and another month of strong gains would cement the view that the labor market is finally showing signs of life.Economists estimate the economy created just under 200,000 jobs in December, in line with the pace earlier in the fall. That is an improvement from the summer of 2013, and the turnaround has already been strong enough to persuade Federal Reserve policy makers to slowly begin easing their economic stimulus efforts. Estimates for the government\u2019s reading on job creation in December were lifted after Automatic Data Processing, a private payroll tracker, reported on Wednesday that private firms added 238,000 positions last month, well above the 200,000 level experts had anticipated.And on Thursday, the government reported that initial unemployment claims last week fell to 330,000, a drop of 15,000 claims, which was a bit more than economists expected. The four-week moving average also declined, falling 9,750 from the previous four-week average of 358,750. While the Fed\u2019s expectations for future growth have repeatedly proved too rosy in recent years, the incoming chairwoman of the central bank, Janet L. Yellen, suggested in an interview with Time magazine that she, along with many of her colleagues at the Fed, were more confident this time that the upturn was real. She suggested that real growth, adjusted for inflation, could reach 3 percent or more this year. Just a few weeks ago, there were fears that 2013 would end on a sour note in terms of economic growth, weighed down by the government shutdown in October and the standoff over the debt ceiling in Washington, as well as the lingering effects of tax increases and cuts in federal spending earlier in the year. But better-than-expected trade data on Tuesday, as well as an increase in consumer activity in October and November, prompted many economists to revise their estimates of growth in the fourth quarter sharply higher this week.Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays, now says he believes the economy expanded at an annualized pace of 3 percent in October, November and December, double his previous estimate. In addition, he now estimates consumer spending increased at a 3.8 percent rate in the same period, the fastest in three years. Mr. Maki attributes more than half of the gain in consumer spending to the surging stock market in 2013 and the steady recovery in real estate prices, the so-called wealth effect that has left shoppers feeling more confident. Wall Street turned in its best performance in 16 years in 2013; the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index gained 30 percent. \u201cThe stock market is pushing spending up, and the fading tax increases are no longer pushing spending down,\u201d Mr. Maki said. Rising domestic oil and gas production, he said, helped trim the need for imported energy supplies, contributing to a significantly smaller trade deficit in November, while the emergence of much of Europe from the grips of a deep recession has benefited exporters in the American manufacturing sector. If Mr. Maki is right, and the American economy grew at a 3 percent rate in the fourth quarter, after the 4.1 percent gain in the third quarter, it would be the best back-to-back quarterly performance in two years. It would add up to a gain for the year of about 2.7 percent, the best since 2007. It could also signal the kind of sustained gains in 2014 that have proved so elusive since the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009, a period in which the occasionally robust quarter has been quickly followed by a near stall, providing few gains to most American workers or much relief to the long-term unemployed. \u201cEverything seems to be flashing green,\u201d said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, N.J. \u201cThe dynamics have changed and we are going to break out of the pattern we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years.\u201d While agreeing that many of the headline numbers are headed in the right direction, Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research, pointed out that it would take more time for that improvement to translate into significantly lower unemployment or better wage gains for most workers. Employers still have the upper hand, with unemployment at 7 percent, so there is little pressure to increase wages or enrich benefits for workers relieved just to have a job.\u201cThe dichotomy is that the data does look increasingly normal for the overall economy, but we\u2019re still not back to where the trends were before the recession,\u201d Mr. Blitz said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pastoral Icon or Woolly Menace?", "Date": "2014-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYOU don\u2019t have to look far to see the woolly influence of sheep on our cultural lives. They turn up as symbols of peace and a vaguely remembered pastoral way of life in our poetry, our art and our Christmas pageants. Wolves also rank high among our cultural icons, usually in connection with the words \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cbad.\u201d And yet there is now a debate underway about substituting the wolf for the sheep on the (also iconic) green hills of Britain.The British author and environmental polemicist George Monbiot has largely instigated the anti-sheep campaign, which builds on a broader \u201crewilding\u201d movement to bring native species back to Europe. Until he recently relocated, Mr. Monbiot used to look up at the bare hills above his house in Machynlleth, Wales, and seethe at what Lord Tennyson lovingly called \u201cthe livelong bleat / Of the thick-fleeced sheep.\u201d Because of overgrazing by sheep, he says, the deforested uplands, including a national park, looked \u201clike the aftermath of a nuclear winter.\u201d \u201cI have an unhealthy obsession with sheep,\u201d Mr. Monbiot admits, in his book \u201cFeral.\u201d \u201cI hate them.\u201d In a chapter titled \u201cSheepwrecked,\u201d he calls sheep a \u201cwhite plague\u201d and \u201ca slow-burning ecological disaster, which has done more damage to the living systems of this country than either climate change or industrial pollution.\u201d The thought of all those sheep \u2014 more than 30 million nationwide \u2014 makes Mr. Monbiot a little crazy. But to be fair, sheep seem to lead us all beyond the realm of logic. The nibbled landscape that he denounces as \u201ca bowling green with contours\u201d is beloved by the British public. Visitors (including this writer, otherwise a wildlife advocate) tend to feel the same when they hike the hills and imagine they are still looking out on William Blake\u2019s \u201cgreen and pleasant land.\u201d Even British conservationists, who routinely scold other countries for letting livestock graze in their national parks, somehow fail to notice that Britain\u2019s national parks are overrun with sheep. Mr. Monbiot detects \u201ca kind of cultural cringe\u201d that keeps people from criticizing sheep farming. (In part, he blames children\u2019s books for clouding vulnerable minds with idyllic ideas about farming.) Sheep have \u201cbecome a symbol of nationhood, an emblem almost as sacred as Agnus Dei, the Lamb of God,\u201d he writes. Much of the nation tunes in ritually on Sunday nights to BBC television\u2019s \u201cCountryfile,\u201d a show about rural issues, which he characterizes as an escapist modern counterpart to pastoral poetry. \u201cIf it were any keener on sheep,\u201d he says, \u201cit would be illegal.\u201d The many friends of British sheep have not yet called for burning Mr. Monbiot at the stake. But they have protested. \u201cWithout our uplands, we wouldn\u2019t have a UK sheep industry,\u201d Phil Bicknell, an economist for the National Farmers Union pointed out. \u201cFarmgate sales of lamb are worth over \u00a31bn\u201d \u2014 or $1.7 billion \u2014 \u201cto U.K. agriculture.\u201d The only wolves he wanted to hear about were his own Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club. A critic for The Guardian, where Mr. Monbiot contributes a column, linked the argument against sheep, rather unfairly, to anti-immigrant nativists, adding \u201csheep have been here a damn sight longer than Saxons.\u201d More soberly, the Oxford geographer John Boardman says the uplands, in the Lake District and elsewhere, have already begun to recover as government policies encourage alternatives to sheep grazing. \u201cI can see George\u2019s point and I can see the value of some reforestation,\u201d says Mr. Boardman. \u201cBut what he is proposing isn\u2019t minimal or sensitive change. It\u2019s a wholesale change, and pretty impractical in terms of public policy.\u201dMr. Monbiot acknowledges the antiquity of sheep-keeping in Britain. But the subjugation of the uplands by sheep, he says, only really got going around the 17th century, as the landlords enclosed the countryside, evicted poor farmers, and cleared away the forests from the hillsides and moorlands, particularly in Scotland. Britain is, he writes, inexplicably choosing \u201cto preserve a 17th-century cataclysm.\u201d The sheep wouldn\u2019t be in the uplands at all, he adds, without annual taxpayer subsidies, which average \u00a353,000 per farm in Wales. He proposes an end to this artificial foundation for the \u201cagricultural hegemony,\u201d to be replaced by a more lucrative economy of walking and wildlife-based activities. He also argues for bringing wolves back to Britain, for reasons both scientific (\u201cto reintroduce the complexity and trophic diversity in which our ecosystems are lacking\u201d) and romantic (wolves are \u201cinhabitants of the more passionate world against which we have locked our doors\u201d). But he acknowledges that it would be foolish to force rewilding on the public. \u201cIf it happens, it should be done with the consent and active engagement of the people who live on and benefit from the land.\u201d Elsewhere in Europe, the sheep are in full bleating retreat, and the wolves are resurgent. Shepherds and small farmers are abandoning marginal land at an annual rate of roughly a million hectares, or nearly 4,000 square miles, according to Wouter Helmer, co-founder of the group Rewilding Europe. That\u2019s half a Massachusetts every year left open for the recovery of native species. Wolves returned to Germany around 1998, and they have been spotted recently in the border areas of Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark. In France, the sheep in a farming region just over two hours from Paris suffered at least 22 reported wolf attacks last year. But environmentalists there say farmers would do better protesting against dogs, which they say kill 100,000 sheep annually. Wolves are now a protected species across Europe, where their population quadrupled after the 1970s. Today an estimated 11,500 wolves roam there.Lynx, golden jackals, European bison, moose, Alpine ibex and even wolverines have also rebounded, according to a recent study commissioned by Rewilding Europe. Mr. Helmer says his group aims to develop ecotourism on an African safari model, with former shepherds finding new employment as guides. That may sound na\u00efve. But he sees rewilding as a realistic way to prosper as the European landscape develops along binary lines, with urbanized areas and intensive agriculture on one side and wildlife habitat with ecotourism on the other.In northern Scotland, Paul Lister is working on an ecotourism scheme to bring back wolves and bears on his Alladale Wilderness Reserve, where he has already planted more than 800,000 native trees. He still needs government permission to keep predators on a proposed 50,000-acre fenced landscape. That\u2019s a long way from introducing them to the wild, on the model of Yellowstone National Park. Even so, precedent suggests that it will be a battle. Though beavers are neither big nor bad, a recent trial program to reintroduce them to the British countryside caused furious public protest. (One writer denounced \u201cthe emotion-based obsession with furry mammals of the whiskery type.\u201d) And late last year, when five wolves escaped from the Colchester Zoo, authorities quickly shot two of them dead. A police helicopter was deployed to hunt and kill another, and a fourth was recaptured. Prudently, the fifth wolf slunk back into its cage, defeated. Rewilding? At least for now, Britain once again stands alone (well, alone with its 30 million sheep) against the rising European tide.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video: An Updated Chevy Traverse That Can Fit the Family", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRecently, I discovered that my older brother and his wife were interested in a Chevrolet Tahoe. Their reasoning was simple \u2013 its three rows of seating would be handy when chauffeuring my niece\u2019s soccer teammates and gear. And they love the S.U.V. look.Now before you roll your eyes and suggest that they buy a minivan (which aren\u2019t very mini these days), consider that they live in Texas. True, vans are supremely functional, but rolling up to a game in a Honda Odyssey or Nissan Quest can get a family unkindly branded in a town like Dallas. Perhaps literally. It is Texas, after all.I suggested a compromise \u2013 the Chevy Traverse crossover. While the Tahoe S.U.V. is a hair larger on the outside, Traverse has an additional 21 cubic feet of cargo room behind the front seats. That\u2019s room the soccer team can appreciate when traveling to away games.The Traverse has better fuel economy, too. The all-wheel drive model I\u2019m driving scores a rating of 16 miles per gallon in town, and 23 on the highway, from the Environmental Protection Agency. That\u2019s 1 or 2 m.p.g. better than the Tahoe. Also, the Traverse is lighter, yet can still manage to tow up to 5,200 pounds.The Traverse was recently updated inside and out. The odd taillights have been replaced with units that would look stylish on a Camaro. The front end gets Chevy\u2019s new family face. All around it\u2019s a conservative look, but one I prefer to the \u201cadventuresome\u201d Odyssey and Quest designs (to put it politely).The spacious Traverse cabin has a simple but rich look with plenty of stitching and ambient lighting on the instrument panel. There\u2019s seating for seven or eight depending upon trim level. The ride quality is soothing, but without float. The Traverse\u2019s 288-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 offers decent power, and the 6-speed transmission is just like my niece during a soccer match \u2013 always in the right position.So what\u2019s not to like? At around $47,000 as tested, my top-of-the-line LTZ test vehicle cannot be had with keyless ignition. Creative features offered by some competitors, like Ford\u2019s foot-activated tailgate, are M.I.A., and the wide and flat front seats seem geared toward Texas-size folk; smaller drivers don\u2019t get much lateral support from them. Finally, as nimble as the big Traverse feels while driving, the vehicle is still large. Something to keep in mind if your garage is small.The Traverse and its corporate cousins \u2013 the GMC Acadia and the Buick Enclave \u2013 have been substantially updated and are worth a look if you have lots of people or stuff to haul. They come close to delivering vanlike room and have the sport utility look that Texans (and, let\u2019s face it, most Americans) prefer. Of course, while you\u2019re shopping check out the Ford Explorer, the Toyota Highlander, the Nissan Pathfinder and the Honda Pilot as well. My older brother will probably just ignore my advice and buy a Tahoe. I will always be his little brother.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Administration Is Seen as Retreating on Environment in Talks on Pacific Trade", "Date": "2014-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would be one of the world\u2019s biggest trade agreements, have exposed deep rifts over environmental policy between the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations. As it stands now, the documents, viewed by The New York Times, show that the disputes could undo key global environmental protections.The environmental chapter of the trade deal has been among the most highly disputed elements of negotiations in the pact. Participants in the talks, which have dragged on for three years, had hoped to complete the deal by the end of 2013.Environmentalists said that the draft appears to signal that the United States will retreat on a variety of environmental protections \u2014 including legally binding pollution control requirements and logging regulations and a ban on harvesting sharks\u2019 fins \u2014 to advance a trade deal that is a top priority for Mr. Obama.Ilana Solomon, the director of the Sierra Club\u2019s Responsible Trade Program, said the draft omits crucial language ensuring that increased trade will not lead to further environmental destruction.\u201cIt rolls back key standards set by Congress to ensure that the environment chapters are legally enforceable, in the same way the commercial parts of free-trade agreements are,\u201d Ms. Solomon said. The Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the World Wildlife Fund have been following the negotiations closely and are expected to release a report on Wednesday criticizing the draft.American officials countered that they had put forward strong environmental proposals in the pact.\u201cIt is an uphill battle, but we\u2019re pushing hard,\u201d said Michael Froman, the United States trade representative. \u201cWe have worked closely with the environmental community from the start and have made our commitment clear.\u201d Mr. Froman said he continued to pursue a robust, enforceable environmental standard that he said would be stronger than those in previous free-trade agreements.The draft documents are dated Nov. 24 and there has been one meeting since then.The report appears to indicate that the United States is losing many of those fights, and bluntly notes the rifts: \u201cWhile the chair sought to accommodate all the concerns and red lines that were identified by parties regarding the issues in the text, many of the red lines for some parties were in direct opposition to the red lines expressed by other parties.\u201dAs of now, the draft environmental chapter does not require the nations to follow legally binding environmental provisions or other global environmental treaties. The text notes only, for example, that pollution controls could vary depending on a country\u2019s \u201cdomestic circumstances and capabilities.\u201dIn addition, the draft does not contain clear requirements for a ban on shark finning, which is the practice of capturing sharks and cutting off their fins \u2014 commonly used in shark-fin soup \u2014 and throwing back the sharks to die. The dish is a delicacy in many of the Asian negotiating countries. At this point the draft says that the countries \u201cmay include\u201d bans \u201cas appropriate\u201d on such practices.Earlier pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement included only appendices, which called for cooperation on environmental issues but not legally binding terms or requirements. Environmentalists derided them as \u201cgreen window dressing.\u201dBut in May 2007, President George W. Bush struck an environmental deal with Democrats in the Senate and the House as he sought to move a free-trade agreement with Peru through Congress. In what became known as the May 10 Agreement, Democrats got Mr. Bush to agree that all American free-trade deals would include a chapter with environmental provisions, phrased in the same legally binding language as chapters on labor, agriculture and intellectual property. The Democrats also insisted that the chapter require nations to recognize existing global environmental treaties.Since then, every American free-trade deal has included that strong language, although all have been between the United States and only one other country. It appears to be much tougher to negotiate environmental provisions in a 12-nation agreement.\u201cBilateral negotiations are a very different thing,\u201d said Jennifer Haverkamp, the former head of the United States trade representative\u2019s environmental office. \u201cHere, if the U.S. is the only one pushing for this, it\u2019s a real uphill battle to get others to agree if they don\u2019t like it.\u201dBut business groups say the deal may need to ease up. \u201cThere are some governments with developing economies that will need more time and leeway,\u201d said Cal Cohen, president of the Emergency Committee for American Trade, a group of about 100 executives and trade associations that lobbies the United States trade negotiator on the deal. \u201cWhen you think about the evolution of labor provisions, you realize how many centuries the development of high standards took.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed, noted in a video presented at the awards ceremony here.But it represents a new, untested approach for the Fed, which has been widely criticized for bailing out Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis, but leaving Main Street to fend for itself.It is a model that Mr. Rosengren hopes will be adopted by other regional Federal Reserve Banks, which are watching the experiment now underway here.\u201cIt\u2019s a little out of the ordinary for the Federal Reserve,\u201d Mr. Rosengren said in an interview at his 32nd-floor office, which overlooks Boston Harbor. \u201cMonetary policy may not do the same as what this does in Lawrence.\u201dRelying on traditional Fed policy tools like lowering interest rates, as well as more unconventional methods employed in recent years, like buying up government bonds, has bolstered the housing sector and Wall Street and helped revive the overall economy. But many areas of the country \u2014 and many millions of Americans \u2014 have been largely left behind.At the same time, growing economic inequality, after years of drawing little attention from politicians and policy makers, has emerged as a hot topic for President Obama, as well for Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. Mr. Rosengren is eager to weigh in on the issue, and perhaps even help make a dent in the problem.\u201cIf we want to get to Main Street, we have to get out of Boston,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we want to help the economy, we can\u2019t just help people from M.I.T. and Harvard. The have-nots are in midsized cities, and they have the opportunity to be haves.\u201dTo be sure, the 20 cities that competed for the grants face long odds, and $1.8 million divided among six winners will hardly pay for local renaissances.In Lawrence, which won $700,000, the largest single grant, unemployment stands at 13.9 percent, double the state average; 28 percent of families there were below the poverty line in 2011, up from 21 percent in 2000. Aides to the former mayor of the historic mill town have been accused of corruption, and state officials took over Lawrence\u2019s schools in late 2011 after years of disastrously low test scores.The new program centers on Lawrence\u2019s troubled school system, but it is aimed at engaging parents, using the schools as a place to offer other services like language training, health care and leads on jobs for Spanish-speaking parents.\u201cEvery parent has to take their kids to school,\u201d said Prabal Chakrabarti, vice president for regional and community outreach at the Boston Fed. \u201cNow we can connect them, and kids will do better if their parent has a job.\u201dThe Fed has also encouraged the city to reach out to local employers like the shoemaker New Balance, as well area hospitals and local banks, for both funding and employment assistance for parents. Just as they did not contribute the money \u2014 the Fed has the authority to support only financial institutions \u2014 Fed officials relied on a panel of local leaders, urban experts and donors to select the recipients.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be a coach and a referee at the same time,\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti said.In addition, Fed economists and community development specialists worked with each town on its submission, providing advice on the best tools to employ and bringing some of their statistical rigor to the Working Cities Challenge. Experts like Mr. Chakrabarti will track data as projects get underway and provide feedback to local officials in Lawrence and the other winning cities (in order of largest to smallest awards): Fitchburg, Holyoke, Chelsea, Somerville and Salem.Mr. Rosengren sees all of this as an example of the power of regional Fed presidents to \u201cconvene\u201d the various economic players in local areas, from government officials to bankers, business officials and philanthropies. \u201cThe money is not huge,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is enough to get the cities engaged.\u201dAnd although the central bank will always be defined primarily by number-crunching, not community organizing, local officials say they have been pleasantly surprised by Mr. Rosengren\u2019s stance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Industry Awakens to Threat of Climate Change", "Date": "2014-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Coca-Cola has always been more focused on its economic bottom line than on global warming, but when the company lost a lucrative operating license in India because of a serious water shortage there in 2004, things began to change.Today, after a decade of increasing damage to Coke\u2019s balance sheet as global droughts dried up the water needed to produce its soda, the company has embraced the idea of climate change as an economically disruptive force.\u201cIncreased droughts, more unpredictable variability, 100-year floods every two years,\u201d said Jeffrey Seabright, Coke\u2019s vice president for environment and water resources, listing the problems that he said were also disrupting the company\u2019s supply of sugar cane and sugar beets, as well as citrus for its fruit juices. \u201cWhen we look at our most essential ingredients, we see those events as threats.\u201dCoke reflects a growing view among American business leaders and mainstream economists who see global warming as a force that contributes to lower gross domestic products, higher food and commodity costs, broken supply chains and increased financial risk. Their position is at striking odds with the longstanding argument, advanced by the coal industry and others, that policies to curb carbon emissions are more economically harmful than the impact of climate change.\u201cThe bottom line is that the policies will increase the cost of carbon and electricity,\u201d said Roger Bezdek, an economist who produced a report for the coal lobby that was released this week. \u201cEven the most conservative estimates peg the social benefit of carbon-based fuels as 50 times greater than its supposed social cost.\u201dSome tycoons are no longer listening.At the Swiss resort of Davos, corporate leaders and politicians gathered for the annual four-day World Economic Forum will devote all of Friday to panels and talks on the threat of climate change. The emphasis will be less about saving polar bears and more about promoting economic self-interest.In Philadelphia this month, the American Economic Association inaugurated its new president, William D. Nordhaus, a Yale economist and one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on the economics of climate change.\u201cThere is clearly a growing recognition of this in the broader academic economic community,\u201d said Mr. Nordhaus, who has spent decades researching the economic impacts of both climate change and of policies intended to mitigate climate change.Nike, which has more than 700 factories in 49 countries, many in Southeast Asia, is also speaking out because of extreme weather that is disrupting its supply chain. In 2008, floods temporarily shut down four Nike factories in Thailand, and the company remains concerned about rising droughts in regions that produce cotton, which the company uses in its athletic clothes.\u201cThat puts less cotton on the market, the price goes up, and you have market volatility,\u201d said Hannah Jones, the company\u2019s vice president for sustainability and innovation. Nike has already reported the impact of climate change on water supplies on its financial risk disclosure forms to the Securities and Exchange Commission.Both Nike and Coke are responding internally: Coke uses water-conservation technologies and Nike is using more synthetic material that is less dependent on weather conditions. At Davos and in global capitals, the companies are also lobbying governments to enact environmentally friendly policies.In the United States, the rich can afford to weigh in. The California hedge-fund billionaire Thomas F. Steyer, who has used millions from his own fortune to support political candidates who favor climate policy, is working with Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., a former Treasury secretary in the George W. Bush administration, to commission an economic study on the financial risks associated with climate change. The study, titled \u201cRisky Business,\u201d aims to assess the potential impacts of climate change by region and by sector across the American economy.\u201cThis study is about one thing, the economics,\u201d Mr. Paulson said in an interview, adding that \u201cbusiness leaders are not adequately focused on the economic impact of climate change.\u201dAlso consulting on the \u201cRisky Business\u201d report is Robert E. Rubin, a former Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration. \u201cThere are a lot of really significant, monumental issues facing the global economy, but this supersedes all else,\u201d Mr. Rubin said in an interview. \u201cTo make meaningful headway in the economics community and the business community, you\u2019ve got to make it concrete.\u201dLast fall, the governments of seven countries \u2014 Colombia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, South Korea, Norway, Sweden and Britain \u2014 created the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate and jointly began another study on how governments and businesses can address climate risks to better achieve economic growth. That study and the one commissioned by Mr. Steyer and others are being published this fall, just before a major United Nations meeting on climate change.Although many Republicans oppose the idea of a price or tax on carbon pollution, some conservative economists endorse the idea. Among them are Arthur B. Laffer, senior economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan; the Harvard economist N. Gregory Mankiw, who was economic adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign; and Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the head of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank, and an economic adviser to the 2008 presidential campaign of Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that if we get substantial changes in atmospheric temperatures, as all the evidence suggests, that it\u2019s going to contribute to sea-level rise,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cThere will be agriculture and economic effects \u2014 it\u2019s inescapable.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019d be shocked if people supported anything other than a carbon tax \u2014 that\u2019s how economists think about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jobs Data Gives Hope for Benefits Extension", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 The surprisingly weak December jobs report might have strengthened Democrats\u2019 hand in the current fight over emergency jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed even as it weakened the party in the larger midterm election battle.On Friday, the Labor Department said that the unemployment rate dropped to a five-year low of 6.7 percent. But the economy added only 74,000 jobs, and for every American who found work, five disappeared from the labor force.With a Senate showdown set for Monday night on legislation to revive expired benefits for 1.3 million out-of-work Americans, those numbers handed Democrats a cudgel to break Republican resistance. The number of Americans out of work for more than six months and actively job-hunting stands at 3.9 million. In addition, about 347,000 Americans dropped out of the labor force in December.Long-term unemployment is \u201cone of our nation\u2019s most immediate and pressing challenges,\u201d said Jason L. Furman, the chairman of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cDespite an abundance of evidence indicating that this challenge is far from solved, Congress allowed extended unemployment insurance to lapse at the end of 2013, cutting off a critical lifeline to those who lost a job through no fault of their own and are still searching for work.\u201dYet Republicans said the burden of persuasion remains with the White House. \u201cThe debate will be further charged by these very important numbers, but the White House has a tough sell here,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania and a key swing-vote moderate. \u201cOn the one hand they say the economy is getting better. On the other, they need emergency unemployment benefits. The two can\u2019t coexist.\u201dIn the larger political picture, the December jobs report started the 2014 election year with a thud for President Obama, with half of Americans disapproving of the job he is doing and Democrats facing a tough \u201csix-year itch\u201d election. Since World War II the party in the White House has lost, on average, 29 seats in the House in its second midterm. Democrats were already struggling to recover from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s disastrous rollout.\u201cUntil and unless the public becomes more enthused about their economic future and accepts the economy is getting better, that\u2019s a big problem for the White House,\u201d said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. \u201cLaying these numbers on top of Obamacare and the six-year itch, gosh, that is a deep hole to crawl out of for the president and Democratic candidates.\u201dDemocrats have tried to harness middle-class families\u2019 frustrations with the pace of economic growth by accusing the slow recovery in part on Republican recalcitrance.But Republicans have become more vocal in pinning the weak economy on President Obama \u2014 and have argued that Congress needs to pave the path for businesses to make more jobs, rather than what they see as the Democrats\u2019 approach of simply making poverty or unemployment more comfortable. \u201cWe have been trying to focus this Congress on getting back to a more optimistic view of what the economy can do,\u201d said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader. \u201cIt is about jobs. It is about growth. Our focus is about wanting people to get a job. It\u2019s on employment, not unemployment.\u201dFor Democrats, even a short-term victory on extending unemployment benefits is looking like a long-shot. The six Republicans who voted Tuesday to bring an unemployment bill to the Senate floor ended the week furious that Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, had shut them out of any negotiations to reshape the bill. A loss of two of them on Monday would leave Democrats without the supermajority needed to keep the bill alive, dashing Mr. Reid\u2019s hopes to extend the expired benefits through mid-November.Senator Dan Coats of Indiana, one of those six, said the group continued to negotiate together and with Democrats to see if some changes could be made to the unemployment bill to keep them on board. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, spent much of Friday on the phone with Mr. Reid, hoping for a breakthrough on Monday. But the senators are smarting over what they see as rough treatment at the hands of the leader.\u201cI don\u2019t think we should let that be the deciding factor; you don\u2019t want to subject good policy to hurt feelings,\u201d Senator Coats said Friday. \u201cOn the other hand if the leader has told you, this is not a one-off \u2014 he pretty much said, \u2018Forget about offering amendments on anything as long as I\u2019m leader\u2019 \u2014 what good does it do to negotiate anything?\u201dEven if the measure does clear the Senate, House Republicans say they simply do not feel much pressure to take it up. Mr. Coats said the job numbers weren\u2019t great, but continued job growth, even sluggish growth, dissipates the pressure to act.Republicans argue that the jobs report underscores that Mr. Obama\u2019s economic policies have failed, and that Congress should focus on spurring businesses to hire, in part by reducing regulatory requirements and cutting taxes. The price for House action would be steep, Republicans say, citing as options approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and repeal of a tax on medical devices, which helps pay for the health care law.At the end of the year, the emergency federal program abruptly expired, cutting off about 1.3 million workers who have been out of a job for more than six months. After the benefits expired, the proportion of jobless Americans receiving unemployment insurance payments fell to its lowest level in more than 50 years.Democrats have promised to continue to push for the extension, saying that millions of jobless workers still need the government lifeline. \u201cThe safety net has been just ripped away,\u201d Mr. Reid said at a news conference this week. \u201cThe economy\u2019s improving, but not for everybody.\u201dWhatever the short-term outlook, the underlying performance of the economy continues to leave millions of working age people so discouraged that they no longer even bother to look for a job. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve been seeing over the past year is very steady modest job growth,\u201d said Erica L. Groshen, the commissioner of labor statistics, speaking before a congressional panel on Friday. \u201cYet there\u2019s still a long ways to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scarlett Johansson and Oxfam, Torn Apart by Israeli Company Deal", "Date": "2014-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut instead of a fizzy drink, Ms. Johansson, a Hollywood actress, stirred up an international political storm this week because SodaStream\u2019s largest factory is in a Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, an area the Palestinians envision as part of a future independent state.Her deal with SodaStream has led to a parting of ways between Ms. Johansson and Oxfam International, the confederation of aid groups. Oxfam issued a statement on Thursday saying it had accepted Ms. Johansson\u2019s decision to step down after eight years as a global ambassador.\u201cOxfam believes that businesses such as SodaStream that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support,\u201d the group said, adding that it was \u201copposed to all trade from Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law.\u201dThe factory is in Mishor Adumim, an industrial zone attached to the large, urban settlement of Maale Adumim in the beige hills east of Jerusalem. Israel views the territory that it captured from Jordan in the 1967 war as disputed and says it intends to keep Maale Adumim under any peace deal with the Palestinians.The dispute over the ad, scheduled to air during the Super Bowl on Sunday, has pitted pro-Palestinian activists against people and groups who support Israel unreservedly. Accusations of Israeli exploitation of Palestinian resources have been met with arguments that SodaStream encourages coexistence by providing employment for hundreds of West Bank Palestinians alongside Israeli Jews and Arab citizens of Israel.The fuss comes to the fore just as concern is growing in Israel about a potential increase in foreign boycotts of its companies if current Israeli-Palestinian peace talks fail. Some European supermarket chains are already shunning agricultural produce from the settlements. PGGM, a large Dutch pension fund management company, recently decided to withdraw all its investments from Israel\u2019s five largest banks because they maintain branches in West Bank settlements or are involved in financing settlement construction.Yair Lapid, Israel\u2019s centrist finance minister, warned this week, \u201cIf the negotiations with the Palestinians get stuck or break down and we enter a reality of a European boycott, even a very partial one, Israel\u2019s economy will retreat.\u201d Speaking at the annual conference of the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, he said that \u201cevery resident of Israel will get hit straight in the pocket.\u201dBut the dispute over SodaStream has taken the boycott debate way beyond its usual, relatively limited audiences, and it is likely to simmer on.SodaStream, she continued, \u201cis a company that is not only committed to the environment but to building a bridge to peace between Israel and Palestine, supporting neighbors working alongside each other, receiving equal pay, equal benefits and equal rights.\u201dPalestinians and their supporters who have been campaigning for Palestinian rights to settle in the area around Maale Adumim do not see it that way.Grass-roots activists known as the Bab al Shams Village Council, in coalition with the Jahalin Association, representing the Bedouin tribe that has been encamped in the area for decades, also issued a statement. \u201cFor Palestinians to enjoy genuine and lasting economic prosperity,\u201d it said, \u201cthey require freedom from Israeli domination.\u201dDaniel Birnbaum, the chief executive of SodaStream, joined the company in 2007, years after its establishment. He said this week in an interview that while he would not have chosen Mishor Adumim as the site for a factory, it was by now a reality. He said that out of loyalty to the roughly 500 Palestinians employed there, he would not bow to political pressure to close the factory.\u201cI could leave there tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me it would be easier, but what about the employees?\u201dJodi Rudoren contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Seeking Ways to Help the Poor and Childless", "Date": "2014-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneLast Friday at the Food Bank for New York on 116th Street, I caught a glimpse of the many shapes of need.With a few hundred dollars, 25-year-old Ayesha Depay could afford the lessons she needs to pass her road test and get a driver\u2019s license, an indispensable tool for the job she craves leading recreation programs for children.Nadine Robinson, 43, a former receptionist at Sony Music Studios who has been working for $9 an hour as a home health aide, could use the money to get a step ahead of the relentless stream of bills, pay down debts and rebuild her credit.A 53-year-old security guard I talked to declined to provide his name, embarrassed perhaps that he was sleeping on friends\u2019 couches, working barely enough hours to \u201ckeep my head above water.\u201d He had so many potential uses for extra cash he couldn\u2019t pin any one down.To perform the investigation, proposed by the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and supported by his successor, Bill de Blasio, New York City contracted with MDRC, a nonprofit social policy research organization, to track 6,000 low-income single adults who do not have direct responsibility over children \u2014 from never-married childless women to divorced fathers who don\u2019t have custody of their children but are obligated to pay child support.Half of them will receive a bonus payment every year intended to replicate the main features of the earned-income tax credit. The other half will serve as a control group.The hope is that the tax break will do for singles what it has achieved most successfully for single mothers: shoring up workers who suffer a drop in earnings and encouraging work by subsidizing the meager wages that have become the hallmark of the American service economy.The test is one of the first concrete acknowledgments that the longstanding American economic belief that the job market alone can provide for the needs of nearly all workers may no longer be valid.Needy children are innocent, worthy recipients of assistance. And for all practical purposes, that means aiding the parents, often single mothers, who care for them. But childless adults have been historically barred from most government support, from Medicaid to welfare.From the 1930s well into the 1970s, most mothers were eligible for aid to families with dependent children only when the man was out of the home. \u201cPeople from the welfare office came around looking for evidence of a man,\u201d said MDRC\u2019s president, Gordon L. Berlin. Today, low-income noncustodial fathers who can\u2019t afford to pay child support are still not considered deserving of assistance. And they can go to jail for not paying up.If the taboo against helping the able-bodied made sense in an era when a job guaranteed something approaching a reasonable living, its case is far weaker today.Like raising the minimum wage, broadening the tax credit could help workers earn their way out of poverty. \u201cThis is a promising thing to test,\u201d said Lawrence F. Katz, a professor of economics at Harvard who has been collaborating with MDRC on the design and evaluation of the experiment. \u201cIt is a pro-employment sort of way to make work pay.\u201dProposing more government aid in these bruising political times might seem like a waste of time. The New York program will bump the maximum annual benefit for singles to $2,000 for three years \u2014 from a maximum under the federal earned-income tax credit of $496. And it will phase out much more slowly.Extending New York\u2019s credit to some 13 million singles without qualifying children across the country would cost roughly $15 billion a year, according to a calculation by Cynthia Miller, who is head of the project for MDRC. Chances are that wouldn\u2019t sit well among congressional Republicans, who have called for cuts to food assistance and are opposed to reinstating the extension of emergency jobless benefits.Still, the earned-income credit has proved enormously popular on the left and the right. President Ronald Reagan called it \u201cthe best anti-poverty, the best pro-family, the best job creation measure to come out of Congress.\u201dThis argument, which could bolster the case for a higher minimum wage, could also strengthen the case for spreading the tax credit\u2019s benefits more broadly. And a broader credit could serve another rare bipartisan cause: improving compliance with child support laws.\u201cWe have a robust child support enforcement system,\u201d said Maria Cancian, a professor of public affairs and social work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve been less successful at is enabling low-income fathers to earn enough to support themselves and afford child support obligations.\u201dAnother potential benefit, said Kathryn Edin, a professor of public policy and management at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School, would be to encourage young disadvantaged men into jobs and away from crime, making them more desirable as marriage partners and reducing the number of children born to teenage single mothers.\u201cFamily structure is both a consequence and a cause of poverty,\u201d Professor Edin told me.The fundamental reason to support wages goes beyond children, however. In a nutshell, for the American market economy to remain viable, being employed must, one way or another, provide for workers\u2019 needs.The Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about a program aimed at helping poor people without children, misstated part of the name of the food bank on 116th Street in Manhattan in some copies.

His judgment, not least about his personal security, has been called into question.Already weighed down by historically low support in the polls, he also faces the challenge of keeping the affair from undercutting his ability to push through an ambitious new agenda aimed at restoring France\u2019s fading global competitiveness and moving his Socialist Party to the center.One big test could come next month, when he will travel to Washington for a state visit with President Obama. Mr. Hollande\u2019s official partner, Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, was scheduled to accompany him in her role as de facto first lady, but now the visit seems likely to attract considerable attention for his eventual choice of, or lack of, a traveling companion.\u201cHe\u2019s always hated when politics turned into a spectacle, and now he finds himself right in the middle of one,\u201d Julien Dray, a prominent Socialist, said in an interview. \u201cThe question is how he will handle it over the long term. If this becomes vaudeville, it could damage his presidency.\u201dMr. Hollande, 59, has had little respite since a magazine, Closer, caught him meeting at an apartment around the corner from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace with Julie Gayet, a 41-year-old film actress who has played roles as varied as a Foreign Ministry official, a hairdresser and an addict, with nude scenes. The magazine published pictures of him arriving for his trysts on a scooter, wearing a helmet with the visor down, but apparently recognizable by his sensible black lace-up shoes.Members of the French public at first took the revelations in their usual sexually sophisticated stride, but not Ms. Trierweiler. People who know her well said she was so devastated by the news that she checked herself into a hospital.Mr. Hollande said Monday in a news conference in the Netherlands that Ms. Trierweiler was \u201cgetting better,\u201d but he did not respond to the question of whether she was France\u2019s first lady, according to reports by news services.If he does leave her, it will be his second high-profile breakup in seven years, after the end of his 25-year relationship with S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, a Socialist Party presidential candidate in 2007 and the mother of their four children.The confluence of the two story lines made Mr. Hollande, who had been caricatured as wobbly as a popular French custard, into a more complex figure.To his supporters, this is the start of a new chapter for Mr. Hollande in which he is emerging as a more mature and pragmatic leader who may be freed from what had become a complicated relationship with Ms. Trierweiler.They are banking on the assumption that what would be a media circus to an American president will be treated as a sideshow by the French, and that the story will die down.\u201cThere is a new Hollande, more in harmony with himself,\u201d said one of his close friends.Much will depend on what happens in the coming weeks, especially whether Ms. Trierweiler speaks publicly. As Mr. Hollande toured his political constituency of Tulle in central France over the weekend, he was trailed by 90 reporters, almost all French. He declined to answer the few questions that were posed about his personal life.But more than his predecessors in the pre-Twitter era, who could count on journalists to keep most private behavior by public officials out of the limelight, Mr. Hollande now finds himself operating in a climate of more intensive and intrusive scrutiny.Perhaps more worrisome for him is that potentially his support among women could erode.\u201cThis makes the French look like idiots,\u201d said Arlette da Rocha, who runs the restaurant Le Pressoir in Tulle, where Mr. Hollande started his political career. \u201cHe has to tell the truth. This unconventional behavior in his private life doesn\u2019t give a clean image of the president.\u201dMr. Hollande long seems to have assumed that he could live by his own rules.As leader of the Socialist Party, he campaigned for Ms. Royal when she ran for president in 2007. Both of them hid the fact that he had already left her for Ms. Trierweiler. French journalists who knew about the breakup did not write about it until Ms. Royal announced it after the election.\u201cHe who has betrayed will betray,\u201d Ms. Royal said afterward.Mr. Hollande has never been the marrying kind \u2014 a rarity for high-ranking politicians, although not for many French couples. Not that Ms. Royal was unwilling to tie the knot. Asked about marriage in a joint television interview in 2006 during the prelude to her presidential campaign, she replied mischievously: \u201cWe love each other, so I\u2019m expecting him to propose. Fran\u00e7ois, do you want to marry me?\u201dMr. Hollande chuckled, awkwardly, and said nothing.\u201cYou see \u2014 he still hesitates!\u201d Ms. Royal said.\u201cNo, this is not what I mean,\u201d Mr. Hollande said. \u201cI\u2019ll answer you after the program.\u201dApparently his answer was no.Mr. Hollande never married Ms. Trierweiler, even though he described her in an interview with Gala magazine in October 2010 as \u201cthe woman of my life.\u201d By the following February, he had curbed his enthusiasm. \u201cThe sentence was maladroit,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have said, \u2018She is the woman of my life today.\u2019 \u201dNot only did he not marry Ms. Trierweiler when he became president, he also agreed that she could keep working for Paris Match, although she stopped covering politics. Mr. Hollande and his aides depicted it as an example of a modern partnership rather than a conflict of interest. She was installed as the de facto first lady with offices in the east wing of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, a staff of four and a monthly budget of about $27,000.Early in his presidency, he wanted the freedom to move in and out of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace as he pleased. In \u201cSo Far, Everything\u2019s Going Badly,\u201d a new book on the Hollande presidency, the author, C\u00e9cile Amar, said that shortly after Mr. Hollande was elected, he asked members of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e staff, \u201cHow do I get out without people seeing me?\u201dConcerned that he might try to escape the \u00c9lys\u00e9e on his motor scooter, his aides sold it, Ms. Amar wrote.He took the high-speed train to a European summit meeting in Brussels against the wishes of his security staff, and insisted on living mostly in the apartment he shares with Ms. Trierweiler \u2014 with large exposed bay windows \u2014 which had to be secured.He quickly made some concessions: He stopped taking trains and abandoned his pledge that his motorcade would stop at red lights like ordinary motorists (an obvious security risk).But he still believes he knows best about his security. \u201cI go around when and where I want as I want,\u201d he said at his news conference last week.Interviews with more than a dozen friends and political colleagues suggest that Mr. Hollande often deflects deeper questions about his character.\u201cHe is very difficult to read,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Rebsamen, a close friend, the mayor of Dijon and a member of the Senate, in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s very affable, bubbly, lively, with a quick mind and great intelligence. But he\u2019s also a very closed person. The true Hollande has revealed himself in the past few days. He\u2019s 100 percent politics. Nothing comes before that. He loves it. He is married to politics.\u201dPeople describe him as having a good sense of humor, being a good listener and making shrewd political judgments. But these traits alone do not fully capture him.Mr. Hollande once confessed his unwillingness or inability to reveal himself. \u201cYou ask me who I am,\u201d he said in a news conference last May, replying to a narrow question about his political ideology in broader terms. \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible question.\u201dScott Sayare contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}

The Nasdaq composite fell 11.16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,131.91.General Motors was among the stocks that posted the biggest losses in the S.&P. 500. The automaker fell $1.38, or 3.4 percent, to $39.57, after reporting a sales slump in the United States of more than 6 percent in December.Energy companies have also started the year with declines as the price of oil falls.On Friday, oil extended a weeklong skid by falling $1.48, or 1.6 percent, to $93.96 a barrel as signs emerged of ample supply worldwide. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, on Friday predicted stronger growth in 2014 and said that factors that had kept the economy from accelerating appeared to be abating.\u201cThe combination of financial healing, greater balance in the housing market, less fiscal restraint, and, of course, continued monetary accommodation bodes well for U.S. economic growth in coming quarters,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said in comments to the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Philadelphia.The encouraging economic backdrop is a reason for investors to remain positive about stocks, despite the slow start to the year, said Bill Barker, a senior portfolio analyst at Motley Fool Funds, which manages about $600 million in stock mutual funds. \u201cAs long as there is no inflation and a good economy, with low interest rates,\u201d Mr. Barker said, \u201cthat\u2019s the kind of thing that stocks love.\u201dTrading was muted on Friday after a winter storm hit the Northeast, and was quiet all week because of the New Year\u2019s Day holiday on Wednesday.In bond trading, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 1/32 to 97 29/32, and its yield rose to 3 percent from 2.99 percent late Thursday.The yield on the note climbed from 1.76 percent last year to as high as 3 percent as investors sold bonds in an improving economy. Many analysts expect the yield to continue rising this year as the Federal Reserve reduces, or \u201ctapers,\u201d its stimulus.\u201cDepending on how quickly the Fed decides to taper, this could be a very bearish year for bonds,\u201d said Anna Rathbun, director of research at CBIZ, an investment and retirement consultant.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daunting Calculus for Maine Shrimpers as Entire Season Is Lost", "Date": "2013-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPORT CLYDE, Me. \u2014 Shrimping in the Gulf of Maine was so bad last season that Randy Cushman, a longtime fisherman, wondered if there was any point in going out at all.\u201cI can honestly say it was the worst catch that I\u2019ve ever seen in my career,\u201d said Mr. Cushman, 51, who has captained a boat for more than 30 years. \u201cI was calling people and saying, \u2018Let\u2019s shut this fishery down, this is stupid.\u2019\u00a0\u201dRegulators recently did just that, closing the 2014 Gulf of Maine shrimping season \u2014 which, in a normal year, might have run from December through the spring \u2014 to give the supply time to recover. The unusual step has brought some hope to Mr. Cushman and to other fishermen and processors whose livelihoods depend in part on the shrimp\u2019s making a comeback, even as they wonder how to weather this season, and perhaps longer, without it. But others say closing the season completely will deal too heavy a blow to the tiny, specialized market, eroding another part of New England\u2019s imperiled fishing economy.The shrimp in question are called Northern shrimp or, more locally, Maine shrimp. They are the southernmost appearance of a species, Pandalus borealis, that can also be found in Canadian and Icelandic waters, but the ones caught here in the Gulf of Maine tend to be at the bigger end of the species. They are usually caught in the winter, when females come close to shore to lay their eggs in cold water. They are smaller and typically sweeter than warm-water or farmed shrimp, with delicate, edible shells, and are popular in European and Scandinavian markets, although New England chefs use them, too.\u201cThey\u2019re something that I love to have,\u201d said Michael Leviton, the chef at Area Four and Lumi\u00e8re, two Boston-area restaurants, who said he would use local fish in lieu of the shrimp this year. \u201cMy favorite thing to do with them is to basically pan-fry them whole, head and shell on.\u201dThe fishery is among the last in Maine to be open-access, meaning licenses are not limited as they are elsewhere. As a result, some fishermen say, the supply is vulnerable to overfishing when prices are high. It had a peak in the late 1960s and the \u201970s before the supply collapsed and regulators imposed the last complete closing, in 1978. In 2011, regulators estimate, about 350 boats \u2014 mostly in Maine, with some in Massachusetts and New Hampshire \u2014 caught $10.6 million worth of shrimp; last season, about 200 boats caught an estimated $1.2 million worth.In 2013 researchers towing nets to assess the size of the stock counted an average of 27 shrimp per tow, compared with a historical average of 1,400 per tow.\u201cThe 2013 survey was the worst ever,\u201d said Maggie Hunter, a scientist at Maine\u2019s Marine Resources Department and a member of the technical committee that advised the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, which regulates Northern shrimp, to close the fishery for the season.Ms. Hunter and other scientists ascribe the precipitous decline to a combination of overfishing and, more important, higher ocean temperatures over the past few years, which seem to threaten the survival of newly hatched shrimp. \u201cOne mechanism that has been proposed is that if it\u2019s warm, the shrimp\u2019s eggs mature too fast and they hatch too early,\u201d Ms. Hunter said.Marshall Alexander, 67, a longtime shrimper who lives in Biddeford, Me., has grudgingly piled his gear. \u201cIt affects me dearly, O.K.,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. He added that he would have to take long, cold trips offshore this season, which he would usually prefer to do in the summer, in search of ground fish \u2014 cod, haddock and others that live near the ocean floor \u2014 because he cannot shrimp close to shore. \u201cAt my age, I don\u2019t enjoy the beating I used to take when I was younger,\u201d he said.Mr. Alexander is among a group of fishermen and processors who acknowledge that stocks are in trouble but have pushed regulators to allow so-called no-harm fishing of older shrimp that have already hatched their last round of eggs for the year, in order to keep parts of the market supplied and the infrastructure functioning. They argue that this could prevent a price crash should European markets have moved on by the time the fishery reopens, but scientists say it would not be possible to exclusively target shrimp that can no longer lay eggs.\u201cThe shelf space we had in Waitrose in the U.K. or the market in Norway is gone with Maine shrimp,\u201d said Spencer Fuller, a shrimp manager at the Portland-based seafood distributor Cozy Harbor, who called the cuts \u201cdraconian, not necessary.\u201dBut another subset of fishermen and processors view the decision to close the season as an overdue investment in the future of the species.\u201cThere\u2019s so little we can do to control what\u2019s going on in the ocean,\u201d said Glen Libby, a founder of a fisherman-owned seafood processing business called Port Clyde Fresh Catch. \u201cWe have to try to make some contribution to help the stock.\u201dShortly after the closing was announced, Mr. Libby had just two bags of shrimp \u2014 last season\u2019s, found hidden in a freezer behind some monkfish. As he watched two employees pick crab, he said he hoped crab legs, scallops and fish could see his business through the winter.\u201cThat\u2019s our shrimp substitute,\u201d he said gamely.Across town, Mr. Cushman, who is also part of Mr. Libby\u2019s processing business, was less optimistic. \u201cIt kills me \u2014 it breaks my heart,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need them shrimp in order to keep that business alive.\u201dOne of Mr. Cushman\u2019s brothers handed him a paycheck: With shrimp in so much trouble, Mr. Cushman is working as his stern man. It used to be that ground fishing could help him through a bad shrimping season, but because of deep cuts, that is no longer the case.\u201cWe have two fisheries that are failing now,\u201d Mr. Cushman said, looking over the Port Clyde harbor and counting, to his surprise, just a handful of boats capable of catching ground fish and shrimp.\u201cWe keep losing boats out of this harbor every year, and I keep forgetting about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is why you see guys like me disappearing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "German Economy Grows at Modest Pace", "Date": "2014-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The German economy registered only meager growth in the fourth quarter of 2013, according to early estimates released on Wednesday, as an improvement in consumption was not strong enough to compensate for a decline in investment by business and government and the effects of recession elsewhere in Europe.For all of 2013, the German economy grew 0.4 percent from 2012, the Federal Statistical Office said in Berlin. That compared to growth of 0.7 percent in 2012.The statistics agency did not release an official figure for the fourth quarter on Wednesday, but its president estimated that growth during the last three months of the year was about 0.25 percent, or about the same as in the third quarter.\u201cThe German economy suffered from the continuing recession in some European countries and from restrained growth of the global economy,\u201d Roderich Egeler, president of the Federal Statistical Office, said in a statement. \u201cThe strong domestic demand could offset those factors only to a limited extent.\u201dCompared to the rest of the euro zone, Germany is still considered a success story because unemployment remains low at just 5.2 percent, with a record 42 million people working. In addition, the country\u2019s carmakers and other exporters are expected to benefit from a pickup this year in the United States\u2019 and other economies.The full-year growth figure was less than the 0.5 percent forecast by analysts in a Reuters survey, but economists described the growth as roughly within expectations.\u201cToday\u2019s numbers bode well for a re-acceleration of the German economy in 2014,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING Bank, said in a note to clients. \u201cWith the improved global economic outlook, filled order books, low inventories and the stable labor market, all the ingredients for another strong growth performance of the German economy are there.\u201dGermany\u2019s notoriously thrifty consumers showed an increasing willingness to spend in 2013, pushing up consumption by 0.9 percent as low unemployment made people more confident about their financial standing. The increase helped to compensate for a decline in purchases of machinery and other equipment by businesses and government. Spending on construction also fell.The increase in private spending is also good news for the rest of the euro zone. Germany accounts for 29 percent of economic output in the 18 countries of the euro zone, and is a crucial market for other countries in the region.Public investment is likely to increase in 2014 as the German government faces pressure to carry out public works such as upgrading schools and bridges. Chancellor Angela Merkel and her government have the wherewithal to spend more. The Statistical Office also said on Wednesday that the government budget deficit amounted to only 0.1 percent of gross domestic product.The government deficit was higher than in 2012, when the government had a surplus of 0.1 percent. Still, it was the lowest deficit in the euro zone and leaves plenty of room for increased spending, especially considering that the government is able to borrow money at record low rates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fissures in G.O.P. as Some Conservatives Embrace Renewable Energy", "Date": "2014-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo one would not expect to see Barry Goldwater Jr., the very picture of modern conservatism and son of the 1964 Republican nominee for president, arguing passionately on behalf of solar energy customers. But there he was last fall, very publicly opposing a push by Arizona\u2019s biggest utility to charge as much as $100 a month to people who put solar panels on their roofs.The utilities, backed by conservative business interests, argue that solar users who have lower power bills because of government subsidies are not paying their fair share to maintain the power grid. Mr. Goldwater and other advocates have struck back by calling the proposed fees a \u201csolar tax,\u201d and have pushed their message in ads on Fox News and the Drudge Report.Similar conflicts are going on in California and Colorado, with many more to come. And as the issue pops up, conservatives are even joining forces with environmental groups. In Georgia, a Tea Party activist and the Sierra Club formed a \u201cGreen Tea Coalition.\u201dTo Mr. Goldwater, the true conservative path lies elsewhere. \u201cUtilities are working off of a business plan that\u2019s 100 years old,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201ckind of like the typewriter and the bookstore.\u201d On the website for his campaign, Tell Utilities Solar Won\u2019t Be Killed, Mr. Goldwater, a former congressman, says, \u201cRepublicans want the freedom to make the best choice.\u201dHe says conservatives are the original environmentalists, especially in the West. \u201cThey came out here and fell in love with the land,\u201d he said, and added that his father used to tell him, \u201cThere\u2019s more decency in one pine tree than you\u2019ll find in most people.\u201dTom Morrissey, a former state Republican Party chairman in Arizona who was embraced by the state\u2019s Tea Party groups, called the party\u2019s national leaders \u201cknuckleheads\u201d on this issue. Domestically produced energy is a national security issue, he said, adding, \u201cIf we can keep one dollar from going to people who are killing our kids in Afghanistan, it\u2019s a good thing \u2014 and I feel that\u2019s what solar energy does.\u201dHe and others consider the utilities to be regulated monopolies whose rates are set by bureaucrats \u2014 the opposite of a free-market economy. In Georgia, Debbie Dooley, the national coordinator for Tea Party Patriots and a co-founder of the Green Tea Coalition, said the fact that some conservatives denounced the favorable treatment that solar power got from the federal government was immaterial. \u201cThey neglect to mention billions of dollars that the fossil-fuel industries have received,\u201d she said. \u201cThey cherry-pick their principles.\u201dSeth Gunning, an organizer in Georgia with the Sierra Club\u2019s Beyond Coal campaign who teamed up with Ms. Dooley, said that although ideals differ, \u201cwe can find common ground.\u201d Ms. Dooley said she was working with pro-solar activists in Colorado, South Carolina, Florida, Virginia, Ohio and Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s spreading,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople respond to free-market energy.\u201dShe said that in the work with Mr. Gunning and other activists on the left, everyone tried to keep things civil. \u201cWe just don\u2019t talk about Obamacare,\u201d she said. Sometimes she will call Mr. Gunning a tree-hugger. Her liberal partners \u201ccall me a \u2018right-wing radical.\u2019 But we\u2019ll joke about it,\u201d Ms. Dooley said. \u201cWe\u2019re on each other\u2019s Christmas card list.\u201dIn Hawaii, where high electricity costs have led to enormous private investment in rooftop solar panels, State Representative Cynthia Thielen, a Republican, in cooperation with the local Sierra Club chapter, has been battling Hawaiian Electric over policies that she says discourage adoption of solar power. Like other utilities, Hawaiian Electric has argued that the boon in solar has put a strain on the grid and could even cause safety problems.The fight in Arizona led to a vote in November that allowed both sides to claim victory. The all-Republican commission that regulates utilities voted for an average fee of $5 per month, much lower than the original request from the utility, but accepted the utilities\u2019 argument that solar subsidies are inappropriately disrupting their bottom line.In many states, the conflict focuses on so-called net metering subsidies that utilities give rooftop solar owners for the excess energy they feed back onto the grid \u2014 an important incentive for consumers to adopt solar power. As solar power has boomed, the companies have argued that customers who put solar panels on their roofs might be shifting the cost of maintaining the energy grid to nonsolar ratepayers.In any case, the rise of solar, like other forms of independent power generation, has caused headaches for the industry. Lisa Wood, vice president of the Edison Foundation, a nonprofit group in Washington sponsored by investor-owned utilities, argued that for the typical residential customer, the cost of making the electricity accounted for only about 45 percent of the bill. Most of the rest was distribution, transmission and maintenance of equipment that might be called on for only part of the year, when demand was high. Her argument that rooftop solar users shift costs to other ratepayers pits homeowners against apartment dwellers and those who do not have the kind of credit rating that the solar companies like to do business with.David Leeper, an electrical engineer and solar rooftop user in Phoenix, ridiculed the power industry\u2019s arguments as \u201chigh-tech chutzpah.\u201d Mr. Leeper, a Republican who cites his core values as \u201climited government, free markets and fiscal responsibility,\u201d said the notion that he was some kind of free rider made him wonder whether he should owe the utility money if he conserved energy by using his air conditioner more sparingly. \u201cDoes that mean I took money from them?\u201dBut he said he was satisfied with the vote for a small monthly charge since he needs the power grid to reliably provide power in the evenings, or when clouds pass across the face of the sun.\u201cI owe you guys something for being there when I need you,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the fee for backup service.\u201dMatthew L.

{"Headline": "But It Doesn\u2019t Look Like a Marriott", "Date": "2014-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is what I know, but I\u2019m the past,\u201d he said, sitting in the old-fashioned floral splendor of a Grosvenor corner suite. Edition, conceived in partnership with the boutique hotelier Ian Schrager, is about the Marriott company\u2019s future. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get some flash,\u201d Mr. Marriott said. He rose wearily from his chair. \u201cI\u2019m off to see the flash.\u201dMarriott is dependable. When you\u2019re stranded overnight on business in St. Louis or Denver or Chicago, the red glow of a Marriott sign is there at the airport to offer you a clean, comfortable room.Marriott, in the words of brand experts, is boring. Nobody raves about the D.J. at a Courtyard.It\u2019s no easy puzzle, but Marriott, the world\u2019s No. 3 hotel company by number of rooms, must quickly solve it to compete for younger hotel guests, Mr. Sorenson says. One indication of the urgency: Marriott expects more globally minded millennial consumers, also referred to as Generation Y or people born roughly between 1980 and 2000, to account for a third of business-room nights in the United States by 2020. \u201cWe have to be as strong with the X\u2019s and Y\u2019s as we are with the boomers,\u201d Mr. Sorenson said in November. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of the big brands in the hotel space have really won them over.\u201dLodging analysts agree. But everyone is certainly giving it their best, from the sprawling InterContinental Hotels & Resorts, the No. 1 company and the owner of Holiday Inn and others, to Hilton Hotels & Resorts, the No. 2 company, which in mid-December executed a $2.35 billion initial public offering. To win over younger business travelers \u2014 and, even more important, to keep them in the Marriott fold when they travel for leisure, particularly overseas \u2014 the energetic Mr. Sorenson is relying on a range of strategies.\u201cWe want people to be saying, \u2018Hey, do you see what Marriott just did?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Sorenson said.Tina Edmundson, Marriott\u2019s global brand officer for luxury and lifestyle hotels, added: \u201cThis company can be very humble, almost to its detriment. It hasn\u2019t been important to say, \u2018Hey, look at me.\u2019 Some competitors are very good at that.\u201dMr. Sorenson is also leaning harder on a part of the company that many consumers may not realize is owned by Marriott: Ritz-Carlton. Marriott bought 49 percent of that luxury hotel chain in 1995 and the balance in 1998. But Marriott \u2014 agreeing with Ritz-Carlton that the luxury brand would be hurt by association with Marriott\u2019s middle-market brand \u2014 kept the connection quiet. Now, with Ritz-Carlton delivering some of Marriott\u2019s biggest growth \u2014 30 new Ritz-Carlton hotels will open worldwide in the next five years, expanding the chain by 40 percent \u2014 Mr. Sorenson says he thinks it\u2019s time to tear down the wall. \u201cIn 10 years of talking to Ritz-Carlton customers, never once has someone said, \u2018Oh, yuck \u2014 Marriott,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cWe now think all of our brands get stronger, including Ritz-Carlton, when people understand the breadth of our portfolio.\u201dThe Edition chain \u2014 rooms start at $425 a night in London \u2014 is by far Marriott\u2019s biggest bet. With a location opening next year in Manhattan and nine more announced elsewhere, Edition is the one that Marriott has to get right \u2014 even if it has meant gritting its teeth through an odd-couple relationship with Mr. Schrager, the swaggering Studio 54 impresario who helped create the boutique-hotel concept back in the 1980s and \u201990s.Why did Marriott need him?\u201cWe probably didn\u2019t have consumer permission to enter this boutique space on our own,\u201d Mr. Sorenson said. It was a blunt encapsulation of Marriott\u2019s challenges.Asking permission is new for Marriott. Once, it led the pack. In 1983, it created Courtyard by Marriott, the first national moderately priced chain catering to business guests. It was the first major hotel company to exit the real estate business \u2014 it runs hotels but does not own a vast majority of them \u2014 a formula now used by most all of the hotel giants. Marriott\u2019s rewards club, with 45 million members, is the envy of the lodging industry.But somewhere along the line, Marriott fell behind in some important ways. The hotel industry does not innovate quickly, analysts say, but Marriott in particular was slow to expand overseas. When it did, it created hotels in places where Americans wanted to travel, overlooking a new market of foreign customers with money to burn. Rivals, namely Starwood Hotels & Resorts, did a better job of tapping into the booming categories of leisure and lifestyle lodging for young adults. While Marriott was playing catch-up overseas and focusing on its enormously profitable lower-tier business, Starwood was feverishly building out its luxurious W chain, polishing its faded Sheraton brand and opening five-star St. Regis hotels.\u201cPeople have a positive view of us, but we certainly don\u2019t stand for luxury,\u201d Mr. Sorenson said. Marriott did eventually catch on to the importance of catering to moneyed travelers. In addition to Ritz-Carlton, Marriott manages the Bulgari hotel line and 64 high-end hotels under the name JW Marriott where rooms can start at $425 a night. Corporate image can affect more than reservations, said Shaun Kelley, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cWall Street generally has a better perception of luxury or aspirational brands than middle-market brands,\u201d Mr. Kelley said. Hotel investors, while obviously focused on profit, tend to give outsize attention to brands where they stay themselves \u2014 and those typically don\u2019t include Fairfield Inn, another lower-end Marriott chain.Luxury offerings are also considerably more insulated from economic downturns. \u201cStarwood, which is more skewed toward luxury, grabs a disproportionate amount of investor attention compared to its size,\u201d he said. In the 12 months through Friday, shares of Starwood, which manages roughly 50 percent fewer rooms than Marriott, had a total return of 34.4 percent, versus 26.3 percent for Marriott\u2019s stock. For the first nine months of last year, Starwood had $507 million in net income on $4.6 billion in revenue. Marriott had net income of $475 million on revenue of $9.6 billion over the same period. Marriott has freshened its image before, particularly in the 1990s, when it divested the Bob\u2019s Big Boy and Roy Rogers restaurant chains as well as its hospital and airport catering businesses. But Mr. Sorenson, who joined Marriott in 1996 from a private law firm, must change the way people think of the company without ruffling Marriott family members, five of whom hold senior positions in the company.Mr. Sorenson appears to have a keen grip on how much is too much. Asked if he was open to a restyling of the company\u2019s swooping M logo, a sort of coat of arms for the family, Mr. Sorenson\u2019s voice grew chilly. \u201cI\u2019m not terribly turned on by conversations about changing the logo,\u201d he said. And experts may see the JW Marriott line as a confusing vanity brand, but Mr. Sorenson dismissed that criticism.Wall Street has been cheering Mr. Sorenson\u2019s moves: Marriott\u2019s shares are currently trading near a record high. But Mr. Sorenson acknowledged that Mr. Marriott\u2019s legacy is nonetheless on his mind. \u201cI worry about it more than he does,\u201d Mr. Sorenson said. \u201cAre we moving too fast? Are we undoing things that are sacred?\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019ve reached out a few times, and in every instance he has said, \u2018I love it, and you should go faster.\u2019 He understands that the company needs to evolve.\u201dOn his tour of the London Edition, Mr. Marriott grinned when he stepped inside the lobby, marveling in particular at a sculpture \u2014 a giant chrome egg \u2014 that Mr. Schrager had hanged from the ceiling, in lieu of a chandelier. But Mr. Marriott probably made a wise decision to skip the opening. Mr. Sorenson tried busting a hipster move or two in the nightclub, and the sharp-tongued Mr. Schrager had a few awkward things to say about his partners.He added: \u201cSo we\u2019ve become the odd couple.\u201d That is true enough. Marriott prides itself on discipline and service. Mr. Schrager\u2019s hotels can be frenetic and so hip that it hurts. And analysts say that too many boutique hotels, including the W brand, may sacrifice service for style, ultimately turning off consumers, or at least making it hard to maintain prices. Perhaps Marriott\u2019s customer service could spare Edition that fate. That, at least, is the goal.So far, people seem pleasantly surprised. With their hardwood floors and wood-paneled walls, the guest rooms are meant to feel like cozy cabins on a luxury yacht; faux-fur throws are tossed shambolically across the beds.The Edition chain has had a difficult time getting off the ground. It was introduced in 2008, just as the recession flattened the hotel market; one Edition property, on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, spawned an ugly management spat and has since been re-branded. Aside from the property in London, the only other Edition now open is in Istanbul.Advertisement"}

The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index edged up just 1.06 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 1,844.86. The Nasdaq composite index gained 17.24 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,243.00. IBM was the biggest drag on the Dow, falling $6.18, or 3.3 percent, to $182.25, after it missed revenue expectations for a fourth straight quarter amid weakening demand, particularly in growth markets like China.IBM\u2019s decline offset modest gains from United Technologies, also a Dow component, which rose $1.13, or 1 percent, to $116.12 after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates, although its revenue was shy of expectations.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen significant decreases in a company\u2019s ability to deliver on earnings this quarter,\u201d said Kristina Hooper, head of portfolio strategies at Allianz Global Investors. \u201cHowever, we\u2019ve also seen signs that the top-line growth we\u2019ve been looking for is starting to emerge.\u201d She added: \u201cSeeing a broad-based top-line growth trend would really speak to the health of the economy.

{"Headline": "Text and Video of the G.O.P. Response to Obama\u2019s Speech", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byREPRESENTATIVE CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS (R-Wash.): What an honor it is for me to be with you after the president\u2019s State of the Union.Tonight we honor America, a nation that has witnessed the greatest rise of freedom and opportunity our world has ever seen, a nation where we are not defined by our limits but by our potential, and a nation where a girl who worked at the McDonald\u2019s drive-through to help pay for college can be with you from the United States Capitol.But the most important moments right now aren\u2019t happening here. They\u2019re not in the Oval Office or in the House Chamber. They\u2019re in your homes, kissing your kids good night, figuring out how to pay the bills, getting ready for tomorrow\u2019s doctor\u2019s visit, waiting to hear from those you love serving in Afghanistan or searching for that big job interview. After all, we the people have been the foundation of America since her earliest days, people from all walks of life and from all corners of the world, people who come to America because here no challenge is too great and no dream too big. That\u2019s the genius of America.Tonight the president made more promises that sound good but won\u2019t actually solve the problems facing Americans. We want you to have a better life. The president wants that too. But we part ways when it comes to how to make that happen. So tonight I\u2019d like to share a more hopeful Republican vision, one that empowers you, not the government. It\u2019s one that champions free markets and trusts people to make their own decisions, not a government that decides for you. It helps working families rise above the limits of poverty and protects our most vulnerable, and it\u2019s one where Washington plays by the same rule that you do. It\u2019s a vision that is fair and offers the promise of a better future for every American.If you would have told me as a little girl that I would one day put my hand on the Bible and be sworn in as the 200th woman to serve in the House of Representatives, I wouldn\u2019t have thought it possible. I grew up working on my family\u2019s orchard and fruit stand in Kettle Falls, a small town in eastern Washington, getting up before dawn with my brother to pick apples.My dad drove a school bus and my mom worked as a part-time bookkeeper. They taught me to work hard, help others, and always, always dream for more.So, when I showed my 4H animals at the county fair, my parents used to say to me, \u201cCathy, you need to save this money so you can go to college one day!\u201d And so I did -- I saved, I worked hard, and I became the first in my family to graduate from college.The chance to go from my Washington to this one was unexpected. I came to Congress to help empower people, not politicians; to grow the working middle class, not the government; and to ensure that everyone in this country can find a job. Because a job is so much more than a paycheck: It gives us purpose, dignity and the foundation to build a future.I was single when I was elected -- but it wasn\u2019t long before I met Brian, a retired Navy commander, and now we have three beautiful children, one who was born just eight weeks ago.Like all parents, we have high hopes and dreams for our children. But we also know what it\u2019s like to face challenges. Three days after our son was born, Cole, we got news no parent expects. Cole was diagnosed with Down syndrome. The doctors told us he could have endless complications, heart defects, even early Alzheimer\u2019s. They told us all the problems.But when we looked at our son, we saw only possibilities. We saw a gift from God. And today we see a 6-year-old boy who dances to Bruce Springsteen; who reads above grade level; and who is the best big brother in the world.We see all the things he can do, not those he can\u2019t.And Cole, and his sisters, Grace and Brynn, have only made me more determined to see the potential in every human life, that whether we\u2019re born with an extra 21st chromosome or without a dollar to our name, we are not defined by our limits, but by our potential, because our mission, not only as Republicans, but as Americans, is to once again to ensure that we are not bound by where we come from, but empowered by what we can become. That is the gap Republicans are working to close. It\u2019s the gap we all face: between where you are and where you want to be.The President talks a lot about income inequality, but the real gap we face today is one of opportunity inequality. And with this Administration\u2019s policies, that gap has become far too wide. We see this gap growing every single day. We see it in our neighbors who are struggling to find jobs, a husband who\u2019s now working just part-time, a child who drops out of college because she can\u2019t afford tuition, or parents who are outliving their life\u2019s savings.Last month, more Americans stopped looking for a job than found one. Too many people are falling further and further behind, because right now, the President\u2019s policies are making people\u2019s lives harder. Republicans have plans to close the gap, plans that focus on jobs first without more spending, government bailouts, and red tape. Every day, we\u2019re working to expand our economy, one manufacturing job, nursing degree and small business at a time.We have plans to improve our education and training systems so you have the choice to determine where your kids go to school, so college is affordable and skill training is modernized.And yes, it\u2019s time to honor our history of legal immigration. We\u2019re working on a step-by-step solution to immigration reform by first securing our borders and making sure America will always attract the best, brightest and hardest working from around the world.And with too many Americans living paycheck to paycheck, we have solutions to help you take home more of your pay, through lower taxes, cheaper energy costs and affordable health care.Not long ago I got a letter from Bette in Spokane, who had hoped the president\u2019s health care law would save her money but found out instead that her premiums were going up nearly $700 a month. We\u2019ve all talked to too many people who received cancellations notices they didn\u2019t expect or who can no longer see the doctors they always have. No, we shouldn\u2019t go back to the things -- the way things were, but this law is not working. Republicans believe health care choices should be yours, not the government\u2019s, and that whether you\u2019re a boy with Downs syndrome or a woman with breast cancer, you can find coverage and a doctor who will treat you.So we hope the President will join us in a year of real action by empowering people, not by making their lives harder with unprecedented spending, higher taxes and fewer jobs. As Republicans, we advance these plans every day because we believe in a government that trusts people and doesn\u2019t limit where you finish because of where you started. That is what we stand for. It\u2019s for an America that is every bit as compassionate as it is exceptional.If we\u2019re successful, years from now our children will say that we rebuilt the American dream. We built a working middle class that could take in anyone, and a work force that could take on the world. Whether you\u2019re a girl in Kettle Falls or a boy from Brooklyn, our children should be able to say that we closed the gap. Our plan is one that dreams big for everyone and turns its back on no one.The president said many things tonight. But now I ask him to listen to you, for the true state of the union lies in your heart and in your home.Tomorrow I\u2019ll watch my son Cole get on the school bus. Others will wait in the doctor\u2019s office, or interview for that first job. Some of us will celebrate new beginnings. Others will face great challenges. But all of us will wake up and do what is uniquely American. We will look forward to the boundless potential that lies ahead. We will give thanks to the brave men and women who have answered America\u2019s call to freedom, like Sergeant Jacob Hess from Spokane, who recently gave his life to protect all of ours. So tonight I simply offer a prayer, a prayer for Sergeant Hess\u2019s family, your family and for our larger American family, that with the guidance of God, we may prove -- proves ourselves worthy of His blessings of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. For when we embrace these gifts, we are each doing our part to form a more perfect union.May God guide you and our president, and may God continue to bless the United States of America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Central Bank Aggressively Raises Rates", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Turkey\u2019s central bank aggressively raised rates late Tuesday, in a drastic move aimed at bolstering the currency. But it is unclear whether the move will be enough to satisfy international investors and repair the central bank\u2019s reputation.Turkey is facing increased political and economic pressure to take action. The Turkish lira has been among the most battered of developing-market currencies in recent weeks. After the central bank\u2019s decision, the lira strengthened in after-hours trading.\u201cRecent domestic and external developments are having an adverse impact on risk perceptions, leading to a significant depreciation in the Turkish lira and a pronounced increase in the risk premium,\u201d the central bank said in a statement. \u201cThe central bank will implement necessary measures at its disposal to contain the negative impact of these developments on inflation and macroeconomic stability.\u201dTurkey is battling a crisis of confidence in the global markets.Along with Argentina, Ukraine and Thailand, Turkey\u2019s domestic problems were more or less tolerated by international investors when the world was awash in cheap money. But now that the Federal Reserve has begun withdrawing its stimulus to the American economy, investors are taking a closer look and punishing countries like Turkey where there is both political turmoil and a monetary policy widely considered unsound by international economists.\u201cAlthough the Fed triggered the sell-off, the underlying problems are homegrown, and investors are starting to pay more attention to these domestic problems,\u201d said Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, a consulting firm. \u201cTurkey is a glaring example.\u201dThe Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey said in a statement Monday that it would meet Tuesday evening, three weeks ahead of schedule, \u201cto discuss recent developments and take the necessary policy measures for price stability.\u201dAt the emergency meeting, the central bank increased a series of short-term interest rates. It increased the marginal funding rate, an overnight rate, to 12 percent, from 7.75 percent.The moves are intended to help country\u2019s currency. Higher interest rates tend to push up the value of the lira, by offering a greater return on investments denominated in the Turkish currency.Ahead of the central bank meeting, Turkey\u2019s currency, the lira, rose more than 1 percent against the United States dollar to about 44 cents on Tuesday. In the previous two months, it had lost about 14 percent of its value, hitting a record low Monday. A weak lira raises the cost of imported goods, like oil for Turkish corporations, pushing up inflation and hurting growth.\u201cWe buy fabric and yarn in U.S. dollars, so our prices went up dramatically on a daily basis in recent weeks,\u201d said Zeynep Demir, 21, a textile worker. \u201cIn February, we were supposed to have a raise, but now I think of ways to cut down my expenses.\u201dMonetary policy in Turkey is highly politicized. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is in the middle of a corruption scandal and faces increasing criticism both at home and abroad for his attempt to curb press freedoms and enact other authoritarian policies. Mr. Erdogan has spoken darkly of a foreign interest rate lobby that he accuses of being determined to push up rates and stifle growth.Hours before the emergency meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Erdogan reaffirmed his opposition to any increase in interest rates. \u201cI\u2019m against increasing interest rates today as always, but have no jurisdiction over the central bank,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said in a televised statement.But Mr. Spiro said investors would not be satisfied unless the central bank, which is perceived as being susceptible to pressure from Mr. Erdogan, promised to continue raising interest rates as much as needed to defend the lira\u2019s value.\u201cMarkets want a firm commitment to mount a proper interest rate defense of the lira come what may,\u201d Mr. Spiro said. But, he said, \u201cthis is not a central bank prepared to give the market everything it wants.\u201dSince the middle of last year, when the Federal Reserve sent tremors through international financial markets by announcing that it would pull back from its bond-buying program, Turkey has become a charter member of the \u201cfragile five\u201d \u2014 the finance industry\u2019s recently minted nickname for emerging economies with vulnerable currencies.Other countries in this club include Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia and India. Such countries are highly dependent on skittish foreign investors to finance their growth ambitions. The Fed\u2019s plans, which portended higher interest rates in the United States, made dollar-denominated debt seem more attractive compared with the higher-yield, higher-risk debt of the fragile five.None of those other emerging markets, though, are as dependent as Turkey is on short-term dollar borrowing \u2014 which, unlike longer-term loans, can be quickly pulled by nervous lenders.According to economists at Barclays in London, Turkey must borrow more than $200 billion this year from abroad, the equivalent of about 25 percent of its economic output, with the bulk of that money coming from corporations and banks. If those credit lines are cut, Turkey will run out of cash and will most likely need to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.Although foreign investors demand high yields on their money to put it in fragile economies like Turkey\u2019s, the Turkish central bank has been under pressure to keep interest rates artificially low \u2014 effectively they are around 8 percent, which is high by Western standards but in Turkey is about the level of inflation \u2014 to keep the economy growing in a year of crucial local elections.The Turkish economy grew an estimated 4.3 percent last year, according to the World Bank, up from 2.2 percent in 2012. But there was concern about inflation, which the International Monetary Fund estimated would average 8 percent in 2013.Now, Investors are skittish. According to figures from the Institute of International Finance, a trade group for the global banking industry, since last May foreign investors sold $3.9 billion more of bonds denominated in Turkish lira than they have purchased.For a seven-month period, that is an unusually large net outflow of foreign money. It highlights the extent to which many foreign lenders, who have played a significant role in financing the country\u2019s growth, have changed their view on Turkey, since the political protests in Istanbul last spring.So far, unlike its fellow \u201cfragile five\u201d members, Turkey has been fairly passive in defending the lira. But now the bank is under pressure to act.\u201cThey need to raise rates above inflation,\u201d said Michael Harris, an investment analyst at Merrill Lynch in London who focuses on Turkey and other countries in emerging Europe and the Middle East. If the bank is able to convince the market that it is serious about defending the lira, Mr. Harris said, there is no reason the lira cannot \u201cremain a store of value\u201d for local and foreign investors.Still, skeptics point out that the while the country\u2019s foreign currency reserves seem sizable enough at over $100 billion, such a store can run down very quickly if Turkish deposit holders and corporations join foreign investors and exchange their liras for dollars.Mr. Erdogan may be willing to accept some increases in official interest rates to contain inflation. But the question is whether it will be enough to reassure investors that the central bank is committed to supporting the lira, other analysts said.On Tuesday, the central bank said it would remain vigilant, saying any new data or information may prompt it to rethink its position. In particular, inflation remained a concern.\u201cTight monetary policy stance will be sustained until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook,\u201d the central bank said in a statement. \u201cUnder this policy stance, inflation is expected to reach the 5 percent target by mid-2015.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Activist\u2019s Lawyers Call His Trial Unfair", "Date": "2014-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The central actors in the trial of one of China\u2019s most influential legal activists remained largely silent on Wednesday morning to protest what they said were flaws in the country\u2019s politicized judiciary.The activist, Xu Zhiyong, 40, and his two lawyers decided that there was no point waging a legal fight against prosecutors\u2019 claims that Mr. Xu had disrupted public order by organizing protests during which participants unfurled banners demanding social justice and meaningful constraints on corruption.\u201cThese hearings ignore basic legal precepts, so there\u2019s no way my client can get a fair trial,\u201d one of the lawyers, Zhang Qingfang, said on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s just a piece of theater, which is why we will remain silent.\u201dA legal defender once praised by the state news media, Mr. Xu faces five years in prison if convicted, an outcome that is all but certain.His trial in Beijing is widely seen as an effort by the new Chinese leadership to quash growing public demands for political overhaul at a time when a cooling economy has made officials skittish about the potential for social unrest.Lawyers for the jailed New Citizens Movement members \u2014 including, in addition to Mr. Xu, seven who will go on trial in the coming days \u2014 said they had little doubt that the verdicts had been predetermined. \u201cWhether we are even in the courtroom to defend our clients makes no difference,\u201d said Chen Jiangang, who represents two men scheduled to stand trial on Monday at a separate courthouse in the capital. \u201cWe lawyers have been shackled and gagged.\u201dViewed against President Xi Jinping\u2019s vows to improve judicial fairness, the complaints by Mr. Chen and other lawyers highlight the challenges the Chinese authorities face in using the courts to contain the New Citizens Movement.Judicial officials have told defense lawyers that they will be barred from cross-examining prosecution witnesses and from calling witnesses of their own: legal procedures recently advocated by the nation\u2019s top court. Legal experts also said the authorities were violating Chinese law by holding separate trials, a move they said was intended to prevent the defendants from providing testimony that could be useful to one another\u2019s defense.Mr. Wang could not immediately be reached for comment.Jerome A. Cohen, an expert on Chinese law at New York University, said that by barring the public and the news media from the trials, the authorities were proving hollow the promises of Mr. Xi and his newly appointed Supreme Court chief, Zhou Qiang, to curtail wrongful convictions. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any connection to what they are preaching and what is being practiced,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of Alice in Wonderland absurdity to these proceedings.\u201dAccording to a person who attended Mr. Xu\u2019s trial, both of his lawyers declined to cooperate with prosecutors.Officials chose an especially snug courtroom, the person said, with just 18 chairs, and refused to give seats to several foreign diplomats who showed up. Mr. Xu\u2019s wife and sister were the only family members allowed entry.On Wednesday evening, a statement that Mr. Xu had reportedly tried to read in court began circulating online. \u201cDeep in your hearts, you are terrified \u2014 terrified of having open trials that citizens can freely attend, terrified of your names appearing on the Internet, terrified of the free society that is coming,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are citizens, the masters of this country, not its subjects or lackeys, rabble or a mob.\u201dReached by telephone on Wednesday night, Zhang Qingfang, the lawyer, confirmed that Mr. Xu had written the 50-minute statement but said he had only been able to read about 10 minutes of it before the presiding judge stopped him, saying it was irrelevant to the case.Eva Pils, a legal scholar at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the timing was noteworthy given that politically delicate trials in China often take place during Christmas, when many foreign journalists are on vacation. The scheduling of the New Citizens Movement trials just before the Lunar New Year, she said, pointed to official anxiety about Mr. Xu and his cause. \u201cTo those involved in this movement, it suggests that the authorities are more concerned about the domestic reaction, which perhaps presents a ray of hope for the movement,\u201d she said.Such fears are not unfounded, at least judging from the tenacity of those who braved the gantlet of police officers to gather near the courthouse on Wednesday morning, carrying banners decrying \u201cinjustice\u201d and shouting slogans against corruption. One participant, Yu Chunxiang, 61, a veteran petitioner from Shanghai, said she wanted to show party leaders that jailing Mr. Xu and his associates would be futile. \u201cYou can keep putting people in prison, but behind them are thousands of others who are willing to take their place in the fight for justice,\u201d she said.As she finished speaking, the police swooped in and hustled the remaining protesters into a line of waiting vans, but Ms. Yu escaped.Chris Buckley contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Joining the New Trade Club", "Date": "2014-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThere is a last-minute rush by three advanced economies in East Asia to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that could be concluded this spring. Japan barely made the deadline to become a negotiating member last summer, while Taiwan and South Korea have announced interest in joining once a trade pact is established.The trade talks began in 2010, and there are now 12 members: the United States, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, New Zealand, Australia, Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia and Japan. They account for 40 percent of the world economy.The interests of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea are not about reducing barriers to trade, which are already low. And South Korea, for one, will soon enjoy bilateral free trade agreements with all the economies in the Trans-Pacific Partnership except Japan and Mexico.The partnership is of interest because it is more than a trade deal. Members will be asked to review and restructure the way their domestic economies function, with new rules covering intellectual property rights, regulatory coherence, environmental standards, labor practices and state-owned enterprises. It turns out, for instance, that Japan is eager to restructure the economically inefficient yet politically powerful agricultural sector, and hopes the new rules will help it do so. South Korea wants to use partnership to liberalize its economy, now dominated by 30 family-owned conglomerates, including Samsung and Hyundai, that generate 80 percent of its domestic product. Moreover, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea are mature societies, with older, traditional economic structure. The hope is that foreign pressure can accelerate the difficult task of restructuring and challenging vested interests.For many of the same reasons, it would make sense for China to join the partnership. China recently announced that it would adopt more market mechanisms in an effort to reduce the economic distortions, inefficiencies and corruption of its economy dominated by monopolistic state-owned enterprises. And the partnership itself would make more sense with Chinese membership.But there are pitfalls. Japan, Taiwan and South Korea want to ease rigid labor practices to make their economies more dynamic. There lies the danger of introducing income inequalities in what are now solidly middle-class societies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Search of Europe\u2019s Growth Stories", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFundamentallyALTHOUGH mutual and exchange-traded funds that invest in Europe recently posted strong results for the second consecutive year, the rally has largely been two-dimensional.On the one hand, investors have been bidding up shares of dominant European-based multinationals \u2014 like the food giant Nestl\u00e9 or the spirits maker Diageo \u2014 that derive most of their revenue from abroad. This strategy has allowed investors to maintain exposure to the Continent while largely circumventing the region\u2019s ailing economy.At the same time, bargain-hunters have been keying in on dividend-paying shares of slow-growing companies that have been disproportionately or unfairly punished for the region\u2019s fiscal troubles.Indeed, some of the best-performing segments of the European market last year were traditional growth sectors, such as consumer stocks, which rose by an average of 31.2 percent; technology stocks, up 28.1 percent; and industrial stocks, up 25.7 percent. Those figures compare with a 20.7 percent gain for the broad MSCI Europe index.He said that many European companies were benefiting from a combination of factors, including a healing global economy, improving if modest growth in their home region, and intensive cost-cutting efforts in recent years that will pay benefits in revenue gains as Europe emerges from recession. \u201cJust a few points of revenue growth for these companies can translate into big gains for the bottom line,\u201d he said.Mr. Mills argues that strong companies can be found even in some of the region\u2019s most challenged economies, such as Italy and France. A case in point is Legrand, the French maker of electrical equipment and data networks for homes and office buildings. Even as the company\u2019s sales have declined in France and Italy, its profit margins in those markets have actually increased as a result of management\u2019s cost-cutting efforts. The company, meanwhile, is seeing healthy sales growth in other parts of the world.Legrand shares, which Mr. Mills\u2019s fund owns, rose nearly 29 percent last year, matching the gain of the typical European stock fund.A more traditional growth story, he said, is found in a company like ASML, the Dutch maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment that sells globally. Its earnings are expected to climb nearly 25 percent annually for the next several years, and its shares were up more than 46 percent in 2013.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want to own anything that\u2019s entirely dependent on Europe for demand,\u201d he said.For instance, his fund, which has outperformed 70 percent of its peers over the past five years, owns shares of the luxury automaker BMW. The company counts Germany and the rest of Europe as its biggest market, yet North America and China account for roughly 40 percent of sales.Mr. Walsh noted that in Europe, the auto market has yet to recover from the financial crisis as much as it has in the United States. Last year, European sales by all carmakers were below 13 million units, versus a peak of more than 15.5 million for passenger vehicles in 2007. If the European economy continues to disappoint, BMW can rely on faster growth from places like China and the emerging markets. If Europe does rebound, that will be icing on the cake, he said.A similar example in Mr. Walsh\u2019s portfolio is WPP, the advertising and public relations firm based in London. This global media giant generates around a third of its revenue from Britain and the rest of Europe, yet its earnings are still expected to grow 11.5 percent a year for the next three to five years, versus around 8 percent earnings growth for the broad European stock market.ANOTHER way to hedge a bet on European growth is to focus on companies where management has recently made strategic moves to bolster profit margins or market share, managers say.An example is Svenska Handelsbanken, a Swedish bank that over the past decade has established a strong presence in Britain. \u201cWhile lots of U.K. banks have suffered and have had to pull back in certain markets,\u201d he said, \u201cHandelsbanken has stepped in and been able to grow and take share in the U.K.\u201d Lewis Altfest, a financial planner, said investors might be too pessimistic in their assessment of Europe\u2019s economy. European business leaders are doing pretty much what their American counterparts started doing several years ago, he argues, by aggressively cutting costs, jettisoning less profitable units and focusing on core businesses that are delivering the strongest cash flow. \u201cI think Europe\u2019s economy will surprise people on the upside,\u201d he said, \u201cand because companies have done such a good job controlling costs, that will result in surprising gains in profitability.\u201dThis could just be a sign that European companies simply aren\u2019t as efficient as those in the United States. But at least there\u2019s hope. The European companies may still have some room to run when it comes to cutting costs to become more profitable, he said.Paul J.

{"Headline": "Quebec\u2019s Multiculturalism Debate", "Date": "2014-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersEver since the Quebec government proposed its Charter of Values, people have punctuated the social debate with examples of other countries\u2019 policies to back up their positions. While Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lis\u00e9e and other members of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois scoff at \u201cfailed\u201d British multiculturalism policies, critics of their bill reply by pointing to the ghettoization of French cities following the implementation of strict la\u00efcit\u00e9. While neither model is perfect, it might be time we stop invoking oversimplified examples rather than addressing, in specific terms, the ways in which the Charter of Values will affect the lives of Quebecers.First, we should see the suspicious gap between the principles used to defend the Charter of Values and the legislative intent behind it. The most striking case might be the gap between the feminist rhetoric the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois employs and the specific discrimination against women of religious minorities that the bill commands. Let us be clear: The ban will hinder the employment of thousands of women, some of them among the most vulnerable of Quebec society. Women will lose jobs. Women will be sent home. Can such prejudicial measures, based on fear, be labeled feminist? Can they be deemed progressive?The Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\u2019s position is informed by a shocking oversimplification of the complex set of norms regulating veiling practices. In their rhetoric, only two extreme options can motivate the choice to wear a hijab: blind submission to a patriarchal institution from which we must liberate them or complete demonstration of religious piety that they ought to refrain from. Is this the \u201crigorous, progressive and modern\u201d secularism that Quebec should be so proud of?Moreover, when elaborating on the conspicuous religious symbols ban, Mr. Lis\u00e9e conveniently gives \u201cthe examples of the Muslim hijab, the Sikh turban and the Christian cross.\u201d Oddly enough, he omits the Jewish kippa, the prohibition of which will cause tremendous problems for wide sectors of the population.(In an irony of history, the Montreal-based Jewish General Hospital was founded partly in reaction to the rise of anti-Semitic sentiment \u2014 Jewish doctors were not permitted to practice in other Quebec hospitals at the time \u2014 with the purpose of providing a safe space for patients of all faiths and cultures. Not surprisingly considering the extent to which the Charter of Values\u2019 dress code would affect its operations, the hospital has vowed to defy these measures.)Mr. Lis\u00e9e finds it odd that people who are opposed to his position do not \u201cbalk at the current ban, for all government workers, on the expression of other social or political beliefs through their attire.\u201d His analogy, while not void of any value, doesn\u2019t hold water. There is a fundamental difference between political and religious neutrality in the public administration. The state\u2019s public administration is enabled by a governing party, which has to keep its executive functions and electoral interests separate.By contrast, wearing a religious symbol out of personal faith does not affect the impartiality of the services rendered, unless any individual departing from the majority norm is de facto seen with suspicion. It is also a bit absurd to imply that the sacrifice of not wearing your preferred party\u2019s colors or slogans at work is of the same magnitude as the sacrifice of renouncing your religious faith from 9 to 5.Of course, people should be able to freely defend this bill without being labeled Islamophobes. Likewise, others should be able to attack it without being labeled na\u00efve. There is an intermediate position to be held between oblivious relativism and institutionalized intolerance. This intermediate position has been the pride of Quebec, a province that built its own integration policy around the importance of balancing the protection of individual freedoms and the preservation of common values. The picture drawn by Mr. Lis\u00e9e in no way corresponds to the majority voice of Quebec. In fact, might we remind him that his minority government does not speak for the majority, as evidenced by the massive opposition to this bill.Pascale Fournier, OttawaThe writer holds the University of Ottawa research chair in legal pluralism and comparative law.\u00a0The Charter of Values has three crucial defects: It discriminates against citizens from a non-Christian background, it deepens divisions between Quebecers and sets them against each other, and it undermines democracy by using the power of the state to benefit the majority at the expense of the minority.If adopted, the charter would prohibit individuals working for any organization subsidized by the government (day care, school, university, clinic or hospital) from wearing \u201costentatious\u201d religious symbols like a turban, hijab, kippa or oversized cross. At the same time, it would entitle the National Assembly to decide whether to maintain the presence of Catholic religious artifacts \u2014 the crucifix that hangs above the speaker\u2019s chair in the National Assembly in Quebec, the cross that stands on top of Mount Royal in Montreal \u2014 on the grounds that the crucifix and cross belong to the cultural heritage of Quebec.In other words, it forces minority groups to remove the symbols that their religions command them to wear and allows the majority to keep their own symbols in place when they are part of public buildings or parks. Aside from infringing on a basic human right, the freedom to worship freely, the prohibition against religious symbols and dress clearly aims to limit the visual presence of non-Christian minorities. The government wants to maintain a landscape of crosses as a common cultural heritage but to erase the visibility of non-Christian faiths in the public sphere.By seeking to regulate religious practice in a discriminatory way, the government has pitted Quebecers against one another; it has created strong tensions where generally there was peace. The incidence of attacks (mostly verbal) against Muslim women wearing head scarves has increased sharply. Members of minority cultures feel less at home. Will the charter, if passed, further exclude already marginalized people, in particular Muslim women, from the public sphere? Already some secular Montrealers have begun wearing hijabs or kippas to express opposition to the charter. Will the law increase adoption of religious types of dress by turning them into emblems of political dissent?The charter undermines Quebec\u2019s values and its reputation for progressivism. In sponsoring the charter, the government is shifting attention and resources away from some very serious problems facing Quebec today, including a lagging economy and long waiting lists for hospital services. For the many residents of Quebec who lack a family doctor, being the patient of a qualified physician in a turban, hijab or kippa would be a cause for celebration, not complaint.For Mr. Lis\u00e9e, Montreal and its multiculturalism are a problem and the Charter of Values a solution. The opposite is true. The multicultural reality of Montreal shows the power that resides in the creative interaction of diverse people in a public sphere open to all.Eve Sanders, Montreal\u00a0Mr. Lis\u00e9e is being economical with the truth when he asserts that his party has reached a decision to remove the large crucifix currently hanging in the Quebec National Assembly. His Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois first announced that the crucifix would remain because it was not a religious symbol but part of Quebec\u2019s cultural heritage. The current proposal in the bill before the National Assembly would leave it up to the legislature to decide. As this body will undoubtedly vote to keep the crucifix where it is, the specious claim that the Charter of Values will defend the religious neutrality of the state is revealed. Some religious symbols, it seems, are more neutral than others.Stephen L. Black Sherbrooke, Quebec\u00a0It should be kept firmly in mind when reading his arguments that Mr. Lis\u00e9e represents a political party that seeks to break up Canada. Thankfully, Quebec\u2019s population has twice voted in favor of remaining part of Canada in referendums with very high voter turnouts.From coast to coast, Canada is as vast as it is diverse \u2014 culturally, economically and linguistically. Canada\u2019s federal system allows for the diversity among its provinces to thrive and make the country as a whole stronger. Most Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois know that while Quebec may find distinct solutions to the issues most jurisdictions face, it also finds within the Canadian federation the flexibility to develop and assert itself, as well as the political and economic stability that\u2019s necessary to move forward, even more so during these tough economic times.Indeed, Quebec\u2019s divergent policy positions enumerated by Mr. Lis\u00e9e are made possible because of Canada\u2019s decentralized build. Our forebears, including the great George-\u00c9tienne Cartier, had the intelligence and foresight to craft a Constitution that has made the very idea of Canada powerful and resistant. It is the idea that two founding peoples can assert their distinctive religious and linguistic makeup and yet thrive as one country.Not only does the Canadian Constitution leave it to the provinces to design and implement their own policies in such critical areas as health care, education, environment and civil rights, but Canada\u2019s economic strengths are a formidable lever for the provinces themselves. A striking and particularly recent example of this is the comprehensive free-trade agreement that Canada reached with the European Union, which will create thousands of new jobs in Quebec alone.Negotiating this agreement, for which the Quebec government was fully consulted and was a constructive partner, was possible because of what Canada offers the European Union as a country \u2014 including the removal of roughly 99 percent of tariffs throughout Canada.Further to this, Canada\u2019s current economic situation and its enticing prospects are more than worthy of mention. Since the worst of the 2008 global economic downturn, Canada has been leading all Group of 7 nations in job creation, economic growth and its debt-to-G.D.P. ratio. Our banking system is constantly recognized as the world\u2019s strongest and most robust. Our trade relationships are expanding and several of our industries are blossoming, creating jobs and growth throughout our vast country.Quebec is stronger because it is part of Canada; stronger because Canada\u2019s constitutional framework gives it the flexibility to implement its own policies in a number of areas; and stronger still because of Canada\u2019s vigorous economy.Denis Lebel, OttawaThe writer is minister of infrastructure, communities and intergovernmental affairs, and minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec.\u00a0Mr. Lis\u00e9e misinterprets the republican ideals of Jefferson. The Jeffersonian principle of the separation of church and state was intended to prevent the establishment of a state religion or the prohibition of religious expression. Mr. Lis\u00e9e confuses that ideal with his party\u2019s plan to strip religious minorities of their identity by preventing them from obtaining basic social services (\u201cunless they have their face uncovered,\u201d as the bill stipulates) or working for the government (if they do not comply \u201cwith the restriction on wearing religious objects that overtly indicate a religious affiliation\u201d).Quebec wants to impose secularism on its workers and clients, which is a form of state-sanctioned religious coercion. Quebecers would be forced to choose between employment, essential government services and their deeply held personal beliefs. The Charter of Values would have a prejudicial effect on non-Francophones, newcomers and minorities who are currently vastly underrepresented in Quebec\u2019s civil service and suffer from lower employment rates and income than other Quebecers. The proposed charter would compound these issues and penalize populations that require assistance and understanding.Mr. Lis\u00e9e claims that Canada\u2019s Constitution, adopted in 1982, has \u201cde facto authority over the province.\u201d But \u201cde facto\u201d implies that an authority rules without legal foundation or basis. This is a shocking claim coming from a minister of the Crown. The Canadian Constitution is, of course, \u201cde jure\u201d \u2014 meaning that state authority operates within the rule of law and was established upon solid legal foundations. This was ruled upon twice by the Supreme Court of Canada during constitutional negotiations.While there are concerns about mass immigration and multiculturalism in Quebec and Canada, they are generally focused on ensuring the effective social and economic inclusion of newcomers in our societies, not inventing new ways to coerce them to leave their fundamental beliefs at the door. I hope all Quebecers will stand up against the Charter of Values and for equal rights, basic human rights, and freedom of religion for all Quebecers as defined under Quebec, Canadian and international law.Colin Standish, Quebec\u00a0Separation of church and state refers to the state not forcing any religious views on the populace. The clothing accessories worn by government employees (this includes teachers, doctors and nurses) do not push any point of view on the recipients of services. In fact, one of the busiest hospitals in Montreal is staffed by health professionals from all walks of life, including those wearing turbans, hijabs, kippas and large crosses. The very women whom the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois claims to be protecting will, in fact, be hurt by this charter. Women who choose to wear the hijab will either be ghettoized, by being forced to work only within their own communities, or will be forced to not work at all.Not only is Quebec risking a serious brain drain of many fine teachers, health care workers and academics, it also may come to be seen by the rest of the world as an intolerant society. Those of us in favor of inclusion can only hope that common sense will prevail and that this bill will be defeated in the spring.Judy Glass, Montreal\u00a0The overwhelming majority of political analysts in Quebec and the rest of Canada have pointed out that Mr. Lis\u00e9e and the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois are engaging in a dangerous game of mobilizing ethnic nationalism in the hopes of winning a majority in the next election. The added bonus for the current government is that the eroding social climate caused by the charter will push minority groups out of Quebec to other parts of Canada, meaning Quebec\u2019s independence movement will rid itself of those pesky immigrants and foreigners who have an attachment to Canada and are more likely to vote no in a future referendum.In 2009 President Nicolas Sarkozy of France criticized Quebec\u2019s independence movement for trying to build an identity constructed on complete opposition to the province\u2019s linguistic and cultural minorities. \u201cDo you really believe that the world, with the unprecedented crisis that it is going through, needs division, needs hatred?\u201d Mr. Sarkozy asked. We are all still waiting for an answer.Kyle Matthews, MontrealThe author is a senior deputy director of the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies at Concordia University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Workers of the World, Faint!", "Date": "2014-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2014 Just over two years ago, at the Anful Garments Factory in Kompong Speu Province, a young worker named Chanthul and 250 of her colleagues collapsed in a collective spell of fainting. They had to be hospitalized; the production line shut down.Two days later, the factory was back up, and the mass faintings struck again. A worker started barking commands in a language that sounded like Chinese and, claiming to speak in the name of an ancestral spirit, demanded offerings of raw chicken. None were forthcoming, and more workers fell down. Peace, and production, resumed only after factory owners staged an elaborate ceremony, offering up copious amounts of food, cigarettes and Coca-Cola to the spirit.This episode, however bizarre, was not singular. In the past few years, Cambodia has experienced a slew of mass faintings among garment workers: One after the other, hundreds of women have fallen to the floor of their factories in a dizzy spell called duol sonlap in the Khmer language. The swooning has been attributed, variously, to heat, anemia, overwork, underventilation, chemical fumes and food poisoning. But according to one group of medical anthropologists and psychologists who have studied the phenomenon, two-thirds of these episodes are associated with accounts of possession by local guardian spirits, known as neak ta.The mass faintings have paralyzed production, to the consternation of the government, factory owners and international clothing retailers. The United States opened its market to Cambodian exports in the 1990s, and the garment industry in Cambodia has since become a $5 billion-a-year business. According to the country\u2019s Garment Manufacturers Association, there are now over 600 garment factories, most owned by Taiwanese, Korean, Chinese, Hong Kong and Singaporean companies. Many were hastily erected on the dusty outskirts of Phnom Penh and in a few other free-trade zones \u2014 on land where people believe neak ta have lived for generations.Although Theravada Buddhism has been the official religion of Cambodia since the 13th century, it never supplanted the existing pantheon of ancestral spirits, local gods and Brahamanic deities. Perhaps the most important of these is the neak ta, a spirit strongly associated with a specific natural feature \u2014 a rock, a tree, a patch of soil. These spirits represent a village-based morality and are inseparable from the land. This connection is so strong that in past times even some kings were seen to be merely renting the land from neak ta.Like those kings of old, Cambodia\u2019s deeply superstitious prime minister, Hun Sen, in power for almost three decades, calls on land and water spirits to curse his enemies. Most Cambodians today, while Buddhist, ply spirits with tea and buns at small altars.These days, when neak ta appear on the factory floor \u2014 inducing mass faintings among workers and shouting commands at managers \u2014 they are helping the cause of Cambodia\u2019s largely young, female and rural factory workforce by registering a kind of bodily objection to the harsh daily regimen of industrial capitalism: few days off; a hard bed in a wooden barracks; meager meals of rice and a mystery curry, hastily scarfed down between shifts. These voices from beyond are speaking up for collective bargaining in the here and now, expressing grievances much like the workers\u2019 own: a feeling that they are being exploited by forces beyond their control, that the terms of factory labor somehow violate an older, fairer moral economy.Early last year, I met a 31-year-old woman called Sreyneang, a worker at Canadia Industrial Park, west of Phnom Penh. She had recently caused dozens of her co-workers to collapse after speaking in the voice of a neak ta. While entranced, she had also assaulted the president of the factory\u2019s government-aligned union, pounding him with her fists and pelting him with insults.We chatted on the dirt floor of the tiny wooden house where she lived; there was nowhere else to sit. She said she had been feeling ill on the day of the fainting, and that the factory nurse had refused to let her go home. She did not remember most of what had happened next, but a spirit healer later explained that a neak ta had entered her, infuriated that a banyan tree on the factory site which had been his home for centuries was chopped down, with neither ritual propitiation nor apology, during the construction of the building.A few months after that event, something similar happened at a sporting-goods factory near the capital that was said to have been haunted ever since it opened in August 2012. Female workers asked their supervisor, a man named Ah Kung, if they could hold a ceremony and offer a chicken to a neak ta angered at being displaced from the site. He refused. Two days later, the spirit entered the body of a young female worker, Sreymom, and claiming, in her voice, to have been \u201clooked down upon,\u201d began shouting in a mixture of Khmer and short, quick syllables her colleagues took to be Chinese. Several dozen other workers lost consciousness and had to be treated at a local clinic.\u201cWhen she was possessed, she just pointed around everywhere,\u201d one eyewitness explained afterward. \u201cShe said, \u2018I want to meet Ah Kung.\u2019 She said, \u2018I want to meet him because I lived here a very long time and he never respected me and this is my land.\u201d\u2019 When Ah Kung arrived, the bystander said, \u201cHe came out and knelt down in front of her and offered whatever the neak ta asked.\u201dWhat the spirit was asking for was respect. He demanded that an altar be built and that ritual offerings be made to him there four times a month. He demanded that the owner roast a pig for him and throw a Khmer New Year party for the workers. The owner complied. The faintings stopped.In other times and places, ethnographers have also noted seemingly magical manifestations when indigenous populations first confront industrial capitalism. As the manufacture of linen intensified in northern Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, household spirits began to appear in textile workshops in a more malevolent form. There was the story about the demonic imp Rumpelstiltskin, for example, who helped a young woman spin grotesque amounts of thread, but only in exchange for her firstborn. Other fairy tales sublimated the distress caused by the environmental and social costs of intensified flax production. The anthropologist Michael Taussig has written about Colombian peasants who were newly incorporated into wage labor on sugar cane plantations in the 1970s and reportedly sold their souls to the devil to increase their productivity.Aihwa Ong, another anthropologist, documented an outbreak of spirit possession in the 1970s among Malaysian women in Japanese-owned electronics factories. These workers often screamed hysterically and attacked their supervisors under the influence of a native spirit called a datuk. Ms. Ong interpreted these acts as a spiritual rebellion against the drudgery of factory life and the rupturing of the women\u2019s longstanding social ties as they migrated from villages to newly established free-trade zones.She also concluded that the spirit visitations did the women little good because they allowed the factory owners to cast the women\u2019s valid complaints about working conditions as mass hysteria.In Cambodia, the opposite seems to be true. Like Ms. Ong\u2019s subjects, the vast majority of garment workers here are female and young. Many are the first generation in their families to work outside their native rice-farming communities. They often send a large portion of their wages back home, and feel both lucky to be able to do this and desperate. \u201cThe conditions are terrible \u2014 very, very bad,\u201d Sreyneang told me as she described working six days a week to eke out $120 a month, without being allowed to take days off even when sick. \u201cThe factory has always been really strict.\u201dDespite efforts to diversify, the garment industry in Cambodia still makes up around 80 percent of the country\u2019s total exports. Because the economy is so vulnerable to instability in the sector, the government has often reacted harshly, even violently, to garment workers\u2019 efforts to unionize or take any collective action to ask for higher wages. During recent demonstrations, on Jan. 2 and 3, striking workers at Canadia Industrial Park and another factory near Phnom Penh were set upon by soldiers and military police; at least four were killed and dozens were injured.Cambodian workers frequently complain that they are forced to work overtime and threatened when they try to join independent unions rather than one of the many government- or factory-backed unions that have sprung up over the past decade. (For an estimated garment workforce of at least 450,000, by the International Labor Organization\u2019s tally, there are now over 400 unions, according to Solidarity Center, an international labor rights group.) Pro-government and pro-factory unions occupy most of the seats allotted to labor on the national committee that determines wage increases, and their dominance complicates collective bargaining.In September 2010, when the national minimum wage was $61 per month, some 200,000 workers took to the streets to ask for a raise. It was the largest-ever strike in the garment sector, but after just three days it came to an anticlimactic halt due to police violence and threats against union leaders. Hundreds of the striking workers were illegally fired in retaliation. The minimum wage remained the same.Then the neak ta appeared. Mass faintings in garment factories increased exponentially in early 2011, just a few months after the mass strike fizzled. Production lines shut down after the workers\u2019 bodies shut down, and spirits bargained with management on the factory floor.Public sentiment started to shift. During the 2010 strikes, few seemed preoccupied with workers\u2019 rights. Even the foreign media and the Asian Development Bank\u2019s chief economist wondered aloud whether the workers\u2019 demands would hurt the industry. But when the mass faintings began, concern for the workers grew: Were they earning enough to feed themselves? Were they being exposed to dangerous chemicals?Since then, basic pay for garment workers has risen from $61 to $80 per month, and is set to rise again to $100 in February. Numerous conferences on occupational health and safety have been convened. Individual factories, the consortium of garment producers and mass retailers like H&M have commissioned studies of working conditions in Cambodian factories. Garment workers have started to receive monthly bonuses for health and transportation.Not all improvements can be attributed to spirit visitations: The country\u2019s six independent unions have been fighting hard for wage increases. And working conditions still leave a great deal to be desired; labor rights advocates say that $160 a month is the minimum workers need to adequately feed and house themselves. But insofar as conditions have gotten better, it is partly because the factory-floor faintings have reframed the debate. The government\u2019s brutal repression of this month\u2019s strike has shown that it will still not tolerate large-scale collective bargaining. But mass swooning is a rare form of group action that can hardly be suppressed.And now neak ta have been showing up to defend other victims of development. The spirits have appeared at demonstrations and sit-ins organized by the political opposition, which has been contesting the results of elections held in July, which kept Hun Sen\u2019s governing party in power. At protests against urban dispossession in Phnom Penh, traditional animist curses are often levied at state institutions. Salt and chilies are hurled at courthouses, chickens are offered to spirits, mediums summon local gods to mete out justice in land disputes.Last year, in a slum in Phnom Penh, a demonstration by residents who were being evicted by a wealthy landlord was interrupted when a neak ta possessed an indigent woman who lived under a staircase with her mentally ill husband, both suffering from H.I.V. The woman assaulted a local official who was trying to shut down the protest, forcing him to stand down. Previously, the landlord had cut down an old banyan tree believed to be the neak ta\u2019s home.\u201cI have been protecting this area for a long time,\u201d the woman shouted, \u201cand I am very angry because the company demolished my house. I am very, very angry.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Mafia Legacy Taints the Earth in Southern Italy", "Date": "2014-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOfficials are trying to excavate toxic waste allegedly buried by the Camorra mafia in the Campania region of Southern Italy. Prime Minister Enrico Letta has approved a decree to increase prison sentences for illegally dumping or burning waste, and the government has announced that soldiers will conduct anti-dumping patrols.CASAL DI PRINCIPE, Italy \u2014 The Italian state arrived in the heartland of the Camorra mafia this month bearing a backhoe. Police officers in polished black boots posed for television cameras as the backhoe clawed into an overgrown field, searching for barrels of toxic waste or some other illegal industrial sarcophagi.Two jailed mafia informants had identified the field as one of the secret sites where the Camorra had buried toxic waste, near a region north of Naples known as the Triangle of Death because of the emergence of clusters of cancer cases. One environmental group estimates that 10 million tons of toxic garbage has been illegally buried here since the early 1990s, earning billions of dollars for the mafia even as toxic substances leached into the soil and the water table.While the dumping has been widely documented, the trash crisis has only worsened, as the parallel problem of the illegal burning of toxic waste has brought the region another nickname, the Land of Fires. With new revelations fueling public outrage, the question is whether the Italian government will confront the Camorra and clean up the mess \u2014 and whether the mess can be cleaned up at all.\u201cThe environment here is poisoned,\u201d said Dr. Alfredo Mazza, a cardiologist who documented an alarming rise in local cancer cases in a 2004 study published in the British medical journal The Lancet. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to clean it all up. The area is too vast.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe\u2019re living on top of a bomb.\u201dGarbage is a perennial problem in Italy as landfills run out of space, setting off periodic crises in cities like Rome and Naples. But the land of the Camorra, stretching from the Tyrrhenian Sea to the Apennine foothills, is a particularly vivid tableau of ruined beauty.Garbage is strewn along highways, tossed beneath overpasses or dumped atop irrigation canals. Rats search for food amid discarded sheets of asbestos, broken computer screens and empty paint cans. Plumes of black smoke often rise, the entrails of trash illegally burned from distant hillsides or abandoned fields.The landscape is a result of decades of secret dealings between manufacturers in Italy and beyond, who sought to avoid the high costs of legally disposing of hazardous waste, and the Camorra, one of Italy\u2019s three main mafia organizations, which saw the potential to make huge profits by disposing of it illegally.By burying the waste in its backyard near Naples and the surrounding region of Campania, where the Camorra was born, the mob ensured a measure of protection, and silence. Bosses often exert a powerful influence over the local economy and politicians, especially in small towns like Casal di Principe.\u201cThe mafia has made money on the garbage,\u201d said Ciro Tufano, 44, an accountant who has spent two decades pushing officials to clean up a toxic site near his home. \u201cPoliticians must have been aware, but they don\u2019t care. Nobody was tracking this trail of garbage.\u201dThe public has awakened in recent months, though, after a string of disclosures and protests that brought thousands of people onto the streets of Naples in November.Some revelations came from the declassified 1997 testimony of Carmine Schiavone, a former treasurer for the Casalesi clan, one of the most powerful Camorra factions. Speaking in secret to an investigative parliamentary committee, Mr. Schiavone had described nighttime operations in which mobsters wearing police uniforms supervised the burial of toxic garbage from as far away as Germany.\u201cWe are talking about millions of tons,\u201d Mr. Schiavone warned in his testimony 17 years ago, portraying an environmental disaster.Last month, Prime Minister Enrico Letta approved a decree to increase prison sentences for illegally dumping or burning waste. This month, the government announced that a contingent of Italian soldiers would conduct anti-dumping patrols in the region.\u201cThis is a response to an emergency situation,\u201d said Gen. Sergio Costa, commander of the Naples region for Italy\u2019s environmental police. \u201cPoliticians now have to respond because people are now marching on the streets.\u201dThe digging operation with the backhoe this month was supposed to demonstrate the government\u2019s newfound resolve. The location was just outside the usual parameters of the Triangle of Death dumping zone, but in a city synonymous with the Casalesi clan. Journalists were invited amid expectations that the backhoe would unearth canisters of hazardous waste. In 2008, a chemical truck had been discovered beneath a field a few miles away.But what emerged after hours was dirt and skepticism. Officials said later that digging would continue for weeks and that quantities of asbestos and mud tainted by industrial waste had already been recovered. The owner of the land, Stanislao Di Bello, a lawyer who bought the plot in 1990 as an investment, watched the work from behind tinted glasses, unimpressed. He said the authorities had also excavated the land in the early 1990s but found nothing.\u201cNow, after 16 years, the movie repeats itself,\u201d he said. The biggest question is whether the buried toxic materials could cause a public health crisis. More than 500,000 people live in the region, and the Lancet study and other reports have documented cancer rates far above the national average. While no study has sought to prove a direct link, a World Health Organization report conducted with national and local health institutions documented clusters of liver, kidney, pancreatic and other cancers in areas known as dump sites.In the nearby town of Marigliano, the Rev. Giannino Pasquale has watched cancer spread swiftly among his parishioners. He opened the green ledger that serves as the parish death registry and counted for last year: 27 deaths, 10 from cancer. One of the parish\u2019s most dedicated volunteers died of pancreatic cancer in 2012, three years after his wife also died of cancer.\u201cMy sense is that there is an agreement between the political parties and the Camorra,\u201d Father Pasquale said. \u201cJust look around. Tires and asbestos are tossed on the sides of the roads. Why is it not possible to control this area?\u201dLuigi Sodano, 57, a member of the parish, has lost more than 60 pounds during his battle with pancreatic cancer. His mother has bladder cancer, his nephew has testicular cancer and his nephew\u2019s wife has breast cancer. He is so listless from radiation treatment that he rarely leaves his apartment.\u201cI\u2019m his angel because I\u2019m always with him,\u201d said his wife, Angela Dioguardi, 53.General Costa, the environmental police commander, said the Camorra had stopped burying waste a few years ago and was now illegally shipping it to Eastern Europe or the Balkans. The acreage where waste is buried is relatively small, he said, but the risks are significantly higher because the dump sites are spread across such a large area.\u201cIt flows all over the place,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can be a farmer who is unwittingly irrigating your land with polluted water.\u201dLocal farmers complain that prices are falling because wholesalers are leery of buying their produce. Concerns have also been raised about the region\u2019s famed mozzarella cheese, though General Costa said that production was tightly controlled and that no cases of contamination had occurred.He recalled the early days of the garbage crisis, when he overheard a wiretapped conversation between a Camorra boss and another mobster.\u201cWe\u2019re polluting our own house and our own land,\u201d the mobster said. \u201cWhat are we going to drink?\u201d\u201cYou idiot,\u201d the boss replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll drink mineral water.\u201dGaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Text of Republicans\u2019 Principles on Immigration", "Date": "2014-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Thursday, Congressional Republicans released a one-page document, obtained by The New York Times, outlining their blueprint for immigration overhaul.Standards for Immigration ReformPREAMBLEOur nation\u2019s immigration system is broken and our laws are not being enforced. Washington\u2019s failure to fix them is hurting our economy and jeopardizing our national security. The overriding purpose of our immigration system is to promote and further America\u2019s national interests and that is not the case today. The serious problems in our immigration system must be solved, and we are committed to working in a bipartisan manner to solve them. But they cannot be solved with a single, massive piece of legislation that few have read and even fewer understand, and therefore, we will not go to a conference with the Senate\u2019s immigration bill. The problems in our immigration system must be solved through a step-by-step, common-sense approach that starts with securing our country\u2019s borders, enforcing our laws, and implementing robust enforcement measures. These are the principals guiding us in that effort.Border Security and Interior Enforcement Must Come FirstIt is the fundamental duty of any government to secure its borders, and the United States is failing in this mission. We must secure our borders now and verify that they are secure. In addition, we must ensure now that when immigration reform is enacted, there will be a zero tolerance policy for those who cross the border illegally or overstay their visas in the future. Faced with a consistent pattern of administrations of both parties only selectively enforcing our nation\u2019s immigration laws, we must enact reform that ensures that a President cannot unilaterally stop immigration enforcement.Implement Entry-Exit Visa Tracking SystemA fully functioning Entry-Exit system has been mandated by eight separate statutes over the last 17 years. At least three of these laws call for this system to be biometric, using technology to verify identity and prevent fraud. We must implement this system so we can identify and track down visitors who abuse our laws.Employment Verification and Workplace EnforcementIn the 21st century it is unacceptable that the majority of employees have their work eligibility verified through a paper based system wrought with fraud. It is past time for this country to fully implement a workable electronic employment verification system.Reforms to the Legal Immigration SystemFor far too long, the United States has emphasized extended family members and pure luck over employment-based immigration. This is inconsistent with nearly every other developed country. Every year thousands of foreign nationals pursue degrees at America\u2019s colleges and universities, particularly in high skilled fields. Many of them want to use their expertise in U.S. industries that will spur economic growth and create jobs for Americans. When visas aren\u2019t available, we end up exporting this labor and ingenuity to other countries. Visa and green card allocations need to reflect the needs of employers and the desire for these exceptional individuals to help grow our economy.The goal of any temporary worker program should be to address the economic needs of the country and to strengthen our national security by allowing for realistic, enforceable, usable, legal paths for entry into the United States. Of particular concern are the needs of the agricultural industry, among others. It is imperative that these temporary workers are able to meet the economic needs of the country and do not displace or disadvantage American workers.YouthOne of the great founding principles of our country was that children would not be punished for the mistakes of their parents. It is time to provide an opportunity for legal residence and citizenship for those who were brought to this country as children through no fault of their own, those who know no other place as home. For those who meet certain eligibility standards, and serve honorably in our military or attain a college degree, we will do just that.Individuals Living Outside the Rule of LawOur national and economic security depend on requiring people who are living and working here illegally to come forward and get right with the law. There will be no special path to citizenship for individuals who broke our nation\u2019s immigration laws \u2013 that would be unfair to those immigrants who have played by the rules and harmful to promoting the rule of law. Rather, these persons could live legally and without fear in the U.S., but only if they were willing to admit their culpability, pass rigorous background checks, pay significant fines and back taxes, develop proficiency in English and American civics, and be able to support themselves and their families (without access to public benefits). Criminal aliens, gang members, and sex offenders and those who do not meet the above requirements will not be eligible for this program. Finally, none of this can happen before specific enforcement triggers have been implemented to fulfill our promise to the American people that from here on, our immigration laws will indeed be enforced.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under Gang\u2019s Rule, a Mexican City Loses Hope in the State", "Date": "2014-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApatzing\u00e1n JournalAPATZING\u00c1N, Mexico \u2014 Like the shutters closing in an old Western, the metal gates on storefronts in this town slammed shut and their owners fled as first a powerful drug gang took hold and then the federal police and soldiers arrived to restore order, stirring fears of a bloody showdown.There was good reason: Even as the federal forces massed in and around City Hall on Tuesday, a pharmacy was burned around the corner, which many took as a signal that the criminal gang with a lock grip here was still in control. On Wednesday night, somebody was shot yards from the regional offices of the federal prosecutor, where dozens of officers are now stationed. Last week, City Hall itself was firebombed, its lobby scarred with soot and still smelling of smoke.But instead of taking on the gang that had terrorized the town, the military ended up shooting three local residents protesting the government\u2019s efforts to disarm a self-proclaimed self-defense force that had sprung up to fight the outlaws. The shootings set off widespread outrage.\u201cThe army and the government have been discredited because instead of pursuing criminals, they have attacked the people defending themselves against them,\u201d the local Roman Catholic bishop, Miguel Pati\u00f1o Vel\u00e1zquez, wrote Wednesday night in a letter to the community. \u201cThere is no authority stopping\u201d the gang\u2019s leaders, he wrote.The gang is called the Knights Templar, so named, scholars of the drug trade say, as a nod to its quasi-religious doctrine and its belief, like those of the Crusades, that it is valiant and noble. Like the self-defense groups, it, too, began with a stated aim to root out the feared Zetas gang but ended up a large criminal organization itself.The spawn of another powerful organized crime group called La Familia Michoacana, the Knights Templar have grown to sow terror and infiltrate Mexico\u2019s vital Pacific port, extorting rich merchants and humble lime pickers alike.This city of 99,000 people, the capital of Mexico\u2019s lime- and avocado-producing region, is widely described as the gang\u2019s stronghold, an assertion that is easy to believe given the recent violence and the palpable climate of fear.\u201cYou have to pay them quotas or they burn your business down or kidnap you or your wife or girls,\u201d said a street vendor selling pirated videos near the burned pharmacy. \u201cI have paid, everybody pays. And all the police and politicians are in on it, too.\u201dThat is the widespread perception here, where the Catholic vicar general, Javier Cortes, said one organized group or another had kept the town under its thumb for close to a decade, with little interference from the state or federal authorities.The mayor, Uriel Ch\u00e1vez Mendoza, surrounded Thursday by well-armed municipal bodyguards, begged to differ. The rumors that he is a Knight Templar himself and that the group controls city hall are \u201cjust what they are saying on social media networks, but it\u2019s not the truth.\u201d He was careful not to take sides and declared the city now on the path to tranquillity.Not many here have much hope that will happen, predicting that the surge of federal forces will soon abate and give way to the same complacency and neglect that allowed the Knights Templar to gain a foothold and prompted the rise of the vigilantes.President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who had vowed to steer the conversation about Mexico to the economy rather than violence, appointed a special commissioner to oversee the federal response in the state, but has not commented publicly about the crisis, maintaining a normal schedule.While the self-defense groups no longer appear to be planning to take control of Apatzing\u00e1n, promising in some cases to patrol side by side with the federal police, residents here still view them as a viable alternative.The Rev. Gerardo L\u00f3pez, a local priest, said businessmen who had fled were financing the self-defense groups and still making plans to displace the Knights here and in the surrounding countryside.One businessman who fled to nearby Jalisco State about six years ago said in a telephone interview that he had provided about $20,000 to the self-defense groups in the past year, hoping they restore order.\u201cI had the luck that many didn\u2019t, the luck of fleeing,\u201d he said on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. \u201cMany of those who stayed are now dead.\u201dFather Cortes said young people joined the gang because it paid more than working in a store or picking fruit in the fields. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to sit around with a gun or cellphone than work the fields,\u201d he said.Others have been forced to work for the gang under threat of death, he said.The Knights Templar\u2019s main source of income has been trafficking methamphetamine to the United States, with the state of Michoac\u00e1n a prime source of the drug. But as with many other drug gangs, it has branched out to other sources of revenue, including illegally mined iron ore.The military took control of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, the principal Pacific port city, from the gang in November. But its rackets are so extensive that few expect any serious takedown of the group to occur anytime soon, and most people here assume they are being watched by the gang.\u201cYour neighbor could be one of them, and you won\u2019t know until you cross them,\u201d said a government official here who declined to be identified out of fear of death.As truckloads of federal police officers and soldiers cruised the streets, several people sought to keep up a sense of normalcy. A mariachi group came out to rehearse on the sidewalk the other night, some shopkeepers reopened their stores, children chased pigeons in the central square and the mayor promised a coming city festival would proceed.Carmen Enriquez, a secretary on a taco break, rolled her eyes at all the fuss.\u201cOne group comes, and then another, and then the police; this city has seen it all and we go on,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you have the money to leave you do, but for those who stay we just have to go on.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting from Mexico City.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.U. Labor Market Opens for Romanians and Bulgarians", "Date": "2014-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The lifting of labor restrictions on Wednesday for Bulgarians and Romanians in nine European Union countries, including Germany, France and Britain, was greeted as both an opportunity and a threat, touching off fear among some about unchecked immigration from Bulgaria and Romania, two of the poorest states in Europe.In France, unease over the loosening of restrictions is linked to the presence of roughly 20,000 noncitizen Roma, or Gypsies, from Romania and Bulgaria, some of whom live in squalid encampments on the outskirts of French cities. The far-right National Front has warned that Roma could flood the country and has made them an issue before municipal elections in March.When Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union in 2007, some temporary obstacles were imposed on their citizens by nine member states for their first seven years of membership, including their right to work and to benefit from social and medical programs.While analysts say it is too early to predict the outcome of the change of policy, the issue is particularly sensitive in Britain, where a previous Labour government vastly underestimated the number of migrants who would come from Eastern and Central Europe when Britain threw open its doors to the new European Union members from the east in 2004.Before 2004, a study commissioned by the government suggested 5,000 to 13,000 arrivals a year up to 2010. The 2011 census showed 521,000 Polish-born people listed as residents in Britain, the majority having arrived after 2004.In prerecession Britain, politicians saw immigration as a catalyst for growth. But now a struggling economy is helping fan anxiety.The Romanian government, for its part, has sought to allay concerns, lamenting what it has characterized as a xenophobic campaign against the country. Britain, it has emphasized, is not even the preferred destination for Romanians.Professor John Salt of the University College London migration research unit said Wednesday that data from Bulgaria showed that advance bookings for Bulgaria Air, the main air carrier from Bulgaria to Britain, decreased by more than 3 percent for travel in the first three months of 2014, compared with the previous year. He said that all indications were that airlines were not introducing extra flights.Laszlo Andor, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for employment, said Wednesday that Britain was unlikely to experience a sudden and large influx of immigrants from the two countries, in part because three million Bulgarians and Romanians had already been able to settle in other European Union countries.While acknowledging that the newcomers could put a strain on education, housing and social services, he said they would also fill labor market gaps and help offset aging populations.\u201cThe free movement of people has been one of the cornerstones of E.U. integration,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis right is one of the most cherished by Europeans, with over 14 million of them studying, working or retiring in another E.U. state.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Leader Criticizes U.S. Over Pervasive Surveillance", "Date": "2014-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel took perhaps her sharpest swipe yet at pervasive American intelligence surveillance, saying on Wednesday that Washington had endangered its standing by violating the freedom of the individual, a value for which it is admired abroad.Ms. Merkel, addressing the German Parliament, stressed that the damage wrought was so grave and fundamental that it would not be swiftly overcome. She has promised to visit Washington in the coming months, even as President Obama has signaled willingness to address German concerns and pledged that her cellphone is no longer under surveillance by the National Security Agency.But one trip alone will not overcome all the issues, Ms. Merkel said, even as she argued against exacting some kind of revenge by stopping trade talks between Europe and the United States, as some Germans in her conservative and normally pro-American camp have urged.\u201cA way of operating in which the end justifies the means, in which everything which is technically possible is actually done, that violates trust, it sows mistrust,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cAt the end of the day, there is not more, but less security.\u201dIn her hourlong speech, which presented the program of her recently formed coalition between conservatives and the Social Democrats, Ms. Merkel also reiterated that Germany had emerged strongly from the world financial crisis \u2014 thanks to action by a similar grand coalition that governed from 2005 to 2009.Europe has temporarily eased the crisis over the euro, she said. But, she said, \u201cWe should not trust the deceptive calm,\u201d noting that the currency will only truly be strong if is accompanied by a parallel economic union for which it might be necessary to alter current European treaties. \u201cAll European policies must be measured against the yardstick of whether they contribute to a stronger continent,\u201d she said, and every European actor \u201cmust do their homework.\u201dFor its part, she said, Germany should reform its federal system so that central government, for instance, assumes more of the economic burden, particularly where university and other research is concerned.As a trained scientist who is at the helm of Europe\u2019s biggest economy and a global export powerhouse, Ms. Merkel is among the world leaders who is most vocal about the need to stay competitive and current.That gave extra force to her strong words about how the United States \u2014 and Britain \u2014 uses the digital technology that, she repeatedly stressed, is changing all aspects of human affairs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "European Central Bank Set to Do Whatever It Takes to Bolster Recovery", "Date": "2014-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The European Central Bank is ready to take decisive action to keep Europe\u2019s tentative recovery afloat, the bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, said on Thursday after the bank left interest rates unchanged at a record low.After the rates announcement, Mr. Draghi said at a news conference here that the central bank was \u201cready to consider all available instruments\u201d to address either further weakness in consumer prices or increases in short-term money market rates that could put stress on banks. He did not, however, specify what tools he would use.The central bank\u2019s Governing Council, which sets monetary policy for the 18-nation euro zone, surprised the market in November by cutting its benchmark rate to 0.25 percent, a record low, from 0.5 percent.Economists had not expected any further action on Thursday, but they said there was a significant chance the central bank would act again in the coming months to guard against an outright decline in prices. The fear is that low inflation could turn into deflation, a widespread and sustained fall in prices that can be economically debilitating and difficult to reverse.The allusion to money markets referred to the ready availability of cheap, short-term loans to and between banks. Interest rates on such money spiked last month but have since fallen back.Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank in Brussels, said the central bank wanted to be certain that lenders did not face short-term funding pressures over the course of this year, when they will undergo tests of their financial soundness as part of the central bank\u2019s new supervisory role over the euro zone\u2019s biggest banks. The central bank will be balancing those concerns against various signals that the zone\u2019s financial and economic crisis may finally be ending.On Thursday, the optimists\u2019 case was reinforced by news of a rebound in German industrial production in November and a report from the European Commission showing that businesses and consumers were more confident in December.Investors also showed strong interest in an offering of Portuguese debt, as an improved economic outlook makes buyers willing to accept somewhat lower \u2014 though still attractive \u2014 interest rates on bonds from euro zone countries they had been leery of in recent years. Earlier this week, Ireland, which required a bailout in 2010, also carried out a successful bond auction.But Mr. Draghi, when asked on Thursday if the euro crisis was over, was guarded in his reply. \u201cThe recovery is there, but it\u2019s fragile,\u201d he said. The best that can be said about the job market, for example, is that unemployment does not seem to be growing worse.\u201cWe want to see confidence staying for a relatively long time before we declare victory,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.In Britain, the Bank of England left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.5 percent, where it has been since March 2009, as the British economy continued its own slow recovery.Mr. Draghi has recently warned about the danger of an inflation rate that becomes entrenched below 1 percent, creating the sort of situation that caused Japan\u2019s \u201clost decade\u201d of poor growth and economic pain.At his news conference Thursday, he played down the significance of the most recent inflation number, saying the unexpectedly low figure was partly due to a \u201cquirk\u201d in the way the German portion of the data was calculated. He said the January numbers would give a better indication of price trends.Mr. Draghi said that even the negative price trends in some euro zone countries \u2014 like Cyprus \u2014 were in some cases not really the broad-based \u201cself-fulfilling, self-feeding\u201d deflation that stalked Japan in the 1990s, but were rather \u201cpart of a necessary rebalancing.\u201dMr. Brzeski, the ING economist, said it appeared that Mr. Draghi was now trying decouple extremely low inflation and more E.C.B. action.\u201cIt\u2019s verbal intervention right now, pretending you\u2019re strong and flexing your muscles,\u201d Mr. Brzeski said. But it may be that within the Governing Council, \u201cthere is no consensus on what to do or even what the main problem is,\u201d he added.With the region\u2019s unemployment rate stuck at 12.1 percent since last April, the pressure may rise on the central bank to take action sooner or later. Mr. Draghi acknowledged on Thursday that a further slowing of inflation or higher money-market rates could be triggers for further moves by the central bank.\u201cThe risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside,\u201d he said.With interest rates, the traditional lever of monetary policy, already effectively at zero, the E.C.B. might have to find other means of stimulating the economy. The euro zone emerged from recession in the second quarter of 2013, and the central bank expects anemic economic growth of 1.1 percent this year.The meeting Thursday was notable for being the first at which Latvia was formally seated on the Governing Council. Ilmars Rimsevics, the governor of the Bank of Latvia, represented his country, which on Jan. 1 became the 18th nation to join the single currency.The E.C.B. could offer more cheap loans on the condition that banks lend to businesses. Another option would be to penalize financial institutions for depositing funds at the E.C.B. by offering negative deposit rates, spurring them to put more money into the economy. It could also buy the debt of small and midsize businesses in hopes of jump-starting the flow of credit.Marie Diron, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, predicted that the questions of deflation and the divergence within the euro zone, in which businesses in weaker member states must pay more for credit, would dominate the central bank\u2019s thinking in the next few months.There is \u201ca risk that the euro zone as a whole slides into a protracted period of falling prices,\u201d Ms. Diron wrote in a research note. \u201cWhile we do not think that the euro zone will fall into deflation, this risk calls for strong pre-emptive action by the E.C.B.\u201dThe United States Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, who made rapid stops in Paris, Berlin and Lisbon on a two-day trip this week, urged European leaders \u2014 particularly in Germany \u2014 to focus on domestic demand. American officials say they believe it is essential that Europe act to pick up slack in the world economy as the Federal Reserve begins reducing its monthly purchases of bonds this month.Asked about Mr. Lew\u2019s call for measures to bolster demand, Mr. Draghi quoted Abraham Lincoln as having said, \u201cYou cannot make the weak stronger by making the strong weaker.\u201d Such criticism is misplaced, he added, because \u201call of the euro members benefit from Germany\u2019s strength.\u201dJulia Werdigier contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Movies at Sundance Are Sidestepping the Big Screen", "Date": "2014-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 What will be the difference between this year\u2019s Sundance and the Sundance of 2006, when independent film was last riding high?About $100 million in prospective box-office receipts, if the trend line holds.As art-house movie buyers and sellers visit Park City, Utah, for the annual Sundance Film Festival, which starts on Thursday, they face the reality that most of the esoteric fare will land on small screens, not big ones.In total, American-made films from the last festival \u2014 led by hits like \u201cThe Way, Way Back\u201d and \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d \u2014 have taken in about $160 million at the domestic box office. That is down by about a third from 2006, when the economy was soaring and Sundance standouts like \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine,\u201d \u201cThe Illusionist\u201d and \u201cThank You for Smoking\u201d contributed to a total festival result of roughly $250 million in domestic ticket sales.The gap may be even wider this year, as digital-leaning distributors like Magnolia, IFC and Radius-TWC, the boutique division of the boutique Weinstein Company, become the most active buyers. Perhaps half of the 120 films on the Sundance roster will find distribution, said Adam Leipzig, chief executive of Entertainment Media Partners, a film consultancy, \u201cbut most of them will not get theatrical distribution.\u201dSundance, the pre-eminent bazaar for American independent cinema, is usually judged by how well its films sell and their resulting box office totals. This frustrates Robert Redford, the festival\u2019s founder, who prefers that the event lean toward art over commerce. \u201cWe pick films that might not ever have the chance to be seen elsewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cSundance is about giving chances to diverse voices.\u201dBut with the shortage of theatrical success for independent films, it\u2019s unclear whether the new cinematic voices that Mr. Redford prizes can afford to keep speaking up. Mr. Leipzig estimates that filmmakers spent about $3 billion to make the more than 4,000 films submitted to Sundance, but in the aggregate will probably recoup only about 2 percent of their investment.The very concept of a \u201csale\u201d \u2014 the old Sundance measuring stick \u2014 has shrunk along with a diminishing theatrical audience. Companies that once paid millions of dollars for the right to distribute a film will now often acquire a picture for no money down. Instead they promise to put it in front of viewers, and give the filmmaker a cut of the proceeds, if there are any.And most of the selections that reach theaters will stay there long enough only to be reviewed by critics, affirming a film\u2019s feature status, before moving to video on demand.The shift is particularly true among documentaries: Three films on the coming Sundance roster are from CNN, including Joe Berlinger\u2019s \u201cWhitey: United States of America v. James J. Bulger.\u201d Netflix already bought \u201cMitt,\u201d about Mitt Romney\u2019s failed presidential campaign. Amazon is expected to be a shopper.Tellingly, one of the first films to sell from this year\u2019s Sundance slate was \u201cTim and Susan Have Matching Handguns,\u201d a 95-second documentary short that Oscilloscope Laboratories picked up last month. \u201cWe\u2019re going to figure out a way to put this film in front of your faces,\u201d the company\u2019s co-presidents, Dan Berger and David Laub, said in a statement at the time. It is safe to assume they were not thinking about an Imax premiere.Many distributors will be openly trading on the disappointment that Sundance brings by offering to adopt films that attract no cash offers in the heady few minutes after their festival debuts. \u201cIf not, call me,\u201d said Dylan Marchetti, the founder of Variance Films, summing up his pitch to the many filmmakers who will be reluctant to leave the event without some kind of commitment in hand.Last year\u2019s Sundance films actually had more theatrical success than in several years prior. \u201cDon Jon,\u201d about sex addiction in the Internet age, made $24.5 million, a healthy total (although perhaps not enough to justify the $25 million in marketing that Relativity Media committed to spend on its release). Among documentaries, \u201c20 Feet From Stardom,\u201d a celebration of backup singers, has earned more than $4.8 million for Radius-TWC and is still playing in theaters. It arrives on video on demand and DVD on Tuesday.Even so, you have to go back to 2009 to find a true breakout hit: \u201cPrecious: Based on the Novel \u2018Push\u2019 by Sapphire,\u201d which sold $47.6 million in tickets.But with last year\u2019s Sundance slate, box office disappointment was by far the most common result. For every \u201cSpectacular Now,\u201d a success for the distributor A24 with about $7 million in ticket sales, there were 10 examples akin to \u201cUpstream Color,\u201d a buzzy festival movie that made zero impression in theaters, taking in less than $450,000.Agents say that digital sales are starting to make up the slack at Sundance.\u201cSometimes the ancillary windows are not at all ancillary,\u201d said Rena Ronson, a sales agent at United Talent Agency, which will represent nearly a dozen films this time around, including \u201cLaggies,\u201d starring Keira Knightley as a 28-year-old woman stuck in permanent adolescence. She added, \u201cI also think you have to look more broadly than just Sundance to judge the festival market. It\u2019s quite strong overall.\u201dBut most filmmakers have a more pessimistic view of digital distribution, saying that the money from those deals does not routinely reach them. There is also a shortage of publicly available statistics to support a booming on-demand market.Bidding wars still erupt from time to time. Distributors are already circling a handful of movies on Sundance\u2019s coming slate, including \u201cDear White People,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek exploration of racial identity at an Ivy League college. But few are likely to match 2005, when an all-night bidding war erupted for \u201cHustle and Flow.\u201d Brad Grey of Paramount ultimately beat the competition by paying $9 million for the movie, in addition to promising to fund two other films. \u201cHustle and Flow\u201d earned $22.2 million in domestic ticket sales. Some filmmakers are choosing to sidestep the brutal\u00a0Sundance economics by going directly to the audience. \u201cFrom the get-go it was clear I wouldn\u2019t want to depend on festival acceptance,\u201d said Marco Weber, referring to his young adult thriller, \u201cCalifornia Scheming,\u201d which he did not submit.

{"Headline": "Failed EuroVegas Bid Was Still a Boon for Spanish Casinos", "Date": "2014-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Even though Sheldon G. Adelson, the American billionaire casino magnate, abandoned his plans for a $30 billion casino and leisure resort on the outskirts of Madrid last month, he has nevertheless helped get the roulette wheels spinning here for the first time in almost a century.In mid-December, Mr. Adelson dropped plans to build a resort with six casinos, known as EuroVegas, after the Spanish government refused to accept his demands for financial concessions. Just days later, however, two small casinos opened in central Madrid, operated by Spanish companies that applied for new licenses in the wake of the EuroVegas plan.\u201cThe arrival of a giant like EuroVegas meant that we had to do something and couldn\u2019t just stand still,\u201d said Pedro Olmedo Franco, a director of the Casino Gran Madrid, one of Madrid\u2019s two new casinos. Without the EuroVegas project, he added, \u201cwe probably wouldn\u2019t be here now.\u201dUnlike some other Spanish cities, Madrid had a longstanding ban on any casino operating within an 18-mile radius of the city center. But it was effectively lifted when its authorities started to compete against Barcelona to lure Mr. Adelson, who had decided to locate his project in Spain. While negotiating with Mr. Adelson and under pressure from Spanish operators concerned about unfair competition from EuroVegas, Madrid decided to also grant two other licenses for smaller Spanish rivals to open casinos in the heart of the city.Before last month\u2019s opening, Grupo Gran Madrid already owned three other casinos in Spain, with combined revenue of 28 million euros, or roughly $38 million. Madrid\u2019s other new venue, Casino Gran V\u00eda, is owned by Grupo Comar, which has several casinos across Spain and the Dominican Republic, which generated combined revenues of about \u20ac110 million last year.The two new Madrid casinos differ in style, but required comparable investments \u2014 about \u20ac20 million for Gran Madrid and \u20ac15 million for Gran V\u00eda.Neither operator said it could provide earnings details so close to their opening. Mr. Olmedo Franco said Gran Madrid had made \u201ca slightly weak start\u201d during the Christmas season. On a recent evening there, several gambling tables stood empty.In emailed answers to queries, Javier Garc\u00eda, the general director of Grupo Comar, said he was \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with the debut of Gran V\u00eda, located at a century-old avenue. The casino has recently averaged 1,500 visitors a day, each paying an entrance fee of \u20ac9 and required to bet a minimum of \u20ac2.5. Mr. Garc\u00eda forecast a profit for this year, without providing specifics. He also said the new casino was opened \u201cindependent\u201d of EuroVegas and other business developments.Despite Spain\u2019s recent economic problems, the two casinos are filling a clear gap in Madrid, said Miguel C\u00f3rdoba Bueno, a professor of applied mathematics who published a book last year about gambling. Mr. Adelson\u2019s initial choice of Madrid, he contended, shows that it is \u201cby some margin the most attractive city to set up a casino.\u201dMr. Adelson\u2019s company, Las Vegas Sands, decided to drop EuroVegas just as other foreign investors have started to return to Spain. They had exited two years ago, when the country was plunged into a banking crisis. Since then, the banking sector has received an international bailout and the economy emerged from a two-year recession in the third quarter of 2013.Spain still faces considerable economic challenges, including a 26 percent unemployment rate. But the casino revival has also made a contribution to Madrid on the jobs front. Gran V\u00eda created 270 new jobs while Gran Madrid created 200 jobs, in addition to relocating 250 existing staff members to Madrid. Some of the new employees had little or no previous work experience, let alone in the casino business.\u201cCroupier is certainly not what I expected to become, but it\u2019s proving an exciting opportunity,\u201d said Valeria Garc\u00eda, 21, who has been completing a history degree at Madrid\u2019s Complutense University.Ms. Garc\u00eda oversees a roulette table for six hours an evening. Croupiers like her earn \u20ac1,500 a month to start, with pay rising to about \u20ac2,400 including tips. On average, the casino pays staff \u20ac1,600 a month.\u201cGiven how things are in Spain now,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s unfortunately not with history that I was going to find a job.\u201dWith Spanish consumption still in the doldrums, Madrid\u2019s new casinos have been targeting foreign tourists, placing advertisements in the city\u2019s main hotels. Last year, Spain welcomed a record 60.6 million tourists, even though the number of people visiting the Spanish capital fell about 5 percent to 4.2 million.At Gran V\u00eda, one of the rooms has an Oriental design to help attract Chinese tourists. Both venues have also teamed up with celebrated restaurant owners \u2014 Gran V\u00eda with Jes\u00fas Santos, a specialist of Basque cuisine, and Gran Madrid with the Sandoval brothers, who own a Michelin-starred restaurant near Madrid.While EuroVegas would have created thousands of jobs, it also generated criticism as a \u201cSin City\u201d project, with opponents warning that by promoting gambling on such a large scale Spain might encourage criminal activities like prostitution and money laundering. The two Madrid newcomers have not drawn similar opposition, perhaps because they are minnows compared with the extravagant and giant casinos Mr. Adelson has sprawled across Las Vegas or Macau.Mr. Adelson\u2019s EuroVegas would have provided formidable competition for smaller Spanish operators. On the other hand, the Spanish companies anticipated that EuroVegas would help bolster the Spanish gambling sector as a whole and raise its international profile.They also hoped to benefit from the same tax concessions that Mr. Adelson wanted to obtain for EuroVegas. Mr. Adelson scrapped his plans and turned his sights on opportunities in Asia after failing to win special tax benefits and an exemption from a nationwide ban on smoking in public spaces.\u201cWe are now negotiating once more to get a better fiscal deal, but this time without the support of EuroVegas,\u201d Mr. Olmedo Franco said.The Madrid casinos want the authorities to cut the gambling tax to 20 percent from the current 45 percent. \u00c1ngel Ruiz de Apodaca, professor of administrative law at the University of Navarra, poured cold water on the casinos\u2019 chances of winning major concessions.\u201cMr. Adelson didn\u2019t get the treatment that he wanted, so I don\u2019t think that any special deal or fiscal advantages will be seen as acceptable for the new casinos either,\u201d he said.Both operators also face the risk that their downtown locations will hurt their existing casinos outside Madrid.Eduardo Ladr\u00f3n de Guevara, a Madrid fashion designer, said he would probably make regular visits to Gran Madrid rather than travel to the casino in Torrelodones, 29 kilometers outside Madrid. \u201cThis is a much more comfortable experience and you also don\u2019t have to worry any longer about drinking and then finding a way to get home,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Planned Comcast Tech Center Raises Sights in Philadelphia", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetPHILADELPHIA \u2014 The city that once boasted that no building would be higher than William Penn\u2019s hat atop City Hall is getting a new skyscraper, to be the city\u2019s tallest and more than twice as high as the iconic statue.Plans for the building, the Comcast Innovation and Technology Center, were announced this month. The design calls for a height of 1,121 feet reaching above central Philadelphia, beyond the existing Comcast Center.The 59-story building, on Arch Street between 18th and 19th Streets, four blocks from City Hall, will be adjacent to the company\u2019s current headquarters. It will include some 1.5 million square feet of space for rent, of which 1.28 million will be for offices. Construction is to begin this fall, and it is scheduled for completion in 2017.Comcast, owner of Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, will take 75 percent of the office space, which will house technical staff members such as software developers and engineers.The building, designed by the British architect Norman Foster, will be the eighth-tallest in the United States. Its top will be some 650 feet below that of New York\u2019s new One World Trade Center which, at 1,776 feet, is the tallest in the United States. (The Penn statue stands just 548 feet above street level.)Some commercial real estate professionals welcomed the project as a major boost for the local office market, and for the city\u2019s economy over all.\u201cIt just shows there is significant demand in the marketplace,\u201d said Michael Silverman, managing director in the Philadelphia office of Integra Realty Resources, a real estate and valuation consulting firm.Over the last 12 to 18 months, demand has been rising for the 53 million square feet of office space in the Center City area of Philadelphia, pushing rents up and vacancy rates down, said Mr. Silverman, whose company has no connection with the new building.The vacancy rate for Class A office space in the Market West section of downtown Philadelphia, where the new building is to be located, has dropped slightly, to 12.2 percent from 12.7 percent at the end of 2012, Mr. Silverman said. The average asking price for commercial space has risen to $27.84 a square foot from $27.16 in 2012, he said, citing data from CoStar, a commercial real estate information company.He predicted that the large addition of office space would not drive down local office prices, because Comcast employees would occupy three-fourths of the building.But David M. Scolnic, a real estate lawyer with the Philadelphia firm of Hangley Aronchick Segal Pudlin & Schiller, said the new supply would be likely to stabilize or even drive down rents, as well as shift perceptions about what constituted a \u201ctrophy\u201d building in the city.While the new building and the existing Comcast headquarters will be sought after as prestigious corporate locations, others with older facilities are likely to lose their appeal as the most desirable premises, Mr. Scolnic predicted.\u201cObservers believe that there\u2019s a shortage of large blocks of space in those buildings,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s exaggerated, and I think this building will bring people back to reality because there is a general contraction still of big users of those spaces and there are now quite a lot of floors being made available.\u201dFor example, he predicted rents would come under pressure in one building, currently seen as being in the \u201ctrophy\u201d category, where Comcast has some of its employees. They will be moving out when the new offices are built.\u201cIt\u2019s going to put pressure on those landlords to get more realistic about some of their expectations,\u201d Mr. Scolnic said.Still, the influx of young technology employees to a building designed by a prestigious international architect is likely to encourage boosters of a city that has long harbored an inferiority complex because it lacks either the financial power of New York or the political clout of Washington.\u201cThis new development really speaks to a more favorable outlook for the city,\u201d Mr. Silverman said.The $1.2 billion building will create 20,000 direct and indirect jobs during construction, adding $2.75 billion to the local economy, according to Gov. Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, who announced the project, along with Comcast officials, on Jan. 15.The project, 80 percent of which will be owned by Comcast and 20 percent by the developer Liberty Property Trust, is expected to create some 2,800 permanent jobs in the city.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Temporary Nuclear Deal With Iran Takes Effect", "Date": "2014-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe first orchestrated rollback in Western antinuclear economic sanctions against Iran took effect on Monday under Tehran\u2019s temporary agreement with world powers, as all sides reported that the steps initially promised had been fulfilled.Under the temporary agreement, Iran began suspending most advanced uranium-fuel enrichment and halted other sensitive elements of its nuclear program. In exchange, it received what the United States called \u201climited, targeted and reversible sanctions relief for a six-month period.\u201dThe agreement, known in diplomatic language as the Joint Plan of Action, expires on July 20 and was intended to give Iran and the so-called P5-plus-1 powers, which are the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council \u2014 Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States \u2014 plus Germany, more time to negotiate a permanent accord.The goal is to resolve peacefully the longstanding dispute over Iran\u2019s nuclear energy program, which Iran has called peaceful and legal but the Western countries and Israel have described as a guise to achieve the ability to produce nuclear weapons.Tero Varjoranta, the deputy director general of the I.A.E.A., told reporters at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Vienna that the Iranians had provided \u201cgood cooperation\u201d so far and that \u201cwe have a very robust system in place with Iran\u201d to ensure compliance with the agreement.In return, the European Union and the United States, which have imposed tough sanctions on Iran that have severely impaired its economy, suspended some restrictions on the Iranian petrochemicals, automotive and precious metals industries and began the staggered release of $4.2 billion in Iranian cash frozen in overseas banks.Other Western provisions that were eased included restraints on insurance for Iran\u2019s oil shipments and licenses for services and parts needed by Iran\u2019s commercial airlines, which have been increasingly hobbled by the need for maintenance and repairs of their old Boeing aircraft.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.In a statement, Catherine Ashton, the European Union\u2019s top foreign policy official and the lead P5-plus-1 negotiator with Iran, called the carrying out of the agreement an important step. She also expressed hope that new talks with Iran would begin in the next few weeks.\u201cIt is important to keep that momentum, and I would like to see us move swiftly to agreements,\u201d Ms. Ashton said in Brussels. \u201cBut I am mindful that there are many difficult issues.\u201d She declined to specify them.The seemingly smooth execution of the temporary nuclear agreement was particularly notable on a day when Iran\u2019s role in another major global dispute \u2014 Syria\u2019s civil war \u2014 threatened to subvert peace talks set for Wednesday in Switzerland. The United States and the Syrian opposition objected to a United Nations invitation for Iran to attend. The United Nations later rescinded the invitation.The nuclear agreement dominated the news in Iran, where several officials welcomed the start of the deal and Iranian news media reported on every step taken by the I.A.E.A.\u2019s inspectors.\u201cThey are now in the enrichment facilities of Natanz and Fordo,\u201d Behrouz Kamalvand, the spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told state television, referring to the two principal locations of Iranian centrifuges. \u201cThey have now disconnected certain pipes,\u201d he said later. Finally he said, \u201cIran has voluntarily suspended enrichment up to 20 percent.\u201dIranian critics of the deal, who fear Iran conceded too much, expressed anger. The front page of the conservative newspaper Vatan-e Emrooz was published in black and white, as if in mourning, with a headline that declared \u201cnuclear holocaust\u201d had been committed.Ahmad Tavakoli, an influential lawmaker who is close to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said there were many issues with the agreement. \u201cAs the officials of the Islamic republic, we cannot publicly explain all of these problems because the other party may misuse them,\u201d he said in a speech in Parliament reported by the Fars news agency. \u201cBut we will share some of these worries with the supreme leader and with the people.\u201dOthers in Iran said they were prepared to give the agreement time to succeed. \u201cI am cautiously optimistic, but not sure about the future,\u201d said Hamid Reza Tarraghi, a conservative analyst who has close ties to Iran\u2019s political leadership. \u201cWe have to wait and see whether the opposite side will take all the necessary steps.\u201dIn Israel, where the interim agreement has been severely criticized as a capitulation to Iran, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the deal would not stop the \u201cIran nuclear train\u201d and what he called its intent to develop nuclear weapons. Rick Gladstone reported from New York, and Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran. Alan Cowell contributed reporting from London, Andrew Higgins from Brussels, and Jodi Rudoren from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Affair? France Shrugs, but Its Leader Calls for Privacy", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The photographs show a stout man of middling height striding out of an ordinary-looking Parisian apartment house, a helmet and a dark visor obscuring his face. He gets on a motorized scooter and zooms away into the Eighth Arrondissement.The face behind the visor, a glossy tabloid magazine called Closer reported on Friday, belongs to President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France. The apartment, a short distance from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, is used for his meetings with an actress 18 years younger than he is, who is not his primary partner, the magazine said.Revelations of that sort typically do not shock the French people, and this one is no different. But Mr. Hollande, while not denying the report, lashed out at the magazine for violating what he has sought to define as his privacy rights, suggesting that the French president, like any citizen, is entitled to assignations.Mr. Hollande \u201cprofoundly deplores the violations of the respect of private life, to which he has the right, like any citizen,\u201d his office said in a statement. He condemned the magazine, and said he was weighing action, including through the courts, to defend his privacy.In an era of mass violations of personal privacy, including widespread mining of French phone data revealed by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, Mr. Hollande\u2019s appeal for confidentiality appears to have resonated in the country. Moreover, Mr. Hollande, who has abysmally low poll ratings largely because of his handling of the sclerotic French economy, is unlikely to suffer a further backlash from voters over reports of an affair, which rarely generate the sort of public moralizing in France that they do in the United States.But the relationship, assuming the report is correct, suggests the continuance of a rather complicated love life for Mr. Hollande, 59, one that at times has directly intersected with his public roles and has amounted to a new challenge to the French presumption that the private lives of public figures are no one\u2019s business.Mr. Hollande, who has never married, was involved for many years with S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, a former presidential candidate for his Socialist Party. The two have four children together. He strongly supported her unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2007, and they appeared together as a couple throughout the race before splitting publicly immediately afterward.More recently, he has been in a relationship with Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, a journalist for the magazine Paris Match who has acted as France\u2019s first lady since Mr. Hollande\u2019s election in 2012. Their relationship began while Ms. Trierweiler was covering Mr. Hollande for the magazine. Ms. Royal and Ms. Trierweiler had engaged in a highly public rivalry that was made particularly plain when, on Twitter, Ms. Trierweiler supported a candidate running in a legislative election against Ms. Royal, who had received the backing of Mr. Hollande. That incident caused a minor political scandal, and Ms. Trierweiler\u2019s Twitter activity has been somewhat less adventuresome since.The photos appear to show Mr. Hollande and his security detail coming and going by motorcycle on several occasions from the apartment. Ms. Gayet can be seen entering the same building. The photos show a man said to be Mr. Hollande \u2014 the man was always photographed wearing a helmet with a full visor \u2014 arriving at the building. In one photo, a man in an overcoat with his helmet on is shown as he leaves the building. Mr. Hollande and Ms. Gayet are not shown together.Rumors of a relationship between the two had circulated for months in Paris, and last year Ms. Gayet went so far as to seek a court injunction to make them stop. On Friday, Closer said it would remove the photos from its website in response to a request from Ms. Gayet.Ms. Trierweiler made no public comment on the report, and the status of her relationship with Mr. Hollande remained unclear.Ms. Gayet, who has two children and is said to be separated from her husband, an Argentine film director, has mostly acted in independent films and has played mainly secondary roles, as well as producing some of her own movies. She has played a drug addict, a blind woman, a lesbian and a hairdresser, and in articles about her films she has been praised by directors for her professionalism and artistic choices. She was an active supporter of Mr. Hollande during his presidential campaign.Speaking Friday morning on Europe 1 radio, Laurence Pieau, the top editor at Closer, called Mr. Hollande a \u201cnormal president\u201d and \u201ca normal person.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a president who\u2019s fallen in love,\u201d Ms. Pieau said. \u201cWe really need to undramatize these images.\u201dThe reaction of French people, many of whom said they had already heard the rumor before the magazine\u2019s report, was much the same as Ms. Pieau\u2019s.Julie Lechevalier, 32, a legal specialist at a technology company, saw it as perhaps not laudable behavior, but hardly something to be condemned.\u201cThis shows our president is a normal man,\u201d she said, adding that even if she did not approve morally, Mr. Hollande has \u201cthe right to live his life even if he is president of the republic.\u201dThe love lives of public officials were long considered off limits for French journalists, some of whom, like Ms. Trierweiler, have become involved with politicians. Several recent presidents have been widely rumored to have had affairs that the news media have avoided publicizing.A century ago, President F\u00e9lix Faure expired in the presidential palace at age 58 while engaging in some extramarital sport with a young woman. (Newspapers at the time did not make explicit the circumstances of his death, but one suggested with a wink that Mr. Faure had been \u201csacrificed to Venus,\u201d the Roman goddess of love.)Now, a combination of factors, including the Internet and the very public soap opera around former President Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s divorce and subsequent marriage to a model-turned-singer, Carla Bruni, has changed the news media\u2019s appetite for intimate glimpses into the lives of powerful men.The 2011 arrest on sexual assault charges of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then the head of the International Monetary Fund, exposed the potential dangers of the news media\u2019s silence. The legal case against him and subsequent accounts from other women forced a debate about the French news media\u2019s deference to powerful figures over sex.However, the debate died down, and the question of how much the news media should say about private lives has not been resolved.In interviews, several people said they were comfortable having Mr. Hollande keep his romantic liaison out of public view.A financial officer at an industrial company, Alexandre Pasquier, 33, said: \u201cThe split between private life and public life is very important to me,\u201d adding, \u201cThis does not involve a political problem.\u201d Mr. Pasquier said that although he did not approve of infidelity \u201con a moral plane,\u201d Mr. Hollande\u2019s apparent affair would not affect either the president\u2019s ability to run the country or the French population\u2019s view of him. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to stain his image,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has so many other things going badly, this won\u2019t hurt him. It could even maybe give him a boost.\u201dMa\u00efa de la Baume contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Both transmissions will feed power to Volkswagen\u2019s 4Motion all-wheel-drive system.On the large end of Volkswagen\u2019s car offerings, the new Passat will be powered by a relatively tiny, albeit turbocharged, 1.4-liter 4-cylinder direct-injection gasoline engine. The fuel-economy number is a manufacturer estimate and will be subject to federal testing at some point, but Volkswagen said it employed a number of devices to squeeze such thriftiness out of an engine that produces 150 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque.There is an engine management system \u2013 similar to the cylinder deactivation systems used in engines with more cylinders \u2013 that shuts down the valvetrain on two cylinders under light throttle. Volkswagen says the feature has been used on European Polo and Golf cars.Another fuel-saving feature decouples the engine from the transmission during coasting to reduce mechanical drag.

Cuomo, was trumpeting his own vow to lower taxes.If there was any ambiguity to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s message, it was cleared up by the slogan, in five-inch-high capital letters, that appeared on a sign beneath his seat. \u201cCutting Taxes,\u201d it read.The dueling news conferences, 150 miles apart, offered a vivid portrait of this year\u2019s most intriguing political showdown: the upstart mayor and the up-for-re-election governor, Democratic colleagues and ostensible friends, who may end up on sharply different sides of the issue on which Mr. de Blasio has staked his young administration.\u201cThey are in profound conflict on economic policy,\u201d said Richard Brodsky, a former state assemblyman and past candidate for attorney general.\u201cBut this ideological conflict is also about who is going to have primacy,\u201d Mr. Brodsky added. \u201cWho is going to be the alpha male in deciding the economic future of the city and the state?\u201dMr. de Blasio, a onetime grass-roots advocate, has moved into full organizing mode as he prepares for the start of the Albany legislative session. His event on Monday, in which he presented a united front with union officials, was only the latest in a string of news conferences that have doubled as rallies for the prekindergarten plan, and he has helped assemble a group of celebrity activists to aid his efforts.On Monday, the mayor gestured toward the labor leaders \u2014 including the heads of powerful unions like the teachers\u2019 and other city workers\u2019 who will face his administration in contract talks this year \u2014 and said, \u201cThis is not something you see every day.\u201d He said there was more expert consensus on the utility of prekindergarten classes than on the reality of climate change.The sticking point for Mr. de Blasio, however, is not the notion of prekindergarten itself; Mr. Cuomo has said he agrees, in theory, that such classes are a worthy policy.At issue is how to pay for it. The mayor\u2019s proposal would raise taxes on city residents earning more than $500,000 a year. Mr. de Blasio has insisted that his tax plan, rather than a rejiggering of the state education budget, is the only way to provide sustainable financing.\u201cThe governor has made a very clear commitment to pre-K, and I commend him for it,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said on Monday. \u201cThat is different from reaching every child in New York City here and now. We don\u2019t want a phase-in. We don\u2019t want a someday.\u201dBut when Mr. Cuomo was asked on Monday about Mr. de Blasio\u2019s tax plan, he offered only a dispassionate, noncommittal take on the matter.\u201cThere\u2019s a two-step process, in government and in life,\u201d said the governor, who can be sphinx-like in his public remarks. \u201cFirst, decide what you want to do. And Step 2 is decide how you are going to do it.\u201d When Mr. de Blasio was pressed on why he would accept only a plan funded by taxes on the wealthy, rather than a bigger budget allocation in Albany, he said that legislators were quick to cut money for children\u2019s programs, and that his tax, once enacted, would not be fought over year after year. W. Steven Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, echoed that argument, saying prekindergarten \u2014 still widely viewed as an optional form of instruction \u2014 would be more vulnerable to legislators\u2019 whims.Referring to first graders, Mr. Barnett said: \u201cIf you\u2019re 7 years old, you get to go to school. It doesn\u2019t matter how tight the budget is.\u201d Prekindergarten, he said, would not enjoy the same immunity.Still, there are those who see other motivations in Mr. de Blasio\u2019s insistence on his own plan, and his dismissal of any alternative.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the same political bang if he just says, \u2018Hey, I came up with the savings to create pre-K,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, who noted that Mr. de Blasio\u2019s tax-the-rich idea was a potent talking point on the campaign trail.Ms. Gelinas said she believed that in the event of a downturn, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s tax could prove just as unstable as money allocated by the Legislature.\u201cEven if the city gets the tax hike that de Blasio wants,\u201d she said, \u201cit can\u2019t control the economy.\u201dThomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Design Du Jour", "Date": "2014-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe DetailsHooka, a hookah designed by Karim Rashid for Gaia & Gino, is based on a whirling dervish.PARIS \u2014 On Sunday, the British designer Tom Dixon was a guest of honor at a cocktail party at Eclectic, a new restaurant in the 15th Arrondissement here. Mr. Dixon had designed the space, with his usual flair for muscular materials (in this case, concrete warmed by splashes of gleaming metal). He was being feted by Maison et Objet, a trade fair held every January and September, which had anointed him, along with Philippe Nigro of Paris and Dimore Studio of Milan, a \u201cdesigner of the year.\u201dMaison et Objet, a five-day event that ended on Tuesday, is the pre-eminent design show in France and results in a billion euros a year worth of sales, said its managing director, Philippe Brocart. It began 19 years ago with a focus on tabletop goods \u2014 teapots, cutlery, vases \u2014 but has expanded to fill eight pavilions at a fairground near Charles de Gaulle Airport with many other kinds of objects for the home.Sitting beneath a chandelier he had assembled for the restaurant from an enormous cluster of his perforated brass Cell lamps, Mr. Dixon responded to a question about whether he was responsible for what appeared to be an international design fixation on brass and copper. Every pavilion at the fair, including \u201cEthnic Chic\u201d and \u201cNow!\u201d (the more experimental work), was rife with rosy and golden metals, beaten, punctured and woven.Those materials are seen as \u201can alternative to stainless steel,\u201d Mr. Dixon said, adding that people are rebelling against the coldness of steel, just as they scorn other features of industrial modernism considered bland or anonymous. Steel will always be hard and gray, but brass and copper are malleable and take on a patina making them more distinctive with age. They also mix well with new technology, he said. Incandescent bulbs make brass lamps uncomfortably hot, but LEDs lower the temperature. And the color of the metal improves any harsh quality still found in LED light.In his way, Mr. Dixon, through his musings about metal, answered another question that this reporter had left unvoiced: Why go to France to see design trends that are visible everywhere? For one thing, you never know where you are going to find fresh ideas. Among the many copper objects at the fair was a lamp called Light Drop, designed by Tim Brauns of e27 studio in Berlin for Pulpo, a German company. The metal-mesh-and-glass lamp, Mr. Brauns said, is meant as a companion for communing with our screens. \u201cYou don\u2019t need much light with hand-held devices and TV,\u201d he said, but neither do most of us want to sit in the glow of our electronics, so Light Drop provides atmosphere. New technology has given rise to a new typology.Similarly, Prado, a sofa bed by Christian Werner for the French company Ligne Roset, is one of several recent designs promoting the idea that the family that surfs together on individual devices needs a new style of furniture. The traditional couch that is placed against a wall facing a television may now be less practical than this big, armless, backless surface punctuated with movable but stable backrests. Family members can sit or lounge on it, facing different directions. Remove the cushions and it becomes a bed.And context is always instructive. Even as design fairs grow more global (more than half of Maison et Objet\u2019s exhibitors are international, and the show just announced plans to travel to Singapore in March and to Miami next year), each fair has its own character. This one offered a view of French designers who are mired in a depressed economy and searching for ways to translate their elegance, rationality and humor into sellable objects.\u201cWe still don\u2019t have an industry, which is problematic,\u201d said the Paris designer Patrick Jouin. \u201cLigne Roset and Fermob,\u201d he added, referring to the outdoor furniture company. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201dIt is a tribute to Mr. Jouin\u2019s stature that commissions for him, at least, pour in from around the world. He recently introduced a chair for the Italian company Pedrali, renovated the lounge and restaurant of the Bayerischer Hof hotel in Munich and redid the Van Cleef & Arpels boutique in New York. At the same time, he is designing the restaurant and all the furniture for the new headquarters of France\u2019s Ministry of Defense, a three-million-square-foot building in Paris that will house 10,000 workers when it opens next year. Arik Levy, another French designer with a large international clientele, has been collaborating with small companies in countries with developing design interests, like Turkey and the Czech Republic. Historically, he said, France has paid more attention to fashion, perfume and wine than industrial design, and the neglect has turned corrosive in the long economic malaise. \u201cDesign is based on entrepreneurial energy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are all micro companies. Financially, the situation in France is killing every entrepreneurial initiative.\u201dBut a lack of government support does not seem to have discouraged a growing number of French designers, fresh out of school, from entrepreneurship. Young companies with names like the Y\u2019a Pas Le Feu Au Lac, slang for \u201cno need to rush,\u201d and Petite Friture, or \u201csmall fry,\u201d showed pieces like cylindrical wooden containers with architectural tops and a giant skeletal chandelier that rotated gently overhead.This youthful independence is new, Mr. Jouin said. More typically, designers here apprentice with established ones before going out on their own. Mr. Jouin started in the studio of Philippe Starck. \u201cTo create your own company is normal for Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cNot for the French.\u201d And what of the giants? Pierre Roset, chief executive of Ligne Roset, described a practice, common among international design producers, of spreading goods out onto a giant virtual carpet. The company has showrooms and distributors throughout the world, and it is adapting popular products to the small-scaled homes of cities like New York and San Francisco. (It recently introduced the luxuriant Ploum sofa, by Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec, as a love seat with the adorable presence of a baby hippo.) And as it sees the age of its core consumer rising well above 40, it is trying to lure intimidated younger consumers into the store with furniture like the new Tarmac storage system, by Dieter Zimmer and Burkhard Hess, which sells for less than its usual fare.\u201cMore and more, the young generation appreciates design and interiors products,\u201d Mr. Roset said. \u201cThe problem for them is the price.\u201d He estimated that it would cost less than $6,000 to outfit a room with Tarmac, and the buyers, he added, would be able to take the system with them when they moved.In the end, Maison et Objet was worth the visit if only for the pleasure of its surprises: antique saucers paired with gilded teacups that reflected the patterns (by Richard Brendon of London), a life-size sisal dog sculpture designed as a scratching post for cats (by Erik Stehmann for the Dutch studio Soonsalon), a table and chandelier made of borosilicate laboratory glass (by Studio deForm of Prague) and a hookah that is a stylized whirling dervish (by Karim Rashid for the Istanbul-based Gaia & Gino). There was no shortage of vitality in the fairgrounds, much of it evident in the ferment of various styles. \u201cI have two visions: the French and the Italian,\u201d said Mr. Nigro, the much-lauded designer, who was born in France but spent 12 years in the Milanese studio of Michele De Lucchi, a founder of Memphis. Mr. Nigro characterized his Italian side as spontaneous, artistic and experimental, and his French side as quiet and determined. The enthusiasm of many of the other French designers struck a similar note. That can-do spirit. That mix of influences. It felt almost ... American.Advertisement"}

While such behavior may serve his interests, it does not serve his long-suffering country\u2019s.Mr. Karzai \u2014 like most citizens of his country \u2014 is fed up with airstrikes and civilian deaths after a dozen years of war. But the United Nations has said that most civilians are killed by the Taliban. Instead of dealing with the issue honestly, Mr. Karzai uses it to demonize America. Publicly, he seems to blame the United States for the war with the Taliban. Privately, according to reports, he has suggested that Americans may have aided or conducted attacks aimed at undermining his government. That\u2019s hard to believe, but, if he has evidence, he should produce it.No one knows what Mr. Karzai\u2019s game is. He may be seeking leverage before April\u2019s presidential election, or as some believe, he may really want all coalition troops out because he thinks that America is conniving with Pakistan to perpetuate the conflict and divide the country.Some Afghans have pushed back against Mr. Karzai\u2019s conspiracies and destructive ways but not enough. The candidates running to succeed him owe voters a vision of how they will improve governance, reduce corruption and work more productively with the United States and its allies, who have spent billions of dollars to underwrite Afghanistan\u2019s economy and will be asked to continue the aid, at reduced levels, in the years to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Opposition Says No to Ukraine on Power Share", "Date": "2014-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 In a striking concession aimed at defusing Ukraine\u2019s civil uprising and preserving his own grip on power, President Viktor F. Yanukovych on Saturday offered to install opposition leaders in top posts in a reshaped government, but they swiftly rebuffed the offer to the delight of thousands of protesters on the street craving a fuller victory in the days ahead.With mass protests spreading across the country, Mr. Yanukovych proposed one opposition figure, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, as prime minister and another, the former boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, as vice prime minister for humanitarian affairs. Mr. Yatsenyuk is a leader of Fatherland, the party of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s archrival, the jailed former prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko.\u201cNo deal,\u201d Mr. Yatsenyuk wrote on Twitter, addressing Mr. Yanukovych as thousands of angry protesters streamed to the still-occupied Independence Square, undeterred by the biting cold. \u201cWe\u2019re finishing what we started,\u201d he added. \u201cThe people decide our leaders, not you.\u201dIn a speech from the stage on the square, and in a news conference afterward, Mr. Yatsenyuk expressed more flexibility, but insisted that the embattled president was no longer in a position to dictate the terms of a deal. \u201cWe have our conditions,\u201d he said, \u201cnot your conditions.\u201dThose conditions, Mr. Yatsenyuk said, would include reconsideration of the far-reaching political and free trade agreements with the European Union that Mr. Yanukovych had promised to sign, but then abandoned. That decision set off the protests in late November. Mr. Yatsenyuk also said that Ms. Tymoshenko must be released from prison as European leaders have insisted.Many demonstrators on the streets of Kiev, the capital, including some involved in violent clashes with the police, have been demanding Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s resignation, which he did not offer. And the fury of the crowd made clear that the leaders would almost certainly have faced a mutiny had they accepted the deal.\u201cShame!\u201d some chanted as Mr. Yatsenyuk began his remarks by saying that the opposition was not afraid to lead the country. Others shouted, \u201cBetrayer!\u201dIn a further complication, some of the most aggressive demonstrators are supporters of the nationalist Svoboda Party and its leader, Oleg Tyagnibok, who took part in the talks with Mr. Yanukovych but was not offered a position.Mr. Klitschko, who leads a party called the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform, said that protesters would remain on the streets as negotiations continued.Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s willingness to remove Prime Minister Mykola Azarov, who has been his staunch ally through the more than two-month-long civic uprising, underscored just how much pressure he has been facing to contain the crisis.His offer came as protests continued to spread across the country on Saturday, with efforts to occupy or blockade government buildings underway in at least a dozen cities besides Kiev. In recent days, it has become increasingly clear that the elite Berkut riot police and other Interior Ministry troops are outnumbered and would face enormous challenges if asked to enforce a state of emergency.Late Friday night, a fragile truce had disintegrated in Kiev and the city again was convulsed in violence.In a move that suggested that his offers were more than theatrics aimed at dividing the opposition, Mr. Yanukovych also said he would be willing to roll back constitutional changes made at his direction that broadly expanded the powers of the presidency earlier in his term.He also agreed to make changes to a package of new laws that severely suppress political dissent, including freedoms of speech and assembly, which Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s backers rammed through Parliament on Jan. 16. And he reiterated his offer to free all detained protesters who have not been charged with serious crimes.At his news conference late Saturday, Mr. Yatsenyuk said talks with Mr. Yanukovych would continue. \u201cWe do not reject the offer,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we do not accept it.\u201dThe concessions were announced in a statement on the presidential website on Saturday after a negotiation session lasting more than three hours. The leadership changes were offered in a portion of the statement attributed to the minister of justice, Olena Lukash, who took part in the talks.Ms. Lukash said that Mr. Yanukovych had also agreed to engage in a public debate with Mr. Klitschko, who has said he plans to challenge Mr. Yanukovych in the presidential election next year.Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s offer also called for reshaping the Central Election Commission to give opposition parties more influence \u2014 a step that is seen as important to preventing election fraud, which has been a persistent problem in Ukrainian balloting.Still, there seemed to be some strategizing in Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s proposal, by offering the prime minister post to Mr. Yatsenyuk, rather than to Mr. Klitschko, who is more popular in public opinion polls and is likely to pose a sharper challenge in next year\u2019s presidential campaign.Even before the three opposition leaders could return to Independence Square from the talks at the presidential headquarters, violence flared in the main conflict zone, near the Dynamo soccer stadium. Tires were once again set ablaze on the street, and protesters clashed with special police units inside Ukraine House, a public conference center nearby.Before offering the concessions, Mr. Yanukovych was pressed by two of the nation\u2019s wealthiest men, the so-called oligarchs who control Ukraine\u2019s industry and economy and also wield influence in Parliament. Both men warned, in separate statements, that Ukraine was in danger of splintering.System Capital Management, a conglomerate owned by Ukraine\u2019s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov, regarded as a close ally of Mr. Yanukovych, issued a statement lamenting the loss of life in recent days and offering condolences.\u201cBusiness cannot keep silent when people are killed; a real danger of breakup of the country emerges; when a political crisis can lead to a deep economic recession and thus inevitably result in lower standards of living,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is only by peaceful action that the political crisis can be resolved. Any use of force and weapons is unacceptable.\u201dAnother billionaire, Petro Poroshenko, a member of Parliament who is viewed as a potential future presidential candidate, issued a statement calling on lawmakers loyal to Mr. Yanukovych to join with opposition leaders to reach a compromise.\u201cUkraine has never faced such a big threat,\u201d Mr. Poroshenko said. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a political crisis. It\u2019s a crisis of statehood. In danger are the lives of our fellow citizens, civil peace and territorial integrity.\u201d\u201cAnyone who fails to see it or denies it,\u201d he added, \u201cis either blind or a provocateur.\u201d Mr. Poroshenko later appeared on the stage with the opposition leaders in Independence Square.Protesters gathered in the freezing cold made no secret of their displeasure with Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s offer and their lack of trust in politicians, even those who have been leading the protest effort, like Mr. Yatsenyuk.\u201cIf he accepts this offer, he will be a betrayer,\u201d said Volodymyr, declining to give his last name, an unemployed economist from the western city of Ivan-Frankivsk, who was wearing a helmet and respirator, common among those who have been at the center of clashes with the police. \u201cIf they accept it, they will all be political corpses,\u201d he said, Before word came of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s concessions, opposition leaders had been bracing for a declaration of a state of emergency, which they warned would only lead to further bloodshed.Saturday also brought news that a protester injured during battles with the police had died in a Kiev hospital, raising the confirmed death toll to four.After Mr. Yanukovych backed away from the political and free trade agreements with Europe, he turned to Russia, which agreed to provide $15 billion in loans and discounts on natural gas to stave off an economic collapse that some experts warned was imminent. With its money on the line, Russia has also expressed consternation about the spreading protests.On Saturday, mass demonstrations and sieges of public buildings spread to at least three more cities, with thousands of protesters occupying the regional administration building in Vinnytsia, a city in central Ukraine about 90 miles from the border with Moldova. Demonstrators also blocked a government building in Chernihiv, north of Kiev, near the border with Belarus, and held a large rally in Poltava, about 200 miles southeast of Kiev.Those actions, combined with the violence in the capital, drew pleas \u2014 both domestically and from abroad \u2014 for calm and for a peaceful solution.Adrian Karatnycky, an expert on Ukraine at the Atlantic Council of the United States, a research group, said that the opposition leaders would almost certainly want guarantees of changes to the Constitution before agreeing to any deal.\u201cThis is a first offer from Yanukovych, a sign he has blinked,\u201d Mr. Karatnycky said. \u201cThe concessions Yanukovych has made are signs that his base wants to sue for peace. But the offer is not enough, as there is no trust in him.\u201dOksana Lyachynska contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Minimum Wage: Whose Burden?", "Date": "2014-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTO THE EDITOR:Professor Mankiw prefers the earned-income tax credit, which is supposedly fairer because it is paid for by taxpayers as a whole. But is it not unfair for employers to reap the benefits of an employee\u2019s labor without paying the employee enough to live at a baseline level in our society? Raising the minimum wage merely requires employers to pay more of the true cost of the labor they use. Conversely, the earned-income tax credit can be thought of as a government subsidy to some employers, enabling them to pay artificially low wages. Where\u2019s the fairness in that?LARRY KOLODNEYCAMBRIDGE, MASS., JAN. 5TO THE EDITOR:Professor Mankiw argues that raising the minimum wage concentrates the cost of subsidizing wages \u201con a small subset of businesses and their customers.\u201d But that is precisely where it belongs.First, many of these businesses are highly and even stupendously profitable. Therefore they are socializing their costs \u2014 and pocketing the difference for themselves \u2014 by not paying their workers a living wage. Second, when low-wage businesses tout low prices to their customers, they skirt the simple fact that these prices are more accurately described as artificially low. Their customers no more deserve goods and services at prices that foist some of the business\u2019s true costs onto society than I deserve to simply dump my trash into my neighbor\u2019s garbage can, to be carted away on her dime.STEVE TRIPOLISUDBURY, MASS, JAN. 5\u00a0TO THE EDITOR:As the column says, the minimum wage directly taxes providers of jobs for low-skilled workers. A result must be fewer affordable low-skill job openings because of rising business costs.Why do people insist on taxing business to pay this subsidy? The answer is that many voters do not understand that business rather than government is the ultimate source of all income. What selectively hurts a business selectively hurts those who depend on it for their livelihood.Business ultimately provides all income, including the income of government workers from the taxes paid by business and its employees. And business provides the innovation, risk investment and organization for the efficient generation of the income that sustains our economy.Unfortunately, some media have imbued business with a negative reputation as greedy and callous about the welfare of its workers, whereas government, the source of handouts, is presented as the good fairy.HOLLISTER SYKESCRANFORD, N.J., JAN. 5\u00a0TO THE EDITOR:The column says businesses may already be doing more than their share by providing jobs to the unskilled. I would argue that businesses are not concerned about doing their share; they hire these workers because their labor contributes to business profits. And in many cases, businesses will continue to hire these workers if the minimum wage is raised. They can\u2019t use robots to change the linen on hotel beds.TERESA W. SHEPHERDAVONDALE ESTATES, GA., JAN. 5\u00a0TO THE EDITOR:The idea that an increased minimum wage is a tax on employers is preposterous. It is rather a requirement that employers establish business models that provide for living wages so that taxpayers are not obliged \u2014 via programs like food stamps, Medicaid, etc. \u2014 to supplement or pay for essential goods and services that low-paid employees cannot afford.Setting a legal minimum levels the playing field so that businesses compete with one another not by forever seeking to reduce wages and benefits, but rather by better performance. Any increased costs, generally quite minimal, are typically passed on to the direct consumers, which is appropriate, not to taxpayers at large (not even upper- and middle-income ones).RICHARD KOGUTMERCED, CALIF, JAN. 5Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Next Job Application Could Involve a Video Game", "Date": "2014-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyBrittni Daron jumped through a lot of hoops before she landed her job as a solution consultant at Oracle. At the tech giant, as at other firms in Silicon Valley to which she applied, she endured weeks \u00ad \u2014 and occasionally months \u2014 of phone interviews, in-person interviews, mock presentations, personality tests and technical tests for both the skills she claimed to have and those she didn\u2019t. This might sound a little ridiculous, but it\u2019s not unusual. I\u2019ve met lots of job seekers in the last few years who underwent a similar form of H.R. torture \u2014 spelling quizzes, math exams and oddball brainteasers (\u201cIf you were a pizza-delivery man, how would you benefit from scissors?\u201d) \u2014 only to walk out of the interview room wondering what they\u2019d really just been tested for. \u201cBasically, I could never figure out what they got out of it that qualified or disqualified me for the job,\u201d Daron told me.These days, companies have become more cautious about whom they hire. The average length of the job-interview process has nearly doubled from 12 days in 2009 to 23 days in 2013, according to an analysis by Glassdoor, a website where users rate employers. (Curiously, biotech and pharmaceutical companies averaged the longest interviewing periods, at 29 days per candidate.) At the same time, many employers are also trying to become more cost-effective. Since interviewing takes time and resources, companies have increasingly focused on finding work-force-analytics software that can make the process cheaper and more efficient \u2014 and ideally better at identifying the most promising candidates early on. \u201cThere is a huge amount of money to be made in matching people to their careers better,\u201d Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at M.I.T., told me, \u201cand improving the allocation of trillions of dollars of human capital.\u201dBrynjolfsson is advising one start-up that hopes to revolutionize what might be called the human-capital-allocation market. The company, Knack, uses video games as a screening device to determine how creative, cautious, adept at multitasking or easily distracted, among other attributes, potential job applicants are. Its \u201cWasabi Waiter\u201d game, for example, casts the player as a server at a sushi restaurant who must figure out what dishes to recommend. It\u2019s one of the more gimmicky-sounding entrants in an already crowded field competing for that \u201chuge amount of money.\u201d Other companies include start-ups like ConnectCubed (another gaming-based assessment technology), Good.Co, Evolv and Prophesy Sciences, as well as older firms that also provide other personnel-management tools, like Kronos.These companies are an outgrowth of the \u201cMoneyball\u201d-style, buzzwordy \u201cbig data\u201d empiricism that has transformed fields from professional baseball to political campaigns. H.R. firms are increasingly administering newfangled tests to existing employees to track which traits or habits correlate with whatever the firm considers to be evidence of success. Then they try to identify those characteristics in potential hires through cold, hard observational data, rather than through hiring managers\u2019 far mushier gut reactions and candidates\u2019 self-reported declarations of \u201cgreatest strengths and weaknesses.\u201dThe idea that a video game or a fancy test could, in one fell swoop, better and more cheaply match people to their jobs is a seductive one. But it\u2019s also a bit trickier than finding a way to recreate Jason Giambi\u2019s offensive output at a fraction of his salary. Administering a test or a game remotely has the potential to pull in a lot more job candidates who might not otherwise have been considered \u2014 people who didn\u2019t go to elite schools, for example \u2014 but it could also screen out entire classes\u00ad of workers. Millennials might be totally cool with playing a video game set in a sushi restaurant as part of a job application, but some older workers might balk. (Then again, even I, a millennial, got a little sweaty-palmed when I sat down to play Wasabi Waiter.)There\u2019s also the matter of the quality of the tools themselves. Do they really measure the things we want them to measure? A lot of these start-ups promote projects they\u2019ve done with individual companies that show strong correlations between some test question or observable behavior and various success metrics. Knack has worked with Shell, for example, and a lot of medical employers; and Evolv with Xerox and Harte-Hanks. But in an economy where work proc\u00adesses and the requisite skills change very quickly, it\u2019s not clear that yesterday\u2019s correlation is a helpful predictor of whether an applicant will be a high performer tomorrow, said John Sullivan, an H.R. consultant and management professor at San Francisco State University. In the meantime, you might worry that job applicants can figure out how to game the system. Or that you\u2019re just cloning the workers you already have, rather than bringing in new perspectives.The very act of quantifying certain characteristics may also give a false sense of precision that leads to overweighting the things quantified. \u201cYou are what you measure,\u201d warned Dan Ariely, an economist at Duke. Ariely thinks the hiring process should become more data-driven, but acknowledges that applying sabermetrics, or the sort of empiricism that helped turn Billy Beane\u2019s Oakland A\u2019s into a winner, to the recruiting process can still create distortions. Online dating sites, for instance, often overemphasize measurable and sortable attributes (like height and income) at the expense of other ineffable ones that might be more useful or relevant. \u201cIf I want to hire people for my basketball team, it\u2019s easy to tell who\u2019s seven feet tall and who can shoot the ball really well,\u201d explained Alvin Roth, a Stanford economist who shared a Nobel Prize for his work on market design and recently joined Knack\u2019s board. \u201cThe hard thing is figuring out when they\u2019re on the court, how will the rest of the team do?\u201dHuman beings still beat computers at detecting these sorts of soft skills, like empathy. But the people-analytics industry is hot on their tail. Right now, the gaps and glitches in these various vetting systems may encourage companies to subject their potential hires, like Daron, to even more opaque tests than a mystery-illness patient on \u201cHouse.\u201d But soon enough, perhaps, some firm might convincingly prove that a single, simple algorithm can replace the good old-fashioned grill session.That might sound a little scary, but automating and expediting the hiring process, if done successfully, offers huge benefits. Three-quarters of the nation\u2019s wealth is in the form of human capital; the talent and training of workers, in other words, offers far more value to the overall economy than anything else. Better allocation and investment could provide huge returns for everyone, which is particularly important at a time when 10 million Americans can\u2019t find work and extended unemployment can deteriorate their skills. The faster we can place America\u2019s workers in jobs they\u2019re good at \u2014 even if they need to play a video game to get there \u2014 the better.Catherine Rampell is an economics reporter for The\nTimes.

{"Headline": "Why Bankers Have Gotten a Pass", "Date": "2014-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorial ObserverThe comforting answer \u2014 that no fraud was committed \u2014 is possible, but implausible. \u201cWhile officials of the Department of Justice have been more circumspect in describing the roots of the financial crisis than have the various commissions of inquiry and other government agencies,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI have seen nothing to indicate their disagreement with the widespread conclusion that fraud at every level permeated the bubble in mortgage-backed securities.\u201dSo why no high-level prosecutions? According to Judge Rakoff, evidence of fraud without prosecution of fraud indicates prosecutorial weaknesses. Under the deal, JPMorgan Chase, which served as Mr. Madoff\u2019s primary bank for more than two decades, must pay a $1.7 billion penalty, essentially for turning a blind eye to Mr. Madoff\u2019s fraud. It must also take steps to improve its anti-money-laundering controls. And it had to acknowledge, among other facts, that shortly before the fraud was revealed, the bank withdrew nearly $300 million of its money from Madoff-related funds. By adhering to the settlement terms, the bank will avoid criminal indictment on two felony violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. No individuals were named or charged. And that is the problem. Until relatively recently, it was rare for corporations to face criminal charges without the simultaneous prosecution of managers or executives. That changed over the past three decades, as prosecutors shifted their focus away from individuals and toward corporations, as if fault resides not in executives, but in corporate culture. That shift, in Judge Rakoff\u2019s view, largely explains the lack of banker prosecutions from the financial crisis. It also explains the JPMorgan Chase settlement in the Madoff case. A likely consequence of this approach is more wrongdoing, since, as Judge Rakoff argues, imposing compliance measures that are often just window-dressing is far less potent than \u201cthe future deterrent value of successfully prosecuting individuals.\u201d Even worse is the distortion of justice. In the financial crisis, prosecutors not only took a hands-off approach to bankers, but to banks as well for fear that indicting a big bank could harm the economy. The JPMorgan Chase settlement in the Madoff case also sidesteps justice by relying on \u201cdeferred prosecution.\u201d That tactic, wrote Judge Rakoff, makes prosecutors happy because they tell themselves that the threat of prosecution will deter future crime; it makes corporations happy because they avoid indictment; and happiest of all are the executives or former executives responsible for the misconduct who are left untouched.In addition, he explains, deferred prosecution is \u201ctechnically suspect\u201d because, under the law, prosecutors should not threaten to indict a company unless they can prove that some company manager committed the alleged crime, and if that can be proved, why not indict the manager? He also finds it \u201cmorally suspect\u201d because it punishes innocent shareholders and employees for wrongdoing committed by unprosecuted individuals. As the myriad cases against JPMorgan Chase and other banks demonstrate, misconduct was not limited to the mortgage bubble. But unless prosecutorial weaknesses are remedied, justice will continue to prove elusive. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Program to End Homelessness Among Veterans Reaches a Milestone in Arizona", "Date": "2014-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHOENIX \u2014 Their descent into homelessness began almost as soon as they had closed a dignified chapter in their lives: their military service.Dexter Mackenstadt, 63, a sailor who spent the Vietnam War tracking submarines along the East Coast, slipped into alcoholism. Robert Stone, 56, who spent three years stationed at naval bases in California, fell to that, too, and to a failing heart. John Hankins, 52, who repaired intercontinental ballistic missiles at an Air Force base in Wyoming, spent years as a drifter, living in a methamphetamine lab in the Arizona desert.In 2011, by a city count, there were 222 chronically homeless veterans here, a vulnerable, hard-to-reach population of mostly middle-age men, virtually all battling some type of physical or mental ailment along with substance abuse. Federal and city officials acknowledged that was not an exact number, but it is widely regarded as the best measure of the veteran population.Last month, the last 41 members of that group were placed in temporary housing. Shane Groen, a director at the Arizona Coalition to End Homelessness, one of the city\u2019s partners in the program, said the goal was to have them all in permanent housing by Feb. 14.Mr. Stone said, \u201cI\u2019m coming up on nine months sober, and a big part of it is because I have a roof over my head.\u201d He lived on the streets off and on for 15 years until he moved into an apartment here in March.Arizona has more homeless veterans than most other states \u2014 roughly one in five homeless adults, according to statistics from the state\u2019s Department of Veterans\u2019 Services. In an interview, Greg Stanton, the mayor of Phoenix and a longtime proponent of increasing investment and partnerships on homeless outreach, characterized the recent achievement as \u201cimportant because we\u2019re helping people in need, but also important because it helps our economy.\u201dAcross the country, the strategy is centered on an approach called Housing First, through which a home is not treated as a reward for good behavior. As Ms. Zeilinger put it, it is instead \u201cthe platform of stability that lets previously homeless people work on the other issues they\u2019re facing,\u201d like mental illness and addiction, which are particularly common among the chronically homeless. The term is defined as those who have continuously lived on the streets for a year or have done so at least four times over three years.There is also the challenge of sustaining the investment, given the steady stream of soldiers back from Iraq and Afghanistan who have been ending up on the streets.\u201cThe question,\u201d said Mr. Peck, who served in the Marine Corps in Vietnam, \u201cis how we create enough housing units to house those who are homeless and where we find the money to provide all the services that are essential to keep them in those units.\u201dIn cities like Philadelphia and Salt Lake City, private donors and religious groups have helped pay for the types of expenses not covered by the vouchers, like furniture and security deposits. Here the United Way is funding 14 workers known as navigators, who have been deployed to walk the veterans through the confusing process of applying for benefits and housing. One of them, James Roberson, 57, who served in the Navy in the Persian Gulf, said the job also involved more mundane tasks, like making sure the veterans had food at home, that they were clean and that their apartments were in order.Patience is crucial, he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t force things on people who have been on the streets so long,\u201d he said. \u201cThey won\u2019t take it.\u201dWhile the retention rate for homeless veterans placed in permanent housing stood at 85 percent nationally after one year, a survey by the Arizona Coalition to End Homelessness put it at 94 percent in Phoenix, a success attributed largely to the navigator program.Mr. Hankins, the former airman, was homeless for six years when a Veterans Affairs social worker stationed at the agency where he had gone to recharge his food stamps card pulled him aside and offered to help. He is one of eight clients of Mr. Roberson\u2019s at Victory Place.\u201cIf I had to do this on my own,\u201d Mr. Hankins said one recent morning as he strolled in Victory Place, \u201cI\u2019d never have made it here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Support at Fed for Slow Stimulus Cuts", "Date": "2014-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision in December to taper its bond-buying campaign reflected increased confidence in the economy and continued uneasiness about the stimulus effort, according to an official account of the December meeting.The Fed plans to expand its bond holdings by $75 billion this month, down from $85 billion each month last year, and officials have suggested a similar cut is the most likely result when the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee next meets in late January.The Fed\u2019s path forward is a final compromise forged by its outgoing chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. Some Fed officials worry that the economy needs still more help; others argue that the Fed already is doing more harm than good. Mr. Bernanke, who will step down at the end of the month, predicted in June that the Fed would decide to taper by the end of the year, and it did.\u201cParticipants generally anticipated that the improvement in labor market conditions would continue, and most had become more confident in that outlook,\u201d the account said. \u201cAgainst this backdrop, most participants saw a reduction in the pace of purchases as appropriate at this meeting and consistent with the committee\u2019s previous policy communications.\u201dFed officials are increasingly confident that the economy will grow more quickly in 2014. In part, the outlook is improving because there is no sign that the federal government is planning another round of spending cuts, which have slowed economic growth in recent years.The account noted that the economy has added a monthly average of 190,000 jobs over the last 15 months, and officials expect those numbers to increase. The Commerce Department plans on Friday to release employment data for December. Analysts expect the economy added 195,000 jobs last month.But even Mr. Rosengren\u2019s view of the economy has since brightened. He told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that he was reconciled to reducing bond purchases in $10 billion increments, though he cautioned against an increase in the pace of the retreat. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable with the current approach that it looks like we\u2019re going to be following through on,\u201d he said.Still, the minutes of the December meeting reflected lingering concern among Fed officials about two exceptions to the theme of recovery. The pace of price increases has remained sluggish, and the share of adults in the labor force has fallen.In a statement published after its December meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee said that it was watching inflation closely even as it reduced its support for the economy. Fed officials continue to predict that inflation will return to normal levels over the next several years, and they note that asset prices tied to inflation still reflect a similar expectation.The account said that some officials noted that prices for health care and financial services had climbed particularly slowly in recent years, holding down the overall rate of price increases, and they predicted that would prove transitory.Other officials, however, \u201craised the possibility that recent declines in inflation might suggest that the economic recovery was not as strong as some thought,\u201d according to the minutes of the meeting.Fed officials also disagreed about the decline in labor force participation. The unemployment rate has decreased steadily over the last several years, reaching a new postrecession low of 7 percent in November, but that is largely because fewer people are looking for work. Job growth has kept pace with population growth; the share of adults with jobs has not increased.Some Fed officials say they see reduced participation as a direct result of the recession, and they argue that the Fed therefore must look beyond the unemployment rate in judging the need for additional stimulus. Others point to demographic explanations, like more workers reaching retirement age. Or they argue that monetary policy lacks the power to draw people back to work.The issue is likely to gain in importance as the Fed winds down its asset purchases. The central bank is expected to focus on the measure it regards as the core of its stimulus campaign, its declared intention to hold short-term interest rates near zero at least as long as the jobless rate remains above 6.5 percent. The Fed has said that it plans to keep rates near zero after that threshold is crossed. How much longer will rest in part on its conclusions about its power to increase labor force participation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Influential Minister Behind Argentina\u2019s Economic Shift", "Date": "2014-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 As Argentina absorbs the shock from a sharp plunge in its currency, President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner\u2019s mercurial young economy minister, Axel Kicillof, a scholar with rockabilly-style sideburns and an aversion to business suits, is emerging as the face of policy shifts that are sending tremors through financial markets around the developing world.The rise of Mr. Kicillof, whose writings use Marxist concepts to interpret the work of the British economist John Maynard Keynes, points to efforts by the authorities to assert greater state control over Argentina\u2019s economy at a time when growth is slowing significantly and inflation is soaring.\u201cHe\u2019s the strongest economy minister Argentina has had in a decade,\u201d said Ezequiel Burgo, the author of \u201cThe Believer,\u201d a book about Mr. Kicillof. \u201cHe\u2019s confrontational, outwardly self-confident and sometimes perceived as being arrogant, which of course makes him stand out at a time like this.\u201dBefore advising Mrs. Kirchner on economic matters, Mr. Kicillof taught economics at the University of Buenos Aires. He rose to prominence as a deputy minister in 2012 when he directed the nationalization of YPF, the Argentine oil company then controlled by Repsol, the Spanish energy giant.He has repeatedly justified the seizure of YPF, which Repsol had acquired in 1999, in pointed critiques of Argentina\u2019s economic policies in the 1990s of fixing the currency to the dollar and selling state assets. In November, while reviewing Argentina\u2019s offer to compensate Repsol for its stake in YPF, he contended that authorities had previously laid the foundations \u201cfor the pillaging of our companies.\u201dSince Mrs. Kirchner named him economy minister in November, Mr. Kicillof has been thrust into the spotlight.Paparazzi trail him around his middle-class neighborhood, Parque Chas, and a celebrity magazine has described his relatively modest lifestyle \u2014 reflected in the car he drives, a compact 2008 Renault, and his decision to forgo bodyguards on a vacation with his wife, a literature professor, and their two small children. One columnist for the magazine Noticias went so far as to examine the psychology of Mr. Kicillof\u2019s sideburns, questioning whether they fit within a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll tradition of chafing at authority, or within the fashions of 19th century Argentine political leaders who sought to display virility and power.Mr. Kicillof has shown a flair for clashing with critics. In an interview published on Sunday by the pro-government newspaper P\u00e1gina 12, he warned against what he called \u201cdisinformation\u201d campaigns on social media networks that could destabilize Argentina\u2019s financial system.\u201cEconomic phenomena can have this magic,\u201d he said, referring to the circumstances around some bank runs. \u201cThey are self-fulfilling prophecies, results of a herd mentality which have no real cause.\u201dBorn to middle-class parents who prized intellectual achievement, Mr. Kicillof grew up in Recoleta, an elegant neighborhood in Buenos Aires. His father committed suicide when Mr. Kicillof was 22, according to Mr. Burgo\u2019s book. Mr. Kicillof\u2019s mother is a prominent psychologist. Before he became a fixture of Argentina\u2019s political establishment, Mr. Kicillof gained notoriety as a leader of an anti-establishment student organization at the University of Buenos Aires, where he went on to earn his doctorate and lecture against orthodox economic theories as a professor.Mr. Kicillof also gained a reputation for being obsessed with numbers in some industries. After he began requesting spreadsheets from oil companies with details of wells, investments and production, the news media here reported that industry executives began calling him Excel, after the Microsoft spreadsheet application. While he is sometimes criticized for his leftist views by Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s opponents, he has also led a shift in the government\u2019s policies as Argentina seeks to regain access to global financial markets, following the country\u2019s default on its foreign debt in 2002 during a severe economic crisis.For instance, with Mr. Kicillof at the helm of the economy ministry, Argentina has begun discussions with Repsol over compensation for the seizure of its shares in YPF. Argentina is also trying to appease the International Monetary Fund, which censured the country in 2013 over the accuracy of its economic statistics, by releasing a revised inflation index next month.In an attempt to obtain a $3 billion loan from the World Bank, Argentina has also settled disputes through the bank\u2019s arbitration body with five companies claiming a total of more than $650 million. This month, Mr. Kicillof traveled to France to discuss with creditors the repayment of Argentina\u2019s estimated $10 billion debt.But as Argentina tries to halt a plunge in the central bank\u2019s international reserves, Mr. Kicillof\u2019s critics have also grown more outspoken, arguing that he helped create some of the problems he is now trying to solve.Alfonso Prat-Gay, a former president of the central bank, called Mr. Kicillof\u2019s recent maneuvering \u201ca scandal,\u201d especially in relation to Argentina\u2019s renewed efforts to reach an agreement with foreign creditors and the sharp fall of the peso. \u201cYou don\u2019t solve things with a devaluation, but with a credible economic program,\u201d Mr. Prat-Gay told a local radio station.Some people here believe Mr. Kicillof is out of his depth in government. H\u00e9ctor Zum\u00e1rraga, 68, a labor rights lawyer, said: \"He\u2019s not up to the job. He doesn\u2019t understand that it\u2019s not enough to know just economic theory, and we\u2019re seeing proof of that now.\"Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korean Leader Says He Wants Better Ties With South", "Date": "2013-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cNorth and South Korea should create a mood to improve relations,\u201d Mr. Kim said in a nationally televised New Year\u2019s Day speech. \u201cIt\u2019s time to end useless slandering, and the North and the South should no longer do things that harm reconciliation and harmony.\u201dMr. Kim began delivering a New Year\u2019s Day speech after coming to power two years ago, reviving the practice of his grandfather Kim Il-sung. During the rule of his reclusive father, Kim Jong-il, the country\u2019s main state-run newspapers issued a joint editorial to mark the day. Analysts waited for this year\u2019s speech with unusual interest because it would be the first since the purge of Mr. Jang, long considered Mr. Kim\u2019s mentor and the regime\u2019s No. 2 figure. Mr. Jang was executed on Dec. 12 on charges of building a faction within the ruling Workers\u2019 Party in a plot to overthrow Mr. Kim\u2019s government.\u201cWe took decisive actions to remove factional filth,\u201d Mr. Kim said Wednesday in an apparent reference to the purge of Mr. Jang and his associates. \u201cOur party has tightened its revolutionary ranks by making a timely decision to ferret out and purge the anti-party, anti-revolutionary factional clique.\u201dThe purge was the biggest political upheaval in North Korea in recent years. Some analysts have said it indicated the further consolidation of Mr. Kim\u2019s rule. But others speculated that he had failed to establish the kind of absolute authority that his father and grandfather wielded and that the purge signaled a power struggle in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.South Korean policy-makers have warned that North Korea may attempt military provocations against the South to build internal unity after the domestic political trouble.In his speech, Mr. Kim repeated his government\u2019s traditional condemnation of the United States and South Korea for conducting war games on the divided Korean Peninsula. The exercises \u201ccreated a situation where a trifle military skirmish can spread into a full-blown war,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is another war on this land, it will bring about a nuclear catastrophe, and the United States won\u2019t escape it, either.\u201dMr. Kim had also called for an end to \u201cconfrontation\u201d with South Korea during his last New Year speech, after his country launched a rocket in December 2012. Washington condemned it as a test of long-range missile technology. Mr. Kim\u2019s government further raised tensions by conducting its third underground nuclear test in February.In most of the first half of 2013, the North issued a torrent of threats of missile and nuclear attacks at South Korea, the United States and its bases around the Pacific. But it has since expressed a willingness to re-engage in dialogue. Under Mr. Kim, North Korea adopted the simultaneous development of the economy and the nuclear weapons program as a key party line. Yet years of tightening sanctions have made reviving the moribund economy even harder. South Korean intelligence officials said Mr. Jang\u2019s purge was partly the result of a factional struggle over the spoils of the country\u2019s few sources of foreign currency, like exports of coal.On Wednesday, Mr. Kim echoed the themes of previous New Year messages, emphasizing that improving the living standards of North Koreans and rejuvenating agriculture were main priorities. But he also reiterated a call for strengthening the military through the development of advanced weapons like drones.North Korea has often called for improved ties with the South in its New Year messages. It hopes for the return of billions of dollars of South Korean investment, aid and trade, which had flowed during an era of reconciliation between 1998 and 2008.South Korea\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye, a conservative, says her nation will not provide aid until the North wins the South\u2019s \u201ctrust\u201d by moving toward denuclearization.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Manhattan Real Estate Market Surging at Year\u2019s End", "Date": "2014-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Manhattan real estate market continued a yearlong trend, ending the final quarter of 2013 with a scarcity of listings and surging sales, while prices remained relatively flat. Despite the flurry of sales activity at the end of the year, the median sales price of $855,000 was up just slightly from the same quarter of 2012, according to a report by the Douglas Elliman brokerage firm that will be released on Friday.That number is still far from the market\u2019s peak in 2008, when the median was close to $1 million, but it is up from the market\u2019s bottom in 2009, when the median hovered around $800,000. \u201cI think we\u2019re going in a very good direction,\u201d Diane M. Ramirez, the chief executive of Halstead Property, said. \u201cThe prices are going up but at a very sustainable rate.\u201dA strong local economy, stock market gains and steady foreign interest helped bolster demand for Manhattan apartments as supply continued to shrink, brokers said. The year ended with the fewest available fourth-quarter listings in 14 years, according to the Elliman report. Despite the low inventory of apartments, the number of sales rose 26.8 percent to 3,297 \u2014 the highest fourth-quarter total recorded, outpacing the sales surge at the end of last year when wealthy buyers rushed to close deals before new tax laws kicked in with the new year. This uptick in sales at the end of 2013 was driven in part by closings in expensive condominiums aimed at the upper echelon that had been in contract for many months. Those deals helped push the median sales price for Manhattan condos, including resales, up 14.3 percent to a record $1,320,000, according to the Elliman report. \u201cThe smart developers realized there was an underserved need for large apartments in New York City and this quarter in particular saw a lot of large apartments closing, which helped to drive up the price,\u201d Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group, said. New development had a robust 32 percent increase in median price, as closings skewed toward the high end, according to a report by the Corcoran Group. It is a trend that is expected to continue in 2014 as a number of new luxury developments currently in contract at record-breaking prices are poised to close, Ms. Liebman added, noting that highly anticipated closings in Extell Development\u2019s luxury tower, One57, have just begun. More than 10 condos there priced above $45 million were under contract at the end of 2013, two for more than $90 million. The luxury category, which represents the top 10 percent, \u201ccontinues to grab headlines\u201d with double-digit year-over-year increases, said Andrew Heiberger, the chief executive of Town Residential, which found in its report that the median sales price of the top 10 percent of the market increased $4,604,019 in the fourth quarter, up 15.1 percent from the same period in 2012. The rest of the market, he said, \u201cremained status quo.\u201dCo-ops, which account for the majority of sales, sold at a median price of $660,000 in the fourth quarter, down 2.4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2012, according to Town Residential. But at any category, said Hall F. Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens Residential Sales, buyers do not want to feel like they have overpaid. \u201cThey\u2019re wanting the price they pay to be very justifiable,\u201d he said, adding that price sensitivity continues to help keep the market \u201cvery healthy.\u201d In 2014, brokers expect supply to begin to loosen up. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see a little rise in inventory,\u201d said Dottie Herman, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman, adding that as sales prices increase and sellers gain equity and confidence that they can find something to buy, they are more willing to list. \u201cWhen you have no equity, you\u2019re kind of stuck,\u201d she said. Jonathan J. Miller, the author of Elliman\u2019s report and the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, agreed.

{"Headline": "Ford Remakes F-150, the Nation\u2019s No. 1 Vehicle", "Date": "2014-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 The heady combination of growing sales and big profits has spurred automakers to reinvest heavily in new models and make major changes to some of their most prominent vehicles.No company has stretched further than Ford Motor, the second-largest American automaker after General Motors, which on Monday took the wraps off a radically redesigned pickup truck at the annual Detroit auto show.Instead of playing it safe with its best-selling F-150 truck, Ford will replace its traditional steel body panels with aluminum parts, which saves weight and improves fuel economy.Such a wholesale change would have been unheard-of a few years ago, when Ford and other carmakers were under intense pressure to cut costs and save money.But now Ford has invested heavily to significantly make over the truck, even though it finished 2013 as the nation\u2019s top-selling vehicle of any kind for the 32nd consecutive year.\u201cIt\u2019s all about maintaining leadership,\u201d said Alan R. Mulally, Ford\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe don\u2019t take risks we can\u2019t deliver on.\u201dFord is hardly alone in its efforts to significantly upgrade high-volume products and seek to gain an edge in a competitive marketplace.The aggressive approach is made possible, in part, by drastic improvements in the financial conditions of the Detroit carmakers and their foreign rivals.Ford, like their hometown competitors General Motors and Chrysler, has transferred costly retiree health care obligations to employee trusts.The companies have also reduced the number of workers and factories to better align production with market demand.In addition to cutting costs, the companies are enjoying the fruits of a steadily expanding market for new vehicles in the United States, as well as higher sticker prices for new models.Industry analysts said the companies are intent on building on their recent success with better products loaded with new technology and features\u201cThese turnarounds always take place because of new product,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an independent auto analyst in Detroit. \u201cIn this case, Ford is rolling the dice on the aluminum truck to improve what is already a dominant position.\u201dChrysler, the smallest of the three Detroit car companies, is also pushing hard to capture a bigger chunk of the American market, which last year grew by 7.6 percent, to 15.6 million vehicles.The company has methodically revamped several of its most important models since it was forced to seek a government bailout and file for bankruptcy five years ago.On Monday, it showed off a new version of its Chrysler 200 midsize sedan \u2014 which has lagged the company\u2019s overall growth in the United States.\u201cWe needed a credible competitor in the midsize market,\u201d said Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of Chrysler and its Italian parent company, Fiat.Chrysler spent more than $1 billion to overhaul an assembly plant in Sterling Heights, Mich., to produce the new model, which features a fuel-saving nine-speed transmission and a sleek new body style.Since its bankruptcy and bailout, Chrysler has focused mainly on improving its most successful models, like the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram pickup truck.But Mr. Marchionne said that Chrysler was now financially healthy enough to expend resources on products that, in the past, might have been neglected.\u201cDo we have the resources to do whatever we want to do?\u201d he said. \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201dGeneral Motors, the biggest American automaker, is also revving up product programs that were delayed or hampered by its bankruptcy and bailout in 2009.The company is showing off variations on two hot models, the Chevrolet Corvette sports car and Cadillac ATS sedan, at the Detroit show.G.M. also revealed a redesigned version of its GMC midsize pickup \u2014 a niche vehicle that it could not afford to update when the company was under financial stress.\u201cWe might not have done this before,\u201d said Mark Reuss, who this week takes over as G.M.\u2019s global product chief. \u201cBut we see a lot of open space in the market where we can make gains with a midsize pickup.\u201dOther automakers are also loading up with new models being introduced in Detroit, like a new version of the Fit subcompact from Honda.The star of the show so far, however, has been the Ford pickup.Analysts and executives from competing automakers have expressed mixed views on Ford\u2019s bold strategy to trim 700 pounds of weight in the F-150 with aluminum parts.The question asked repeatedly was why would Ford risk such a broad change of a perennially popular vehicle?\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier about our recent success, but we cannot afford to be complacent for one second,\u201d said William C. Ford Jr., Ford\u2019s executive chairman.Redesigning the truck and updating factories to produce it could cost Ford more than $2 billion, according to estimates by analysts, an enormous commitment, even for the capital-intensive auto industry.\u201cThis is a huge deal,\u201d said Alec Gutierrez, an analyst with the auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book. \u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for Ford in so many ways.\u201dBut Ford has made several large bets on new technology under the leadership of Mr. Mulally, who said recently that he would remain at the automaker at least through this year rather than continue to be considered as a chief executive candidate at the software giant Microsoft.\u201cWe had one of our most fantastic years ever in 2013, but we cannot back off,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to take chances if you want to stay the leader.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Confronting Old Problem May Require a New Deal", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneWe look back upon the Great Depression as a discrete event with a beginning and an end; a long and profound economic shock but one that turned out to be nonetheless temporary. In the 1930s, however, many feared that what John Maynard Keynes clinically called \u201cequilibrium at less than full employment\u201d might, in fact, be the new normal \u2014 forever.There is a lesson here for us, somewhere. In hindsight, the Depression suggests our era will, too, eventually emerge from its economic morass. Yet we should hardly let optimism carry us away.Despite timid buds of growth, profusely irrigated with money by the Federal Reserve, we could be in for a much more enduring stagnation than our leaders in Washington are willing to concede.As he delivered his fifth State of the Union address, President Obama, not unlike President Franklin D. Roosevelt early in his second term, seemed to have given up far too early in the game on trying to stimulate the recovery. He quotes Lorena Hickok, a former reporter for The Associated Press who joined the Roosevelt administration in 1933 to work on the New Deal: \u201cThe majority of those over 45 probably will NEVER get their jobs back,\u201d she said.Her boss, Harry Hopkins, agreed: Given \u201cimprovements in management and technology,\u201d private businesses might never be able to absorb all able-bodied workers.Indeed, the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, which created the Works Progress Administration that funneled over $13 billion into public jobs (the equivalent of about $218 billion today) and employed 8.5 million people over eight years, was hardly meant to be just \u201cemergency relief\u201d for the job market, Mr. Kennedy wrote. Rather, it aimed to relieve a potentially permanent shortcoming.The job market is not in as bad a shape as it was at the depths of the downturn in the 1930s. The standard measure of unemployment stands at 6.7 percent rather than over 20 percent. Still, by any reading of the statistics, the economic emergency set off by the implosion of the housing bubble is far from over.The failure to rebound has revived the old, recurring fear: Is stagnation inevitable? Has the economy \u2014 has the job market \u2014 become stuck for good?For all the political back-and-forth over these questions, calls for more radical moves to revive the economy have largely vanished from the policy debate.This is not just the president\u2019s doing. The bipartisan cooperation that would be needed to start a jobs program of the scale of what was tried during the New Deal \u2014 not to mention the World War II production explosion that finally ended the Depression \u2014 is out of the question today.Perhaps more important, however, is that even among Democrats there remains little appetite for the kind of aggressive government action that was popular in F.D.R.\u2019s day.The fear, however, seems overdone.Many economists go pale at the thought of a mass program of public jobs to combat unemployment. They envision a bungling bureaucracy choosing investments, hiring workers and firing them. Even if the right investments could be identified, they fear the new jobs would demand skills the unemployed simply do not have.The aversion is anchored in history. In the late 1970s, President Jimmy Carter ran into trouble trying to increase jobs with the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act.Even as voters expressed skepticism of \u201cfake\u201d jobs, public employee unions demanded that the cheaper CETA workers not compete for tasks performed by government employees. Politically vulnerable to expos\u00e9s of petty corruption, the program was killed as soon as Ronald Reagan came to office.Though the program employed 750,000 workers at its peak in 1978, it was perceived largely as a failure.The experience of the 1970s hardly settles the debate, however. Recent precedent with other forms of public job promotion is not all bad. Thirty-nine states used $1.3 billion from the fiscal stimulus package passed in 2009 to create more than 260,000 jobs by subsidizing private employers.Our experience, moreover, has taught us specific rules of thumb for governments searching to increase employment.\u201cIt works best if you hire people that would not otherwise be hired, to do something productive that is not already being done by somebody else,\u201d said Lawrence Katz of Harvard, formerly chief labor economist in the Clinton administration. \u201cLong overdue infrastructure investments would be a good place to start, coupled with funding for positions cleaning parks and the like, which could help disadvantaged workers like the long-term unemployed.\u201dNot every unemployed worker may be qualified to build infrastructure. But many might. Today, there are 1.5 million fewer jobs in construction than there were before the financial crisis six years ago. Plenty of unemployed workers out there know how to build things.There is a fair chance that the private sector, left to its own devices, will never hire them.Importantly, he has noted that the forces restraining growth preceded the crisis. \u201cEven a great bubble wasn\u2019t enough to produce any excess in aggregate demand,\u201d Mr. Summers said in his November speech. Whatever is wrong with the United States economy has been wrong for a while.There are potentially great benefits to government investments in public works at a time like this. The legacy of the Works Progress Administration of the 1930s included half a million miles of highways, 100,000 bridges and as many public buildings. It includes the Dock Street Theater in Charleston, S.C., and the Timberline Lodge on the slopes of Mount Hood in Oregon.And it would not even be very expensive. With the borrowing costs of the federal government below the rate of inflation, investments would actually help reduce the nation\u2019s debt burden. Lenders are, in effect, paying the government to borrow money.Perhaps the best argument for government investment to increase jobs and raise demand is that the alternatives seem much worse.It would be better to rely on fiscal policy, but the path favored by many Republicans in the House seems even worse. To slash government spending and let the economy run its bedraggled course would probably transform our economic emergency from a painful though temporary setback into a permanent feature called stagnation.And yet this is essentially the policy the nation is following.Advertisement"}

Encourages Labor Changes in Russia", "Date": "2014-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia will have to remake its labor practices for the country\u2019s economy to pull out of its current doldrums.That, in essence, is the conclusion of a study released on Wednesday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the think tank supported by the governments of 34 member countries.For a decade under the rule of President Vladimir V. Putin, Russia\u2019s economy surged on the back of rising oil prices. But a different picture awaits in the years ahead, the O.E.C.D. report concluded.Russia, the report said, can no longer rely on any of the major drivers of economic growth that had pushed the country forward since the late 1990s. Gains from rising commodity prices, utilization of legacy Soviet infrastructure and improvements from the introduction of capitalist management techniques, among other drivers, have all run their course.The economy is already withering. Growth in 2013 slowed to 1.3 percent, the lowest in a decade other than during the global recession in 2009.At the same time, Russia is facing a long-simmering demographic crisis as its work force is expected to contract sharply in the coming decade. The issue is tied to the \u201ctiny generation,\u201d the Russians born during the post-Soviet depression of the 1990s who are now coming of age.\u201cThe Russian economy is at a crossroads,\u201d the O.E.C.D. secretary-general, Angel Gurr\u00eda, said in a statement about the study, the first issued by the group since the slowdown began here.\u201cIt has tremendous potential but is still heavily reliant on volatile revenues from natural resources,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would do well to invest more in infrastructure, human capital and innovation, so that larger segments of society can partake in Russia\u2019s transformation.\u201dWith the work force shrinking and oil revenue flat, Russia\u2019s main hope for growth lies in improving the average productivity of workers, the O.E.C.D. suggested in its report.The group offered several recommendations, including removing infrastructure bottlenecks and increasing competition. The average speed of a car during rush hour in Moscow, for example, is only 10 kilometers per hour, or six miles per hour, the report notes. That means cars are only marginally more efficient than walking as a means of transportation.The Russian government has also lavished long breaks and holidays on workers. The winter holiday that Russians are returning from now, for example, provides six days off in the first two weeks of the year \u2014 five days off to celebrate the new year and one for Orthodox Christmas. And once at work, Russians are relatively unproductive compared to other emerging market workers; wages in the country rose faster than labor productivity for a decade.The O.E.C.D. also highlighted the inefficiencies of employers, who don\u2019t necessarily cull their work force in line with economic changes. The Russian national railway company, Russian Railways, employs a million people and is the largest employer in the country. But analysts have long wondered what all these people do.Suspicion that they do very little was reinforced in December when the company, citing a government cap on freight tariffs, put a third of its work force, or about 300,000 people, on part-time schedules. Far from slowing down, it was as if the company gained a new head of steam: freight loadings that month went up by nearly 2 percent, to 103 million tons.The O.E.C.D.\u2019s concerns come at a time when Russia\u2019s prospects are faltering.The Russian ministry of economy\u2019s trend growth forecast is 2.5 percent, lower than the global average. Just two years ago, the O.E.C.D. had forecast Russia\u2019s long-term growth at slightly above the global average, at 4 percent.This shift means that living standards for Russians, which had been converging with developed nations, will now be moving in the opposite direction.\u201cWe are for the first time on the waning side, when the world will grow at a faster rate,\u201d the minister of economy, Aleksei Ulyukayev, said on Wednesday in remarks at an economic forum in Moscow.Advertisement"}

Building a new bridge or tunneling under Kill Van Kull would have been much more expensive and would have required years of regulatory reviews.That was back in 2009. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey first spent more than six months importuning various federal offices to serve as the lead agency for an environmental review. The law is vague about which agency is responsible. The Coast Guard finally agreed.Since then, the Port Authority\u2019s \u201cfast-track\u201d approach to a project that will not alter the bridge\u2019s footprint has generated more than 5,000 pages of federally mandated archaeological, traffic, fish habitat, soil, pollution and economic reports that have cost over $2 million. A historical survey of every building within two miles of each end of the bridge alone cost $600,000 \u2014 even though none would be affected by the project.After four years of work, the environmental assessment was issued in May and took into consideration comments from 307 organizations or individuals. The report invoked 207 acronyms, including M.B.T.A. (Migratory Bird Treaty Act) and N.L.R. (No Longer Regulated). Fifty-five federal, state and local agencies were consulted and 47 permits were required from 19 of them. Fifty Indian tribes from as far away as Oklahoma were invited to weigh in on whether the project impinged on native ground that touches the steel-arch bridge\u2019s foundation.Maybe it would have been easier to lower the water than to raise the bridge. (In fact, the channel had already been dredged by the Army Corps of Engineers in anticipation of the Panama Canal project.)The approval process for the Bayonne Bridge reconstruction has become a case study, critics say, in the bureaucratic roadblocks imposed by decades-old federal environmental regulations.\u201cEnvironmental review has evolved into an academic exercise like a game of who can find the most complications,\u201d said Philip K. Howard, a lawyer who cites the Bayonne Bridge in his forthcoming book, \u201cThe Rule of Nobody: Saving America from Dead Laws and Broken Government.\u201d \u201cThe Balkanization of authority among different agencies and levels of government creates a dynamic of buck-passing.\u201dThose complications are a particular concern among local officials in the Northeast, where a public works program is often intended both to help an ailing economy and to salvage aging bridges and highways, since most projects are likely to be replacements (brand-new ones would require even more rigorous environmental reviews). The sweeping final environmental impact statement that was required before the Port Authority could begin replacing the nearby Goethals Bridge took almost 10 years to complete.The only reason a federal review was required at all for the Bayonne project was that the bridge spans a navigable waterway \u2014 even though raising the deck to 215 feet from about 151 feet above the waterline of Kill Van Kull, the tidal strait that separates Staten Island from Bayonne, N.J., will facilitate navigation rather than impede it.\u201cWe\u2019re not proposing to build a nuclear plant on a pristine mountain lake,\u201d said Patrick J. Foye, the executive director of the Port Authority. \u201cWe\u2019re not building a bridge, we\u2019re not knocking a bridge down, we don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any increase in vehicular traffic. The environmental impact is more energy-efficient ships. They will emit less schmutz per container and per pair of Nikes.\u201dEven as construction began in June, environmental groups and civic groups challenged the review process in a federal lawsuit. They argued that bigger containers being unloaded in Port Newark and Port Elizabeth would result in more truck traffic through Newark and other poor neighborhoods already polluted with diesel fumes and saddled with congested streets.\u201cIt assumes a more efficient port will cause people to buy more sneakers and iPads,\u201d Mr. Foye said dismissively. The case is still pending.\u201cThe environmental process for public infrastructure is too long, costly and uncertain,\u201d he said. \u201cPublic infrastructure ought to be treated differently, especially replacement of public infrastructure. And there ought to be someone in the process on the federal side who is looking at the impact of economic development and job retention.\u201dAs it is, the project manager, Joann Papageorgis, said the existing deck would be removed in two years after the locks of the Panama Canal have been widened to 180 feet from 110 feet and lengthened to 1,400 feet from 1,050 feet. That means ships carrying as many as 12,000 containers will pass under the Bayonne Bridge \u2014 the maximum today is 9,000 containers. A new roadway for the bridge is to be completed by mid-2017; the current bridge will be partly closed.The cost is estimated at $1.3 billion. The cost of a new bridge or a tunnel would have been about $4 billion. The new bridge will have wider lanes, bicycle and pedestrian pathways and the capacity to add public transit.The entire project, from conception to completion, is expected to take less than a decade \u2014 with the environmental review accounting for nearly half that time. As cumbersome as it was, the process was expedited by a presidential directive to speed construction of the Bayonne Bridge and six other public works projects across the country.And despite the protracted environmental review period, Ms. Papageorgis said the project was being done at warp speed when compared with other public works projects. (Consider, for example, the Second Avenue subway line in Manhattan.)\u201cIn my 40 years, this is the fastest I\u2019ve ever seen an environmental assessment get done,\u201d Ms. Papageorgis said. \u201cWe\u2019re being criticized for rushing it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mrs. Gandhi said the decision had little significance because the party has not traditionally named prime ministerial candidates before elections.Mr. Modi seems eager to campaign against Mr. Gandhi, casting himself, the son of a tea stall owner, as a self-made man and Mr. Gandhi as a privileged \u201cshehzada,\u201d or prince.

There is no fire in the belly left to fight adversity.\u201dAt the televised gathering on Friday, Mrs. Gandhi cast the national elections, scheduled for May, as a \u201cbattle for the preservation of our age-old secular traditions,\u201d warning that a victory by Bharatiya Janata, a Hindu nationalist party, could introduce a dangerous religious divide.Mr. Gandhi took the podium a few hours later and delivered a long, passionate speech.

The energy and excitement which I am seeing in this call is proof that when we decide, we can do anything.\u201dNot naming Mr. Gandhi the prime ministerial candidate means sacrificing some of his star power in a country where many revere his father, grandmother and great-grandfather, who all served as prime minister.Mr. Gandhi has at times projected reluctance about his public role, refusing offers of a cabinet-level post and rarely speaking at parliamentary sessions or expressing a stance in national debates. In an interview published in a Hindi newspaper on Tuesday, he sidestepped a series of questions about whether he intended \u2014 or even wanted \u2014 to become prime minister.\u201cI will follow whatever orders the party asks me to follow,\u201d he said. \u201cI am only concerned about why the entire argument comes to a standstill over the issue of a \u2018post.\u2019 Why is it being debated on a national level? Why don\u2019t people debate about steps to clean politics?\u201dSiddharth Varadarajan, a prominent journalist, called the decision not to nominate Mr. Gandhi \u201can insurance policy, an exit strategy, a safety valve,\u201d allowing him to escape damage if Congress performs badly.Congress leaders are braced to become the minority party in May, he said, but may see an opportunity to bounce back in several years if the newly formed government proves fragile and collapses. And in that event, he said, the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty will continue \u2014 if not through Rahul, then through his sister, Priyanka, who is widely viewed as a talented politician.But he added that in his view, the family would be wise to gradually untether itself from the party.\u201cThe way to do it would be to say, \u2018We recuse ourselves, and we will keep a distant watch,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cIf they had the best future of the Congress party in their mind, they would realize that the dynasty has to end, and it has to end in an orderly fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Nasdaq was up nearly 2 percent. European stocks, which were off earlier in the day, also ended in positive territory.The strength in stocks followed robust economic data out of the United States. On Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at an annualized rate of 3.2 percent in the final quarter of 2013.The latest batch of data underscores recent optimism that the domestic economy is poised for faster growth after fall\u2019s government shutdown and the debt standoff. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said it would continue to pare back its stimulus effort, citing \u201cgrowing underlying strength in the broader economy.\u201dThe gains on Thursday represented a reversal from the recent tumult. Global markets have been volatile of late, as investors reconsider risky assets like stocks and developing-market currencies.On Thursday, the Japanese stock market closed 2.5 percent lower, with investors fretting about the potential toll that a stronger yen might be taking on the earnings of the country\u2019s export sector. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong closed down 0.5 percent, and the main Australian ended 0.8 percent lower. In mainland China, which closes for a weeklong holiday starting Friday, the Shanghai composite index slipped 0.6 percent.The Fed\u2019s decision Wednesday to cut its bond purchases by $10 billion is helping fuel concerns. Investors, in part, are worried that emerging economies like Turkey and South Africa may not be able to maintain their growth without the extra capital flowing into the markets.On Thursday, emerging market currencies were mixed. The South African rand and Brazilian real strengthened. The Indian rupee and Turkish lira were modestly weaker.In a sign that the distress in emerging markets is creeping closer to the developed world, the Hungarian forint, which is closely tied to the euro, has also come under pressure in the last few days. Investors were also nervously watching the Czech currency, the koruna, and the Polish zloty.The forint has fallen amid \u201csome confusion in the market\u201d from Federal Reserves moves in Washington, said Peter Rona, an economist who sits on the supervisory board of the Hungarian central bank, though not its monetary policy committee.The central banks of South Africa, India and Turkey have all raised their benchmark interest rates this week to help bolster their currency. Others like Brazil, Indonesia and Chile may follow.But such measures have done little to shore up confidence. While emerging markets were relatively calm on Thursday, they remained wobbly.\u201cThe underlying fears are still there, and the situation is quite fragile,\u201d said Lars Christensen, the head of emerging market research at Danske Bank in Copenhagen.The fact that currencies have continued to weaken even in countries that have started to raise interest rates \u201copens up a new, and potentially more worrying, phase\u201d in which beleaguered policy makers find themselves unable to defend their currencies, analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a note on Thursday. They stressed, however, that it was important \u201cto recognize key differences between individual emerging economies.\u201dMr. Christensen said there was cause for optimism in that \u201cmostly what we are seeing so far is currency volatility, rather than economic distress.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Golf Trade Show Bounces Back With the Economy", "Date": "2014-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 When six salesmen arrived for the 1954 P.G.A. Senior Championship in Dunedin, Fla., they lined up their products around a practice green for the pros to see. They had no idea that what they were doing would someday become the world\u2019s largest annual golf trade show.In those days, playing pros were also club pros, so all Charlie Lentz, a 40-year salesman for Wilson Sporting Goods, wanted was to get the pros to look at his golf equipment. Word got out, and the next year, more salesmen arrived to show their wares in the P.G.A. National Golf Club parking lot.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough room around the putting green, so everybody opened up their car trunks, and the pros wandered around the parking lot and looked at everything,\u201d Lentz said.From its early days, the annual P.G.A. Merchandise Show has been seen by many as more than a trade show or a golf convention: It is a barometer of the health of the sport.\u201cI view the P.G.A. show as the official beginning of whatever the next golf season will be,\u201d said Ted Bishop, president of the P.G.A. of America. After about a half-decade of slower sales and reduced rounds of play, Bishop said he had felt renewed energy in the golf business this year. Attending his 30th show this year, he has been around long enough to witness the event\u2019s peaks and valleys, paralleling the slumps and surges in the game.In 1957, P.G.A. officials rented a tent for the show. Then from 1964 to 1973, the annual show of golf equipment was held at P.G.A. National in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., now known as BallenIsles Country Club. The event landed at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando in 1985. Throughout the 1990s, the P.G.A. Merchandise Show was a week of excess. Show attendees would arrive three days early to play in golf outings, sponsored by equipment companies, at top Orlando resorts. The larger companies would also lease Universal Studios, SeaWorld and other Orlando hot spots for parties each evening. Some booked musical acts and celebrities to appear in their booths.For the showroom floor, equipment companies spent vast amounts of money on double-decker exhibition booths. Sound systems blasted music.\u201cIt was about who could scream the loudest, literally and figuratively,\u201d said Barb Kauffman, a former senior product manager for Spalding Sports. \u201cThe strategy back then was bigger was better, and you wanted to be seen and heard.\u201dLarge companies sent 100 or more staff members to the show for a week. Kauffman, now president of Kauffman & Associates Inc., said the P.G.A. show was a \u201csix- or seven-figure investment\u201d for the largest exhibitors.At its peak, 1,539 exhibiting companies came to the winter 2001 show, which spanned 712,625 square feet across the convention center and spilled across the street into the Peabody Hotel.But after 2001, the golf industry began to mirror a challenged national economy, and companies scaled back.Ping Inc. pulled out of the 2003 show and was soon followed by other large club makers, including Titleist. TaylorMade Golf skipped shows from 2008 to 2010. By 2010, only 784 exhibitors brought their wares to the annual event, needing only 395,000 square feet of floor space.\u201cIt was very alarming when those top companies left the show,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cWhen all the vendors aren\u2019t here, it makes the buyers very cautious. A dark cloud hung over the entire industry for about five years.\u201dAs the economy climbed, club makers re-evaluated their messages, tactics and spending. They asked the show organizer, Reed Expositions, and the P.G.A. of America to make big changes.An outdoor Demo Day was added before the show, at which industry professionals could test golf equipment from all of the top manufacturers. Also added were booths related to fitness, health and new products.A 29,000-square-foot multimedia P.G.A. Forum stage was constructed for educational presentations, and an indoor range with 47 hitting bays was stretched across one end of the convention center.\u201cThe show had to evolve because the industry now uses this week to move the game forward,\u201d said Ed Several, the P.G.A. show\u2019s senior vice president and general manager. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about sales.\u201dThis week\u2019s event attracted more than 40,000 golf professionals, retailers and golf industry leaders, who traversed about 10 miles of aisles showcasing nearly one million square feet of exhibit, demonstration and symposium space.Among the more than 1,000 companies, more than 200 were new to the show this year.There were fashion shows, putting greens, coffee and drink bars and, in the Callaway Golf booth, a military tank parked on the showroom floor. Ping, which returned to the show in 2008, showcased its products in a 7,500-square-foot space.At the other end of the convention center was TaylorMade\u2019s 30,000-square foot booth, which was staffed by more than 250 sales and marketing employees.TaylorMade returned to the event this year, with spending that was \u201cdefinitely seven figures,\u201d said Bob Maggiore, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer.\u201cWe\u2019re fans of the razzle-dazzle, and we like a party,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Abolish the Corporate Income Tax", "Date": "2014-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBOSTON \u2014 JOBS don\u2019t grow out of thin air, especially well-paying ones. They require, among other things, companies that are willing to operate where you live. Just ask the Seattle-based District 751 of the machinists\u2019 union, which was worried that Boeing will build its new 777X airliner someplace far away where it is cheaper to produce. Last month the union offered contract concessions, as its president explained, to ensure \u201cthe long-term success\u201d of Boeing in Washington State. And on Friday, Boeing machinists approved a contract with concessions to keep assembly of the plane in the area.In recent decades, American workers have suffered one body blow after another: the decline in manufacturing, foreign competition, outsourcing, the Great Recession and smart machines that replace people everywhere you look. Amazon and Google are in a horse race to see how many humans they can put out of work with self-guided delivery drones and driverless cars. You wonder who will be left with incomes to buy what these robots deliver. What can workers do to mitigate their plight? One useful step would be to lobby to eliminate the corporate income tax. I, like many economists, suspect that our corporate income tax is economically self-defeating \u2014 hurting workers, not capitalists, and collecting precious little revenue to boot.The United States may well have the highest effective marginal corporate income tax rate of any developed country. Jack Mintz, a public finance economist and director of the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary, puts the rate close to 35 percent, which is also the statutory rate. Other economists, using different techniques, calculate the marginal rate to be as low as 23 percent. But both figures are miles above zero.They are also miles above our 13 percent average corporate income tax rate \u2014 the ratio of corporate taxes to total corporate profits. The fact that the marginal tax rate, whether 23 percent, 35 percent or somewhere in between, is so much larger than the average rate suggests that a sizable share of corporate profits and production is ending up overseas and untaxed. In the model, eliminating the United States\u2019 corporate income tax produces rapid and dramatic increases in American investment, output and real wages, making the tax cut self-financing to a significant extent. Somewhat smaller gains arise from revenue-neutral corporate tax base broadening, specifically cutting the corporate tax rate to 9 percent and eliminating all corporate tax loopholes. Both policies generate welfare gains for all generations in the United States, but particularly for young and future workers. Moreover, all Americans can benefit, though by less, if foreign countries also cut their corporate tax rates.The size of the potential economic and welfare gains are stunningly large and don\u2019t reflect any extreme supply-side (a k a, voodoo economics) assumptions. Fully eliminating the corporate income tax and replacing any loss in revenues with somewhat higher personal income tax rates leads to a huge short-run inflow of capital, raising the United States\u2019 capital stock (machines and buildings) by 23 percent, output by 8 percent and the real wages of unskilled and skilled workers by 12 percent. Lowering the corporate rate tax to 9 percent while also closing loopholes is roughly revenue neutral and also produces very rapid increases in capital (by 17 percent), output (by 6 percent) and real wages (by 8 percent).It\u2019s been a long time since the typical American worker received a raise in her real pay. In fact, average weekly earnings, exclusive of fringe benefits but adjusted for inflation, are 10 percent lower today than they were in 1966. This is America\u2019s nightmare, not its dream. Turning things around requires getting a lot of things right, starting, I\u2019d argue, with corporate tax reform.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Jobs, No Benefits, and Lousy Pay", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe report showed that average monthly job growth in 2013 was 182,000, basically unchanged from 2012. Even the decline in the jobless rate last month, from 7 percent in November to 6.7 percent, was a sign of weakness: It mainly reflects a shrinking labor force \u2014 not new hiring \u2014 as the share of workers employed or looking for work fell to the lowest level since 1978. That\u2019s a tragic waste of human capital. It would be comforting to ascribe the dwindling labor force mainly to retirements or other long-term changes, but most of the decline is due to weak job opportunities and weak labor demand since the Great Recession. One result is that the share of jobless workers who have been unemployed for six months or longer has remained stubbornly high. In December, it was nearly 38 percent, still higher by far than at any time before the Great Recession, in records going back to 1948. And yet, nearly 1.3 million of those long-term unemployed had their federal jobless benefits abruptly cut off at the end of last year, after Republicans refused to renew the federal unemployment program in the latest budget deal. Each week the program is not reinstated, another 72,000 jobless people who otherwise would have qualified for benefits will find there is no longer a federal program to turn to. Worse, in the Senate this week, after a show of willingness to discuss renewing the benefits, Republicans objected to a bill to do just that. They had demanded that a renewal be paid for, but they didn\u2019t like how Democrats proposed to do that \u2014 with spending cuts at the end of the budget window in 2024 in exchange for relief today. There was no need to pay for the benefits, which have such a crucial and positive effect \u2014 on families, the economy and poverty \u2014 that it would be sound to renew them even if the government borrowed to do so. But Republicans would rather criticize President Obama\u2019s handling of the economy than help those left behind. A similar dynamic is developing around the drive for a higher minimum wage. In the December jobs report, the average hourly wage for most workers was $20.35. That means that the minimum wage, at $7.25 an hour, is only one-third of the average, rather than one-half, as was the case historically. Raising the wage to $10.10 an hour, as Democrats have proposed, would help to restore the historical relationship. But even that would fall far short of the roughly $17 an hour that workers at the bottom of the wage scale would be earning if increased labor productivity were reflected in their pay, rather than in corporate profits, executive compensation and shareholder returns. Republicans, however, are opposed to any increase, as if the numbers don\u2019t speak for themselves. Their stance also dismisses research, and common sense, which says that raising the wages of low- and moderate-income workers is essential for lessening both poverty and inequality. The December jobs report is telling Congress what it needs to do. Unfortunately, that will not lead to action anytime soon. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Diageo Reports Slower Growth", "Date": "2014-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Selling beer and liquor in emerging markets has for a long time been investors\u2019 main attraction to Diageo. On Thursday, some investors sold their shares because of it.Diageo, the British maker of Smirnoff vodka and Johnnie Walker Scotch, joined other consumer brands in saying that slower growth in developing economies last year hurt its business. Diageo\u2019s sales in the six months through the end of December rose 1.8 percent, about half of what a group of analysts polled by Bloomberg News expected.Shares in Diageo dropped nearly 5 percent on Thursday.Diageo, the world\u2019s biggest distiller, said it was facing more difficult market conditions in China and Nigeria, countries that are central to the company\u2019s emerging-markets strategy. In Nigeria, consumers are drinking less beer and turning to cheaper brands, while a government crackdown in China on extravagant spending prompted a 66 percent drop in sales of its baijiu liquor.Faster sales growth in the United States, helped by new premium products like Ciroc Amaretto and Johnnie Walker Platinum, only partly offset the slowdown in emerging markets, Diageo said.As the pace of economic growth slows in emerging markets and consumers grow more selective, companies like Diageo that have been seeking growth there to compensate for tighter markets in Europe and the United States are suffering.Unilever, one of the world\u2019s largest consumer products companies, whose products include Dove soap and Knorr soups, warned this month that global markets would continue to be volatile this year. L\u2019Or\u00e9al of France recently decided to phase out certain products in China and its rival, Revlon, plans to exit the market completely after failing to win sufficient market share.\u201cThis half has seen a weaker set of results at the top line than we would have expected at the start of the year,\u201d Ivan M. Menezes, the Diageo chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cThe weakness we have seen in some markets in Asia and Latin America and in Nigeria has resulted in a decline in volume.\u201dWhen he took over as chief last summer, Mr. Menezes said he would continue his predecessor\u2019s strategy of expanding in Asia, Africa and Latin America. But Mr. Menezes also predicted that the recent pace of emerging market acquisitions would slow and Diageo would instead focus on more expensive products, like Johnnie Walker Black Label, by investing in marketing and the sales network.Diageo said Thursday that half-year sales rose to 5.76 billion pounds, or $9.5 billion, from \u00a35.66 billion, while operating profit rose 2.9 percent to \u00a32.06 billion, from \u00a32 billion a year earlier, less than some analysts expected. Beer sales declined and a \u201csignificant\u201d tax increase in Thailand hurt spirit sales there, Diageo said.In China, a recent survey found that people planned to cut down on lavish spending on gifts as the government moves to crack down on corruption and the luxurious lifestyles of some officials following a series of corruption scandals.\u201cDifficulties in the emerging markets have impacted\u201d Diageo\u2019s business, Keith Bowman, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers in London, said. \u201cA crackdown on gifting to officials in China, troubles in Thailand and a consumer switch to alternative value beers in Nigeria have all taken their toll.\u201dThe new approach to gift giving in China also hurt sales at R\u00e9my Cointreau. Sales at the French spirits company fell 18.9 percent during the last three months of 2013 compared to the same period a year earlier.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "American Starts a Luxury Resort to Share the Argentina He Loves", "Date": "2014-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMichael Evans and his partners are investing $16 million on the Vines Resort in Vista Flores, part of a 1,600-acre property intended to showcase Argentina\u2019s countryside.VISTA FLORES, Argentina \u2014 It is hard to find fault with lunch at Siete Fuegos, the restaurant at the new Vines Resort & Spa in the Mendoza province. The steak is grilled to medium-rare perfection. The sparkling torront\u00e9s wine nicely complements the homemade dulce de leche ice cream. The open-air dining room looks upon acres of vineyards set against the snow-capped Andes.But Michael Evans, the American entrepreneur behind the Vines, wants to nitpick. As lunch comes to a close, a waiter delivers a cortado \u2014 an espresso with warm milk \u2014 and a plate of cookies to a guest. Mr. Evans quietly suggests to his team in Spanish that if one person at the table gets cookies, everyone should get cookies.To Mr. Evans, the details matter.Mr. Evans and his partners are plowing $16 million into the Vines Resort, on a 1,600-acre property aimed at giving guests an \u201cexperience\u201d in the Argentine countryside, albeit a highly pampered one. Rooms go for $510 to nearly $2,000 a night, and Mr. Evans wants to make sure that the resort has all the amenities, activities and accouterments \u2014 even the cookies \u2014 to justify those prices.\u201cOur focus on everything is: What is this going to do for the customer?\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cI am much more a customer than a winemaker or a hotelier.\u201dThe team at the Vines is among a growing number of investors who are building or expanding high-end properties here, in the belief that Mendoza has the potential to be the next Napa Valley, Calif., or Bordeaux, France.As demand outstripped supply at the nine-year-old Cavas Wine Lodge, the owners recently added three villas, bringing the total rooms to 18. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Ortega Gil-Fournier, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker who founded the O. Fournier boutique winery, is hoping to break ground on a 40-room hotel early this year. Youngwoo & Associates, the New York developer behind the redesign of Pier 57 in Manhattan, is working on a private vineyard project just south of Mendoza city, with plans to eventually open a luxury hotel.\u201cFor the longest time, we have been interested in South America. It was really gaining a lifestyle that we hadn\u2019t really seen before on this continent,\u201d said Bryan Woo, the director of acquisitions for Youngwoo, who is leading the Mendoza project. \u201cPeople are going to discover Mendoza. We\u2019re banking on that.\u201dMendoza is decades behind more established wine regions in the United States and Europe, so developers still have room to grow. Land prices are relatively low. And beyond the city center, there are few high-end hotels. Competition here is friendly, even supportive.When Mr. Evans decided to open the Vines Resort, he sought the counsel of the established players like the founders of Cavas. \u201cPeople talk about competition, but it is such a small pool at the high end,\u201d he said. Other hoteliers, he said, are willing to provide guidance. The more players, the thinking goes, the better it will be for Mendoza broadly.But Argentina presents its own challenges. Inflation runs high. Official government figures put it at more than 10 percent, although economists estimate that it is more like 25 percent. In the United States, inflation is less than 2 percent.In such an environment, labor costs and other expenses can jump substantially each year. But hotels cannot necessarily increase their rates in tandem. Cecilia Diaz Chuit, who founded Cavas with her husband, Mart\u00edn Rigal, decided to expand last year to bolster revenue and help offset increased costs.\u201cWe cannot raise our rates anymore. We have reached a limit,\u201d Ms. Diaz Chuit said. Rooms at Cavas cost roughly $700 a night in the high season. \u201cSo we have created different products at Cavas. That was our way to fight inflation.\u201dIn Argentina\u2019s hit-or-miss economy, investors have to be willing to ride out the ups and downs. Mr. Ortega Gil-Fournier, who set up his winery in 2000, planned to build a hotel in 2007. But then the global financial crisis hit, Argentina\u2019s economy swooned, and he mothballed the plan. While Argentina remains on shaky ground, Mr. Ortega Gil-Fournier said he was now willing to take the risk, citing the potential of the country.\u201cIt\u2019s really challenging. You have to pay a lot more attention to the macroeconomic factors,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cYou certainly wouldn\u2019t invest unless you think long term.\u201dMr. Evans, 48, first saw the promise of Mendoza a decade ago. After working on John Kerry\u2019s failed presidential campaign, Mr. Evans, a political consultant, took a vacation in Argentina to rest, relax and enjoy wine. He never left.Enamored of Argentina, Mr. Evans and a friend decided to start a business selling vineyards. The company would do all the work \u2014 planting, harvesting, blending and bottling \u2014 for investors who want to create their bespoke wine. He initially bought 100 acres in the Uco Valley for about $500,000. The area, about two hours south of Mendoza city, was largely undeveloped. And the terroir \u2014 the land, the soil and the altitude \u2014 offered the potential for high-quality wines.That business, the Vines of Mendoza, now has 135 vineyard owners and creates 225 wines, including its own brand, Recuerdo. An acre goes for $85,000. And the company has a tasting room and a wine bar in the city, where tourists can sample a variety of wines from the area. As the business evolved, a resort, Mr. Evans said, seemed like a natural extension of the business.Like many developers in Argentina, Mr. Evans has largely relied on outside investors to help finance expansion. Mortgages are not common. And while investors can tap into government loans, the bureaucratic process can be tricky and time-consuming. In 2013, Mr. Evans raised nearly $8 million from angel investors, mainly friends, relatives and vineyard owners.At Vines, Mr. Evans says he is trying to create a sense of place. In doing so, he is drawing on the landscape and history of Mendoza. A dusty running path winds through acres of malbec, cabernet sauvignon and other grape vines. The walls are built with stones dug from around the property. The top Argentine chef Francis Mallmann draws upon open-air cooking techniques for Siete Fuegos, which means seven fires in Spanish. Guests get their own personal \u201cgaucho\u201d \u2014 a play off the traditional Argentine cowboy \u2014 to set up winery excursions, horse rides, or even helicopter trips for backcountry skiing.Wine serves as a centerpiece. Guests can spend a day with an agronomist planting malbec vines in the spring or helping with the harvest in the fall. At the on-site tasting room, they can learn to blend grapes or sample a 2013 torront\u00e9s directly from a stainless steel cask. Construction has started on a winemakers village. The village will bring together top winemakers like Santiago Ach\u00e1val, the founder of Ach\u00e1val-Ferrer Winery, which specializes in malbec.As workers put the finishing touches on the resort late last year, Mr. Evans, with Maria Uco, his dog, at his side, talked animatedly about the next steps. He pointed to nearby vineyards, and laid out plans for a yoga platform. Off in the distance, he says, he wants to upgrade an old ramada, an outdoor pavilion that can be used for asados, Argentine barbecues. The soon-to-be-built gym will be elevated, giving treadmill-runners the sense that they are floating above the vineyards.\u201cIt\u2019s about coming to Mendoza,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cI came here on vacation, fell in love with the place, and stayed. So how do I give people that?\u201dAn earlier version of the article misspelled the surname of a winemaker. He is Santiago Ach\u00e1val, not Arch\u00e1val.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Makers Pack New Cars With Technology, but Younger Buyers Shrug", "Date": "2014-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 Young, educated and upwardly mobile, Kristin Winn represents the ideal target for automakers trying to reach young buyers. Ms. Winn, a 24-year-old technician for an ophthalmologist, says she plans to replace her nine-year-old Chevrolet Cobalt this year.She says that she would like to buy a new car that has the latest technologies, like hands-free calling, but that it\u2019s not likely to happen considering the cost.\u201cI\u2019ll probably buy used,\u201d said Ms. Winn, who is from Ann Arbor, Mich., as she admired the Mercedes and Cadillac exhibits at the North American International Auto Show last week. \u201cI plan to go back to school, so I have to keep that in mind.\u201dAutomakers have been in a race in recent years to woo the most coveted, if elusive, sector of the car market: younger buyers. They have restyled cars, creating sportier versions that are more environmentally friendly, and loaded them with the latest dashboard technology. But despite these efforts, young buyers like Ms. Winn still say that price and fuel economy are the most important factors in deciding what to purchase.Since 2009, the percentage of new cars registered to buyers age 18 to 34 has remained flat, hovering between 10 percent and 13 percent, according to an IHS Automotive analysis of Polk data. And in a recent survey of buyers born between 1977 and 1994 conducted by the global consulting firm Deloitte, four out of five respondents said cost was the main barrier to owning or leasing a vehicle, even though they were attracted by the new features.When the transmission on Adrian Jauregui\u2019s 1994 Toyota Corolla died at an intersection in El Paso this month, he quickly found himself among the legions of younger buyers in the market for a car. But, like most younger buyers, he is limited by how much he can afford.\u201cI\u2019m not so sure I\u2019d get approved for financing\u201d before starting a new job at a nursing home for veterans this month, said Mr. Jauregui, who is 20 and a nursing school graduate. He settled on a 2005 Honda Civic.Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book, said it was no surprise why cost remained paramount for younger buyers.\u201cThe economy still isn\u2019t supporting employment as well as it should, and this is particularly true for young people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that, as the economy improves, parents could play a larger role in helping get young buyers into cars.\u201dStill, the allure of younger buyers remains for automakers, who see an opportunity to replace the aging baby boom generation with a new group of loyal customers. The Deloitte survey found that three out of five young consumers expected to buy or lease a car, new or used, within the next three years, and nearly a quarter of them said they planned to make the purchase in the next 12 months.But figuring out what they want is a challenge, said James E. Lentz, chief executive of Toyota North America.\u201cI think they want everything,\u201d he said, adding that young buyers \u201care so used to trying new and different things, it\u2019s really difficult to forecast what they want.\u201dThe long lead times for product development in the automotive industry further complicate the task of deciding what younger buyers are looking for in a car.\u201cI\u2019ve got to guess today what you\u2019ll want in a car 10 years from now,\u201d Mr. Lentz said. \u201cToday I\u2019ve got to decide what is going in a car in 2018, and that model will likely be sold until 2024.\u201dWhat they want, according to the Deloitte survey, is technology that serves a variety of purposes \u2014 to recognize the presence of other vehicles, alert drivers when they have surpassed the speed limit, entertain passengers and connect their smartphones to their vehicle\u2019s dashboard interface.But buyers say that a vehicle\u2019s cost takes precedence over bells and whistles.Dashboard technology \u201cis not something I\u2019d look for specifically,\u201d David Campanella, a 24-year-old architect from Washington, said after stepping out of Cadillac\u2019s new ATS coupe on display at the Detroit auto show on Saturday.\u201cI have so many gadgets,\u201d he said. \u201cDo I need another one in my car? No. Would it be nice to have? Yes.\u201dYounger buyers like Mr. Campanella are showing a more pragmatic streak. Last year, he bought a 2010 Volkswagen Tiguan sport utility vehicle because he liked its 2.0-liter turbo engine and its storage space.Fuel economy is critical, Josh Pettrey said, as he browsed Ford\u2019s display of Fiesta subcompacts at the show. Mr. Pettrey, a 26-year-old HVAC technician from Bedford, Mich., said that his 2005 Ford 500 sedan gets 23 to 28 miles to the gallon but that he would prefer something closer to 30.\u201cGas prices are up and down,\u201d Mr. Pettrey said, \u201cand I don\u2019t have a ton of money that I can throw out on gas.\u201dFor luxury brands, the task for automakers is to convince younger buyers with more disposable income that there is value in an upscale trim line at an entry-level price. From the new BMW 4-series and the Mercedes CLA sedan to Audi\u2019s coming A3 sedan and Q3 compact crossover, some automakers are banking on smaller luxury models that will convert young buyers into lifetime customers.\u201cI think we\u2019ve got to do it all,\u201d said David Caldwell, a spokesman for Cadillac, which introduced its ATS coupe at the auto show. \u201cI think it\u2019s wrong to assume that the younger buyer, by definition, is a whole lot different in what they want in a car.\u201dOne out of every five buyers of Cadillac\u2019s ATS sedan, which had its debut in 2012, is under 35, and the automaker expects that rate to rise for the sportier coupe version.\u201cThere\u2019s younger buyers who are into connectivity,\u201d Mr. Caldwell said. \u201cThere\u2019s younger buyers who are into performance. I think it goes to the point that they don\u2019t want a compromise.\u201dBut no matter the budget, technology that has become basic in newer cars remains desirable for younger buyers.Ms. Winn, the ophthalmic technician, said she looked forward one day to upgrading to hands-free technology that is missing in her Cobalt.\u201cThere are some counties in Michigan where you can\u2019t even talk on the phone\u201d while driving if you\u2019re holding a handset, she said, \u201cand that\u2019s the only time I talk to my mom, when I\u2019m driving home from work.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s Message at Davos Has Eerie Echo", "Date": "2014-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byListening PostWASHINGTON \u2014 When President Hassan Rouhani of Iran commandeered the spotlight this week in Davos, Switzerland, with a message of peaceful intentions and a desire for dialogue, it was an eerie echo of 10 years ago, when Iran\u2019s last would-be change agent, Mohammad Khatami, delivered the very same message at the World Economic Forum.Comparing their appearances demonstrates how much Iran has changed in the last decade, but also how fragile the current diplomatic opening is, and how little time Mr. Rouhani may have to negotiate a nuclear deal, while holding Iran\u2019s hard-liners at bay.Iran, Mr. Rouhani said Thursday, was determined to pursue \u201cconstructive engagement\u201d with the world and had no intention of acquiring a nuclear weapon. In 2004, Mr. Khatami said, \u201cAnywhere that we sense and feel that the other side respects us and does not force anything upon us, we are prepared to talk.\u201d He, too, ruled out a bomb.Then, as now, Iran agreed to halt some enrichment of uranium and submit to United Nations inspections, as part of an effort to negotiate a nuclear deal. Then, as now, the Iranian leaders used Davos, the annual gathering of world leaders and captains of industry, as an opportunity to lure foreign investors back to their country.But less than a month after Mr. Khatami\u2019s star turn in the Swiss Alps, Iran held parliamentary elections marred by the government\u2019s disqualification of thousands of reformist candidates. For Mr. Khatami, whose landslide election in 1997 had stirred hopes for change, it was the final blow to his own reformist credentials. By the following summer, the nuclear diplomacy had collapsed and Iran switched its centrifuges back on.Mr. Rouhani faces a similarly treacherous path. To close a nuclear deal, he will have to make concessions that would engender fierce resistance from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and other conservative factions. His growing international celebrity \u2014 and that of his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who was also at Davos \u2014 could bring him into conflict with Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\u201cRouhani knows Khatami\u2019s history,\u201d said Abbas Milani, an Iranian scholar at Stanford University. \u201cHe knows Khamenei\u2019s delicate position. He reads the attacks on him and Zarif in Iran. So he is trying to walk this rather sensitive line to see if he can open doors.\u201dFor a variety of reasons, Iran experts said, Mr. Rouhani has more room for maneuver than his predecessor. The pain of international sanctions on Iran\u2019s economy is a much bigger motivation to signing a nuclear deal than Iran\u2019s fear in 2004 that the United States, which had invaded Iraq the year before, would march on Tehran next.Mr. Rouhani, never a reformist, was elected with a broad consensus of Iran\u2019s clerical and military establishment to try to negotiate a deal that would ease those sanctions. Mr. Khatami, who had long spoken out in favor of democracy and civil society, was an unorthodox victor whose election presaged deep rifts within the ranks of the mullahs.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.\u201cIn contrast to Khatami, there is a widespread perception that Rouhani is working with, rather than against, the supreme leader to carry out d\u00e9tente abroad and reconciliation at home,\u201d said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Still, he added, \u201cRouhani has been winning global accolades by using a similar \u2014 although less articulate and arguably less genuine \u2014 script than Khatami began using in 1997.\u201d The surface similarities were on display in Davos. Both leaders projected a genial, reasonable image as they greeted participants. Both steered clear of the angry, anti-Israel vitriol of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who served as president between them. Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s inflammatory talk all but ensured that he would never be a Davos Man.Mr. Khatami larded his speech with references to German philosophers like Hegel and Weber, and said, \u201cDemocratic norms are not identical packaged-goods, ready for export.\u201d Afterward, he gamely held a chaotic news conference, in which he brushed aside suggestions that he should meet with Vice President Dick Cheney, who was also in Davos that year.At the time, Iran was not even the world\u2019s No. 1 nuclear rogue state. Two days after Mr. Khatami spoke, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan\u2019s military ruler at the time, admitted that his country\u2019s top atomic scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan, had sold nuclear designs to other countries. This year, Mr. Rouhani was guaranteed a sold-out crowd. He had held a history-making phone call with President Obama; his country has signed an interim nuclear deal with the West, which has halted parts of its nuclear program for the first time in a decade; and Iran is viewed as something of a kingmaker in Syria, where its support for President Bashar al-Assad is one of the main reasons he has clung to power.Speaking to an audience that included Israelis, Mr. Rouhani insisted that Iran would pursue a foreign policy of \u201cprudent moderation.\u201d While he did not seek common ground with the United States on Syria, he said \u201call of us should work to push terrorists out.\u201dYet Mr. Rouhani also showed a more cautious, politically calculating side than Mr. Khatami. He canceled a planned news conference; his aides cited technical problems with the room. And in an interview with Fareed Zakaria of CNN, he insisted that Iran would not agree to dismantle a single centrifuge \u2014 a position that, if nonnegotiable, would be a deal breaker.Mr. Rouhani, unlike Mr. Khatami, has shown little appetite for opening up Iranian society or challenging the authority of its clerical institutions. If he runs afoul of Ayatollah Khamenei, some experts say, it will be less because of what he said at Davos than because of his enthusiastic embrace of other first-world pursuits, like Twitter and Facebook, though he said in Davos that his frequent posts are ghostwritten.\u201cDavos is fully approved by the theocracy,\u201d said Suzanne Maloney, a senior fellow and an Iran expert at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019s the other elements of the strategy, like social media, that are problematic at home.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Labor Data Suggests Dip In December Was Outlier ", "Date": "2014-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, their second consecutive decline, suggesting that the slowdown in job growth in December may be temporary.The better labor market tone was also captured by a survey on Thursday showing an acceleration in manufacturing activity in the Mid-Atlantic region, accompanied by a rise in factory jobs.\u201cWe view the tepid December payroll gain as an aberration and expect job creation to look stronger in January,\u201d said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics.Job growth slowed sharply in December, with employers adding only 74,000 new positions. In contrast, nonfarm payrolls increased 241,000 in November. The retreat last month was attributed to cold weather.Even as the economy gathers steam there is little sign of a broad pickup in prices, keeping inflation pressures muted. In another report, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.3 percent after being flat in November. In the 12 months to December, consumer prices rose 1.5 percent, after advancing 1.2 percent in November. The increases were in line with economists\u2019 expectations.Stripping out the volatile energy and food components, the so-called core Consumer Price Index rose only 0.1 percent, slowing from a 0.2 percent gain in November. That left its increase over the last 12 months at 1.7 percent, where it has now been for four consecutive months.The Federal Reserve has a target of 2 percent inflation, although it tracks a gauge that tends to run a bit below the Consumer Price Index. The Fed has started scaling back its economic stimulus program, but with persistently low inflation, the central bank is expected to hold short-term interest rates near zero for a long time even if the jobs market picks up significantly.\u201cWith the amount of slack in the labor market, we do not anticipate any substantial acceleration in wage growth for quite some time,\u201d said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Average hourly earnings adjusted for inflation fell 0.3 percent in December. They rose only 0.2 percent compared with a year earlier.A 3.1 percent increase in gasoline prices was mostly behind the rise in inflation last month.Food prices rose 0.1 percent for a third month.\u201cLow inflation looks set to continue in 2014,\u201d said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo. \u201cPrices for imported consumer goods have been flat or fallen in seven of the past eight months, which should keep downward pressure on the C.P.I. in coming months.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Text of Bill de Blasio\u2019s Inauguration Speech", "Date": "2014-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe following is the complete text of Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s inaugural address, as prepared for delivery. Thank you, President Clinton, for your kind words. It was an honor to serve in your administration, and we\u2019re all honored by your presence. I have to note that, over 20 years ago, when a conservative philosophy seemed dominant, you broke through \u2013 and told us to still believe in a place called Hope.Thank you, Secretary Clinton. I was inspired by the time I spent on your first campaign. Your groundbreaking commitment to nurturing our children and families manifested itself in a phrase that is now a part of our American culture \u2013 and something we believe in deeply in this city. It Takes a Village.Thank you, Rev. Fred Lucas Jr., Rabbi Joseph Potasnik, Monsignor Robert Romano, and Imam Askia Muhammad for your words of prayer.Thank you, Governor Cuomo. Working with you at HUD, I saw how big ideas can overcome big obstacles. And it will be my honor to serve shoulder-to-shoulder with you again.Thank you, Mayor Bloomberg. To say the least, you led our city through some extremely difficult times. And for that, we are all grateful. Your passion on issues such as environmental protection and public health has built a noble legacy. We pledge today to continue that great progress you made in these critically important areas. Thank you, Mayor Bloomberg.Thank you, Mayor Dinkins, for starting us on the road to a safer city, and for always uplifting our young people \u2013 and I must say personally, for giving me my start in New York City government. Thank you. And Mayor Dinkins, you also had the wisdom to hire a strong and beautiful young woman who walked up to me one day in City Hall and changed my life forever.Chirlane, you are my soul mate \u2014 and my best friend. And my partner in all I do. My love for you grows with each passing year. Chiara and Dante, I cannot put into words the joy and the pride that you bring your mother and me every day. You are the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to us, and we love you so much.And finally, thank you to my brothers Steve and Don, and all my family assembled here today \u2014 from all around this country, and from Italy. You have always guided and sustained me. Grazie.Thank you, my fellow New Yorkers \u2014 my brothers and sisters \u2014 for joining Chirlane, Chiara, Dante and me on this chilly winter day. And we thank you for your fortitude.De parte de Chirlane, Chiara, Dante y yo, les extiendo las gracias a ustedes, mis hermanas y hermanos niuyorquinos, por acompa\u00f1arnos en este dia tan especial.Like it is for so many of you, my family is my rock. Their wisdom, their compassion, and their sense of humor make each day a gift to cherish.But, what makes today so special isn\u2019t just my family, but our larger New York family. Yes I am borrowing from Governor Cuomo, our family of New York. We see what binds all New Yorkers together: an understanding that big dreams are not a luxury reserved for a privileged few, but the animating force behind every community, in every borough.The spark that ignites our unwavering resolve to do everything possible to ensure that every girl and boy, no matter what language they speak, what subway line they ride, what neighborhood they call home \u2014 that every child has the chance to succeed.We recognize a city government\u2019s first responsibilities: to keep our neighborhoods safe; to keep our streets clean; to ensure that those who live here \u2013 and those who visit \u2013 can get where they need to go in every boroughs. But we know that our mission reaches deeper. We are called to put an end to economic and social inequalities that threaten to unravel the city we love. And so today, we commit to a new progressive direction in New York. And that same progressive impulse has written our city\u2019s history. It\u2019s in our DNA.Nearly a century ago, it was Al Smith who waged war on unsafe working conditions and child labor. It was Franklin Roosevelt and Frances Perkins who led the charge for the basic bargain of unemployment insurance and the minimum wage. It was Fiorello La Guardia who enacted the New Deal here on the city level, battled the excesses of Wall Street, and championed a progressive income tax.From Jacob Riis to Eleanor Roosevelt to Harry Belafonte \u2014 who we are so honored to have with us here today \u2014 it was New Yorkers who challenged the status quo, who blazed a trail of progressive reform and political action, who took on the elite, who stood up to say that social and economic justice will start here and will start now.It\u2019s that tradition that inspires the work we now begin. A movement that sees the inequality crisis we face today, and resolves that it will not define our future. Now I know there are those who think that what I said during the campaign was just rhetoric, just \u201cpolitical talk\u201d in the interest of getting elected. There are some who think now, as we turn to governing \u2013 well, things will just continue pretty much like they always have.So let me be clear. When I said we would take dead aim at the Tale of Two Cities, I meant it. And we will do it. I will honor the faith and trust you have placed in me. And we will give life to the hope of so many in our city. We will succeed as One City. We know this won\u2019t be easy; It will require all that we can muster. And it won\u2019t be accomplished only by me; It will be accomplished by all of us \u2014 those of us here today, and millions of everyday New Yorkers in every corner of our city.You must continue to make your voices heard. You must be at the center of this debate. And our work begins now.We will expand the Paid Sick Leave law \u2014 because no one should be forced to lose a day\u2019s pay, or even a week\u2019s pay, simply because illness strikes. And by this time next year, fully 300,000 additional New Yorkers will be protected by that law. We won\u2019t wait.We\u2019ll do it now. We will require big developers to build more affordable housing. We\u2019ll fight to stem the tide of hospital closures. And we\u2019ll expand community health centers into neighborhoods in need, so that New Yorkers see our city not as the exclusive domain of the One Percent, but a place where everyday people can afford to live, work, and raise a family. We won\u2019t wait. We\u2019ll do it now.We will reform a broken stop-and-frisk policy, both to protect the dignity and rights of young men of color, and to give our brave police officers the partnership they need to continue their success in driving down crime. We won\u2019t wait. We\u2019ll do it now.We will ask the very wealthy to pay a little more in taxes so that we can offer full-day universal pre-K and after-school programs for every middle school student. And when we say \u201ca little more,\u201d we can rightly emphasize the \u201clittle.\u201dThose earning between $500,000 and one million dollars a year, for instance, would see their taxes increase by an average of $973 a year. That\u2019s less than three bucks a day \u2013 about the cost of a small soy latte at your local Starbucks.Think about it. A five-year tax on the wealthiest among us \u2013 with every dollar dedicated to pre-K and after-school. Asking those at the top to help our kids get on the right path and stay there. That\u2019s our mission. And on that, we will not wait. We will do it now.Of course, I know that our progressive vision isn\u2019t universally shared. Some on the far right continue to preach the virtue of trickle-down economics. They believe that the way to move forward is to give more to the most fortunate, and that somehow the benefits will work their way down to everyone else. They sell their approach as the path of \u201crugged individualism.\u201dBut Fiorello La Guardia \u2014 the man I consider to be the greatest Mayor this city has ever known \u2014 put it best. He said: \u201cI, too, admire the \u2018rugged individual,\u2019 but no \u2018rugged individual\u2019 can survive in the midst of collective starvation.\u201dSo please remember: we do not ask more of the wealthy to punish success. We do it to create more success stories. And we do it to honor a basic truth: that a strong economy is dependent on a thriving school system. We do it to give every kid a chance to get their education off on the right foot, from the earliest age, which study after study has shown leads to greater economic success, healthier lives, and a better chance of breaking the cycle of poverty.We do it to give peace of mind to working parents, who suffer the anxiety of not knowing whether their child is safe and supervised during those critical hours after the school day ends, but before the workday is done. And we do it because we know that we must invest in our city, in the future inventors and C.E.O.'s and teachers and scientists, so that our generation \u2013 like every generation before us \u2013 can leave this city even stronger than we found it.Our city is no stranger to big struggles \u2014 and no stranger to overcoming them.New York has faced fiscal collapse, a crime epidemic, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters. But now, in our time, we face a different crisis \u2013 an inequality crisis. It\u2019s not often the stuff of banner headlines in our daily newspapers. It\u2019s a quiet crisis, but one no less pernicious than those that have come before.Its urgency is read on the faces of our neighbors and their children, as families struggle to make it against increasingly long odds. To tackle a challenge this daunting, we need a dramatic new approach \u2014 rebuilding our communities from the bottom-up, from the neighborhoods up. And just like before, the world will watch as we succeed. All along the way, we will remember what makes New York, New York.A city that fights injustice and inequality \u2014 not just because it honors our values, but because it strengthens our people. A city of five boroughs \u2014 all created equal. Black, white, Latino, Asian, gay, straight, old, young, rich, middle class, and poor. A city that remembers our responsibility to each other \u2014 our common cause \u2014 is to leave no New Yorker behind.That\u2019s the city that you and I believe in. It\u2019s the city to which my grandparents were welcomed from the hills of Southern Italy, the city in which I was born, where I met the love of my life, where Chiara and Dante were raised.It\u2019s a place that celebrates a very simple notion: that no matter what your story is \u2013 this is your city. Our strength is derived from you. Working together, we will make this One City. And that mission \u2014 our march toward a fairer, more just, more progressive place, our march to keep the promise of New York alive for the next generation. It begins today.Thank you, and God bless the people of New York City!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sounds to Complement Red and White at Long Island Wineries", "Date": "2014-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArts | Long IslandThe listeners included a retired couple from nearby Laurel who learned online about the winery\u2019s Fight Cabin Fever Concert Series; a group of eight relatives and friends celebrating a birthday; and a couple from Smithtown who happened on the music and decided to linger.\u201cIt\u2019s a fun thing to do instead of sitting at home,\u201d said Julie Petrocelli-Vergari, part of the family that owns the winery. \u201cWithout music, people wouldn\u2019t stay.\u201d In fact, she said, it\u2019s likely that few people would show up at all. This year, the festival\u2019s central music component, which started out seven years ago as Jazz on the Vine, has been renamed Live on the Vine and encompasses a greater range of genres, including blues, rock, soul, country, bluegrass and Latin, said Kathryn Simos, the festival coordinator. \u201cThe committee got together this past summer and looked at ways to expand the audience,\u201d Ms. Simos said. It was a \u201cno-brainer,\u201d she said, to add more genres. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to create a larger festival and bring in more businesses,\u201d she said. In addition to the wineries, the venues now include a few theaters, hotels and restaurants, with more than 100 performances scheduled (compared with 75 in 2012 and 86 last year). State grants totaling $261,000 allow the festival to advertise beyond Long Island, she said, including in New York City buses and subways. All local businesses benefit, she said, including limousine companies, inns, stores and restaurants. In 2012, Mr. Bate said, the festival had 10,000 visitors, though last year only about 6,000 people came because of bad weather. An extra week in March was added to this year\u2019s schedule to allow for possible makeup concerts. Most events cost $20, including a glass of wine, and there are discounted tickets for those attending multiple events. At Raphael, Mr. Europe started with \u201cMy Creole Belle,\u201d a country blues song by Mississippi John Hurt, and moved later to \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice, It\u2019s All Right\u201d by Bob Dylan (with Chris Hurley of Cutchogue on harmonica) and \u201cDead Flowers\u201d by the Rolling Stones.Among his listeners were Pam and Phil Millen, retired airline workers from Laurel who said they had searched online that morning for something to do. They said they would not mind the $20 charge during the festival. \u201cA glass of wine with music \u2014 you can\u2019t beat it,\u201d Ms. Millen said.Maryann Giannettino of East Islip was celebrating her birthday with friends and relatives at a table covered with a huge spread of food they had brought. (Raphael allows outside food, though not all wineries do.) They had bought three bottles of wine.\u201cYou feel like you\u2019re on a little mini-vacation,\u201d Ms. Giannettino said. Both she and Andrea Agostino of Centereach, her cousin and the mother of 13-month-old Avagrace, also at the table, said they would probably not attend Winterfest events because of the $20 charge. \u201cThat\u2019s for tourists,\u201d Ms. Agostino said. Even though Nick and Stephanie Camizzi live in Smithtown, they were more or less tourists, since they planned to stay overnight in Greenport. \u201cIt\u2019s an escape,\u201d Ms. Camizzi said. They had left their three daughters, aged 25, 19 and 17, at home. \u201cThe music was a little bit of a surprise,\u201d Mr. Camizzi said, and motivated them to stay longer. Ms. Camizzi said she was looking forward to the events during Live on the Vine. \u201cWhen you come out here, you\u2019re looking for some action.\u201d \u201cLive on the Vine: The Long Island Winterfest,\u201d Feb. 8 to March 16.

{"Headline": "Talking Troubled Turkey", "Date": "2014-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is, in many ways, a familiar story. But that\u2019s part of what makes it so disturbing: Why do we keep having these crises? And here\u2019s the thing: The intervals between crises seem to be getting shorter, and the fallout from each crisis seems to be worse than the last. What\u2019s going on?Before I get to Turkey, a brief history of global financial crises.For a generation after World War II, the world financial system was, by modern standards, remarkably crisis-free \u2014 probably because most countries placed restrictions on cross-border capital flows, so that international borrowing and lending were limited. In the late 1970s, however, deregulation and rising banker aggressiveness led to a surge of funds into Latin America, followed by what\u2019s known in the trade as a \u201csudden stop\u201d in 1982 \u2014 and a crisis that led to a decade of economic stagnation.Most recently, yet another version of the story has played out within Europe, with a rush of money into Greece, Spain and Portugal, followed by a sudden stop and immense economic pain.When that\u2019s true, you have one of two outcomes. If investors are being cautious and prudent, we are collectively, in effect, trying to spend less than our income, and since my spending is your income and your spending is my income, the result is a persistent slump.Alternatively, flailing investors \u2014 frustrated by low returns and desperate for yield \u2014 can delude themselves, pouring money into ill-conceived projects, be they subprime lending or capital flows to emerging markets. This can boost the economy for a while, but eventually investors face reality, the money dries up and pain follows. If this is a good description of our situation, and I believe it is, we now have a world economy destined to seesaw between bubbles and depression. And that\u2019s not an encouraging thought as we watch what looks like an emerging-markets bubble burst.The larger point is that Turkey isn\u2019t really the problem; neither are South Africa, Russia, Hungary, India, and whoever else is getting hit right now. The real problem is that the world\u2019s wealthy economies \u2014 the United States, the euro area, and smaller players, too \u2014 have failed to deal with their own underlying weaknesses. Most obviously, faced with a private sector that wants to save too much and invest too little, we have pursued austerity policies that deepen the forces of depression. Worse yet, all indications are that, by allowing unemployment to fester, we\u2019re depressing our long-run as well as short-run growth prospects, which will depress private investment even more.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bangladesh's Non-Election", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 In early December, after weeks of strikes and road blocks called by the political opposition, the dairy farmers of the Rangpur district, in northern Bangladesh, started protesting the disruption to their business by pouring milk onto highways. For many weeks, they hadn\u2019t been able to get their milk to the processing and packaging plants in the capital; instead, they had to sell it to local confectioners and small restaurants. Supply far outstripped demand. Across the country, an average of half a million liters of milk was dumped every day that the opposition called a general strike or a blockade. After many such protests since late October, the dairy industry was on its knees. Many small farmers, like those in Rangpur, had borrowed money to buy their livestock and could no longer afford to feed their cows; they started selling the animals and looking for other ways to make a living. Supermarket shelves in Dhaka grew more sparse. They carried little fresh milk, and no butter, except for shockingly expensive brands imported from India and Australia.The crisis erupted after the opposition, led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its ally Jamaat-e-Islami, objected to holding a national election unless the government first handed over power to a neutral caretaker body; it feared rigging otherwise. When the ruling Awami League refused, the opposition leader Khaleda Zia called a series of crippling protests.B.N.P. supporters and Jamaat-e-Islami unleashed their anger on anyone who defied the strikes, destroying roads, damaging rail lines, torching buses \u2014 and killing about 200 people since late October, according to the British newspaper The Independent. The milk farmers\u2019 plight was just one example of the colossal waste caused by the chaos surrounding the election. Supply roads to the capital were obstructed, and across the country, milk soured on roads and vegetables rotted in fields. The garment industry, a major engine of the economy, was in jeopardy because of delayed deliveries to international buyers. Shahidullah Azim, vice president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told Reuters early this month that up to $1 billion in orders were at risk in the weeks ahead if stability did not return. But as political negotiations foundered, the opposition decided to boycott the election. So when the vote took place on Jan. 5, like many of my fellow citizens, I didn\u2019t bother to cast a ballot. The sole candidate in my constituency \u2014 an ally of the Awami League \u2014 was running uncontested. Some 152 other members of Parliament from the Awami League and affiliated parties also ran against no competition, and the 147 remaining Awami League contestants faced off against weak independent candidates. (In the end, the Awami League won 232 out of 300 seats.) Bangladesh is now in the unprecedented situation of having a Parliament with no real opposition. How much staying power can such a government have? Enough to serve the whole term, it turns out, no matter how dysfunctional the situation. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has had the good sense of forming a new cabinet that is relatively fresh and untainted, leaving behind many ministers suspected of corruption. And while the Awami League has taken a hit in terms of popularity for staging an election with no serious contender, the B.N.P. seems to have come out of the experience even more discredited. Many people have been put off by its hard-line stance and violent tactics. The B.N.P. has refused to sever its links to the right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami, even though that group was widely believed to be behind much of the street violence. On polling day and in subsequent weeks, Hindu minorities were targeted by Jamaat-e-Islami members simply for having gone out to vote. Especially in northern districts, where religious minorities are concentrated, Hindu families have been attacked, their homes torched and their businesses destroyed. According to one count, up to 700 people may have been affected. These attacks have been widely condemned, and not just by Hindus, with protests taking place throughout the country. Most important, economic considerations will prevail over concerns about political representation, and this will favor the new status quo. The cost of more upheaval would be too high, and the prevailing mood now is for restoring economic stability. Businesses cannot afford another disruptive year. The Center for Policy Dialogue, an independent think tank, estimates the total economic loss at more than $6.3 billion. The transport sector has borne the brunt of the losses, followed by the agricultural sector and the clothing and textile industries. Previous elections in Bangladesh were celebrated with great fanfare: Voters would display their inky thumbs with pride. Not this time. Still, after the near-standstill of this fall, a semblance of normality has returned. There has been no major public outcry yet over this lopsided election. Children are going back to school. The roads in the capital are reassuringly clogged with traffic again. Butter has returned to the supermarket shelves. The fundamental political issues remain, but for now, an uneasy peace holds.

{"Headline": "Islamist Party in Tunisia Hands Power to Caretaker Government", "Date": "2014-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTUNIS \u2014 Tunisia\u2019s Islamist party Ennahda ceded power\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0to a caretaker government, ending a strife-ridden two years as the country\u2019s first elected government after the Arab Spring of 2011. The government departed under pressure, criticized for failing to halt rising terrorism and steady a faltering economy, but Ennahda was nevertheless assured of its place in Tunisian politics.Prime Minister Ali Laarayedh is handing the reins of government to Mehdi Jomaa, a technocrat who was his minister for industry. Mr. Jomaa was chosen by a consensus of political parties to lead the country into elections later in the year. He presented his cabinet to the National Constituent Assembly\u00a0and won approval in a vote early in the morning on Wednesday.\u201cI have a feeling of pride that our young democracy is alive despite the difficulties and trials,\u201d Mr. Laarayedh said in a packed assembly hall at the signing ceremony. \u201cWe should be proud at what we have achieved and continue on the same road with God\u2019s guidance, having confidence in ourselves and our people.\u201dThe party won the largest portion of the vote in elections in October 2011 and formed a coalition government with two smaller secular parties, the Congress Party for the Republic and Ettakatol. Tasked with drawing up a new constitution and legislation and institutions for elections, Ennahda has delivered, according to supporters, even if the results of that effort came one year later than planned and after some bruising political battles.\u201cWe lived through our own experience, and we are in the process of succeeding and should be proud,\u201d Sihem Badi, a member of the Congress Party and the departing minister for women\u2019s affairs, said in an interview before the vote on the Constitution. \u201cTunisia became a real school for democracy.\u201dMany in the coalition government expressed pride that they were giving up power without violence. The speaker of the assembly, Mustapha Ben Jaafar, said that lesson would resound in the Arab world. \u201cThe peaceful transfer of power has occurred in an extraordinary way that history will not forget,\u201d he told the assembly and guests, including representatives from Algeria and Morocco.Despite the late-hour consensus that led to the approval of the new Constitution by a resounding majority, amid cheers and celebrations on all sides, and of the new government, opposition members remained caustic in their criticism of Ennahda\u2019s performance while in power.\u201cThey failed on the economic, security and social levels,\u201d said Khmais Kssila, an assembly member with Nidaa Tounes, a newly formed opposition party that has coalesced around former Prime Minister B\u00e9ji Ca\u00efd Essebsi. \u201cThey did not succeed in retaining our confidence,\u201d he added.Mongi Rahoui, another opposition lawmaker, said, \u201cThey were nil.\u201d He pointed out the final Constitution was much different from what the Ennahda government originally presented six months ago.Ennahda struggled to govern in the freewheeling chaos of a post-revolutionary Tunisia in which popular expectations were high but few of its ministers had much experience in government. Ennahda was criticized for showing too much leniency toward Islamist extremists who began vigilante campaigns against behavior deemed un-Islamic in some neighborhoods and then turned to attacking police and army units.After the assassinations of two secular politicians last year, the criticism escalated into street protests that finally forced the suspension of the assembly. The economy declined as investor confidence collapsed, and strikes and protests disrupted work as prices rose.Ennahda members defended their party\u2019s performance, saying that they faced not only ferocious opposition in the form of terrorism from religious extremists, but also relentless protests and strikes led by leftist opponents.\u201cThere are parts of the opposition that still have not accepted the results of the last elections,\u201d said Jamel Bouajaja, an Ennahda member of the assembly. \u201cThey tried to hamper Ennahda\u2019s experience in rule through the media and by refusing to accept it as a strong political influence within the authorities.\u201dThere were certainly deep-seated prejudices against Islamists. Some opposition demonstrators openly declared that all Islamists were terrorists. Ennahda\u2019s coalition partners came under pressure too, attacked for joining the Islamists and lending them democratic support, but they saw a chance to institute changes.\u201cIn the context of the revolution, we were able to dare,\u201d Ms. Badi said. As minister of women\u2019s affairs, she initiated the first nationally representative survey on violence against women and opened the first center for abused women in the country.Previous governments had claimed to be progressive and support women\u2019s rights, but had only paid lip service, while the coalition government dared to acknowledge the problems and begin to tackle them, she said. She expressed disappointment that the new leadership had not increased the number of women in government, only three, and that the women\u2019s affairs ministry would now be led by a man because ministries had been combined.Mr. Jomaa, 51, the new prime minister, is an engineer who has spent most of his life in the private sector. He promised to tackle the two most pressing problems, terrorism and the ailing economy, in a speech to the assembly\u00a0on Tuesday. He has appointed mainly independent experts to his cabinet, among them Hakim Ben Hammouda, an adviser to the African Development Bank, as his finance minister, and Mongi Hamid, a former United Nations diplomat, as his foreign minister.Ennahda retains its dominance of the assembly, the only elected body in Tunisia, and so will continue to exercise influence over legislation and as a check on the new government. By approving the new government, the assembly essentially voted its own government out of office in favor of a cabinet of nonelected independent technocrats.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Companies Fight Back Against Patent Lawsuits", "Date": "2014-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneThe general counsel of Rackspace, a web-hosting company in San Antonio, does not mince words when he discusses patent litigation.\u201cIt\u2019s a shakedown,\u201d the general counsel, Alan Schoenbaum, said. \u201cIt\u2019s extortive behavior.\u201dThe subject of his rancor, which is shared by many in the software industry, is litigation by patent assertion entities that are known derisively as patent trolls. Their tactics are simple and legal: Collect dormant patents, then file suit in federal court against companies, claiming infringement, to extract licensing fees. Advocates of patent reform say the legal system unfairly favors the entities and have called on federal lawmakers to restrict what they call frivolous litigation that stifles innovation. While bills slowly grind through Congress, some Texas lawmakers are considering ways for the state, which has increasingly invested in the software industry, to address the issue.\u201cTheir activity has been skyrocketing,\u201d Mr. Bessen, a law lecturer, said of patent assertion entities. Reformers have mostly advocated federal laws that would limit frivolous litigation and require patents to be worded less vaguely. \u201cIf a patent owner has no assets besides the patent, the playing field is completely uneven\u201d because filing suit costs patent holders a fraction of what defendants pay, said Matt Levy, the patent counsel for the Computer and Communications Industry Association. \u201cThat pressure will encourage the defendant to settle even a weak claim.\u201dOne provision of the House bill would shift responsibility for legal fees in patent litigation cases to a \u201closer pays\u201d system. It is intended to discourage frivolous patent suits, but some federal lawmakers, including Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Houston, opposed the measure because it favored the wealthier party in a lawsuit.Mr. Schoenbaum acknowledged the controversy surrounding fee-shifting and said the problem lacked a \u201csilver bullet\u201d fix. But he stressed the necessity of federal patent overhaul of some kind, particularly to address \u201clow value\u201d patents that could be interpreted broadly.\u201cMost of the work needs to be done by the U.S. Congress,\u201d he said.But with federal legislation stuck, some state politicians are weighing overhauls of their own. Most prominently, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst made patent assertion entities a legislative priority for state senators in the interim session. In November, speaking at a conference, Mr. Dewhurst directed the state affairs committee to investigate the economic effects of patent trolling.\u201cAllegedly, these folks prey on businesses across the state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt appears they\u2019ve turned their attention to small companies that lack the resources to defend themselves.\u201dMr. Schoenbaum estimated that defending a case in court cost his company roughly $2 million a suit, a figure that smaller businesses routinely balk at. He said most small businesses agreed to settle rather than risk tremendous losses before a judge.It is not always apparent which entities rank among the \u201ctrolls.\u201d Even reform advocates like Mr. Schoenbaum draw distinctions between good-faith patent asserters and trolls, because in many cases, patents are \u201cinherently good\u201d for inventors, he said.\u201cThere are some infringement cases that are legitimate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the problem is, there\u2019s been a proliferation of these shakedowns.\u201dMr. Bessen attributed the increase in such litigation to software patents, he said, because the technology has \u201creal problems in the patent system.\u201dIt is difficult to break down the economic effects of patent litigation along state lines, Mr. Bessen said, but Texas politicians may be especially keen on addressing litigation that hampers software companies. The state has billed itself as a haven for technology companies, offering cash incentives from the Texas Enterprise Fund to those willing to relocate to the state. Software and I.T. companies have received about $70 million by way of 14 Enterprise Fund grants \u2014 the most grants of any industry, tied with the medical and biotechnology sector. Rackspace alone has received $22 million from the Enterprise Fund.But as patent litigation has grown, so too has the diversity of its defendants. Justin Bragiel, general counsel for the Texas Hotel and Lodging Association, said patent assertion entities had targeted hotels around the state for offenses like offering guests wireless Internet. \u201cIt costs upwards of a million dollars in legal costs to defend one of these things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just sort of stuck at the end here, so we\u2019d like to see some protection for us.\u201d Mr. Dewhurst did not provide specifics about what patent reform might look like in Texas, but the state could follow others like Vermont, where lawmakers amended a consumer protection law to prohibit \u201cbad faith\u201d patent assertions. Vermont\u2019s attorney general has used the law to file suit against MPHJ.Mr. Bragiel said he was hopeful about patent reform, despite the difficulty of getting a bill through Congress, because the most egregious patent entities seemed to be growing apprehensive.\u201cI think the trolls are a little bit afraid of killing the goose,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they don\u2019t go after individual consumers, because at that point everybody calls their congressman.\u201dewalters@texastribune.org Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sometimes \u2018Nazi\u2019 Is the Right Word", "Date": "2014-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTEL AVIV \u2014 \u201cNAZI\u201d is a short word. It has only two syllables, like \u201crac-ist\u201d or \u201ckill-er.\u201d \u201cDemocracy,\u201d on the other hand, is a long word with lots of syllables that is very tiring to say. It may not be as tiring as saying \u201cfreedom of expression\u201d or \u201csocial justice,\u201d but still, there is something really exhausting about it. People in Israel use \u201cNazi\u201d when they want the most vicious curse possible, and it\u2019s usually directed at someone they perceive as belligerent. It could be a cop, a soldier or an elected official who, in their opinion, is acting like a bully. Such usage is offensive and infuriating. As the son of Holocaust survivors, I find it particularly rankling. This week the Knesset gave preliminary approval to a bill that would criminalize saying \u201cNazi\u201d under inappropriate circumstances. The government views the word as a weapon of mass destruction no less lethal than an Iranian nuclear bomb, and so it insists on Israel\u2019s basic right to protect itself from the threat.Many Israelis think that passing a law against a word is stupid and juvenile; others see it as fascist and anti-democratic. Incidentally, saying \u201cfascist\u201d or \u201canti-democratic\u201d is also seen as insulting and offensive. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if someone tried to outlaw those words in the future, too.Imagine a different state of Israel, one very much like our own: This other Israel would also be sunny, with golden beaches, roadblocks in the territories, targeted killings, and rockets hitting the southern towns. The only difference between this new Israel and the current one would be that in the new Hebrew language that would be spoken there, you could say anything except \u201cNazi,\u201d \u201cfascist\u201d and \u201canti-democratic.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t that be a better place to live than our current Israel? And now that we\u2019re exercising our imaginations, let\u2019s picture yet another new Israel \u2014 one where the word \u201cNazi\u201d is permitted but the government genuinely wants a peace accord and its members do not treat the Palestinians like \u201cshrapnel in your butt\u201d \u2014 as our economy minister, Naftali Bennett, recently put it \u2014 but rather as neighbors seeking freedom and self-determination.Let\u2019s go one step further: Imagine that in this second new Israel, the government gives serious consideration to African refugees\u2019 appeals rather than locking them up in camps while Knesset members like Danny Danon and Miri Regev call them \u201ca cancer,\u201d or \u201cinfiltrators,\u201d and use racial epithets not unlike those my parents were subjected to in that miserable war in which my grandparents were murdered by you-know-who.Now, hand to heart, which of these alternative Israels would you prefer to live in? Aha! I knew you\u2019d choose the one that strives for peace and defends human rights regardless of religion, race or gender. How unfortunate, then, that our elected government wants the other one. Its ministers know, of course, that criminalizing the word \u201cNazi\u201d will require painful sacrifices, such as banning reruns of the Soup Nazi episodes of \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d But they are willing to pay this heavy price. Many years ago, my father, who had to hide in a damp pit for roughly 600 days during World War II, told me that there were only two lessons to be learned from that war. The first was that the Jewish people, who have suffered so much, must do whatever it takes to be strong so that they never again find themselves at the mercy of others. The second was that the Jews, who have suffered from racial discrimination and inhumane conduct, must be more careful than any other people to avoid the slightest hint of racism and persecution in their own conduct. My father, may he rest in peace, tried to live by these sometimes contradictory values throughout his 83-year life. More than three decades ago, he once found himself at a train station in Norway, where a group of local drunks were harassing two Chinese tourists. The drunks called the tourists \u201cslant eyes\u201d and \u201cyellow dogs.\u201d My father stood between the drunks and the Chinese and demanded that the hooligans leave. In response, he was also showered with curses and threats. When the Norwegians called him a \u201ckike,\u201d he called them \u201cNazis.\u201d What my father did, according to the Knesset members who support the \u201cNazi\u201d ban, was a criminal act that justifies a prison sentence. And in their Brave New Israel, it\u2019s worth noting, the racist Norwegians would have been well within their rights. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Free-Trade Conundrum", "Date": "2014-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 IN his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Obama focused on reversing the growth of economic inequality in the United States and restoring the American dream. At the same time, he also announced his support for fast track authority that would limit Congress\u2019s role in determining the content of trade agreements.The president\u2019s call follows on legislation introduced earlier this month to grant him fast-track authority as a way of forcing Congress to speed up its consideration of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation pact with Latin American and Asian nations. But Mr. Obama\u2019s desire for fast-track authority on the T.P.P. and other agreements clashes with another priority in his speech: reducing income inequality. This month is the 20th anniversary of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which significantly eliminated tariffs and other trade barriers across the continent and has been used as a model for the T.P.P. Anyone looking for evidence on what this new agreement will do to income inequality in America needs to consider Nafta\u2019s 20-year record. While many analysts focus on the number of jobs lost from Nafta and similar pacts \u2014 and some estimates say upward of a million \u2014 the most significant effect has been a fundamental change in the composition of jobs available to the 63 percent of American workers without a college degree. At Nafta\u2019s core \u2014 and proposed for the T.P.P. \u2014 are investor rights and privileges that eliminate many of the risks that make firms think twice about moving production to low-wage countries. Today, goods once made here are being produced in Mexico and exported here for sale. Indeed, American manufacturing exports to Mexico and Canada grew at less than half the rate after Nafta than in the years before it. As a result, our trade deficit has ballooned. In 1993, before Nafta, the United States had a $2.5 billion trade surplus with Mexico and a $29 billion deficit with Canada. In 2012, the combined Nafta trade deficit was $181 billion, even as the share of that deficit made up of oil imports dropped 22 percent. The average annual growth of our trade deficit has been 45 percent higher with Mexico and Canada than with countries that are not party to a Nafta-style pact. The companies that took the most advantage of Nafta \u2014 big manufacturers like G.E., Caterpillar and Chrysler \u2014 promised they would create more jobs at their American factories if Nafta passed. Instead, they fired American workers and shifted production to Mexico. The Labor Department\u2019s Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which documents this trend, reads like a funeral program for the middle class. More than 845,000 workers have been certified under this one narrow and hard-to-qualify-for program as having lost their jobs because of offshoring of factories to, and growing imports from, Mexico and Canada since Nafta. The result is downward pressure on middle-class wages as manufacturing workers are forced to compete with imports made by poorly paid workers abroad. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly two out of every three displaced manufacturing workers who were rehired in 2012 saw wage reductions, most losing more than 20 percent. The shift in employment from high-paying manufacturing jobs to low-paying service jobs has contributed to overall wage stagnation. The average American wage has grown less than 1 percent annually in real terms since Nafta, even as productivity grew three times faster. But the decline in the wages of workers who lost a job to Nafta is only part of the story. They joined the glut of workers competing for low-skill jobs that cannot be done offshore in industries like hospitality and food service, forcing down real wages in these sectors as well. And, for America\u2019s remaining manufacturing workers, Nafta put downward pressure on wages by enabling employers to threaten to move jobs offshore during wage bargaining. A 1997 Cornell University study ordered by the Nafta Commission for Labor Cooperation found that as many as 62 percent of union drives faced employer threats to relocate abroad, and the factory shutdown rate following successful union certifications tripled after Nafta. This is hardly news; in the early 1990s a spate of studies resulted in an academic consensus that trade flows contributed to between 10 and 40 percent of inequality increases. Indeed, since Nafta\u2019s implementation, the share of national income collected by the richest 10 percent has risen by 24 percent, while the top 1 percent\u2019s share has shot up by 58 percent.Some advocates of Nafta-style pacts acknowledge that they will cause the loss of some jobs, but argue that workers will win over all by being able to purchase cheaper imported goods. But when the Center for Economic and Policy Research applied the data to the theory, they found that reductions in consumer prices had not been sufficient to offset losses in wage levels. They found that American workers without college degrees had most likely lost more than 12 percent of their wages to Nafta-style trade, even accounting for the benefits of cheaper goods. This means a loss of more than $3,300 per year for a worker earning the median annual wage of $27,500. The Nafta data poses a significant challenge for President Obama. As he said on Tuesday, he wants to battle the plague of income inequality and he wants to expand the Nafta model with T.P.P. But he cannot have it both ways.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Solid Retail Sales in December Point to Economic Acceleration ", "Date": "2014-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Retail sales crept up in December, with a core spending gauge posting a big increase, a sign that the economy gathered steam at the end of last year and was poised for stronger growth in 2014.The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that retail sales gained 0.2 percent last month, even as receipts at automobile dealers recorded their biggest drop in more than a year.\u201cThe surge in sales in December means the momentum will continue into the first quarter of the new year \u2014 2014 is shaping up to be pretty good from where we sit,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York.Economists had expected retail sales to rise just 0.1 percent last month. For all of 2013, sales increased 4.2 percent.Sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services increased 0.7 percent after a 0.2 percent rise in November. Economists looked for a gain of just 0.3 percent.These so-called core sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, and the increase suggested consumption accelerated in the fourth quarter from the third quarter\u2019s 2 percent annual pace.The government report suggested holiday sales were better than some had expected, though at the cost of heavy discounting. The National Retail Federation said a measure of holiday sales \u2014 which leaves out spending on cars, gasoline and restaurant meals \u2014 rose 3.8 percent in the November-to-December period compared with a year earlier. That is up from a 3.5 percent rise in 2012.Fourth-quarter growth prospects were further bolstered by a second report from the Commerce Department showing retail inventories, excluding autos, increased 0.6 percent in November after increasing 0.3 percent in October. Businesses aggressively accumulated inventories in the third quarter and warehouses were left bulging. Economists had anticipated a need for businesses to sell off those goods, which would have undercut production in the fourth quarter.It now appears some of the inventory buildup was planned.\u201cIt does not appear that the fourth-quarter G.D.P. report will feature a drag from inventories and, possibly, might even show a modest further addition to growth,\u201d said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. \u201cIt is hard to argue that this pickup in inventory investment is excessive.\u201dA separate report from the Labor Department showed import prices were unexpectedly flat in December.Advertisement"}

A civil emergency for metropolitan Atlanta expired at noon, and traffic volume along the area\u2019s roads was significantly increased from a day earlier.The authorities in Alabama and Georgia said no public school students stayed at their schools on Wednesday night; the night before, thousands slept on towels, gym mats and blankets after dinners of cafeteria food. And Georgia officials began the process of helping drivers return to the vehicles they abandoned during a Tuesday rush hour that provoked comparisons to a zombie movie and led to packed motels along the highways.As they sought to coordinate recovery operations, public officials again pushed back against the mounting and fiercely negative reviews of their management of the storm.\u201cWithin 24 hours, the roads in the city of Atlanta were more than 80 percent passable,\u201d Mr. Reed said. \u201cSo I just reviewed your report and it focused almost exclusively on our city\u2019s highways, which the city does not have jurisdiction for, and most of those simply were not in the city of Atlanta.\u201dBut Mr. Reed conceded what many here believe was a fundamental misstep: the sudden wave of decisions on Tuesday to close schools and shut down area governments.\u201cWe made an error in the way that we released our citizens,\u201d Mr. Reed said.Gov. Nathan Deal said warnings could have been posted earlier, but he defended the state\u2019s response. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be accused of crying wolf,\u201d Mr. Deal told reporters. \u201cBecause if we had been wrong, y\u2019all would have all been in here saying, \u2018Do you know how many millions of dollars you cost the economies of the city of Atlanta and the state of Georgia by shutting down businesses all over this city and this state?'\u201dBy Thursday, area residents were beginning to emerge from their homes, hotel rooms and other shelters.A couple of dozen of them quickly went to the two staging areas where state officials offered once-stranded drivers rides to their cars in vehicles with four-wheel drive.\u201cI\u2019m just happy to find my vehicle,\u201d said Sharon Howell, 32, as she waited among state troopers and members of the National Guard at a rail station in southwest Atlanta.A spokeswoman for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, Crystal Paulk-Buchanan, said there were 2,029 abandoned vehicles on the Atlanta area\u2019s Interstates, plus a major state highway, as of early Thursday.In Alabama, where officials reported that the weather had been a factor in five deaths and 54 injuries, the authorities did not immediately announce formal plans for drivers to retrieve their vehicles, but they said they were working to move cars out of travel lanes.But conditions in the state remained treacherous. Cleburne County, Ala., was under a countywide curfew, the Alabama Emergency Management Agency reported, and about 300 people were in shelters in the state.In a sign of impending, widespread relief, though, forecasters lifted weather warnings throughout the region.Still, many roads remained shut down, and dozens of Southern school districts stayed closed. There were exceptions, though, and the University of Georgia, east of Atlanta, resumed classes late on Thursday morning.Arrangements for air travel remained difficult. The Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, one of the world\u2019s busiest, was open, but by 6 a.m., airlines had canceled 400 flights. The Southern freeze has led to 5,400 cancellations since Tuesday, with flight schedules that moved planes to or from Atlanta taking the hardest hit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rebel Chic vs. Rebel Shock", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFashion ReviewFLORENCE, Italy \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting time for our Europe \u2014 moral, economic, ethical, spiritual, political and religious \u2014 and the best has yet to come,\u201d said Brunello Cucinelli.It seemed a grandiose statement by the men\u2019s wear designer, who was standing near a lineup of men of different ages and sizes wearing suits that expressed various tastes and physical traits \u2014 mostly three pieces, but with vests always slightly mismatched to the shapely jackets.But Mr. Cucinelli, whose success in business was reflected in the vast area he took over at Pitti Uomo in Florence this week and by the variety of his imaginative and appealing men\u2019s wear, was on to something. There seemed to be a change in the air at the Italian trade show for the 2014 winter season.It could be the new Italian government, a steadying of the country\u2019s economy or the universally lauded, down-to-earth attitude of Pope Francis. Or maybe just because, as Linda Loppa, director of the Polimoda fashion school, put it: \u201c2014 sounds better than 2013.\u201d\u201cThere is a good mood and a lot of energy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are more open-minded \u2014 and men\u2019s wear is always a good start.\u201dHe offered rebel chic rather than rebel shock, with military details, silver zippers and badges that seemed more decoration than social statement.As befits the premier line of a denim brand, the pants were skinny, sexy and sometimes studded, but in black leather rather than as blue jeans. A gash of scarlet on color-block sweaters was part of the sporty message while outerwear including shearling parkas looked positively luxurious.A flash of the designer\u2019s women\u2019s line, which will be shown in New York next month, used fancied-up camouflage as the female form of rebellious luxury, along with sloppy leather boots.On the runway, the bold African prints and sleek Italian tailoring made a skittish combination. The prints might be just on a carpet bag or on the tops of brogue shoes, or used for lively pants, which were teamed with tailored tweed jackets and perhaps a witty T-shirt, such as the poster of the 1961 movie \u201cDivorce Italian Style.\u201dThis tongue-in-cheek meld of different cultures, and a sense of fashion ease that the designer has not yet caught in her women\u2019s line, made this a stand out men\u2019s collection for Stella Jean.The man/woman thing did not quite work. The fancy, female fabrics seemed irrelevant to the masculine power of the knits, duffel coats and parkas. But the designer scored a hit with his decorative Alpine socks, where lacy effects and ornamental embroidery made a chic crossover between the sexes.A capsule collection of \u201cmen\u2019s wear for women\u201d included a pantsuit and a bathrobe-style coat in shocking pink, a shapely, draped jumpsuit and a fold-flat handbag, the designer\u2019s first accessory. Yet the Brazilian-born Ms. Casasola, who works out of London but makes her clothes in the Tuscan region of Italy, needed to make a stronger statement about androgynous dressing in the 21st century.To produce something new in fashion is so rare that it deserves recognition. At the fashion institute in Florence, Ms. Loppa and her team focus on one \u201cPolimoda talent\u201d among their students.This season\u2019s accolade went to Breno Cintra Pugliesi, a Brazilian-born shoemaker who called his collection of inventive footwear \u201cAugmented Reality and New Perceptions.\u201d Using technology to develop shoes that are in symmetry with the natural foot, the designer offered something new, maybe even revolutionary, in footwear.And it is an example of how Italy, which once treated its luxury clothing as a comfort zone, is pushing dynamically ahead.

{"Headline": "Immigrants Seen as Way to Refill Detroit Ranks", "Date": "2014-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Detroit, a city that has watched a population in free fall, officials have a new antidote: immigrants.Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan on Thursday announced plans to seek federal help in bringing 50,000 immigrants to the bankrupt city over five years as part of a visa program aimed at those with advanced degrees or exceptional abilities in science, business or the arts. Under the plan, which is expected to be formally submitted to federal authorities soon, immigrants would be required to live and work in Detroit, a city that has fallen to 700,000 residents from 1.8 million in the 1950s. \u201cIsn\u2019t that how we made our country great, through immigrants?\u201d said Mr. Snyder, a Republican, who last year authorized the state\u2019s largest city to seek bankruptcy protection and recently announced plans to open a state office focused on new Americans.Later, he added, \u201cThink about the power and the size of this program, what it could do to bring back Detroit, even faster and better.\u201dThe fate of Mr. Snyder\u2019s particular plan \u2014 unusual, officials say, for the way it envisions allotting such visas to a specific city \u2014 remains uncertain because federal authorities have yet to receive a formal request. The proposal comes as part of a push in Midwestern cities \u2014 including Chicago, St. Louis and Dayton, Ohio \u2014 to jump-start growth by attracting entrepreneurial immigrants. \u201cThis is one way you grow the economy,\u201d said Richard Herman, a lawyer in Cleveland who advises cities on such matters and who praised Mr. Snyder\u2019s notion. \u201cThe Rust Belt has needed this for decades.\u201dMike Duggan, the new mayor of Detroit, who has said he wanted to see an increase in the population within five years, said he backed the idea, as did an array of city leaders who attended the governor\u2019s announcement. \u201cWhat seemed like a politically impossible thing in Detroit has changed dramatically,\u201d Mr. Duggan said. \u201cThe leadership of this community is united in saying we are going to take full advantage of the governor\u2019s initiative and we are going to make sure everybody understands that Detroit has been historically and is today truly open to the world.\u201dStill the politics may yet be complicated in Detroit, a mostly black city where 38 percent of people live below the poverty level. \u201cThere will be some whose vantage point is going to be: \u2018O.K., but what are you going to do to help the people who are already there?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Eric Foster, a political consultant in Detroit.The Rev. Charles Williams II of the civil rights group National Action Network said he believed Detroit, as well as other Midwestern states, should be pro-immigration. \u201cHowever,\u201d he said, \u201cI will say, on the other end of this, I think it\u2019s a little ambitious for Governor Snyder to put together a plan to induce more population when still we have to work on double-digit unemployment and high poverty that\u2019s already in our city right now.\u201dBut advocates of bringing an influx of immigrants into the city say the outcome will ultimately benefit longtime residents, too, bringing new business enterprises and jobs, as well as a more stable tax base. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have jobs as part of this process but the part you should focus in on, in particular, are all the jobs they\u2019re going to create for Detroiters, for Michiganders,\u201d Mr. Snyder said. Mr. Snyder said demand already exists for experts in fields like engineering, technology and health care. And he noted that Michigan colleges and universities are home to tens of thousands of international students \u2014 many of whom, he said, ought not depart after graduation. Representatives for Mr. Snyder said the governor had already had high-level discussions with federal officials about the concept but had yet to submit a formal request. Federal authorities said it was too soon to comment on it. But a White House official issued a statement about the administration\u2019s broad views, which said, in part, \u201cPresident Obama is committed to honoring our nation\u2019s legacy of innovation and competitiveness by attracting the world\u2019s best and brightest students and entrepreneurs to start the next great companies here in the United States.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Political Faces in India", "Date": "2014-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialA new organization called the Common Man Party shook India\u2019s political system in December when it took control of the government in the territory of Delhi, which includes the capital of New Delhi. Its rapid rise since its founding in 2012 suggests that many Indian voters are tiring of establishment politicians, especially members of the Indian National Congress Party, which has governed the country and Delhi longer than any other party but has lost favor in recent years because it has mismanaged the economy.Common Man \u2014 its official Hindi name is Aam Aadmi Party \u2014 is led by Arvind Kejriwal, a former tax commissioner who helped lead a popular movement in 2011 that campaigned for the creation of a powerful federal anti-corruption agency. When lawmakers refused, Mr. Kejriwal and his supporters formed their party.The recent election in Delhi, which has nearly 17 million people, was Common Man\u2019s first foray into elective politics. Its commanding victory \u2014 it won 30 percent of the vote in a largely three-way race against the incumbent Congress and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party \u2014 stunned political analysts. If it is able to maintain that momentum in next year\u2019s national election, Common Man could soon play an important role in Parliament as well. Common Man must now show that it can govern. Mr. Kejriwal\u2019s first challenge will be managing a coalition government. Because Common Man did not win an outright majority of the seats in the Delhi Assembly, it will need support from lawmakers Mr. Kejriwal has criticized as corrupt and feckless. The party will also struggle to fulfill big promises like cutting electricity prices in half and providing free, clean drinking water to every Delhi household. Mr. Kejriwal, an engineer by training, will also be judged on how well he deals with major problems like Delhi\u2019 air pollution and violence against women. It is impossible to know whether or how successful Common Man will be. But that it has come this far in such short order suggests a readiness among many Indians for change \u2014 and a willingness to use the democratic system to get it. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lost in the Gallery-Industrial Complex", "Date": "2014-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new year. A new New York mayor. Old problems with art in New York. I have a collection of complaints and a few (very few) ideas for change.Money \u2014 the grotesque amounts spent, the inequitable distribution \u2014 has dominated talk about art in the 21st century so far. It\u2019s a basic fact of art history. Emperors, popes and robber barons set the model for the billionaire buyers of today. Of course, it is today that matters to the thousands of artists who live and work in this punitively expensive city, where the art industry is often confused with the art world. The distinction between the two, though porous, is real. The art industry is the nexus of high-price galleries, auction houses and collectors who control an art market renowned for its funny-money practices. In numbers of personnel, the industry is a mere subset of the circle of artists, teachers, students, writers, curators and middle-range dealers spread out over five boroughs. But in terms of power, the proportions are reversed, to the degree that the art world basically functions as a labor source, supplying the industry with product, services and exotic color but, with the age of apprenticeships long gone, only uncertainly sharing in its wealth. Do I exaggerate? A bit. The argument can be made that labor is benefiting from its ties to management, in a high-tide-floats-all-boats way. Visit art schools or galleries, and you get the impression that a substantial portion of the art world is content to serve as support staff to a global ruling class.The reality is that, directly or indirectly, in large ways and small, the current market system is shaping every aspect of art in the city: not just how artists live, but also what kind of art is made, and how art is presented in the media and in museums.I got tired of money talk a while back. Rather than just sputter with indignation, I figured it would be more useful to turn in another direction, toward art that the industry wasn\u2019t looking at, which is a whole lot of art. But reminders keep pulling you back to the bottom line. With every visit to the gallery-packed Lower East Side, I see fewer of the working-class Latinos who once called the neighborhood home. In what feels like overnight, I\u2019ve watched Dumbo in Brooklyn go from an artist\u2019s refuge to an economically gated community. Recently, my attention was drawn to a controversy surrounding a large and much praised group exhibition installed at a complex of converted warehouses called Industry City in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. The show, \u201cCome Together: Surviving Sandy,\u201d was conceived as a benefit for artists who had suffered losses in the 2012 hurricane and was promoted as evidence of art-world solidarity. Yet a widely read blog, Art F City, reported that the owners of the complex, which had for some years provided low-rent studios for artists, were now raising rents dramatically, forcing many artists to vacate. (Landlords say 25 percent of Industry City tenants are artists). The new residents seem to be an upscale clientele drawn by the artsy atmosphere. Whatever the full facts, money is the winner, and with that comes caution and conservatism. This is almost absurdly obvious on the high-end of the market. Sales of retrograde \u201cmasterworks\u201d can be relied on to jack up the auction charts at regular intervals; the most recent record was set last fall by a $142.4 million Francis Bacon painting of Lucian Freud, a monument to two overpraised painters for the price of one. Meanwhile, big, hugely pricey tchotchkes \u2014 new whatevers by Jeff Koons, say \u2014 roll out of fabrication shops and into personal museums being assembled by members of the international power elite. Outside auctions, the marketing mechanics buzz on. Roughly since the end of the multicultural, postmodern 1990s, we\u2019ve watched new art being re-Modernized and domesticated, with painting the medium of choice, abstraction the mode of preference. Together they offer significant advantages. Paintings can be assembly-line produced but still carry the aura of being hand-touched. They can be tailored to small spaces, such as fair booths. Abstraction, especially if color is involved, can establish instant eye contact from afar. If, in addition, the work\u2019s graphic impact translates well online, where stock can be moved eBay style, so much the better. Other traditional forms \u2014 drawing, photography, some sculpture \u2014 similarly work well in this marketing context. But an enormous range of art does not, beginning with film, performance and installation, and extending into rich realms of creative activity that defy classification as art at all. To note this dynamic is not to dismiss painting or object making, but to point to the restrictive range of art that the market supports, that dealers are encouraged to sell, and that artists are encouraged to make.The narrowing of the market has been successful in attracting a wave of neophyte buyers who have made art shopping chic. It has also produced an epidemic of copycat collecting. To judge by the amounts of money piled up on a tiny handful of reputations, few of these collectors have the guts, or the eye or the interest, to venture far from blue-chip boilerplate. They let galleries, art advisers and the media do the choosing, and the media doesn\u2019t particularly include art critics. What, after all, does thumbs up, thumbs down matter when winners are preselected before the critical votes are in? In this economy, it can appear that the critic\u2019s job is to broadcast names and contribute to fame. Conservative art can encourage conservative criticism. We\u2019re seeing a revival \u2014 some would say a disinterment \u2014 of a describe-the-strokes style of writing popular in the formalist 1950s and again in the 1970s: basically, glorified advertising copy. Evaluative approaches that developed in the 1980s and 1990s, based on the assumption that art inevitably comments on the social and political realities that produce it, tend to be met with disparagement now, in part because they\u2019re often couched in academic jargon, which has become yet another form of sales-speak. And although both are based in New York, they include national coverage and in a feisty mix of voices, a welcome alternative to the one-personality blog of yore. That mix would probably be even more varied, and transcultural, if a few forward-thinking, art-minded investors would infuse some serious capital into such enterprises so they could pay writers a living wage and make online freelance writing a viable way of life.I don\u2019t know what it would take to get a global mix of voices into some of New York\u2019s big, rich art museums. If archaeologists of the future unearthed the Museum of Modern Art as it exists today, they would have to assume that Modernism was a purely European and North American invention. They would be wrong. Modernism was, and is, an international phenomenon, happening in different ways, on different timetables, for different reasons in Africa, Asia, Australia and South America. Why aren\u2019t museums telling that story? Because it doesn\u2019t sell. Why doesn\u2019t it sell? Because it\u2019s unfamiliar. Why is it unfamiliar? Because museums, with their eyes glued to box office, aren\u2019t telling the story. Their job as public institutions is to change our habits of thinking and seeing. One way to do this is by bringing disparate cultures together in the same room, on the same wall, side by side. This sends two vital, accurate messages: that all these cultures are different but equally valuable; and all these cultures are also alike in essential ways, as becomes clear with exposure.With its recently announced plans for an expansion, MoMA has an ideal chance to expand its horizons organically. The new spaces, which should certainly be devoted to the permanent collection, won\u2019t be ready for several years, but the museum has no excuse for waiting for its long-overdue integration process to begin.And on the subject of integration, why, in one of the most ethnically diverse cities, does the art world continue to be a bastion of whiteness? Why are African-American curators and administrators, and especially directors, all but absent from our big museums? Why are there still so few black \u2014 and Latino, and Asian-American \u2014 critics and editors? Not long ago, these questions \u2014 of policy but also political and ethical questions \u2014 seemed to be out there on institutional tables, demanding discussion. Technically, they may be there still, but museums seem to be most interested in talking about real estate, assiduously courting oligarchs for collections, and anxiously scouting for the next \u201cRain Room.\u201d Political questions, about which cultures get represented in museums and who gets to make the decisions, and how, are buried.Political art brings me back to where I started, with artists, and one final, baffled complaint, this one about art schools, which seem, in their present form, designed to accommodate the general art economy and its competitive, caste-system values. Programs are increasingly specialized, jamming students into ever narrower and flakier disciplinary tracks. Tuitions are prodigious, leaving artists indentured to creditors for years. How experimental can artists be under such circumstances? How confidently can they take risks in an environment that acknowledges only dollar-value success? How can they contemplate sustaining \u2014 to me this is crucial to New York\u2019s future as an art center \u2014 long and evolving creative careers? The temptation for many artists, after a postgraduate spurt of confidence, is to look around, see what\u2019s selling, and consider riffing on that. We\u2019re seeing a depressing number of such riffs these days. Again, do I exaggerate? And, again, sure, to some degree. By no means is all the news bad. Start-up galleries are opening; middle-tier galleries are holding their own, or doing better than that. Artist-intensive neighborhoods like Bushwick and Ridgewood are still affordable, companionable and fun. But when the rents get too high, or the economy fails, or art buying falls out of fashion, and the art industry decides to liquidate its overvalued assets and leave? Artists, the first and last stakeholders, will have themselves to fall back on. They\u2019ll learn to organize and agitate for what they need, to let City Hall know, in no uncertain terms, that they\u2019re there. They\u2019ll learn to share, not just on special occasions, but all the time. They\u2019ll learn that art and politics are inseparable, and both can be anything and everything. They\u2019ll learn to bring art back from the brink of inconsequence. As someone long on questions and short on answers, let me ask: Why not start now? Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Straying From Tradition on the Croatian Shoreline", "Date": "2014-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOPATIJA, Croatia \u2014 The home that Aleksandar and Vanja Lazinica built a few years ago sits on a hillside above this historic seaside resort on the Istrian Peninsula, not far from where they both grew up.But what they call the \u201cNest and Cave House\u201d has little in common with the rest of the larger homes here, mostly villas built by Austrian nobles during the 19th century, when the land that makes up modern-day Croatia belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire.The house was designed by Idis Turato, an architect based in nearby Rijeka, Croatia, and built from steel, aluminum and concrete. Its name was inspired by the building itself, which looks as if a child decided to see if he could balance a very long stick off the side of a broad block. \u201cThe upper floor is \u2018floating\u2019 in the air. It is made from stainless steel and looked, before the facade was completed, like a bird\u2019s nest,\u201d Mr. Lazinica said. \u201cDownstairs is buried by soil on three sides so it seems like a cave. Plus, the name sounds appealing.\u201dMr. Turato and the builders proved to be fast workers. Construction on the 2,000-square-meter, or 21,528-square-foot, lot began in February 2011, and the family moved in eight months later.Mr. Lazinica recalled: \u201cIdis met us here and made the sketches in a week, and we became really good friends. It was the first time in his career he had connected with investors.\u201dThe couple spent six months in the house before going to New York in mid-2012. Mr. Lazinica is founder of InTech, a publishing company based in Rijeka that focuses on medicine, science and technology. Mrs. Lazinica is a dentist, having studied the subject at the University of Rijeka and orthodontics during their stay in New York. During their American visit, their daughter Nina, now 5 months old, was born in Los Angeles. The couple\u2019s older child also is a girl, Mila, now 2.The family returned to their new home in September. \u201cIt is an incredibly beautiful place to live, and we love the home and have family nearby,\u201d Mr. Lazinica said.Overall, the house has 333 square meters of living space. The Nest, the upper part of the house, is 17 meters, or 56 feet, long, a steel framework covered in aluminum panels. It contains an open-plan living room and dining room as well as a small kitchen. Also, the couple had wallpaper made from a photograph of Mila to cover one wall in the entryway.A set of steel stairs, built by Mr. Lazinica\u2019s father, Zivojin Lazinica, who is a steel specialist, links the house\u2019s two levels. The three bedrooms are in the Cave portion of the house, although one is a guest apartment with its own entrance. All three rooms overlook the Adriatic and the garden, which has a pool, an outdoor dining area and a 60-year-old olive tree from Mr. Lazinica\u2019s grandfather. \u201cWe have pieces of history and heritage throughout the house. It is not just about buying new stuff but we also wanted to incorporate the past,\u201d Mrs. Lazinica said.The roof of the Cave has been covered in greenery, so rainwater is collected, filtered and then used in the toilets.The Lazinicas do not want to disclose how much they paid for the house. But Mr. Turato said that land prices in Opatija range from 280 to 480 euros per square meter, and that while construction costs can vary, they average around \u20ac1,000, or $1,356, per square meter.Kieran Kelleher, managing director of Savills Croatia and Montenegro, said that properties in Istria sell for an average of \u20ac1,400 to \u20ac1,600 per square meter. In contrast, homes in the tourist magnet of Dubrovnik, where demand is high and few properties are ever available for sale, can be \u20ac4,000 to as much as \u20ac6,000 per square meter.Real estate agents, however, are expecting changes in the country\u2019s properties market, partly as a result of its admittance to the European Union last summer.\u201cThere has been no major immediate impact on the market,\u201d Mr. Kelleher said. But \u201cthe real benefits will only be realized over the next five years as Western Europeans, by far our most prominent buyers of second homes, re-enter the market buoyed by increased confidence in their local economies.\u201d \u201cWhen this group return to the second home property market,\u201d he continued, \u201cCroatia will be well poised to take advantage, with simplified purchase processes introduced for foreigners, a stable and normalized market offering great value, and the most beautiful coastline in Europe.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I want to believe again that the G.O.P. is sufficiently responsible to govern nationally.May he and others in Republican leadership positions shift their emphasis to what is good for the nation from what is good for them personally before November.\u00a0Readers ReactMr. Bryant, you need to look at this in the same way that we football fans here in Cleveland look at our football team. While the name is still the same, the Browns of our youth left us to move to Baltimore. Do we still cheer for that team in Baltimore? No, we cheer for the team that now represents us (4-12 records notwithstanding).You need to view your political parties in the same way. The Republicans left you, though in this case they took the name with them. You need to learn to cheer and vote Democratic, a party that, as you note, now has a lot more in common with what you believe in.\u00a0When I was a student in the late 1950s and early 1960s, many, if not most, of my professors were Republicans. Today, a professor myself, I find that few of my colleagues are Republicans or vote Republican.Conservatives blame this change on the 1960s cultural revolution and decry the \u201cliberal bias\u201d in academia. But the real reason is lack of reason: How can any academician belong to a party in which its leaders deny science (evolution and climate change) and pander to religious extremists who wish to define and control personal morality (abortion and same-sex marriage)?\u00a0I can understand Mr. Bryant\u2019s frustration and anger with the direction his party has taken in recent years. I, too, am frustrated and angry, but from a different perspective: I am a liberal, progressive Democrat, and I feel that my party has moved away from me toward the right. I see no simple solution for my problem, but Mr. Bryant has a clear path to a happier political stance. He could become a Democrat.I would welcome him, because even though I would disagree with him on many issues (as I already disagree with many of my Democratic colleagues), he seems to be the kind of person I could work with. Like most Democrats, Mr. Bryant values what is right for the nation more highly than what is right for the party. He seems to be ideologically moderate, fiscally responsible, pragmatic and patriotic. No wonder he feels so uncomfortable as a member of the Republican Party.The Democratic Party has become a bigger tent than I would like it to be, but in doing so, it has created a place for you, Mr. Bryant.\u00a0Thanks, Mr. Bryant, for expressing so well what I have been feeling for years.I am a staunch supporter of my local Republican Party. Sensible fiscal conservatism is ideally suited to running a small city like my hometown, Norwalk, Conn. Our Republican mayor and Republican Council ably steered the city through the mire of the Great Recession, while maintaining a AAA bond rating. But my support for Republicans almost completely disappears when considering the national party.What is perhaps the most strange to me \u2014 and telling \u2014 is that so-called \u201cliberal\u201d commentators have been making much more sense to me lately than their conservative counterparts. Sometimes I think back wistfully to the days that news of the latest pronouncement by a limousine liberal would make my blood boil. For the last several years, it has been news of the exploits of Republicans in Congress or on the election trail that is most likely to strike me as outrageous. In my view, the national Democrats just make more sense these days than the national Republicans.My social views may have placed me firmly on the \u201cliberal fringe\u201d of the Republican Party. In the past, I was comfortable there. But it is clear to me that today\u2019s national Republican Party just does not care about a fiscally conservative, gun-control-supporting, science-affirming, pro-choice Republican like me.\u00a0I, too, am an angry Republican, and a former assistant Republican floor leader of the Massachusetts House of Representatives to boot.However, in writing as if the Republican Party has done something to him, Mr. Bryant has created a Pogo moment. Look in the mirror, sir. The enemy is us. It is the Republicans like us who by their action (comfortably voting for moderate Democrats) and inaction (not donating enough time and money in primaries to counterbalance the influence of passionate ideologues on the right) have colluded with both the Tea Party and the Democratic Party to produce the current Republican Party.Speaker John A. Boehner is walking the razor\u2019s edge and almost lost his job last year because he tried to do the right thing by agreeing to compromise on the debt ceiling.Can either Mr. Bryant or I say as much?The writer teaches about leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School. \u00a0I can only hope that party leaders might heed the advice of Mr. Bryant, but I am not holding my breath. Our party has come to a juncture at which neither Barry Goldwater nor Ronald Reagan could pass the G.O.P. litmus tests.As a Republican woman, I have watched as a party that was at one time an advocate for women now hesitates on fair pay and violence against women. It also wants to eliminate the right of women to make personal decisions about their pregnancies, as well as pursuing continued attempts to shrink women\u2019s access to contraception.And then it wonders about a persistent gender gap?\u00a0As welcome as Mr. Bryant\u2019s letter is, the current state of the Republican Party can hardly be a surprise. As PBS\u2019s American Experience program \u201c1964\u201d demonstrated so well this month, the G.O.P.\u2019s transformation into a conservative party started with Barry Goldwater\u2019s campaign 50 years ago and has continued since. In the process, what the press has described as \u201cmoderate\u201d has moved increasingly right.As \u201c1964\u201d reminded us, it was Republican votes in the Senate that secured the landmark Civil Rights Act that year. Can we imagine the Roberts Court, having struck down key parts of the equally essential Voting Rights Act of 1965, upholding the traditions of Republican moderates like Edward Brooke, the first black senator since Reconstruction, or Arthur Fletcher, who as President Nixon\u2019s assistant secretary of labor helped institutionalize affirmative action?It would be great if G.O.P. leaders took up Mr. Bryant\u2019s challenge, but don\u2019t hold your breath. President Bill Clinton may be the closest thing to a representative of values embraced by moderate Republicans that we\u2019ll see for a long time.The writer was national president of the Ripon Society, a Republican research and policy organization, from 1971-72.\u00a0As a registered Republican myself, I am angered most by the intrusion of the religious right into the Republican Party. All the talk of abortion and same-sex marriage in the G.O.P. matters not a whit to many Americans struggling in this economy, and has offered a useful grenade to the Democrats in more than one election.\u00a0Amen to Mr. Bryant. The Republican Party that I grew up with and supported most of my life, the party that was strong on the environment, fiscally conservative and socially liberal, has morphed into something I don\u2019t recognize, don\u2019t like and do not support. I didn\u2019t leave it; it left me.\u00a0The Writer RespondsThoughtful responders question why I remain registered as a Republican. I am hard pressed to answer, but this does not constrain how I vote.I regret with Mr. Huey that the G.O.P. no longer has room for fiscally conservative, socially liberal \u201cRockefeller Republicans.\u201d I am drawn to Mr. Morgan\u2019s tent, where people can discuss differing views with mutual respect. The historian Daniel Boorstin observed that \u201cour national well-being is in inverse proportion to the sharpness and extent of the theoretical differences between our political parties.\u201dI prefer \u201cfiscally responsible\u201d (used by Mr. Morgan) to ideologically charged terms such as \u201cconservative\u201d or \u201cliberal.\u201d While \u201ctax-and-spend Democrats\u201d are not acting responsibly, neither are \u201clet\u2019s not tax but spend anyway\u201d Republicans. A grand bargain on spending and taxes is needed. I would willingly pay more taxes to help keep my country strong.President Nixon employed Keynesian economics to stimulate the economy out of a recession. President Reagan famously reduced taxes but, in the face of excessive deficits and debt, concluded it was fiscally responsible to partly reverse course. Pragmatism and statesmanlike compromise, not rigid adherence to ideology, enabled both presidents to successfully promote their agendas. Could they pass ideological litmus tests to win Republican primaries today?Moderates can denounce irresponsible taxation or spending while at the same time be advocates of social justice for minorities and economic justice for the 99 percent. Moderates want candidates to compete by winning people over, not by limiting access to voting for people with different views or by refining messaging to hide real policies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Libya Warns Oil Tankers Against Dealing With Militias", "Date": "2014-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 In a further escalation of tensions with the militias occupying Libya\u2019s oil facilities, Prime Minister Ali Zeidan on Wednesday threatened to sink any foreign tankers attempting to load oil supplies from seized port terminals.For nearly six months, most of Libya\u2019s oil production and exports have been obstructed by militias in the eastern region of the country that are seeking to gain autonomy from the weak central government in Tripoli. Mr. Zeidan has repeatedly threatened to send the country\u2019s nascent armed forces to dislodge the militias, but he opted to negotiate to retake control of three key export terminals with little to show for his efforts.But the war of words became more trenchant in recent days. Over the weekend, Libya\u2019s navy apparently fired warning shots near a Malta-flagged tanker that government oil officials said was trying to load at the occupied eastern port of Es Sider.On Tuesday, the leader of a self-declared regional government in the eastern Cyrenaica region openly welcomed foreign oil companies to buy oil controlled by his militias and promised that his security guards would guarantee the safety of any tankers entering his waters.Libya\u2019s economy is almost entirely driven by the oil industry, dominated by the national company working in partnership with mostly European and American companies. More than 90 percent of the government\u2019s revenues and the country\u2019s export revenues come from oil and gas, and the country has lost more than $5 billion in recent months.Mr. Jathran is a close ally of Abd-Rabbo al-Barassi, a Libyan Air Force commander who defected and is now the prime minister of the Cyrenaica regional government. He says he wants a federalist system that shares political power and oil wealth similar to the arrangement in the 1950s, before Colonel Qaddafi came to power.Palmali Shipping, owner of the Malta-flagged tanker, issued a statement saying that its ship had been fired upon in international waters and denied that the company was trying to cooperate with any group to smuggle oil.The company said it was chartered to load 80,000 barrels of crude oil, and the chartering company selected the port of Es Sider. When it became clear from Libyan authorities that the port was not officially open, the statement said, \u201cwe immediately ordered our vessel not to proceed to Es Sider and to remain in international waters.\u201dA Libyan naval ship approached the tanker on Sunday, according to the company, and ordered it to proceed to the port of Misurata \u201cunder threat of fire.\u201d Although the company promised in writing that it would not sail into Es-Sider, the Libyan vessel continued to circle the tanker \u201cthreateningly and even fired two shots in an attempt to push our vessel in the direction of Misurata.\u201dThe tanker instead sailed toward Malta, at full speed.The crisis in the east comes at a time when Mr. Zeidan is having better success negotiating with tribal and village militias in the west who have been controlling various oil fields and facilities.Libya\u2019s oil production almost fully recovered from its prewar rate of 1.6 million barrels a day in 2012, but last year it fell by more than a million barrels a day as the country became more unstable.

{"Headline": "The Submarine Race in Asia", "Date": "2014-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialMost Asian nations have been expanding their military budgets and capabilities in recent years. Now there is a new rush by Southeast Asian countries to acquire submarines because they have the money to pay for them. On Jan. 1, Vietnam received its first of six Russian Kilo-class submarines. The last one is expected to be delivered in 2016. Myanmar intends to create a submarine force by 2015. Thailand plans to include the purchase of submarines in its soon-to-be-announced 10 -year armed forces development proposal. Thai officers are already enrolled at submarine training schools in Germany and South Korea, two potential submarine suppliers. Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia have submarine fleets and plan to procure more. Malaysia paid a Franco-Spanish consortium $1.1 billion for two submarines in 2007 and 2009. Indonesia expects to replace its two aging submarines and expand its fleet to 12 with submarines from South Korea and possibly Russia by 2020. Only the Philippines, among the big nations, has not acquired new submarines yet. These countries are not arming against each other. The arms expansion is a reaction to increasing uncertainty about the distribution of power in the region, caused largely by the extension of Chinese naval power into the South China Sea and Indian Ocean. But Chinese naval expansion is not likely to be halted by these submarine fleets. China will simply augment its anti-submarine capability. Each expansion only adds to regional suspicion and tension. It is not at all clear that China would be more restrained with its aggressive claim if these nations possessed more military power. Japan\u2019s substantial military power, including an advanced submarine fleet, has not stopped China from acting on its territorial claim against Japan in the East China Sea. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations needs to act collectively to negotiate with China to prevent further destabilization, instead of each country dealing separately with China. Much of this arms competition is propelled by growing wealth in Southeast Asia, which is tied to the 21st-century global economy. These countries and China should realize that increasing their armaments can only undermine their security as well as the stability that nurtures their economies. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Ends Year as Asia\u2019s Weakest Market", "Date": "2013-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China may be the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy, but it can also lay claim to a more dubious superlative: home of the worst-performing stock market in Asia.The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index ended 2013 on a low note on Tuesday, closing at 2,115.98 points, a decline of 6.75 percent from a year earlier.The lackluster performance of China\u2019s domestic stock markets also comes in sharp contrast to the United States, where both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index have in the past year overtaken their peak levels before the financial crisis to set record highs. The Shanghai index, by contrast, is trading at slightly more than a third of its value at its 2007 peak, when it reached 6,092.06 points.Shanghai\u2019s stock market came in last place among Asian markets in 2013. Its performance was slightly worse than the 6.7 percent annual decrease in the main share index in Thailand, where street protests have been disrupting the nation\u2019s capital for weeks.The only other Asian market to see a decline for the year was Indonesia, where the main index finished down 0.98 percent from a year earlier, as investors grew concerned over lofty stock valuations amid signs of slowing growth.All other Asian indexes rose in 2013, led by Japan, where the benchmark Nikkei 225 rallied 56.7 percent for the year, its biggest annual gain since 1972. Shares were bolstered by a weaker yen and hopes for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s bold economic and monetary policies.China\u2019s market slump has taken shape over a comparatively long horizon because of a number of factors.Domestic shares are still mostly off limits to foreign investors. China\u2019s largely closed capital account means Chinese savers have few options for investing their money; property and stocks have been the traditional favorites.But since a robust rebound in 2009, China\u2019s stock markets have been stuck in a downward spiral, leaving many investors disheartened. The Shanghai index\u2019s trading volumes declined for three straight years, from 2010 to 2012.Many ordinary Chinese have instead invested their money in recent years in wealth management products. These securitized debt instruments pay much higher interest rates than bank deposits but, as loosely regulated products of the country\u2019s murky shadow banking sector, they tend to offer minimal disclosure and entail significantly greater risk.Still, moves by Chinese policy makers in the year since President Xi Jinping came to power have given investors cause for encouragement. An important plenum of the Communist Party leadership in November concluded with pledges that would represent China\u2019s most significant financial overhauls in decades.On Nov. 30, the securities regulator announced a series of new policies intended to strengthen investor protections and corporate disclosure requirements, as well as to resume share sales. China\u2019s domestic markets have not seen an initial public offering since October 2012.Chinese I.P.O.'s appear on track to resume in January. On Tuesday, five companies announced to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges that they had received approval to conduct share sales. They include the Guangdong Qtone Education Company, Guangdong Xinbao Electrical Appliances Holdings, the Neway Valve (Suzhou) Company, Truking Technology Limited and the Zhejiang Wolwo Bio-Pharmaceutical Company.All five intend to list in January, the first among a backlog of about 760 companies waiting to sell shares in China.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Hybrid Pioneer Is Back in the Hunt", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel | 2014 Honda Accord Hybrid and Plug-InYou might assume that Honda and hybrids go together like Bordeaux and a juicy steak. But despite a reputation for practical and fuel-efficient cars, Honda has largely whiffed on the hybrid front. That has to be vexing for a company that pioneered the hybrid in America, with the two-seat, podlike Insight that beat the Toyota Prius to market in 1999.The Prius has since toted up millions of sales around the world, and Toyota has basked in the green glow of hybrid glory. Honda\u2019s hybrids, in contrast, typically generate as little fanfare as they do fuel savings. The company\u2019s Integrated Motor Assist system always seemed more elegant on paper than at the pump. Among the worst offenders was the Accord V6 Hybrid of 2005-7, which managed only marginally better mileage. Now Honda returns with better technology that makes for a better hybrid, especially when fitted to the latest, acclaimed redesign of the Accord sedan. But first, a caution flag: As with many hybrids, including midsize rivals from Ford, Toyota and Hyundai, owners who expect to achieve the E.P.A.\u2019s estimate \u2014 in this case, 50 miles per gallon in town and 45 on the highway \u2014 are likely to be disappointed. Buyers in New York and California can also choose an Accord Plug-In, which can travel roughly 13 miles on electricity alone before its gasoline engine kicks in to generate the juice. Those 13 miles are achieved at a hyperefficient 115 m.p.g.e., which is the electrical equivalent of a gallon of gasoline. But the Plug-In\u2019s larger, heavier lithium-ion battery \u2014 6.7 kilowatt-hours, compared with the standard Hybrid\u2019s 1.3 kilowatt-hours \u2014 helps to knock its gasoline estimate to 47/46 m.p.g. I tested the standard Accord Hybrid and the Plug-In. Even doing my best impression of an unhurried Prius driver, I never topped 43 m.p.g. in either car, whether in city or suburb or on the open highway. My mileage consistently leveled out around 40 m.p.g., well below estimates. Your perspective, however, depends on whether you see the Accord\u2019s tank as half empty or half full: 40 m.p.g. is still to-die-for economy in a midsize sedan. It\u2019s roughly 10 m.p.g. better than a 4-cylinder Accord and 15 better than the Accord V6. Honda\u2019s system uses a 2-liter 4-cylinder engine, which runs on the fuel-saving Atkinson cycle. A pair of electric motors and a complex nest of shafts and oil pumps replace a conventional transmission. One powerful drive motor sends as much as 226 pound-feet of torque to the front wheels. As in an electric car, all the torque is on tap from 0 r.p.m., and in the Accord holds flat to 3,850 r.p.m. The other motor is actually a generator. It spins on the same shaft as the engine to convert gas power into electricity, which can either charge the battery or power the main drive motor. Like the Ford or Toyota, the Honda can drive on electricity alone for short distances, or blend electric and gasoline power. But unlike the Ford Fusion, which can brush 60 m.p.h. before its gas engine kicks in, I couldn\u2019t go faster than 35 m.p.h. without hearing the engine spring to life. But in the Honda, the 141-horsepower engine mostly runs to generate electricity, as in the Chevy Volt. The only time the engine directly propels the wheels is at highway speeds: What Honda calls \u201cdirect drive\u201d uses a clutch to bind the spinning crankshaft with the wheels through a single fixed gear \u2014 equivalent to overdrive on a conventional car. Honda\u2019s pleasing, energy-capturing brakes show the continuing evolution of hybrid brakes, which used to feel grabby, mushy or just plain weird. Applying especially strong resistance from one electric motor, the Accord\u2019s brakes deliver robust stops. A harder push of the pedal brings conventional mechanical brakes into play. The design maximizes energy recaptured as electricity. But as with the Fusion\u2019s brakes, the key transition from regenerative to mechanical braking \u2014 which occurs as you press the pedal deeper toward the floor \u2014 feels relatively natural. 13 PhotosA selectable Battery mode further bolsters energy regeneration. That\u2019s especially helpful in city or stop-and-go driving; backing off the gas pedal decelerates the car quickly, allowing the \u201cone pedal\u201d driving that E.V. fans have come to love. A useful feature of the Accord Plug-In is a Charge mode that diverts engine power to replenish the battery on the fly, which in my experience took well under 30 minutes of driving. The Plug-In recharges in three hours or so on a household plug and in about an hour with the available 240-volt home charger.By hybrid standards, the Accords drive well, though not as well as gas-only Accords. As with Toyotas, the Honda hybrid system seems to sedate its pilot, rewarding foot-off-the-gas driving.The Accord Hybrids certainly don\u2019t lack power: Between the instant-on torque and 196 total horsepower, the Honda can hum from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in a brisk 7.7 seconds.But compared with standard models, the Hybrid\u2019s steering is lighter, its suspension is softer and its grip is less certain because of fuel-saving low-friction tires. Hilly terrain especially forces annoying throttle corrections to maintain a steady speed, as the engine and motors surge and relax with repeated moans and sighs. Among the midsize contenders, the Ford Fusion remains a bit better at making you forget you\u2019re driving a hybrid. In some ways, drivers like to be reminded. The interior adds the usual hybrid gauges that help a driver achieve maximum efficiency. Outside, the Hondas display only subtle cues of their drivers\u2019 green leanings. The Plug-In, however, has awkward-looking wheels and electric-blue trim, even on the hinged plug-receptacle door: These extras aim for a futuristic vibe, but they look more like sci-fi props from \u201cLogan\u2019s Run.\u201d The Plug-In also sacrifices the most trunk space, with a mere 8.6 cubic feet, versus 12.7 for the Hybrid and a huge 15.9 for the conventional Accord. The hybrids do preserve the admirable features from the recent redesign of the Accord, which ranks at or near the top of its family-sedan class: great visibility, comfortable seats, top safety ratings and a most spacious interior.As ever, hybrid considerations often come down to the cost to buy and operate. The basic Hybrid starts at $29,945, with the EX-L version at $32,695 and the fully stuffed Touring version at $35,695. In general, figure on paying about $3,400 more than a comparable gas-only Accord. Available only with lavish trim, the Plug-In is a heady $40,570, some $6,000 more than a loaded Accord V6. But many buyers will qualify for a $3,636 federal tax break. The Energy Department figures the Accord Plug-In owner will spend $900 a year on electricity and gas to cover 15,000 miles, compared with $1,050 for the standard Hybrid. That compares with $1,700 a year in gas for a conventional 4-cylinder Accord and $1,900 for the thirstier V6.In other words, the Hybrids will save you roughly $650 to $1,000 a year in gasoline. Even if drivers can\u2019t match the official mileage ratings in the real world, these Hondas will save money at the pump. For family-sedan buyers who focus on measuring fuel costs, Honda finally has a hybrid that measures up. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deutsche Loss Underlines European Economy\u2019s Dependence on Banks", "Date": "2014-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith its surprise report of a billion-euro fourth-quarter loss, Deutsche Bank has provided another reminder that the financial crisis has never really ended for European banks \u2014 raising questions about whether the Continental economy can recover before they do.The bank announced the loss, bigger than expected and earlier than it had planned to report, on Sunday night.Anshu Jain, the co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank, argued during a conference call on Monday that, despite the loss, \u201c2014 will represent the turning point\u201d in dealing with lingering problems of the financial crisis, which include a long list of legal woes and pressure from regulators to reduce risk.If so, and if Deutsche Bank were part of a turnaround among European banks, it would be good news for the euro zone economy, which is barely growing, in part because credit is scarce.But it may be more likely that any revival of Deutsche Bank and its big competitors, like Barclays and HSBC, will be based on growth in Asia or the United States and pass Europe by, said Kern Alexander, a professor of law and finance at the University of Zurich. The midsize banks that do much of the business and consumer lending in Europe will continue to struggle, Mr. Alexander said.\u201cThe big global banks that are more multinational and more diverse are able to weather the storm,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big question is, Will the banks be able to make loans and help the economy turn the corner?\u201dDeutsche Bank, based in Frankfurt, is one of the few European banks able to compete globally with United States giants like JPMorgan Chase or Goldman Sachs. Its currency trading business is the largest in the world. As a so-called universal bank, Deutsche Bank also has a large network of consumer banking branches and lends to businesses and consumers.But investment banking, based largely in London and New York, still accounted for half of Deutsche Bank\u2019s pretax profit last year, and for much of the 965 million euro, or $1.3 billion, quarterly net loss the bank reported late Sunday. Deutsche Bank attributed the loss in part to a decline in bond trading that helped reduce revenue by 16 percent, to \u20ac6.6 billion. As investors worldwide shifted out of bonds and into booming stock markets in the last quarter, Deutsche Bank was hit particularly hard because of its focus on bonds and other fixed-income securities.The bank also booked additional losses from lawsuits and official inquiries related to suspicions of misconduct in past years, also linked primarily to the investment bank. Deutsche Bank has been accused of being part of a group of banks that colluded to manipulate benchmark interest rates. Litigation charges subtracted \u20ac528 million from profit in the fourth quarter.The Deutsche Bank loss showed how difficult it has been for European banks to keep pace with their American rivals, whose profits have increased sharply. Mr. Jain acknowledged in the conference call that the bank\u2019s greater exposure to Europe, with its barely growing economy, had been a problem.Like many banks in Europe, Deutsche Bank is also struggling with tougher regulations, which have led it to unload riskier assets and contributed to the drop in revenue. \u201cThe trends of 2013 will likely continue,\u201d Mr. Jain said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see a materially better revenue picture at this point.\u201d But he said that the company had cut costs, by simplifying its information technology systems, for example, and that the stage was set for a turnaround in 2015.The state of banks in Europe is crucial for the economy because European companies are more dependent on bank credit than American businesses. Unlike the United States, Europe lacks a vibrant market for corporate bonds issued by smaller, riskier companies.In a sign of Deutsche Bank\u2019s importance as a bellwether, the earnings report weighed on other European banks. Deutsche Bank shares fell more than 5 percent on Monday in Frankfurt, and in London, shares of Barclays slid 2 percent and HSBC was down 0.7 percent. While some of Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems are fairly limited to the bank, others are widespread among European lenders. In particular, almost all banks in Europe are struggling to meet new capital requirements being imposed by the European Union in line with guidelines established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The rules will place stricter limits on the amount of borrowed money banks may use to do business.The new rules have prompted banks to shed assets \u2014 in Deutsche Bank\u2019s case by 29 percent since the peak in 2006, to a total still valued at about \u20ac1 trillion. The pressure for banks to cut their holdings has intensified in recent months as the European Central Bank prepares for a thorough review of bank assets, with an eye to requiring banks to confront hidden problems.While the reduction in assets should make the banks less prone to crises, it also reduces revenue and profit.Signs suggest that regulators have concluded that the new rules were in danger of becoming too onerous, and contributing to a credit squeeze that is particularly acute in countries like Italy and Spain.This month, central bank chiefs and top regulators from around the world that oversee the Basel Committee endorsed changes to proposed rules that would effectively reduce the amount of banks\u2019 own money, as opposed to borrowed funds, that they use to maintain huge stockpiles of derivative securities that they issue and trade on behalf of clients.Because of its huge derivatives portfolio, Deutsche Bank was seen as a prime beneficiary of the revision by the Basel Committee, which sets benchmarks used by the United States, the European Union, Japan and most large countries.But Mr. Alexander of the University of Zurich questioned whether the revision would simply allow European banks to further postpone a reckoning with damaged assets and other problems. European regulators have been much less aggressive than United States regulators in requiring banks to clean up bad loans or soured investments, and compelling them to raise more capital.\u201cIt\u2019s an example of the Basel Committee going light-touch,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. \u201cThe question is, Will the banks make adjustments with the lighter touch? Or are they just putting off the inevitable where they will have to deal with these bad assets at some point?\u201dWith regards to Deutsche Bank, some analysts were willing to give Mr. Jain and J\u00fcrgen Fitschen, the other co-chief executive, the benefit of the doubt.\u201cDB management deserves credit for moving ahead with resolving some outstanding litigations and running ahead of schedule\u201d in reducing risk, analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note to clients Monday.In many ways, Deutsche Bank is better off than many of its European peers because of its base in Germany, where the economy is solid. Banks in countries like Spain and Italy have had to cope with soaring numbers of loans in or near default, a consequence of high unemployment and recession.One area where Deutsche Bank has not had trouble competing with American rivals is in the scale of accusations of misbehavior, in most cases dating from before the financial crisis began in 2008.Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $1.9 billion in December to settle claims that it had defrauded the government-controlled companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the sale of mortgage-backed securities before the American real estate market collapsed. In addition, the European Union antitrust authorities fined the bank \u20ac725 million for its role in helping to rig benchmark interest rates.Last week, Deutsche Bank suspended several traders amid investigations into potential manipulation of the $5-trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, according to a person briefed on the matter. The traders who were placed on leave worked in the German bank\u2019s offices in New York.Mr. Jain said on Monday that the bank had reformed the way it paid executives and begun a campaign to instill a stronger sense of ethics among employees. He said the bank was \u201cutterly committed to a culture which ensures we don\u2019t wind up with new problems.\u201d An earlier version of this article described Deutsche Bank\u2019s earnings incorrectly. The bank had a net loss, not a net profit. The article also omitted the name of J\u00fcrgen Fitschen, co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank, in a quote attributed to Anshu Jain,\u00a0co-chief executive. It was a joint statement.Chad Bray contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Keeps Interest Rates Unchanged Amid Signs of Recovery", "Date": "2014-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The Bank of England on Thursday left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low as Britain\u2019s economy sputtered toward recovery.Britain\u2019s central bank said it would keep its interest rate at 0.5 percent, where it has been since March 2009. The bank also left its bond-purchasing program unchanged, which totals 375 billion pounds, or about $617 billion, so far. The British economy continued to recover toward the end of last year and fewer people are out of work, but headwinds persist.\u201cThere\u2019s the fiscal squeeze, the weak state of the euro zone economy and the still-fragile banking system,\u201d Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics, said before the rate decision. \u201cBut there are also some powerful elements driving the recovery.\u201dRecent economic data showed that disposable incomes rose in the third quarter, a second quarterly increase in a row, according to the Office for National Statistics. The unemployment rate has been dropping faster than some economists expected and house prices are rising.Mr. Tombs said that he had raised his economic growth forecast for this year to 3 percent from 2.5 percent.But, with electricity and gas bills continuing to rise last year, many consumers are not yet feeling better off, and there are concerns about new government spending cuts. Consumer confidence fell for a third month in December, according to GfK NOP, a market research firm.The chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, said earlier this week that the government would seek an additional \u00a325 billion in spending cuts after the 2015 election, with about half of that expected to come from welfare, he said.The governor of the Bank of England, Mark J. Carney, has pledged to start considering an interest rate increase only when the unemployment rate falls to 7 percent. The rate is currently at 7.4 percent and has been dropping faster than expected over the past months. Nonetheless, some economists expect interest rates to stay at the record low until at least the end of next year.The president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, is expected to face questions about how to revive growth and reduce the risk of deflation in the 18-nation euro zone, of which Britain is not a member, at a news conference scheduled for 2.30 p.m. in Frankfurt. The E.C.B. is also to announce its monthly decision on the benchmark interest rate, which is expected to remain unchanged at 0.25 percent.The prospect of low rates in Britain, combined with government programs to spur mortgage lending, helped push house prices up by 8.4 percent last year, the biggest annual gain since 2006, according to the Nationwide Building Society. A Bank of England survey showed Wednesday that demand for mortgages rose at the fastest pace in at least six years.Even though house prices remain below their pre-crisis peak, the increase raised concerns among some economists and policy makers that the prices were inflated by government policy and could create a market bubble.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bailed-Out Bankia Is Symbol of Spain's Financial Revival", "Date": "2014-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Less than two years ago, Bankia looked like a Spanish version of Lehman Brothers: a big, troubled institution whose collapse threatened to take down a country\u2019s financial system.Only after a government takeover of Bankia, at the time one of Spain\u2019s biggest mortgage lenders, and an international bailout of the Spanish banking system did the crisis subside. But that was not before billions of euros in foreign deposits and investments fled Spain, and not before questions about the stability of the Spanish economy sent the cost of government borrowing to unsustainably high levels.Now, though, Bankia has turned from an emblem of Spain\u2019s reckless lending into a symbol of what might be the beginning of a national financial revival.Operating under new management but still state-controlled, Bankia last week returned to the bond market for the first time since 2012 and raised 1 billion euros ($1.37 billion), double its initial target. The Spanish government also held its own debt auction, oversubscribed and raising \u20ac5.3 billion.Investors bought Spain\u2019s five-year bonds at the lowest rate since the country adopted the euro currency \u2014 2.4 percent \u2014 only about a third of what they were demanding for such debt in mid-2012, when Bankia\u2019s downfall and other missteps in the Spanish sector prompted fears that Spain itself was heading for default.Bankia\u2019s return to the bond markets should be seen as \u201ca sign of being back to normality,\u201d Leopoldo Alvear, Bankia\u2019s chief financial officer, said. \u201cIt is very significant that investors have understood how we have managed to recover.\u201dThe strong demand for Spanish debt is evidence that investors, particularly those outside Spain, are not waiting to see all the elements of a recovery to decide that the country is once again worth a financial gamble. About 85 percent of Bankia\u2019s bonds were bought by foreigners \u2014 the segment of the investment community that in mid-2012 seemingly could not wait to take their money out of Spain.Foreigners are also dominating the Spanish stock market. By the end of last year, foreign investors accounted for almost 80 percent of Spanish equity transactions, according to data from the Spanish stock exchange, up from 64 percent in 2009.Publicly listed Spanish companies raised about \u20ac31 billion of equity capital last year, the highest level in Europe. With some initial public offerings also scheduled this year, that total is likely to climb to as much as \u20ac37 billion, bringing it back to levels not seen since 2006, according to a forecast by the Spanish stock exchange.The rebound is so seemingly robust that some experts warn that the underlying problems in Spain \u2014 as evident in its still disturbingly high unemployment rate of 26 percent \u2014 mean that investors should still proceed with caution.Bankia is one of five Spanish banks that sold bonds in the last week, raising a combined $5.47 billion. Foreigners are plowing not only into the banking sector, but also into the country\u2019s downtrodden real estate sector, while overseas buyers have been involved in takeovers of Spanish companies in industries like shipbuilding, packaging and meat processing.Bankia is certainly still far from a turnaround story. It remains saddled with problem loans totaling $26 billion, most of which were made before the 2008 bursting of Spain\u2019s real estate bubble and account for almost 14 percent of the bank\u2019s overall loan portfolio.Nicholas Spiro, a government-debt risk consultant based in London, noted the continuing risks. \u201cSpain is clearly flavor of the month,\u201d Mr. Spiro, the founder of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, said. \u201cBut it worries me that markets might be getting ahead of themselves.\u201d He said it was still unclear whether the Spanish economy could create enough jobs and stimulate domestic demand.Mr. Spiro suggested that international investors were returning to Spain in part because money was moving out of emerging-market countries like Turkey. Two other recovering euro zone countries, Ireland and Portugal, which conducted their own robust bond auctions last week, were benefiting from similar forces, he said.Factories in the euro zone ramped up output in November after two months of decline, according to data released on Tuesday, the latest sign that economic growth in the region might be picking up steam.For the whole European Union, production rose 1.5 percent in November from October. Both areas reported a 3 percent increase from a year earlier.\u201cThe sentiment toward emerging markets has deteriorated significantly, and Spain and other countries on the euro zone periphery are now probably the greatest beneficiaries of that,\u201d Mr. Spiro said.On Monday, when Spain\u2019s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, visited the White House for the first time, President Obama praised the country\u2019s recent economic growth, as well as efforts to clean up public finances. But Mr. Obama also highlighted the challenge that Mr. Rajoy faced to put more people back to work.And yet, there is no ignoring the many positive indicators of a comeback. With Spain\u2019s labor costs falling compared with other Western economies, for example, carmakers have earmarked a combined \u20ac5 billion of investments for their Spanish factories. Last year, Spain expanded production by about 10 percent to 2.2 million vehicles, most of which were then shipped abroad.For the optimists, the hope is that despite Spain\u2019s lingering high unemployment, the government\u2019s reduced debt costs might make Madrid more able to resume stimulating the economy \u2014 or at least reduce its reliance on growth-sapping austerity budget cuts. Last week, the Spanish Treasury said its gross debt issuance this year would amount to \u20ac242 billion, much of it to refinance existing debt under better terms.Foreign buying of sovereign debt could help Spain avoid a repeat of the kind of so-called doom loop that has been at the heart of the euro debt crisis, a vicious circle in which domestic banks and other investors ended up holding most of their own country\u2019s increasingly risky debt.And although Spain continues to suffer from a banking credit squeeze, nonlisted companies have successfully turned to bond investors for financing.\u201cHistorically, companies like ours would always tap the banks, but the conditions have recently become far more attractive in the bond markets \u2014 and not only for the very big names,\u201d said Gonzalo G\u00f3mez Navarro, chief financial officer of Empark, a privately held owner of underground parking garages car parks that last month raised \u20ac385 million in its first issue of six-year bonds, mostly sold at an interest rate of 6.75 percent.\u201cThe perception toward Spain in the financial markets is completely different from a year ago, even if there is still a long way to go in the real economy,\u201d Mr. Gom\u00e9z Navarro said.On Monday Spain\u2019s economy minister, Luis de Guindos, said that the country\u2019s economy expanded 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter, after growth of 0.1 percent in the third quarter, when Spain pulled out of a two-year recession.\u201cFor the first time since the start of the crisis, we\u2019re in a different scenario,\u201d Mr. de Guindos said.Bankia likes to think so, too.The lender returned to profit last year after receiving about half of the \u20ac41 billion of bailout money that euro zone finance ministers had authorized for Spain during a frenzied weekend conference call in June 2012.To bolster its balance sheet, Bankia also sold assets and cut its branch network by a third and its staff by a fifth.Mr. Alvear, who took over as chief financial officer as part of a May 2012 management overhaul, acknowledged that buyers at the bond sale last week were betting on a rebuilt bank whose \u201ctrack record is pretty short.\u201dBut he also argued that bankia\u2019s troubled past was \u201ca closed chapter\u201d and that investors were showing faith in Bankia\u2019s longer term prospects, noting that 60 percent of orders last week came from fund managers.\u201cThis is real money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about people who are probably not thinking of a short-term trade.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Another Modest Rise for Health Costs ", "Date": "2014-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 National health spending grew slowly for the fourth consecutive year, increasing 3.7 percent in 2012 to $2.8 trillion, the federal government said Monday. But officials disagreed over whether the Affordable Care Act or lingering effects of the recession were primarily responsible for the remarkable trend.As a share of the economy, health spending declined slightly, to 17.2 percent in 2012, from 17.3 percent in the prior year. For decades, health spending has grown faster than the economy, taking a bigger bite out of workers\u2019 wages and the federal budget.Health spending averaged about $8,900 a person in 2012, according to the annual report issued Monday by the government.The authors of the report \u2014 civil servants at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2014 said that the Affordable Care Act, adopted in March 2010, had only \u201ca minimal impact on overall national health spending growth through 2012\u201d and had not yet significantly reined in or accelerated its growth.\u201cThe relatively low rates of growth that we\u2019ve seen over the last four years are consistent with the historical trends that we\u2019ve seen when we look at health spending and gross domestic product,\u201d said Aaron C. Catlin, an economist and co-author of the report. \u201cIt\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in post-recessionary periods in the past.\u201d But the White House said the data vindicated President Obama\u2019s health care policies.\u201cThe years 2009 to 2012 saw the slowest growth in U.S. health care expenditures since the government started collecting this information in the 1960s,\u201d said Jeanne M. Lambrew, a health policy coordinator at the White House.\u201cWhile there is a debate about how much the Affordable Care Act has contributed to this health cost slowdown,\u201d Ms. Lambrew said, \u201cthere is no doubt that it reduced Medicare spending growth, and most experts believe that Medicare savings spill over into the private sector.\u201dSome experts, including the Congressional Budget Office, have reduced their projections of federal health spending, based in part on their belief that pervasive changes in the health care system would endure.\u201cFrom our perspective,\u201d they wrote, \u201cmore historical evidence is needed before concluding that we have observed a structural break in the historical relationship between the health sector and the overall economy.\u201dThe last recession, the worst in decades, ran from December 2007 to June 2009. Mr. Catlin said that delayed effects of the recession \u2014 curtailed growth of the economy, employment and personal income \u2014 appeared to be the main reason for relatively low growth of health spending in recent years.Some provisions of the new health care law increased spending and others reduced it, but the overall effects on spending were modest, said Anne B. Martin, an economist who was the principal author of the report. She estimated that the law had increased national health spending by a cumulative total of one-tenth of 1 percent from 2010 through 2012.Comparing the experience of recent years, the report said that spending on hospitals and doctors increased at a faster rate in 2012 than 2011, while spending on prescription drugs and nursing homes grew more slowly.Spending on hospital care increased 4.9 percent in 2012, to $882 billion, mainly because of a rise in prices and in the intensity and complexity of services, the report said. By contrast, the increase in 2011 was 3.5 percent.At the same time, the report said, spending for doctors\u2019 services and outpatient clinics grew by 4.6 percent in 2012, to $565 billion \u2014 up from growth of 4.1 percent in 2011.But, it said, spending for prescription drugs grew just four-tenths of 1 percent in 2012, to $263 billion, compared with an increase of 2.5 percent in 2011.\u201cThis reduced growth rate was driven largely by a slowdown in overall prices paid for retail prescription drugs as numerous brand-name blockbuster drugs \u2014 most notably Lipitor, Plavix and Singulair \u2014 lost patent protection in late 2011 and in 2012 and as generic versions became available,\u201d the report said.Almost three-fourths of all prescriptions filled in 2012 cost $10 or less per prescription, the study said. Generic drugs accounted for 77 percent of all prescriptions filled in 2012, up from about 70 percent in 2011, it said.The aging of the baby boom generation is reflected in the new data. Enrollment in Medicare increased 4 percent in 2012, the largest one-year increase in 39 years, the report said. More than half of the new beneficiaries joined Medicare Advantage plans managed by private insurers under contract with the government. More than one-fourth of the 50 million Medicare beneficiaries are now in such private plans.Spending on Medicare increased 4.8 percent, to $573 billion in 2012, while federal and state spending on Medicaid, for low-income people, grew 3.3 percent, to $421 billion, the report said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Former Exit Port for a Wave of Cubans Hopes to Attract Global Shipping", "Date": "2014-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMARIEL, Cuba \u2014 The images of desperate refugees crammed onto boats have defined this bay outside Havana for decades. About 125,000 Cubans left from here in 1980 after Fidel Castro, facing growing discontent, announced that anyone who wanted to leave should just go to Mariel and get out.But on Monday, Ra\u00fal Castro, Cuba\u2019s president, stood alongside the president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, to unveil a new Mariel: a state-of-the-art port that both leaders said would lead to a new era of commercial integration, connecting Cuba and the world.The terminal is \u201ca transcendent project for the national economy,\u201d Mr. Castro said, standing by towering container lifts adorned with Cuban flags. He added that the port and the adjacent development zone, where foreign companies will enjoy tax breaks and other advantages, \u201care a concrete example of the optimism and confidence with which we Cubans see a socialist and prosperous future.\u201dThe Mariel upgrade, at a cost of around $900 million, is the largest infrastructure project for Cuba in decades. With financing from Brazil\u2019s government, it amounts to one of the communist country\u2019s biggest bets yet on global capitalism.Analysts said it was an ambitious effort intended to establish tighter economic ties with Latin America and Asia, while preparing for the eventual end of the American trade embargo.\u201cIn the short term, it\u2019s based on the special relationship that Cuba is building with Latin America and East Asia,\u201d said Arturo Lopez-Levy, a former Cuban official who studies Cuba\u2019s economy and politics. \u201cIn the long term, they are planning for a soft landing with the United States.\u201dThe port has the capacity to handle 800,000 containers a year. Port officials said that in term of its sophistication, it was already on equal footing with Kingston in Jamaica and Freeport in the Bahamas, two of the Caribbean\u2019s busiest ports.The port, with dredging that will eventually reach depths of nearly 60 feet, will also be able to support the largest cargo ships coming through the upgraded Panama Canal.Cuban officials have said they hope Mariel will become a regional hub, with large ships docking here, breaking up their loads to efficiently deliver products across Latin America and the Caribbean. In his brief speech at the port\u2019s inauguration, Mr. Castro also argued that the port would lead to greater exports and a stronger economy.Mariel\u2019s Special Development Zone, 180 square miles of what are now grassy fields overlooking the wharf, will most likely be a major test of whether such promises can be fulfilled.For a country that has enacted limited free-market overhauls with clenched teeth, the rules in the Mariel zone are exceptional.While foreign firms elsewhere on the island can operate only as part of joint ventures with Cuba, which typically maintains a majority stake, here in the Mariel zone, they can be 100 percent foreign owned.Construction and possible factory jobs are expected to be filled by Cuban workers, but outlines of the project suggest that foreign companies will be treated to generous tax breaks and less bureaucracy than is usual in Cuba.Ms. Rousseff, the Brazilian president, making her second visit to Cuba to attend a conference of Latin American and Caribbean leaders, said Mariel\u2019s new port would benefit Cuba and the region.Praising Cuba for encouraging \u201cdialogue and cooperation,\u201d she criticized the American trade embargo and noted that with Mariel, \u201cthere are great possibilities\u201d still to be realized.Interest in the development zone is difficult to gauge, but analysts report that companies from several countries \u2014 including China, Malaysia and Angola \u2014 have expressed an interest.In a sign of Cuba\u2019s willingness to let the port stand apart from the state-run economy, Mariel will be administered by PSA International, a port operator based in Singapore. Several of the port\u2019s advisers, guiding reporters through presentations Monday, come from Europe.\u201cIt\u2019s a very substantial, very serious project,\u201d said Philip Peters, a Cuba analyst at the Lexington Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington.\u201cIt has an integrated commercial strategy attached to it: It\u2019s big in the context of the Cuban economic reforms.\u201dThe port, having changed from a launching point for rickety boats full of migrants, may also set a broader precedent. Cuban officials have said that a new foreign investment law will be unveiled in March, and there have been hints that some of the looser rules governing Mariel\u2019s development zone could be a part of the plan for at least some struggling sectors of the economy, such as agriculture.Mr. Lopez-Levy, who also works with a group of Cuban-Americans favoring engagement with Cuba, said that Cuba was hoping to mimic China by creating enough economic growth to blunt demands for political change.Though many Cuban-American leaders in Congress disagree \u2014 arguing that a hard-line stance against Cuba best serves Cuban and American interests \u2014 Mr. Lopez-Levy said that by maintaining the embargo, the United States was essentially giving Cuban officials what they wanted: the ability to exercise greater control over the pace of change.\u201cIf you let them do it in the way they want, piece by piece, they will be able to create the type of market economy they are building now,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they want is a soft landing period, and then at some point, they will be able to manage the Americans when they go in. This is all part of their design.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Crisis, Greeks Work to Promote \u2018Social\u2019 Economy", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALONIA, Greece \u2014 The feisty owner of a small family business that makes detergents has never had time for anticapitalist firebrands. So he was suspicious and skeptical when he was approached by left-leaning activists campaigning to purge \u201cprofiteers\u201d from the market.But, struggling to keep his business afloat under the weight of unpaid invoices and constant demands for bribes, the owner, Savvas Mavromatis, decided to give their proposal a shot. He started selling his products directly to consumers for cash at fixed prices through a nonprofit collective, instead of to shops and traders as he had always done.Fourteen months later, he credits the group with saving his enterprise from a Greek economic meltdown that rivals the Great Depression.\u201cWe are in the middle of a terrible crisis and are just looking for solutions,\u201d said Elias Tsolakidis, the driving force behind the so-called no-middlemen movement here in northern Greece, a small, quixotic but surprisingly successful effort to redefine the terms of commerce. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a magic wand. We are not communists and we are not capitalists, but we are trying to help people survive.\u201dIn their search for solutions, Greeks are tinkering with a new kind of economy with little precedent in modern Europe. The collapse of the Greek economy is challenging not only the survival of Greeks, but also some of the basic mechanisms of capitalism in a nation where the economy has shrunk by about 25 percent since 2008.In the view of widening numbers here, Greece\u2019s market-driven system has broken down, a victim of endemic corruption, budgetary mismanagement by the state and the overbearing demands of global financial markets.In response, experimental ventures like the one Mr. Mavromatis joined have sprung up on the margins in towns and cities across Greece. While they may not offer a long-term solution, and are too small to alter the overall shape of the economy, they represent a bottom-up effort to address an economic crisis whose closest antecedent may be the aftermath of World War II.But Syriza, like many other left-wing parties across Europe, has had a hard time matching fiery criticism of \u201cneo-liberal\u201d economics with concrete actions to ease economic pain, including 27 percent unemployment. It has focused mostly on denouncing job cuts, particularly in the bloated public sector, and attacking austerity measures imposed by Greece\u2019s international creditors in return for $328 billion in bailouts.As the left remains deeply committed to much of the status quo, the task of answering calls for a new economic order and bringing some relief to Greece\u2019s misery has fallen to people like Mr. Tsolakidis, who organizes the ranks of the no-middlemen movement in his region through a local nonprofit collective called the Voluntary Action Group of Pieria.The movement seeks to cut out wholesalers, shop managers, state bureaucrats or anyone else between producers and consumers who once took a share of profits and added to the costs of goods. Instead, Mr. Tsolakidis\u2019s group runs a website where orders are placed in advance and then distributed at markets to customers for a fixed price paid in cash.His group takes a small cut to cover expenses, but it does not pay salaries to its members, more than 3,500 volunteers who have jobs or are unemployed. It is a small link in a long chain of ventures seeking to create a parallel \u201csocial\u201d economy, starting with what became known as the \u201cpotato revolution,\u201d a now nationwide movement that has slashed the price of potatoes by getting farmers to sell directly to customers.In addition to its regular no-middlemen markets, held in parking lots across the region, the Voluntary Action Group operates a free health clinic staffed by volunteer doctors and a pharmacy stocked with donated drugs.Christos Kalaitzis, 53, a convert to the cause who grows kiwis, olives and chickpeas with his wife on their farm near Mount Olympus, acknowledged that he, too, had initially been skeptical but had gotten so fed up with not being paid by big wholesalers and exporters that went bust after taking his products that he had taken the chance.\u201cThe goal is not to destroy the old market system but just to slow it down and get it to change,\u201d Mr. Kalaitzis explained. \u201cMaybe this is a bit romantic, but why should I sell to big companies if their checks bounce? If the free market in Greece worked properly, none of this would be necessary.\u201dBy cutting out marketplace middlemen and avoiding appeals to the state for help \u2014 the customary approach of many Greek leftists \u2014 the activists hope to address, they say, the passive despair felt by many Greeks, who may need a generation or more to climb out of their economic hole.\u201cThis is a whole new concept for Greece,\u201d said Fiori Zafeiropoulou, an expert on ways to mix social goals and business initiatives who advised officials drafting a new law that gives legal status to \u201csocial cooperative enterprises,\u201d entities that combine both business interests and social benefits. Unlike left-leaning activists, however, she does not want to upend market forces, only to make them better serve the underprivileged.Progress, she said, has often been slow because \u201cin Greece there is a problem, and the problem is called corruption\u201d \u2014 what she defined as a whole culture that revolves around getting favors from the state, as well as demanding bribes and kickbacks.Mr. Mavromatis, the detergent maker, said the purchasing managers at supermarkets, whether owned by Greeks or foreigners, all demanded bribes just to agree to a meeting so he could present his products. They also asked for money to ensure good display for his goods, he said. The price varied depending on which shelf he wanted his detergent placed on, with the shelf near the floor costing less. On average he paid about $1,300 a transaction, plus gifts at Christmas and other holidays.He said that when he started selling through the no-middlemen group, \u201cI had been dealing with supermarkets for so long I kept waiting for them to ask for money under the table. But nobody ever asked, and I have not paid anything.\u201d\u201cI could not understand why they were doing all this for free,\u201d Mr. Mavromatis, 46, added. \u201cI was very suspicious and kept thinking: \u2018Where is the catch?\u2019\u00a0\u201dHe said he believed in the free market, but not in Greece, where it is distorted by corruption at every level, public and private.Mr. Mavromatis said he had invested about $680,000 to upgrade his production line on a promise from the government that he would be partly reimbursed from \u201ccohesion funds\u201d provided to Greece from the European Union. But the government, he said, diverted the money earmarked for business development to pay for relief work after a series of forest fires. He said that the government still owed him about $273,000, but that he does not expect it any time soon, if ever.On top of that, he is owed $404,000 from shops and other buyers who purchased his detergents and paid for them with bad checks. \u201cIn the beginning, I went to court to sue them, but they had no money,\u201d he said, opening a ledger stuffed with worthless checks.Today Mr. Mavromatis is a regular at the no-middlemen markets. While he said he got a slightly lower price than before, he no longer has to worry about paying bribes or getting checks that bounce. Struggling families, meanwhile, get to buy household detergent, fruit and a host of other goods at a fraction of the normal market price.Flush with cash for the first time since Greece\u2019s economy went into a nose dive in 2008, Mr. Mavromatis recently bought a new Mercedes-Benz truck to transport his detergents from his factory in a village near the town of Katerini, the regional capital, and has expanded his product line to include toilet paper.Even after six straight years of recession, he said, \u201cpeople need to wash clothes, do their dishes and go to the bathroom.\u201dDimitris Bounias contributed reporting from Athens.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Envoy to Visit Sri Lanka as Pressure Builds for War Crimes Inquiry", "Date": "2014-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 A top State Department official is expected to arrive in Sri Lanka on Friday, just three days after the United States announced that it would again seek a resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Council pressing for an investigation into allegations of war crimes in Sri Lanka.Nisha Biswal, the assistant secretary of state for Central and South Asian affairs, is expected to meet with government officials, members of the opposition and others in Colombo, the capital. She is also expected to travel to Jaffna, a city in the heart of the Tamil-dominated Northern Province of Sri Lanka.The visit comes as relations between the United States and Sri Lanka have become increasingly frosty, largely because, nearly five years after the end of a nearly 30-year civil war in which government forces battled the Tamil Tigers \u2014 a notoriously brutal insurgent group \u2014 the Sri Lankan government has shown little appetite for any robust investigation into possible war crimes.Keheliya Rambukwella, a government spokesman, said in a phone interview that Ms. Biswal\u2019s visit was an opportunity for the United States to \u201csee firsthand the progress Sri Lanka has made in its reconciliation efforts.\u201dTwo resolutions pressing the Sri Lankan government to investigate war crimes have already been passed by the Human Rights Council, but this time the United States may ask that an independent international investigation be conducted, one that does not depend on the government, human rights advocates said.Ananthi Sasitharan, a member of the council, said she was eager to meet with Ms. Biswal during her visit to Jaffna. Ms. Sasitharan said the council\u2019s support of an international investigation reflected the demands of its constituents.\u201cWe want to present our case\u201d to Ms. Biswal, Ms. Sasitharan said in an interview. \u201cHer visit to Jaffna will be greatly welcomed.\u201dVideos and pictures of what appear to be executions of civilians have leaked out of Sri Lanka in recent years, adding to a mountain of evidence suggesting that the Sri Lankan government killed 40,000 people, many of them civilians, in the war\u2019s final stages in 2009.Lalith Weeratunga, the permanent secretary to the Sri Lankan president, is in Washington this week to lobby against a further resolution from the Human Rights Council. Mr. Weeratunga said Wednesday that the government needed several more years before any international investigation into suspected war crimes could be started.\u201cAfter 26 years of conflict, we want to make it a sustainable peace,\u201d he said, according to local news media reports.Mr. Weeratunga said that if Sri Lanka were forced into undertaking such an investigation, the government would extend the inquiry back to the 1980s, when India conducted military operations in the country. Indian peacekeeping troops have been accused by some human rights groups of committing abuses during operations against the Tamil Tigers, who refused to lay down arms after an Indian-mediated peace pact. Revisiting such allegations \u201cwill upset our relationship with India,\u201d Mr. Weeratunga was quoted as saying in the reports.Alan Keenan, a senior analyst at the nonprofit International Crisis Group, said India\u2019s support for a resolution calling for an international investigation could be crucial.\u201cThe U.S., Britain and others have come to a conclusion that for the truth to be established, it needs to be done by an outside body,\u201d Mr. Keenan said.The end of the insurgency has been a boon for Sri Lanka\u2019s economy as well as the political fortunes of the dominant Rajapaksa family. Roads have been rebuilt, tourists have returned, and the pervading sense of unease that gripped the country for decades has largely evaporated.President Mahinda Rajapaksa is popular in Sri Lanka because of this turnaround, but an independent investigation of conduct during the war would be terribly risky for him, said Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, the executive director of the Center for Policy Alternatives, a public policy research group in Colombo.\u201cThere is no way he can allow an investigation because an international probe that asks chain-of-command type of questions will lead directly to the Rajapaksas themselves,\u201d Mr. Saravanamuttu said in an interview. \u201cLiterally and figuratively, President Rajapaksa must live and die in power.\u201dWhether the country\u2019s restive north will remain peaceful without further reconciliation efforts is a crucial question. The army continues to occupy thousands of homes and administer its own farms, factories and resorts on appropriated land, for which the government has paid little or no compensation.Thousands are still missing. S. Illanagai, a mother of two, is still looking for her husband, who was forcibly conscripted by the Tamil Tigers and who surrendered to government troops at the end of the war. \u201cSince then we have not seen or heard from him, and I came to Colombo hoping that the authorities here would give me a clearer answer,\u201d she said Thursday. \u201cThey claim to have no information on his whereabouts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Poor Get Washed Away", "Date": "2014-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsWHEN Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines in November, killing more than 6,000 people and leaving more than four million homeless, one group was particularly hard hit: the landless poor. More than a thousand of the dead lived in a single squatter camp.While natural disasters may seem like equal-opportunity destroyers, they are not.The developing world\u2019s landless poor routinely bear the brunt of these disasters. Families without secure rights to land (and that is a majority of rural residents in many developing countries) often remain in their homes when it is dangerous to do so, fearing they won\u2019t be allowed to return. And without the security of ownership and access to collateral, their homes are often not built to withstand earthquakes, typhoons and other disasters.This has profound consequences that extend far beyond the squatter camps and plantations with their legions of impoverished laborers. Landlessness and the lack of secure property rights among the poor not only hurt a country\u2019s resiliency and slow post-disaster recovery. Those inequities also hold back economic development, perpetuate poverty and fan social tensions. Fixing this problem is not easy. But many countries, including South Korea, Vietnam and Rwanda, have reformed their laws and institutions to provide the rural poor with enforceable rights to the lands they live on and farm.Those success stories are important because the vulnerability of the world\u2019s landless \u2014 squatters, indigenous people, farm laborers and tenant farmers \u2014 cannot be overstated.Consider the case of the cyclone that struck the Indian state of Orissa in 1999, killing an estimated 10,000 people. One-third of the dead were poor fishermen and their families who refused to evacuate their coastal villages, believing it was a ploy to evict them from the government land where they had built their huts. Those communities were washed away. Fears of displacement by government officials and developers are not unfounded. In the Philippine city of Tacloban, which was ravaged by Typhoon Haiyan, government officials are considering buying a six-acre parcel that was a squatter camp and preventing reconstruction. This is just one of many reported cases of efforts to seize valuable land vacated by occupants who fled Haiyan and lacked legal title.Likewise, consider the situation in Haiti. Almost four years after a powerful earthquake struck the island nation, more than 100,000 people, the majority of them poor and landless, remain in tents or other temporary shelters, and many others have moved in with relatives.A key factor hampering rebuilding efforts is the lack of secure land rights among the displaced. A 2012 report by the London-based Overseas Development Institute described a \u201cchaotic\u201d and \u201calmost Kafka-esque\u201d land tenure system in Haiti in which \u201cit is almost impossible to know definitely who owns what.\u201d Time and again, those who have the least lose the most. But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.In the Indonesian province of Aceh, devastated by a tsunami in 2004, the government relief effort initially fell short. Displaced renters and squatters received only small cash payments to buy building materials or to pay rent, while landowners received new homes. Years later, tens of thousands of squatters and renters were still living in squalor in temporary barracks. Protests ensued, and government officials agreed to provide them with new homes built either at the sites of their old homes or in new locations \u2014 all with secure title to the land.Aceh has since made a remarkable recovery. The region is at peace, the economy is growing, life expectancy is increasing and poverty is falling. While providing the poor with secure land rights was not solely responsible for the progress, the recovery could not have been achieved until the fundamental issue of land rights was addressed. The recent disaster in the Philippines could provide the opportunity for the country to sweep away the biggest roadblock to growth and stability there \u2014 the widespread lack of landownership among the poor.The international community should seize this moment, as aid continues to pour in, to press for enforcement of the country\u2019s long-ignored land tenure reform laws. These laws call for government distribution to the poor of large swaths of public land, and for purchase and distribution of certain private land (including idle or abandoned property and bankrupt plantations). The landowning elite has resisted these reforms, but implementing them will help the country and its landless poor recover and prosper.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Capitalism vs. Democracy", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI am hesitant to call Thomas Piketty\u2019s new book Capital in the 21st Century one of the best books in economics written in the past several decades. Not that I do not believe it is, but I am careful because of the inflation of positive book reviews and because contemporaries are often poor judges of what may ultimately prove to be influential. With these two caveats, let me state that we are in the presence of one of the watershed books in economic thinking.\u201dThere are a number of key arguments in Piketty\u2019s book. One is that the six-decade period of growing equality in western nations \u2013 starting roughly with the onset of World War I and extending into the early 1970s \u2013 was unique and highly unlikely to be repeated. That period, Piketty suggests, represented an exception to the more deeply rooted pattern of growing inequality.According to Piketty, those halcyon six decades were the result of two world wars and the Great Depression. The owners of capital \u2013 those at the top of the pyramid of wealth and income \u2013 absorbed a series of devastating blows. These included the loss of credibility and authority as markets crashed; physical destruction of capital throughout Europe in both World War I and World War II; the raising of tax rates, especially on high incomes, to finance the wars; high rates of inflation that eroded the assets of creditors; the nationalization of major industries in both England and France; and the appropriation of industries and property in post-colonial countries.The six decades between 1914 and 1973 stand out from the past and future, according to Piketty, because the rate of economic growth exceeded the after-tax rate of return on capital. Since then, the rate of growth of the economy has declined, while the return on capital is rising to its pre-World War I levels.The only way to halt this process, he argues, is to impose a global progressive tax on wealth \u2013 global in order to prevent (among other things) the transfer of assets to countries without such levies. A global tax, in this scheme, would restrict the concentration of wealth and limit the income flowing to capital.Piketty would impose an annual graduated tax on stocks and bonds, property and other assets that are customarily not taxed until they are sold. He leaves open the rate and formula for distributing revenues.Piketty\u2019s wealth tax solution runs directly counter to the principles of contemporary American conservatives who advocate antithetical public policies: cutting top rates and eliminating the estate tax. It would also run counter to the interests of those countries that have purposefully legislated low tax rates in order to attract investment. The very infeasibility of establishing a global wealth tax serves to reinforce Piketty\u2019s argument concerning the inevitability of increasing inequality.Some liberals are none too happy with Piketty, either.\u201cIs it really implausible that we would ever see any sort of tax on finance in the U.S., either the financial transactions tax that I would favor or the financial activities tax advocated by the I.M.F.?\u201dBaker also noted that \u201cmuch of our capital is tied up in intellectual property\u201d and that reform of patent laws could serve both to limit the value of drug and other patents and simultaneously lower consumer costs.\u201cWe\u2019d take the perspective that this phenomenon is related to the suppression of wage growth so that policies which generate broad-based wage growth are an antidote. The political economy is such that the political power to enact those taxes also requires a mobilized citizenry and institutional power, such as a robust labor movement.\u201d\u201cPart of his interpretation I do not share. Piketty argues that there is a natural tendency for high inequality in \u2018capitalist\u2019 economies (the term capitalist is not my favorite) and that certain unusual events (world wars, the Great Depression and policy responses thereto) temporarily reduced inequality. Then both earnings inequality and inequality between capital and labor have been reverting back to their \u2018normal\u2019 levels. I don\u2019t think that the data allow us to reach this conclusion. All we see is this pattern of fall and rise, but so many other things are going on. It is consistent with what Piketty says, but it is also consistent with certain technological changes and discontinuities (or globalization) having created a surge in inequality which will then stabilize or even reverse in the next several decades. It is also consistent with the dynamics of political power changing and this being a major contributor to the rise in inequality in advanced economies. We may be seeing parts of several different trends underpinned by several different major shocks rather than the mean-reverting dynamics following the shocks that Piketty singles out.\u201dThere is, however, significant liberal applause for Piketty.\u201cI am in 100 percent agreement with Piketty and would add that much of labor inequality comes because high earners got paid through stock options and capital ownership.\u201d\u201cThe way forward is to reform the structure of American business so that workers can supplement their wages with significant capital ownership stakes and meaningful capital income and profit shares.\u201dIn other words, let\u2019s turn everyone into a capitalist.Piketty does not treat worker ownership as a solution, and he is generally dismissive of small-bore reforms, arguing that they will have only modest effects on economic growth worldwide, which he believes is very likely to be stuck at 1 to 1.5 percent through the rest of this century.His prognosis is extremely bleak. Without what he acknowledges is a politically unrealistic global wealth tax, he sees the United States and the developed world on a path toward a degree of inequality that will reach levels likely to cause severe social disruption.Final judgment on Piketty\u2019s work will come with time \u2013 a problem in and of itself, because if he is right, inequality will worsen, making it all the more difficult to take preemptive action.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I May Be 50, but Don\u2019t Call Me a Boomer", "Date": "2014-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is no baby boom generation.Oh, sure, there was a baby boom: a neatly defined, pig-in-the-python bulge from 1946 to 1964. But the kind of broadly shared cultural experiences that could bind together people across that whole span? That just didn\u2019t happen.The end of the war in Vietnam makes for one especially sharp dividing line: In 1973, the cease-fire was signed, United States forces withdrew, and the last American draftees were inducted.If you were an early boomer, even if you were not drafted or shipped to Vietnam, you had friends, classmates or relatives who were. The fathers you knew had served in World War II, and probably thought their sons should answer the call, too. The war was a raw, central presence in young people\u2019s lives, and in the nation\u2019s cultural and political battles.People raised in the immediate postwar years had more faith in their government, and an idealistic view of America that curdled in the \u203260s and \u203270s. My childhood memories of the evening news, on the other hand, include the war, protests, Watergate and the dour faces of Johnson and Nixon, not the grins of Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy.In this way, I think we late boomers have more in common with the jaded Generation X that followed: we had less idealism to spoil. No, I don\u2019t remember where I was when Kennedy was killed and innocence died (I was an infant), but I sure remember where I was when Nixon resigned and cynicism reigned. Older boomers may have wanted to change the world; most of my peers just wanted to change the channel.Another line between the eras runs through the bedroom. It\u2019s not that premarital sex, casual sex and even anonymous sex, were unknown in earlier times. But when early boomers were teenagers in the back seats of their cars, it was understood that sex was dangerous.Then came the birth control pill (first marketed in 1961, but because of various state laws, not universally accessible until 1972) and legal abortion (Roe v. Wade was in 1973). They helped create a window of time, 10 to 15 years, when, for the first time, people could convince themselves (and many did) that there could be sex without consequences.AIDS slammed that window shut in the 1980s, but it was in that opening that late boomers reached adolescence and early adulthood, developed their sexual attitudes and embarked on their sex lives. People my age took for granted the sexual freedom that had been revolutionary to older boomers. .But if sex got easy, then marriage, it seemed, got hard. More babies were born to single mothers, and between the late 1950s and the late \u203270s, the divorce rate tripled. Compared with early boomers, my cohort was a lot more likely to grow up with only one parent around.If you were born in the late \u203240s, you probably didn\u2019t know anybody who had tried illegal drugs while you were in high school, maybe not even into your 20s. If you tried anything yourself, it probably felt like a big deal, a transgression or even a statement. If you were a little younger, from the middle of the boom, you were more likely to know drug users, but it was still a dividing line, a kind of \u201cus-and-them\u201d marker.Then the floodgates opened, once again, in the 1970s. When the Gallup organization asked about marijuana use in 1969, 8 percent of adults under 30 admitted to having tried it. A mere eight years later, it was 56 percent. We late boomers, going to high school in the \u203270s, knew plenty of people who had tried drugs when we were in high school, including teachers and parents, and we knew many more in college. To a lot of us, marijuana never seemed like a very big deal.Macroeconomics form another dividing line, also in the early \u203270s. By then, nearly all of the first-half boomers had finished school and started their working lives. They had lived through a period of historic economic growth, when it seemed a rising tide really did lift all boats.People just a few years younger grew up with that kind of prosperity, but it evaporated when they reached the age to seize it. From 1973 to 1982, the United States suffered through three recessions, two energy crises, inflation and high unemployment \u2014 a disillusioning time to establish a career.Things were different still for those of us at the tail end of the boom. We grew up with the pessimism of that era, but we entered the work force during the \u201880s boom, when the tide lifted many boats but not others.The boomer generation also straddles a revolution in the roles of women, with the first half more likely to fight past old assumptions, and the second more likely to reap the gains. When early boomers were children and young adults, American women were far less likely than men to go to college or hold jobs. The gaps narrowed slowly for decades, but here again, an inflection point came in the early \u203270s, when women\u2019s numbers began to soar.In 1970, women were 41 percent of college students; by 1979, they were a majority. In 1972, 51 percent of American women ages 25 to 54 were in the work force; by 1989, the figure was 74 percent.In pop culture, there\u2019s just no parallel in the amount of political content, darkness and skepticism we grew up with. First-half boomers got all of those things, but later in life, and they were new and challenging; for us, they were part of the landscape. The early boomers were born into a world without rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, swearing in the media or even much in the way of really harsh satire. A lot of us late boomers can\u2019t remember a time before the British Invasion, Hunter S. Thompson and George Carlin.The gap between the two halves of the baby boom might be best summed up by some of the staples of radio and TV when we were kids. The classic boomers had \u201cMr. Sandman\u201d and \u201cLeave It to Beaver.\u201d We rebooted boomers? \u201cSympathy for the Devil\u201d and \u201cAll in the Family.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine\u2019s Uncertainties Include Financial Aid", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 As Ukraine\u2019s political crisis has deepened, an economic question looms: Will Russia continue to bail out the country if it again tilts to the West?But that political victory might quickly turn into an economic crisis. Even if Ukraine once again looks westward, there is no financial package ready to replace the Russian aid the Kremlin began offering in December. Without foreign assistance, Ukraine is all but certain to either default on its debt or devalue its currency.Russia in December provided $3 billion of a total aid package of $15 billion. It is scheduled to disburse an additional $2 billion by Friday.By the end of the week, it will become clear whether Russia will follow through with the second strand of the financial lifeline to the government of President Viktor F. Yanukovych, despite his decision to open reconciliation talks with the pro-Western opposition and his loss of control over regional governments. The resignation Tuesday of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov, who had been a staunch ally of Mr. Yanukovych, adds to the uncertainties.In response to a written query, the Russian Ministry of Finance\u2019s news service declined to comment on its intentions.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Russians decide to delay, at least pending the outcome of negotiations,\u201d Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at Otkritie Financial Corporation in Moscow, said by telephone.\u201cWhen you buy government bonds, you want to be sure you are buying the bonds of a government you have friendly relations with,\u201d he said of the Russian aid, which has been structured as purchases of Ukrainian bonds at below-market rates. \u201cIt would be amazing if the Russians decided to put money on the table now, given all that is going on.\u201dOpposition activists wearing ski masks last week occupied the main Ministry of Agriculture building and briefly took over the main Ministry of Justice building before retreating, but only because the ministry said that the occupation was interfering with negotiations over changing the constitution to weaken the power of the president.The Ukrainian Ministry of Finance issued a statement on Monday saying that it was preparing to issue the bonds as scheduled, but gave no indication whether the Russians had promised to purchase them as agreed. Ukraine is burdened with large budget and current-account deficits and the central bank is quickly depleting its gold and foreign currency reserves.Ukraine\u2019s recessionary economy has hung as a grim backdrop to the recent street protests. The country\u2019s 2014 budget, approved by a show of hands in Parliament this month as the opposition blocked the electronic voting system, includes a deficit equivalent to 4.3 percent of gross domestic product.The Russian money and a reduction in natural gas prices charged by the Russian company Gazprom are subsidizing that spending gap and propping up the national currency, the hryvnia, and staving off default on the government\u2019s debt.In light of the recent violence here, pressure resumed this week on the hryvnia, which the market now values at far less than the central bank\u2019s declared rate of 8 to the United States dollar; it was trading on the Ukrainian interbank market at 8.7 to the dollar early this week, but had not gone into free fall.\u201cAnybody looking around and seeing what is going on in the streets could decide to sell hryvnia and buy dollars,\u201d Ivan Tchakarov, the chief economist at Citibank covering former Soviet states, said of the risk of panic-selling of the national currency, a problem that is not unheard-of in the region.In Kiev on Tuesday, customers went from bank to bank, looking for scarce dollars. A teller at a branch of UniCredit said the bank was selling only dollars that had been sold to the bank earlier in the day by other customers and at times had only a few hundred dollars in cash on hand. UniCredit closed four branches in Kiev last Wednesday because of the street violence.The Ukrainian stock market, not surprisingly, has taken a downward turn. The Ukraine Exchange index has fallen more than 70 percent in the last three years, and 8.9 percent of that decline came in the last week, as violence gripped the capital.Mr. Azarov\u2019s government, which will continue working in an acting capacity after his resignation Tuesday, had been striving to pass as much of the Russian money on to public sector workers and pensioners as quickly as possible, to soothe tempers, in spite of the dysfunction of the largely paralyzed government.In the 2014 budget, the minimum monthly wage went up 6 percent to 971 hryvnia ($114) and the personal income tax was lowered by a percentage point, to 17 percent. Those measures were possible only because of the Russian aid, Mr. Tchakarov of Citibank said.As Ukraine\u2019s political crisis remained unsettled at the time of the Russian deal, the Russians had taken precautions, lest they end up financing a pro-Western government: The bond purchases come in multiple installments and the natural gas contract with Gazprom is subject to quarterly review.Over the weekend, Mr. Yanukovych offered to dismiss the cabinet and install two opposition leaders in senior positions, along with other concessions. But the protesters rebuffed the proposal, and the prime minister\u2019s resignation, as insufficient. Negotiations are continuing.In an interview in December, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, the leader of the Fatherland Party who was offered but declined the position of prime minister, said Western ambassadors had offered assurances that the International Monetary Fund would move quickly on aid if Ukraine signed a trade deal with the European Union. But no such agreement is in place now.Officials of the International Monetary Fund, in Washington, did not immediately reply on Tuesday to a request for comment. The \u201cauthorities have yet to clarify their intentions regarding discussions on a possible fund-supported program,\u201d William Murray, an I.M.F. spokesman, said at a news briefing last week. \u201cWe, as an institution, remain ready to work with the Ukrainians on a plan once it\u2019s brought to us.\u201dA Polish member of the European Parliament, Pawel Kowal, published an article Monday in the newspaper Rzeczpospolita calling for something like a Marshall Plan of immediate Western aid for Ukraine, should the protest leaders succeed in gaining power.Mass protests continued to spread across the country, including new attempts to seize regional administration buildings in eastern and southern Ukraine, areas that are typically strongholds of support for Mr. Yanukovych and his pro-Russian policies.Its unpopularity with the protesters aside, the Russian aid has effectively stabilized the bond market.Bond yields, a measure of the government\u2019s cost of borrowing, had risen above 10.5 percent in the autumn. But they fell to 7.8 percent after the Russian aid was announced. Even that would not be a sustainable cost for Ukraine to bear in the long term. But it was a boon to investors including Franklin Templeton, the California-based money management giant that is one of the largest underwriters of the Ukrainian government. At one point the firm owned about a fifth of the outstanding bonds, with a face value of $5 billion. Franklin Templeton has declined to comment on its position in Ukraine.As the protests radicalized over the last week, with demonstrators burning tires and throwing Molotov cocktails at the police, the yield rose again to 9.2 percent Tuesday \u2014 still below the 10.5 percent peak rate investors had demanded before the announcement of the Russian deal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Global Warming", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistNordhaus is arguably the world\u2019s leading thinker on the economics of global warming. A Yale professor and president of the American Economic Association, he brings unassailable credibility to the central message of his new book: Climate change is an urgent economic issue with impacts that bear spiraling costs.Nordhaus has been making this point to economists for years, but with this book he aims to reach general readers. He gets about halfway there. \u201cThe Climate Casino\u201d reads like a highly engaging college textbook. Nordhaus\u2019s tone is conversational, and his analyses are packed with helpful metaphors, but too many passages bog down in technical jargon. Still, for readers willing to wade through some wonkery, there are rewards.Dollar figures, for example: Nordhaus estimates that over the 21st century, the cost of American hurricane damages will more than double, at a price of about $12 billion a year. He also calculates how much it will cost to effectively tax away carbon pollution \u2014 and acknowledges how that tax will raise the price of almost all economic activity.But his conclusion is clear: Acting to stop climate change costs money. Ignoring the problem costs more \u2014 a lot more. Ultimately, this message, delivered by a number-crunching economist rather than a morally outraged environmentalist, may prove far more effective in making the case for action.When temperatures rise, diseases thrive. Marsa, a contributing editor at Discover magazine, warns that global warming is ushering in a new era of medical crises for which we\u2019re ill-prepared. Thanks to hotter weather, tropical diseases like dengue fever and West Nile virus are resurgent in the Western Hemisphere. The deadly rodent-borne hantavirus is traveling north. Drought-driven dust storms are spreading a respiratory sickness caused by the inhalation of fungal meningitis spores.Crammed with statistics, interviews and gruesome but fun facts, \u201cFevered\u201d make its case with plenty of hard evidence. And it is, at least initially, gripping to read. The early chapters unfold like medical detective stories.But the latter half lags. The reader suffers from medical-description overload, and the policy solutions are a mixed bag. While sipping a latte on the High Line, the Manhattan park built on elevated train tracks, Marsa proposes the promotion of pedestrian-friendly cities with community gardens, which ignores the root cause of climate change: a global economy driven by oil and coal-fired power plants.More realistically, she suggests \u201ca medical Marshall Plan,\u201d designed to make the nation\u2019s public-health infrastructure more resilient to the wave of challenges to come. It\u2019s a good idea \u2014 though unlikely soon to find support in today\u2019s gridlocked, cash-depleted Washington.Mountain glaciers are among the most sensitive barometers of the planet\u2019s changing climate.

Once they\u2019re gone, a crucial water source will disappear \u2014 and no one yet knows how it will be replaced.White spent five years among the vast glaciers of the Rocky Mountains, chronicling the work of the government scientist Daniel Fagre, who made headlines by projecting that Glacier National Park, once home to 150 glaciers, would be ice-free by 2020.\u201cThe Melting World\u201d takes readers to the glacial peaks with Fagre and his team. In order to measure the glaciers\u2019 retreat, the researchers navigate deadly crevasses, repair complicated monitoring tools in howling winds, dig deep holes in packed snow and evade grizzly bears and potential avalanches. They use GPS equipment, radar and cameras \u2014 anything that can help them most accurately document the decline of the ice. The stakes are high. They know their research will be challenged by the skeptics in Washington and industry who question the science of climate change.The book would have benefited from a tighter edit \u2014 there are altogether too many descriptions of stunning vistas and flowering meadows. Despite that, a moving story emerges. It\u2019s a fascinating outdoor adventure, an illuminating look into the science of measuring a melting mountain \u2014 and a fresh warning that the warming world is already here.Too many writers attempt the high-wire act of transcendental nature writing and fall instead into self-indulgence or environmental screeds. MacKinnon succeeds admirably, with a graceful volume reminiscent of Annie Dillard\u2019s classic \u201cTeaching a Stone to Talk.\u201d It\u2019s a beautifully written meditation on natural history and memory, full of new revelations about familiar landscapes and species.MacKinnon\u2019s book is, in part, a detailed account of how animals have shaped the planet in unexpected ways \u2014 how, for example, elephant and buffalo trails might have paved some of the first roads for humans, and allowed us to migrate so quickly. And he illustrates how tiny changes wrought by humans have yielded ripple effects across the centuries, dramatically transforming landscapes we still think of as entirely natural.Ultimately, however, his subject is extinction. We live on a planet populated by just a fraction of the animals that a few centuries ago teemed across its surface. \u201cNature is not a temple, but a ruin. A beautiful ruin, but a ruin all the same,\u201d he writes.He acknowledges that humans can probably continue to live for a long time in what he calls an increasingly \u201csimplified\u201d world \u2014 but he is blunt about where that means we\u2019re going. \u201cWe may be able to ride the current wave of extinction, but we do know we can\u2019t ride it all the way down.\u201dCoral Davenport covers energy and environmental policy at The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As the Working Poor Become More Common in Britain, So Does Hunger", "Date": "2014-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHull Journal10 PhotosHULL, England \u2014 To her colleagues at the day care center, Charlotte Burton is an independent woman who works full time and manages just fine. They admire her for biking to work at this time of year, when chilly winds blow and the River Hull swells with rainwater, intermittently swallowing parts of this northeastern city.Only her mother knows that Ms. Burton, 34 and single, bikes because she cannot afford the $4.75 bus fare, that she huddles under a blanket at night to save on heating bills and that she recently started relying on a local food bank because by the end of the month she was eating only one meal a day \u2014 pasta mostly, or bread, whatever best filled her up.\u201cI was hungry,\u201d she said in her kitchen one recent morning, fiddling with a piece of paper covered in numbers. Her monthly budget: rent, gas, electricity, taxes, down payments for the television and the debt she owes her landlord. That leaves about $100 a month for food.The working poor, long a part of the social landscape in the United States, are becoming more common on this side of the Atlantic. As their numbers grow, so too does hunger \u2014 a feeling Ms. Burton describes as a nagging sensation, not pain as such, more an obsession that consumes all your thoughts and energy. It is no longer confined to the homeless or those struggling to make ends meet on state benefits in the world\u2019s sixth-richest economy, say charities, economists and even some members of Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s Conservative Party.In Britain, five years of economic weakness, austerity and rising prices have left a mark: Average hourly earnings have risen a mere 7 percent while the cost of living has gone up by almost 20 percent, leaving at least 500,000 people here reliant on food aid, three times as many as a year ago, according to the Trussell Trust, a Christian charity that runs a network of more than 400 food banks. The trust says the number of people it fed in the eight months since April has risen twentyfold since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008.Food banks distribute food free of charge or at heavy discounts to people generally referred to them by government agencies. They have sprung up in unlikely places, from southern commuter towns to Westminster, a stone\u2019s throw from Buckingham Palace. Steve Baker, a Conservative lawmaker, says that one in five children in his southern constituency of Wycombe goes to bed hungry, calling the figure a \u201cscandalous indictment of the safety net that is the welfare state.\u201dThe need seems most acute in the struggling, postindustrial north.Hull, birthplace of the 18th-century abolitionist William Wilberforce and the rock band the Housemartins, once had a thriving fishing industry and bustling harbor. Successive waves of New York-bound Eastern European emigrants stopped through on their way to Liverpool and some stayed. Today, in per capita terms, it has the greatest number of jobless benefit claimants in the country. More than one in three children here live under the poverty line.The city\u2019s reputation has never been great. \u201cFrom Hell, Hull and Halifax, Good Lord deliver me,\u201d goes the refrain of a poem written in 1622. More than once, Hull was voted the worst place to live in Britain. Things have actually been looking up recently. In a former fruit market in the rapidly gentrifying waterfront of the Humber estuary, hip art galleries and music venues helped Hull win Britain\u2019s \u201cCity of Culture\u201d designation for 2017. But so far little of that regeneration has trickled down.Ms. Burton\u2019s local food bank is supplied by a charity that until four years ago sent food only to developing countries like Sierra Leone. Today, 80 percent of its work is in Britain. \u201cI never thought I would be doing this in my own country, in my own town,\u201d said Colin Raine, who is one of the founders of the charity, Real Aid, which got its start in 2001.The turning point came in 2007, when bad rains flooded thousands of homes around Hull and the charity temporarily stepped in to help. \u201cIt was a shock to walk into people\u2019s homes and see how some of them lived,\u201d said Lindsay Killick, Mr. Raine\u2019s warehouse manager.Mr. Killick told of one man who refused any food that had to be cooked because gas was too expensive. A woman, who lived in a bare apartment with her young daughter, had sold most of her furniture to put food on the table. \u201cWe brought them an old sofa and the little girl said, \u2018Look mommy, we don\u2019t have to sleep on the floor tonight,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he recalled.Real Aid delivers to half a dozen community centers in Hull but also runs its own food bank in nearby Bridlington, a faded seaside resort that has lost most of its trade to cheap vacation packages in Southern Europe. Three in four food bank users here work, Mr. Killick said. There are some regulars, while others may have fallen victim to exceptional circumstances like illness or an unexpected bill for a broken pipe.The vast majority are deeply embarrassed, he said, adding, \u201cPeople in these parts are very proud.\u201dOn a recent Friday morning, a line formed outside a small room above a shop in a Victorian-era arcade. Among those waiting were a shop clerk, a restaurant worker and a grandmother who looks after her grandson during the day and was too embarrassed to tell her daughter that she did not have the money to buy the boy food.They pay around $2.50 for what would cost more than $30 in the supermarket, a token payment but one that matters. \u201cIt feels a little less like charity,\u201d said Karen Farrow, 24, who came with her 3-year-old daughter, Imogen.Shyly, Ms. Farrow helped herself to potatoes, milk, canned kidney beans, cereal and soap. It was her first time here. A seasonal worker in a local beach restaurant, Ms. Farrow is out of work between November and March. Two weeks ago her partner walked out on her. Her claim for income support is being processed, and she has applied for other jobs. But in the meantime, she said, \u201cthere is nothing left in the fridge.\u201dFew here have noticed the economic recovery politicians in London boast about. The economy is set to expand 2.4 percent this year. Unemployment has dropped to 7.4 percent nationally, the lowest level since 2009, but at nearly 15 percent it remains stubbornly high here in Hull.Jennifer Scales, 66, has been coming every week since June. She picks up food for her daughter Lindsey, a single mother who works as an administrator in a local government office. She recently had her first pay raise in five years, but she still does not make enough to get through the month, Ms. Scales said.Life up north has never been easy, she said. Hull was bombed heavily during World War II, partly because German planes returning from missions over targets like Manchester dropped ballast on their way home. The old British wartime motto \u2014 \u201cKeep calm and carry on\u201d \u2014 is a popular slogan on mugs in local souvenir shops. But somehow it rings hollow these days, Ms. Scales said.\u201cWe always thought if you work hard, things will get better,\u201d she said. \u201cIt no longer feels that way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europeans United, in Hating Europe", "Date": "2014-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 It may seem bizarre that two far-right, nationalist politicians \u2014 Marine Le Pen of France and Geert Wilders of the Netherlands \u2014 have reached across borders to form a Pan-European group dedicated to weakening the European Union. Their aim is a transnational political alliance that would compete in the May elections for the European Parliament; once in power, they would cooperate to try to rein in the power of Brussels.Are these politicians, who share an opposition to immigration and a skepticism about the free flow of labor and capital across the Continent, simply hypocritical opportunists, as many Europeans of the left believe? Perhaps. But in fact, since the early 20th century, Europe\u2019s far-right nationalists have often united in search of an \u201cother\u201d to oppose, exclude, resist, restrict or oppress \u2014 historically, minorities like Jews, homosexuals, the disabled, Roma, Marxists and, more recently, Arabs, Africans and Asians. What emerged after World War I was a philosophy that could be called Euro-fascist. The most extreme proponents, of course, were the Nazis: Notwithstanding their doctrine of racial supremacy, even they formed alliances with Mussolini\u2019s Italy and the militarists of Japan and found keen fascist collaborators in nations they invaded.This vision did not die with the end of World War II. Transnational links among right-wing parties, based on common fears of minorities and immigrants, endured. The right-wingers, while speaking different languages, borrowed ideals, strategies, slogans and theorists from one another. The National Front in France, founded in 1972 by Ms. Le Pen\u2019s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, imitated the symbol and political tactics of the original neo-Fascist party, the Italian Social Movement, which was formed in 1946 by admirers of Mussolini and, in 1979, coordinated with like-minded French and Spanish parties to compete (with little success) in the first popular elections for the European Parliament. So when observers marvel about the \u201cnew\u201d nationalist parties of Europe, they are capturing only part of the truth. These right-wingers mistrust or even detest the Continent\u2019s core institutions \u2014 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the European Parliament \u2014 but they are perfectly happy to join up with extremists in other countries to weaken those institutions. Which raises a question: What makes the European Union so appealing as a target?The answer may (and should) shock complacent left-leaning and center-right Europeans alike. \u201cEurope,\u201d as an idea and a community, has weakened. The European Union\u2019s byzantine governance makes it seem unaccountable. Its leaders \u2014 notably Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso of Portugal, the president of the European Commission, the union\u2019s executive body; Herman van Rompuy of Belgium, the president of the European Council, which comprises the 28 heads of government; and Catherine Ashton, the union\u2019s top diplomat \u2014 are little known outside of elite circles. Soaring youth unemployment, stringent fiscal policies, German-led monetary clout and the presence of Muslim immigrants have created a perfect target for the likes of Mr. Wilders and Ms. Le Pen, who blame outside forces like the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union for their nations\u2019 woes. Conveniently, they overlook structural problems like the costs of social welfare and pension programs, declining birthrates, aging populations, stagnant labor productivity and intensifying competition from the economies of Asia and Latin America. Surveys show that the anti-European Union forces may win more than 90 of the 751 seats to be contested in the May elections for the European Parliament. That might be enough to form an official parliamentary group \u2014 and to make them eligible, like the transnational alliances of socialists and center-right Christian democrats, for European Union financing and full political recognition. Even as a tiny, noisy voice within the European Parliament, this alliance could create a lot of trouble. Just think of the successes that Tea Party Republicans have had in impeding decision making in the United States. The perception that bureaucrats in Brussels, bankers in Frankfurt and European lawmakers in Strasbourg, France, are haughty and indifferent has made it possible for demagogues to pose as populists who are alone in understanding \u201cthe people.\u201d For example, in November, Lorenzo Fontana, an Italian member of the European Parliament from the right-wing Northern League, boasted \u2014 ahead of a gathering with leaders of the National Front and similarly oriented Swedish, Austrian and Flemish parties \u2014 that they spoke in the name of a \u201cshared ideal of Europe, a Europe of people.\u201d The League\u2019s newspaper, La Padania, on Nov. 14, put it this way: \u201cIt will be up to the voters, but this time the troops, willing but disorganized, have the opportunity to unite in a single \u2018army\u2019 behind an able leader.\u201d How would these right-wingers reshape Europe? They say they would give power back to nations by dismantling the technocratic decision-making power amassed in Brussels and returning powers back to individual member states. They would pause, if not quite reverse, six decades of growing integration. Tragically, in the face of this assault, calls for European solidarity are few. This is a sign of how far Europe has come from the dream that helped lift it from the ashes of war. It is a sign of the fading of the vision \u2014 common markets, democratic institutions and societal integration \u2014 promoted by the postwar founders of European integration: thinkers and statesmen like Konrad Adenauer, Winston Churchill, Jean Monnet, Robert Schuman and Altiero Spinelli. The European Union must reclaim its reputation as a champion of the people. Its leaders should abandon their embrace of technocratic solutions, their support for the banking sector and their stoic austerity. Unless they deliver more jobs, and more of a sense that citizens are in charge, the far right will only keep growing. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. and Iran Face Common Enemies in Mideast Strife", "Date": "2014-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 Even as the United States and Iran pursue negotiations on Tehran\u2019s nuclear program, they find themselves on the same side of a range of regional issues surrounding an insurgency raging across the Middle East.While the two governments quietly continue to pursue their often conflicting interests, they are being drawn together by their mutual opposition to an international movement of young Sunni fighters, who with their pickup trucks and Kalashnikovs are raising the black flag of Al Qaeda along sectarian fault lines in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen.The United States, reluctant to intervene in bloody, inconclusive conflicts, is seeing its regional influence decline, while Iraq, which cost the Americans $1 trillion and more than 4,000 lives, is growing increasingly unstable.At the same time, Shiite-dominated Iran, the magnetic pole for the Shiite minority in the region, has its own reasons to be nervous, with the ragtag army of Sunni militants threatening Syria and Iraq, both important allies, and the United States drawing down its troops in Afghanistan.To some, the Iranian moves reflect the clever pragmatism of Iran\u2019s new president, Hassan Rouhani, and his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, aimed at building their country into a regional power. To others critical of the potential reconciliation, the moves are window dressing aimed at lulling the West into complacency while Tehran pursues nuclear weapons and supports its own jihadists throughout the region.Yet even Iranians outside the reformist camp see the shared interests as undeniable. \u201cIt is clear we are increasingly reaching common ground with the Americans,\u201d said one of them, Aziz Shahmohammadi, a former adviser to Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council. \u201cNo country should have an eternal enemy, neither we nor the United States.\u201dWith Iran as an island of stability in a region plagued by violent protests, sectarian clashes and suicide bombers, there are not that many options left for Washington, experts here say.\u201cWe face the same enemy, and the enemy of my enemy is my friend,\u201d said Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, a prominent Iranian reformist journalist who closely follows the Arab world. He recalled how Iranian intelligence operatives gave reliable information to American Special Forces troops battling Iran\u2019s enemy, the Afghan Taliban, in 2001.While the Obama administration acknowledges that Iran has the potential to be an influential player on regional issues from Afghanistan to Syria, senior officials have said they are keeping their focus tightly on the nuclear negotiations. Cooperation on any other issues, they said, hinges largely on coming to terms on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.The administration has concluded that Mr. Rouhani and Mr. Zarif have been empowered to negotiate on the nuclear program, but officials said it remained unclear whether their policy-making authority extended to regional issues like Syria. There, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps holds vast influence through its Quds Force, and it is supplying weapons to Hezbollah in an effort to prop up President Assad\u2019s government.The thaw in relations extends back almost a year, with the two countries making overtures long thought impossible, deeply angering Washington\u2019s closest regional allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel.Iran has been presenting itself as the voice of reason, pointing at the extremely graphic videos of beheadings and other executions produced by some of the insurgent groups in Syria, while Mr. Rouhani wished a happy new year to all Christians on his Twitter account.\u201cNow extremists are once again threatening our security, and as in 2001, both countries will cooperate with each other in Iraq, and potentially elsewhere, too,\u201d Mr. Shamsolvaezin said. \u201cThis is the beginning of regional cooperation.\u201dThe thaw presents dangers to Mr. Obama and Mr. Rouhani, who will remain vulnerable to criticism from conservatives in both countries. Mr. Kerry\u2019s invitation on Sunday for Iran to join \u201con the sidelines\u201d of the Geneva conference was angrily rejected by Iranian hard-liners.\u201cThe Americans are confessing Iran stands for peace and stability in this region,\u201d said Hamid Reza Tarraghi, a hard-line political analyst, with views close to those of Iran\u2019s leaders. \u201cBut when they invite us for a conference on Syria we are \u2018allowed\u2019 to be present on the \u2018sidelines.\u2019 This is insulting.\u201dEven Mr. Zarif rebuffed Mr. Kerry, saying that \u201ceverybody must be unified in order to fight the terrorists,\u201d the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.But Tehran\u2019s full participation in the conference would seem to present even deeper problems, in that the talks are aimed at planning for a Syria after Iran\u2019s longtime ally, Mr. Assad, has stepped down.Critics of United States policy say that the Obama administration is strengthening Iran at the expense of traditional allies, particularly Saudi Arabia and Israel. They say that Iran has not cut back on its support of its regional allies, like Hezbollah, the militant Shiite group in Lebanon, and Mr. Assad, and is deeply involved with Iraq\u2019s Shiite government.Moreover, they say, a final nuclear agreement with Iran, should it be reached, would relieve Iran of crippling economic sanctions, reviving its economy and giving it more resources to spread its influence in the region, while depriving the West of diplomatic leverage to restrain Iran.Analysts in Iran say that Tehran is pursuing a clever strategy, using the United States to undermine its greatest regional rival, Saudi Arabia.\u201cCooperating skillfully with Russia, Iran has managed to change the game both in Iraq and in Syria,\u201d said Hooshang Tale, a Tehran-based nationalist activist and a member of Parliament before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. \u201cIf we play our cards well, we will end up outsmarting both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.\u201dHe and others note that Iran has managed to keep Mr. Assad in power and wields considerable influence over its neighbors, Iraq and Afghanistan. Rightly or wrongly, they view their regional enemy Saudi Arabia as being on the verge of collapse, saying in Friday Prayer speeches and in televised debates that the kingdom is ruled by old men who have lost their way.\u201cWe are worried for Saudi Arabia, which seems weak and potentially unstable,\u201d said Mr. Shahmohammadi, the former adviser, who heads an institute that promotes dialogue between Sunnis and Shiites. \u201cEven we, as their competitor, see all the horrible consequences if things go wrong there.\u201dOn Tehran\u2019s streets, where people tend to see much of the region as distant lands filled with mayhem and unrest, many Iranians welcome every step that brings Iran and the United States closer together.\u201cThe U.S. stands for progress, for work, a future, new cars and a better life,\u201d said Mohammad Reza Barfi, an auto mechanic. \u201cI\u2019d rather have peace with the U.S. than with any regional country. What do they have to offer?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea Proposes Resuming Reunions of War-Divided Families", "Date": "2014-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea\u2019s president proposed Monday that the two Koreas improve their tense relations by resuming the reunions of families separated since the Korean War, a humanitarian program that seemed close to being renewed last year but was scuttled as negotiations soured.President Park Geun-hye\u2019s overture came five days after the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, urged that Seoul and Pyongyang create \u201ca favorable climate for improved relations\u201d in a New Year\u2019s Day speech.\u201cI hope that North Korea will create a new opportunity for South-North relations and a framework for dialogue by taking a good first step with family reunions,\u201d Ms. Park said during a nationally televised news conference.Ms. Park, a conservative, made two other conciliatory gestures toward the North, offering to increase humanitarian aid to the impoverished country and to let South Korean civic groups provide assistance to its farmers and ranchers. But she expressed skepticism about the prospect of meeting with Mr. Kim, whose government has until recently exhorted South Koreans to overthrow her \u201cfascist dictatorship.\u201dMs. Park proposed that a new round of reunions be held around Lunar New Year\u2019s Day on Jan. 31, a traditional time for family gatherings in both Koreas.There was no immediate response from Pyongyang. Ms. Park called Monday\u2019s news conference, her first since taking office last February, amid growing criticism from the South Korean opposition that she had not been communicating enough with the public.Millions of Koreans were separated from family members when the Korean Peninsula was divided into the Communist North and the pro-American South at the end of World War II. The Korean War, which began in 1950, was fought to a stalemate and an ultimate cease-fire in 1953. Since then, no exchanges of letters, telephone calls or emails have been allowed between North and South Koreans, and family reunions remain a highly emotional issue and an indicator of the state of relations on the peninsula.About 22,000 people from both Koreas participated in 18 rounds of government-arranged reunions between 1985 and 2010, when the program was suspended as relations worsened. About 73,000 South Koreans \u2014 half of whom are more than 80 years old \u2014 remain on a waiting list for a chance to meet with parents, siblings or children in the North for the first time in 60 years.After months of harsh rhetoric following the North\u2019s nuclear test last February, North and South Korea reached an agreement last August to revive the reunions. But the North later ended the talks, blaming the South for refusing to resume an inter-Korean tourism program at the North\u2019s Diamond Mountain resort, which had been highly lucrative for Pyongyang until it was shut down in 2008.Ms. Park did not offer details Monday on her proposed humanitarian aid to the North, but she said South Korean civic groups might be able to join international aid agencies in providing support to farmers and ranchers in the country. In his New Year\u2019s speech, Mr. Kim set the rebuilding of his country\u2019s agriculture as a top priority.Cheong Seong-chang, an analyst at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said that the family reunion proposal gave Pyongyang a chance to follow up on Mr. Kim\u2019s call for improved ties. But Mr. Cheong warned that the North would eventually link the reunions to the Diamond Mountain tourism program. Without a concession on that issue, he said, \u201cNorth Korea will be uncooperative with family reunions, and even if they are held, they will be a one-time event.\u201dSouth Korea halted the flow of aid and investment to the North in 2008, demanding that Pyongyang give up its nuclear weapons. It also curtailed inter-Korean trade after the sinking of a South Korean naval ship in 2010, which Seoul says was caused by a North Korean torpedo attack.After spending much of last year threatening nuclear and missile attacks against Washington and Seoul, North Korea recently shifted its tone, calling for reconciliation. Ms. Park said Monday that she was eager to work toward Korean reunification, which she said would bring \u201ca bonanza\u201d to the South Korean economy. But she said that the North\u2019s refusal to abandon its nuclear weapons was a stumbling block and that the motives for its recent overtures remained suspect.Mr. Kim made similarly conciliatory comments toward the South during his New Year\u2019s Day speech in 2013, but they were followed by a series of provocative acts, including its February nuclear test. Just last month, Pyongyang sent a letter to Ms. Park\u2019s office threatening \u201cstrikes without warning.\u201dMs. Park\u2019s overture coincided with the arrival in Pyongyang of a squad of former NBA players led by Dennis Rodman, who are scheduled to play an exhibition game against a team of North Korean players on Wednesday, Mr. Kim\u2019s 31st birthday. The game, planned for months, was the result of Mr. Rodman\u2019s first visit to Pyongyang nearly a year ago at the invitation of Mr. Kim, a basketball fan whom Mr. Rodman now describes as a close friend.Mr. Rodman, the highest-profile American known to have met Mr. Kim, has repeatedly said he is carrying no messages for the North Korean leadership from the United States government, which is still considered the enemy in official North Korean propaganda.The Associated Press, the only American news agency with a bureau in Pyongyang, quoted Mr. Rodman as saying that he had received death threats over his visits to North Korea, and that money raised by the exhibition game would go to a charity for deaf North Koreans.\u201cThe marshal is actually trying to change this country in a great way,\u201d Mr. Rodman was quoted as saying, referring to Mr. Kim\u2019s official title.Advertisement"}

But once in awhile you come across something unique.\u201cI bought a yellow one that came with six others,\u201d he said in a telephone interview, adding that he\u2019d picked up a couple of others since and that those ones came with a sizable heap of parts.\u201cBack in the early \u201880s, I used to drive them back and forth to work at Fort Knox on $3 a week,\u201d Mr. Bowersmith said in a telephone interview, referring to the Subarus\u2019 fuel costs. \u201cI had two or three of them, and people would see me with them and ask me if I wanted to buy another one. That\u2019s how I got so damn many of them.\u201dOnce, Mr. Bowersmith said, he even traded a Cub Cadet riding lawn mower for a Subaru 360 and a Sambar van of the same vintage. He ended up with a handful of the tiny Subaru vans, too.Mr. Bowersmith said he and his wife, Erika, drove the snail-like economy cars to work. As a side job he also cut wood, traveling about 50 miles, his 360 packed full of saws and tools.Although the 360 came in only one color \u2013 white, with a red interior \u2013 he said his cars were painted different colors. One was decorated with a \u201cStarsky & Hutch\"-style stripe. Another \u2013 the one that attracted Mr. Hicks\u2019 attention \u2013 was yellow. There was even a two-tone 360 that had originally been owned by an officer stationed at Fort Knox.\u201cIt was originally white, but a captain bought it and painted one side of the car black,\u201d Mr. Bowersmith said, explaining that based on which way he was going, passers-by would see him in profile riding in either a white car or a black one.Subaru\u2019s entry into the United States market was a failure because the cars were just too small and horribly gutless. Tiny even compared with the then-diminutive Volkswagen Beetle, the 360 took, according to Car and Driver, \u201can agonizing 37.5 seconds to reach 50 m.p.h.\u201d The cars were outsized and outgunned by American models that often weighed more than four times as much and could reach 60 m.p.h. in less than 15 seconds.Even to the enthusiasts who bought the survivors, their small size could be daunting.\u201cThe scariest thing about driving one is pulling up alongside a semi,\u201d Mr. Bowersmith said. \u201cIt was so small, you could fit one up underneath the trailer without touching anything.\u201d\u201cI was glad to get rid of them all at once,\u201d he said of the Subarus.Mr. Hicks said he hoped to do the same with most of the 360s he had acquired, although he planned to keep the yellow one. The remaining eight are lined up \u2013 in a manner that many people store gas-powered lawn and garden implements \u2013 under his back deck, waiting for someone who really likes 1,000-pound cars powered by 2-stroke, 2-cylinder 360cc engines to buy them.\u201cI have the most awesome wife on the planet,\u201d he said of her tolerance of his collection. \u201cShe\u2019s a car person, too, which makes it a lot easier.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indonesia Announces Export Ban on Raw Ore", "Date": "2014-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Indonesia, one of the world\u2019s biggest producers of minerals including gold, nickel, copper, tin and thermal coal, implemented a new law Sunday banning the export of unprocessed ore.Analysts said the ban would have little impact on global supply because the Indonesian government passed a regulation Saturday night that would allow international mining firms to continue such exports until at least 2017.\u201cStarting at midnight on Jan. 12, 2014, raw ore definitely cannot be exported,\" Jero Wacik, the minister of energy and mineral resources, told reporters late Saturday after a meeting led by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.The regulation Mr. Yudhoyono issued, however, could ease the ban\u2019s impact on major mining companies, including the American giants Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold and the Newmont Mining Corporation, Teuku Faizasyah, a presidential spokesman, said Sunday.He referred requests for further comment to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and the office of Hatta Rajasa, Indonesia\u2019s coordinating minister for economic affairs.Details of the presidential regulation have not been released, but mining companies will reportedly be obligated to build smelting facilities by 2017. In the meantime, they can still export unprocessed ore. Those companies, however, say building smelters is not economically viable.\u201cNot only Freeport and Newmont, but we have 66 companies that have said they will build smelters,\" Mr. Wacik said, according to the Reuters news agency. \"These will get a chance to export processed minerals.\" He added, \"The energy ministry will later give more details on the levels of concentrate allowed.\u201dConcentrate refers to the amount of a pure mineral in ore. The law originally banned any ore that was less than 100 percent pure.Indonesia produces more than 15 percent of the global nickel supply and 3 percent of the global copper supply, according to various estimates.Government officials have said the ban is aimed at increasing value-added industries in Indonesia\u2019s economy by requiring miners to build smelters in the country, but the policy has been roundly criticized by both foreign and domestic companies as short-sighted and nationalistic. Some say it is driven by political motives ahead of legislative and presidential elections this year.Industry experts noted that the export ban had been in the works since a mining law was passed in 2009, but that Mr. Yudhoyono\u2019s government, apparently realizing the potential impact that it could have on jobs, taxes and royalties, had only created uncertainty and confusion by granting a reprieve until 2017.\u201cThe most significant metal producers shouldn\u2019t expect any negative impact,\" said Bill Sullivan, a lawyer and mining industry adviser in Jakarta. \"The real story is how the government could have left it to the night before to come to grips with this. It\u2019s been an appalling failure of government policy making.\u201dMr. Sullivan said that midsize nickel and bauxite miners could be unfairly hurt the most by the new regulation if companies hired to build smelting facilities failed to do so by 2017.\u201cWhy should they be penalized if the third party they were relying on hasn\u2019t built the smelter?\u201d he said.Marwan Batubara, director of Indonesian Resources Studies, a nongovernmental organization in Jakarta specializing in public policy, accused the Indonesian government of \u201csurrendering\u201d to pressure from large international mining companies in allowing ore exports to continue as usual until 2017.Because of that, he said he did not expect any noticeable impact in global supply of minerals from Indonesia like nickel and bauxite. China, for example, is a major importer of Indonesian nickel.\u201cBy allowing the export of concentrate of gold and silver and other minerals, the government is not following the law,\" Mr. Marwan said. \"They are playing with the content percentage.\"\u201cI don\u2019t think the supply situation will be big, because it\u2019s not being 100 percent applied,\" he added. \"I don\u2019t think it will influence the market very much. We can say this is business as usual.\u201dMr. Marwan also said that he expected the parties involved would challenge Mr. Yudhoyono\u2019s ore export regulation with the Indonesian Supreme Court, which last week struck down portions of a separate government regulation related to the 2009 mining law, adding further confusion to what analysts say is a heavily politicized sector.Meanwhile, Industry Minister M.S. Hidayat said that the government would impose taxes on mineral exports until 2017, when companies would have built smelters.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "James Baldwin\u2019s Paris", "Date": "2014-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFootstepsOne bright afternoon in Paris, on the terrace of the cafe Deux Magots, in St.-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, I found myself engaged in an increasingly animated conversation about the writer James Baldwin and the notorious feud that broke out between him and his fellow African-American expatriate Richard Wright.It was late July, and the cafe\u2019s terrace hummed with the casual banter of lounging tourists and residents. All the while a small battalion of crisp-collared waiters shuffled elegantly between the tightly ordered tables and stiff wicker chairs, their every gesture backed by the steady cadence of white porcelain cups tapping against saucers and the gentle clank of Art Deco silverware.Having spent nearly a decade living in Paris, I\u2019d eaten at Les Deux Magots many times. That afternoon, however, I had a specific purpose in mind. I was retracing James Baldwin\u2019s steps through Paris, while asking myself where Baldwin might be living if he were in the city now. To further my search, I had invited the expatriate African-American novelist \u2014 and Baldwin enthusiast \u2014 Jake Lamar to join me at Les Deux Magots, hoping he would catch any gaps in my itinerary.\u201cIt started right here,\u201d Jake said of the dispute between Baldwin and Wright, as our waiter swept away our plates to make space for his forthcoming espresso and my cafe allong\u00e9. Jake was reminding me that Baldwin and Wright\u2019s quarrel had begun upstairs from where we sat, facing the cobblestone Place St.-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s and l\u2019\u00c9glise St.-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s itself, the oldest church in Paris.Had we been actually sitting inside the cafe that day, in the winter of 1948, he explained, we would have surely caught a glimpse of an earnest young Jimmy Baldwin, slightly disheveled from having arrived from New York only hours before, climbing the narrow steps up to the cafe\u2019s second floor, where he was greeted by Wright and the editors of Zero magazine, a rather small but important literary journal that would shortly publish Baldwin\u2019s essay \u201cEverybody\u2019s Protest Novel.\u201dBaldwin was only 24 when he arrived in Paris, with just $40 in his pocket. Virtually unpublished, he had left New York to escape American racism \u2014 an escape that he believed literally saved his life and made it possible for him to write. His first essay in Zero argued forcefully against the idea of the protest novel, claiming, among other things, that it was inherently sentimental, and therefore dishonest. Wright, who had already established himself as an international literary force based on the critical success of several novels, was deeply offended by Baldwin\u2019s essay, reading it as a direct attack on the validity of his work. Shortly after the essay was published, the two men ran into each other at Brasserie Lipp, less than a block from Les Deux Magots, and Wright immediately lit into Jimmy, who by all accounts held his own.Baldwin has maintained a grip on my imagination ever since my freshman year of college, when I read his novel \u201cGiovanni\u2019s Room.\u201d Set in 1950s Paris, the novel tells the story of an ill-fated love affair between the narrator, David, a young American ex-soldier, and a darkly handsome Italian barman named Giovanni. As a young, gay black man growing up in the 1980s, I found this to be the first novel I\u2019d encountered with the subject of homosexuality placed front and center and written by anyone who remotely resembled me. I was inspired in equal parts by the depth and style of Baldwin\u2019s prose, and the fact that he, a gay black man had written so boldly and lived so openly at a time when there was such deep social hatred and opposition aimed at those of us who shared either Baldwin\u2019s race or sexual identity, let alone both. What\u2019s more, the fact that he had found a way to live and write freely in Paris made the city feel like an essential destination for me.In the fall of 1998, a few months shy of the 50th anniversary of Baldwin\u2019s arrival, I, too, finally moved to Paris, settling in a quaint \u2014 if not cramped \u2014 one-bedroom apartment on the Left Bank, in the Fifth Arrondissement. Seduced by the idea of chasing Baldwin\u2019s literary coattails, I dedicated myself to rereading \u201cGiovanni\u2019s Room,\u201d allowing the texture and mood of Baldwin\u2019s (and Giovanni\u2019s) Paris to overlap with the version of the city I was newly discovering. Now, some 15 years later, having left Paris, ultimately for New York, I was excited to see the city through Baldwin\u2019s eyes again, which meant returning to the Left Bank.For my first day on Baldwin\u2019s trail, I caught the M\u00e9tro from my apartment in Batignolles \u2014 a recently trendy neighborhood in the once working-class northeast corner of the 17th Arrondissement \u2014 south, across the Seine, to the Sixth Arrondissement and St.-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. I was headed to Caf\u00e9 de Flore, the place where Baldwin had spent endless hours on the second floor, drinking coffee and Cognac to keep warm while working on his first novel, \u201cGo Tell It on the Mountain.\u201dPatrons at Le Select, an Art Deco cafe where James Baldwin wrote much of the novel \u201cGiovanni\u2019s Room.\u201dIt was a mild, sunny day, and exiting the M\u00e9tro station I was struck by how little had changed in St.-Germain since I\u2019d caught my first glimpse of the neighborhood back in the late \u201990s. At once I felt I\u2019d returned to the model-version Paris, the district that, as the author Diane Johnson noted in her book, \u201cInto a Paris Quartier,\u201d the American imagination has tended to \u201cfasten\u201d itself onto for over a century. Surely, this fastening is largely due to St.-Germain\u2019s fabled expatriate history, beginning with Thomas Jefferson\u2019s stay on what is now the Rue Bonaparte. But for me that afternoon, I was experiencing a renewed vision of the Paris that seems to effortlessly weave the rich vitality of city life together with the ease of vacationing in a small French village. To my left a continuous stream of cars, motorcycles, taxicabs and bikes flowed steadily down the broad, tree-lined Boulevard St.-Germain, while on my right, the ponderous row of classic stone facades was pleasantly broken up by stylishly quaint bookstores, shops, sidewalk cafes and side streets meandering toward the Seine.During the late \u201940s and early \u201950s, St.-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s was the center of a thriving artistic and literary community and a place where nightclubs and bars of varying reputations flourished, allowing Baldwin to openly explore both his literary craft and his sexuality.At Caf\u00e9 de Flore I took a seat on one of the crimson and green wicker chairs on the terrace and began planning my next steps on Baldwin\u2019s trail. Caf\u00e9 de Flore sits on the corner of the Boulevard St.-Germain and the Rue St.-Beno\u00eet. Its location places it directly across St.-Beno\u00eet from its chief rival, Les Deux Magots. Similarly founded in the late 1890s, both cafes are adorned with Art Deco details, red moleskin banquettes, mahogany tables and mirrored walls. Both have rich intellectual and literary histories, boasting a list of luminaries \u2014 writers, artists, actors and philosophers that include Ernest Hemingway, Alain Delon, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Pablo Picasso and Albert Camus. Both have similar menus, and prices. Even the difference in ambience is barely perceptible, though residents and frequent visitors to the quarter are quick to say that the Flore attracts a slightly more fashionable clientele. When my waiter finally made his way to my table, I ordered a croque monsieur and a citron press\u00e9, my favorite pairing at the cafe. Handing the menu back to him, I wondered how a starving young writer, as Baldwin had been when he first visited the Flore, might afford the same, somewhat pricey croque today.I rounded out the afternoon in St.-Germain by wandering down the Rue de Verneuil, a short, rather tight street of low 17th-century facades where Baldwin lived in various third-rate hotels during his early years in Paris, before continuing on to the Caf\u00e9 Tournon, on the Rue de Tournon, near the formal Luxembourg Gardens, and the Brasserie Lipp, back on the Boulevard St.-Germain. Baldwin was known to visit the Caf\u00e9 Tournon and the Brasserie Lipp, albeit infrequently, often stopping in before heading off to eat and drink in one of the cheaper neighborhood brasseries or bars. Both restaurants, their Art Deco mosaics still brilliantly maintained, were hot intellectual and creative night spots during the 1950s and \u201960s, the Tournon largely considered the place where the St.-Germain neighborhood jazz scene got its start, providing the stage where Duke Ellington made his Parisian debut. Meanwhile, the Lipp had a perpetual waiting list of A-list celebrities and politicians jockeying for a corner table.On my second day following Baldwin\u2019s trail I made my way to Montparnasse and settled into a comfortable leather bench at Le Select, yet another well-preserved Art Deco cafe, the place where Baldwin wrote much of \u201cGiovanni\u2019s Room.\u201d If ever there was an American expatriate hub in Paris, Montparnasse was certainly it during the postwar years, largely owing to the sheer number of American students who moved to the Left Bank in the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s. Baldwin associated with many of these students, mostly ex-G.I.\u2019s, writing about his experiences with them in the essay \u201cA Question of Identity.\u201dA sudden rainstorm that morning had delayed my trip to Montparnasse, but by 3 o\u2019clock, the time I arrived at Le Select, the torrential streaks had subsided to a misty drizzle, and the cafe\u2019s green-trimmed awning, the words \u201cAmerican Bar\u201d printed on the corner bend, was fully extended, affording cover to a small cluster of smoking patrons huddled leisurely on the terrace. (The French government banned smoking indoors years ago, making it difficult to conjure up an image of Baldwin at Le Select chain-smoking while scribbling furiously on a yellow legal pad in one of the tight rear booths.) In spite of an extensive urban renewal project in the 1960s and \u201970s that led the city to raze many prewar buildings in Montparnasse, Le Select remained intact, its Art Deco d\u00e9cor virtually unchanged since the 1920s. Le Select sits in the shadow of La Tour Montparnasse, which for many years held the title for the tallest building in France. Decried by Parisians as \u201cgrotesque\u201d upon its completion, the tower became the symbol for the indiscriminate destruction of locally cherished buildings, empowering a movement to ban all skyscrapers within the city limits and to preserve historic places like Le Select.The clientele that afternoon consisted largely of French students earnestly discussing politics and philosophy, a handful of American tourists and local businessmen having a late lunch and people I took to be neighborhood regulars reading newspapers and books, or simply staring out at the boulevard. As I nibbled off a plate of bread and charcuterie, I couldn\u2019t help overhearing the nearby students as they discussed the lagging French economy, the weaknesses of their president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and the highly publicized conservative protests against gay marriage. I was captivated by the youthful sense of French entitlement in their speech, and my thoughts returned to the question of which neighborhood in Paris a young, foreign, black \u2014 and struggling \u2014 James Baldwin might currently be, especially considering that Le Select and his other haunts on the Left Bank have all become so chic.Clearly, Baldwin had explored Parisian neighborhoods beyond those on the Left Bank. In a May 1961 article in Esquire magazine, \u201cNew Lost Generation,\u201d he attested to the joy he felt discovering Paris. \u201cThe days when we walked through Les Halles singing, loving every inch of France and loving each other ... the jam sessions in Pigalle, and our stories about the whores there ... the nights spent smoking hashish in the Arab cafes ... the morning which found us telling dirty stories, true stories, sad and earnest stories, in grey workingmen\u2019s cafes.\u201dAs for Pigalle, still the largest red-light district in Paris, I had walked through the quarter earlier that week on my way to a dinner party at a friend\u2019s apartment in Montmartre. The sun had already begun to set, its final rays fading into the variegated shimmer cast by a long procession of dim Art Nouveau lamps and bright storefront neon. Along the Boulevard de Clichy, I strolled past the Moulin Rouge and a vivid array of sex shops, strip clubs, adult movie theaters and hotels for prostitution (which is still legal in Paris). It seemed with every step there was yet another barker calling out to me from in front of a neon-lit doorway, attempting to sell a lap dance, an XXX-rated film, a girl \u2014 or possibly a boy \u2014 for hire. That night the spectacle of Pigalle made it easy to imagine the scenes of decadence and freedom Baldwin described when reminiscing about his trips to the area. Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t the case with Les Halles.In \u201cGiovanni\u2019s Room\u201d Baldwin describes Les Halles as a place with \u201cchoked boulevards and impassible streets, a place where leeks, cabbages, oranges, apples, potatoes, cauliflowers stood gleaming in mounds all over, in the sidewalks and streets in front of metal sheds.\u201d The restaurants, bars and cheap workmen\u2019s cafes that Baldwin spoke of with such joy were demolished and replaced in 1977 by an underground transportation hub and shopping district \u2014 a modern monstrosity of metal and mirrored glass whose underground tunnels connect an intricate series of M\u00e9tro and suburban train lines, while housing a subterranean shopping center. The extensive transportation and shopping options have allowed Les Halles to remain one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in Paris, much like Downtown Brooklyn\u2019s Fulton Street Mall \u2014 in terms of daily traffic, at least, in spite of the planners\u2019 intentions to draw more exclusive retail and dining to the area. Still, the cost of living in the center limits the neighborhood\u2019s actual diversity.In 1999, my second year in Paris, I lived beside Les Halles, in the First Arrondissement, on the pedestrian Rue du Cygne, and, more recently, I\u2019d heard that the entire complex was being redeveloped. Curious to see the changes before leaving Paris, I invited my friend Walid Nouioua to dinner at Le P\u00e8re Fouettard, my favorite restaurant in Les Halles, beside the hub\u2019s main entry. That night, I was disappointed to find the new facade of Les Halles hidden behind wide construction panels and such extensive scaffolding that it was impossible to see what the new structure might look like. Walid and I took a table on the large bustling terrace. A doctor by profession, Algerian and French by birth and citizenship, Walid happens to be an avid Baldwin reader, and so midway through our meal, I asked his thoughts on the possible whereabouts of a young James Baldwin in contemporary Paris. Other friends and colleagues, I explained, had made suggestions based on one characteristic or another: the Marais, given Baldwin\u2019s night life and homosexuality. M\u00e9nilmontant or Place des F\u00eates in response to a notion of creative affinity. Belleville or Ch\u00e2teau Rouge for ethnic diversity. The suburbs of Paris such as Montreuil, St.-Ouen, Aubervilliers and St.-Denis as places where artists and writers were currently moving. After weighing the options carefully, Walid simply shook his head and agreed that the reasons offered for each of these districts made them all viable possibilities.And so I spent my final days in Paris visiting bars and cafes in Beaubourg and the Marais, notably Caf\u00e9 Beaubourg on Rue St.-Merri, L\u2019Open Bar on Rue des Archives and L\u2019\u00c9toile Manquante on Rue Vieille du Temple. I discovered the smartly gentrified, red brick and masonry townhouses hidden in the alleyways near the Place des F\u00eates. I wandered through a string of charming studios and galleries in and around Belleville and the picturesque Rue des Cascades. I revisited the African markets at Ch\u00e2teau Rouge and toured a handful of galleries and artists\u2019 workshops housed in old factories, garages and warehouses in the trendier corners of Montreuil, one of the eastern suburbs of the city. I even visited the northern suburbs of Paris, investigating La Maladrerie, an elegantly conceived public housing project in Aubervilliers, where writers and artists\u2019 studios were located alongside general housing. And yet I couldn\u2019t actually picture a young James Baldwin living in any of these places. As I reflected on the idea behind my search, it dawned on me that the key elements that conspired to bring Baldwin to Paris all those years ago no longer existed in Paris, nor did the same overriding impulses to leave America.In the spring of 1984, during an interview for The Paris Review, a nearly 60-year-old Baldwin was asked why he had chosen to live in France, to which he replied: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much a matter of choosing France \u2014 it was a matter of getting out of America.\u201d The problem of racism in America was for Baldwin so consuming and, to his mind, deadly that he feared he wouldn\u2019t have survived it if he\u2019d stayed, let alone been able to isolate himself enough to write. And yet upon arriving in France, he had no illusions that Paris was among the \u201cmost civilized of cities,\u201d nor did he consider the French among the \u201cleast primitive of peoples.\u201d During those early years he stayed in France because, as a black man, he perceived that the ruling-class whites there simply left him alone, unlike those in America, and that\u2019s what allowed him to develop as a writer.But I arrived in Paris generations after the time when the French were inclined to leave people of color alone. Baldwin himself pointed out the changes in French feeling toward all minorities after the furious battle of Dien Bien Phu, signaling the loss of colonial Vietnam, and the brutal Algerian war. Over the years this change has grown in step with the influx of blacks and North Africans from France\u2019s former colonies and outer departments, including Guadeloupe and Martinique.As the French historian Michel Fabre noted in his book \u201cFrom Harlem to Paris (Black American Writers in France, 1840-1980),\u201d France may have served as \u201ca place of shelter from what Baldwin called, \u2018the American madness,\u2019\u00a0\u201d but that time has clearly passed. No longer a haven for American blacks, France is no longer needed.Of course, during the near decade I lived in Paris, I certainly experienced occasions of French racism firsthand. And yet that didn\u2019t dissuade me during my recent trip. Even if France is no longer a haven for people of color, Paris remains a beacon, a vital connection to a time when, for many of our most important artists, writers and political thinkers, a much-needed shelter was sought and found.The cover article on Jan. 17 about James Baldwin\u2019s Paris omitted a source for information about Baldwin\u2019s main night-life posse and their favorite haunts. The source was Monique Wells, founder of the blog Entr\u00e9e to Black Paris. The article also misstated the street on which l\u2019Abbaye, a nightclub co-owned by Gordon Heath, and a favorite spot of Baldwin and his friends, was situated. It was on Rue de l\u2019Abbaye, not Rue Jacob.Ellery Washington is an associate professor of creative writing at the Pratt Institute.

READING LISTMany of James Baldwin\u2019s books were written, completed or so deeply influenced by his time in Paris that it is nearly impossible to separate his literary legacy from the city itself.

While Turkey has suffered along with other developing nations from the \u201ctapering\u201d of bond purchases by the United States Federal Reserve and the threat of rising global interest rates, its problems go beyond that to basic questions about the stability of the government and its ability to grapple with the economy\u2019s problems.To some extent, Turkey and Mr. Erdogan are victims of their own success, having created an attractive investment climate that brought in billions in dollar-denominated lending, particularly after the financial crisis of 2008. Officials in Western capitals, including President Obama, came to see him as the prime example of a leader who could meld democratic values, Islam and economic prosperity.But much of the money was funneled to a group of insiders who made fortunes while building malls and other developments that increasingly lacked sound economic underpinnings. Now, with bond investors fleeing and interest rates rising, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s economic turnaround is in jeopardy of unraveling in a toxic stew of bad loans, accusations of cronyism and the appearance of seat-of-the-pants economic stewardship.The first cracks in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s aura of invincibility came in the summer, with violent street protests against yet another mall that was to replace a popular Istanbul park. Mr. Erdogan emerged from that with his image tarnished but his power seemingly intact.But he was jolted once again in December by a sweeping corruption inquiry aimed at his inner circle. That continues to unfold, further chipping away at his power.At the same time, his ambitious foreign policy, which sought to position Turkey as the leader of a region in turmoil, failed amid the continuing civil war in Syria, where Turkey has supported the rebels, and the collapse of the Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt, an important ally that Mr. Erdogan enthusiastically supported.The political attacks, economic instability and higher interest rates come at an inopportune time for Mr. Erdogan, as he and his Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party, known by its Turkish initials A.K.P., face a series of elections that will determine if he remains in power.Local elections in March, and especially the contest for the influential post of mayor of Istanbul, will be the first test. In the summer, voters, for the first time, will cast their ballots in a nationwide election for president, a post Mr. Erdogan is hoping to capture.Mr. Erdogan, a pious Muslim who has been in power for more than a decade, is Turkey\u2019s longest-serving prime minister and, analysts say, its most consequential leader since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the secular founder of modern Turkey. Mr. Erdogan has burnished his power with his charisma and his appeal to the country\u2019s religious masses, a previously oppressed class under Turkey\u2019s former secular rulers.But more than that, experts say, Mr. Erdogan owes his staying power atop Turkey\u2019s political system to his stewardship of an economic boom that has elevated Turkey to the global stage.\u201cUltimately, he\u2019s popular because he\u2019s done well with the economy,\u201d said Murat Ucer, an economist at GlobalSource Partners, an economic research firm, and a former adviser to Turkey\u2019s Economy Minstry. \u201cAnd Turks, I think, will want to continue to get rich.\u201dFollowing a series of economic overhauls in the early 2000s, just before the A.K.P. came to power, Turkey\u2019s economy surged by an average of more than 5 percent a year. Per capita income more than quadrupled over that time, to $11,000 a year from $2,500, according to Sinan Ulgen, the chairman of the Center for Economic and Foreign Policy Studies, a research organization in Istanbul.With the boom in Turkey\u2019s private sector, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government expanded social services, such as health care, and infrastructure, providing ordinary Turks with a sense of economic empowerment.\u201cTurks got to know what it means to be treated as a basic citizen, in many different ways,\u201d Mr. Ucer said.Even so, there was plenty of evidence, even before the recent instability, of cracks in Turkey\u2019s economic facade.Despite the impressive growth, unemployment, which has improved, remained relatively high at about 9 percent. An explosion of consumer credit in recent years has raised fears, even as it has powered a new consumer society and ensured that all the new shopping malls sprouting in Istanbul would have a steady flow of customers.In November, the police captured a man near Mr. Erdogan\u2019s office in Ankara, the Turkish capital, who appeared to be carrying a bomb. At first, the police thought he was trying to assassinate the prime minister. But it turned out that the bomb was fake, and that the man was trying to stage a protest over his mounting credit card debt, which local news reports put at $17,000.On Thursday night, a group of men loudly debated the economy in a cafe in Ortakoy, an Istanbul neighborhood on the shores of the Bosporus. One of the men, Levent Koray, a fruit stall owner, spoke about what he viewed as the diminishing economic prospects for men like him.\u201cFor the last 10 years, because of the opportunities given to us by the prime minister, we could come to this cafe and play games freely while relaxing and talking about football, our children, our dreams, but now all we do is talk about our financial problems,\u201d he said.Big business, he said, has ultimately fared better under Mr. Erdogan, pushing out small players like him.\u201cTen years ago, I was the fruit king of this district,\u201d Mr. Koray said. \u201cNow, my stall is in the shadows of three giant grocery chains that were given land by the government. People walk straight past me now.\u201dWith the street protests, Mr. Erdogan was able to order a harsh police crackdown to restore order. Mr. Erdogan has countered the corruption inquiry \u2014 believed to be led by followers of the exiled Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who have taken up posts in the police force and judiciary \u2014 by purging the state of police officials and prosecutors. But with the economy, with its reliance on foreign capital, Mr. Erdogan is largely powerless, forced for now to defend the currency with the higher interest rates he deplores.\u201cIt\u2019s almost unavoidable for Turkey to go through a protracted period of low growth,\u201d Mr. Ulgen said.Throughout these crises, Mr. Erdogan has been able to rely on the support of Turkey\u2019s religious conservatives, who account for roughly half of the electorate. But now, in the midst of economic uncertainty, his popularity is slipping.Yet even more is at stake for Mr. Erdogan than his electoral hopes. His ambitious economic goals for Turkey to reach by 2023 \u2014 the 100th anniversary of the Turkish republic \u2014 are now in peril. Some of his grandest construction projects, like a third airport for Istanbul that officials have said would be the world\u2019s largest, are in jeopardy.\u201cThere is no economy to finance these projects anymore,\u201d Mr. Ucer said. \u201cA lot of these things will probably get shelved.\u201dCeylan Yeginsu and Sebnem Arsu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Delhi\u2019s New Chief Minister Strikes a Chord With the People", "Date": "2014-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From IndiaNEW DELHI \u2014 In Delhi\u2019s winter, the practicality of warm clothes ensures that even the poor do not seem as austere as they do in other seasons. But the capital\u2019s new chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, has somehow managed to maintain his perennial simplicity even at the risk of looking somewhat ridiculous. Part of his attire this winter is a scarf below his customary white oval cap. A comment on my Facebook page described him as looking like an Emirates flight attendant. But the nation is fascinated by him. Never before in modern India have the elite and the poor agreed on a political matter, but now there is a consensus that Mr. Kejriwal is a hero of these times. Long an agitator who chiefly targeted political corruption, he contested the Delhi state elections, and on Saturday was sworn in as its seventh chief minister. He rode the subway to the swearing-in ceremony. He has declined state security cover and the sprawling official residence.His Aam Admi Party, or A.A.P., which had initially planned to contest about 100 of the 545 seats in the impending general elections to the lower house of the Indian Parliament, is now considering contesting about 300 seats. The previous general elections, in 2009, were contested by more than 350 political parties representing scores of regional, communal and social interests. The strategy of A.A.P. is to be the mother ship of numerous citizens\u2019 pressure groups and mass movements across the country. It plans to broaden its mission beyond fighting political corruption and endear itself to those who want to cast a vote against a variety of government policies.Mr. Kejriwal\u2019s triumph is a point in time in the evolution of both elite and mass protests in India, an evolution that has been accelerated by economics, technology and the intoxicating comforts of feudalism, which have long ensured that the rich, in many ways, have a better life in India than in developed nations. These factors have resulted in the urban middle class becoming increasingly interested in the nation\u2019s political destiny.As recently as 2007, there was something comical about how the urban Indian middle class protested. They usually carried sunblock and stood holding placards in English. It was as if they were not protesting so much as talking to each other. Mass protests, at the time, were festive outings with jovial protesters often waving to television cameras. There were also, of course, very serious protests by the poor, but their marches seldom interested the mainstream news media. But something else was going on. The middle-class enchantment with escaping to the affluent West was coming to an end. Even as India\u2019s elite was prospering, the West was going through hard times. Then, in 2008, 10 terrorists from Pakistan attacked South Mumbai, a refuge of the rich. Mumbai\u2019s elite erupted in anger, blaming the politicians they criticized as not being competent enough to protect them. When a politician came to pay his respects to the dead, he was driven away by a group of college students. This was unprecedented in Mumbai. In the general elections that followed, Meera Sanyal, a banker whose close friend had died in the attack, ran as a candidate from the Mumbai South constituency. Ms. Sanyal received extraordinary media coverage, and was impressive when she spoke of her plans, but she fared poorly in the election. It appeared that the educated urban middle class would never be able to influence Indian politics, even with the news media on its side.The middle-class revolt revived in 2011 as the global economy sank further. After a series of high-profile political scandals and a mass movement against the political class, Mr. Kejriwal emerged as a hero of the poor and the miserable. He was a beneficiary of middle-class anger against politicians, and the news media made him a national figure, but his success lay in realizing that the voters, who are mostly poor, mattered more.

{"Headline": "With China Awash in Money, Leaders Start to Weigh Raising the Floodgates", "Date": "2014-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Move over, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke. Step aside, Mario Draghi and Haruhiko Kuroda. When it comes to monetary stimulus, Zhou Xiaochuan, the longtime governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, has no rivals. The latest data released by China on Wednesday show that the country\u2019s rapid growth in money supply has continued. Mr. Zhou and his colleagues at the Chinese central bank have only begun the difficult and dangerous task of reining it in. The amount of money sloshing around China\u2019s economy, according to a broad measure that is closely watched here, has now tripled since the end of 2006. China\u2019s tidal wave of money has powered the economy to new heights, but it has also helped drive asset prices through the roof. Housing prices have soared, feeding fears of a bubble while leaving many ordinary Chinese feeling poor and left out.There are big differences, of course, between China and the major Western industrial powers. The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are trying to prevent deflation and help their economies recover from the lingering consequences of the financial crisis and the Great Recession. They have little reason to fear inflation.The mechanics of China\u2019s monetary policy stimulus are also different from the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing. The Fed has been effectively creating money by buying bonds and other securities. The People\u2019s Bank of China has been creating money to a considerable extent by issuing more renminbi to bankroll its purchase of hundreds of billions of dollars a year in currency markets to minimize the appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar and keep Chinese exports inexpensive in foreign markets; the central bank disclosed on Wednesday that the country\u2019s foreign reserves, mostly dollars, soared $508.4 billion last year, a record increase.Moreover, the rapidly expanding money supply reflects a flood of loans from the banking system and the so-called shadow banking system that have kept afloat many inefficient state-owned enterprises and bankrolled the construction of huge overcapacity in the manufacturing sector.Cao Maolan, a real estate broker in Nanjing in east-central China, helped a young woman buy her first apartment seven years ago, a 650-square-foot unit for which she paid the equivalent of $60,000. The young woman sold it in less than two years for a 50 percent profit, Ms. Cao said, and has traded up to a bigger apartment every year since then, now living in a 2,150-square-foot apartment for which she paid $985,000, mostly in cash with the profits from previous deals.\u201cEveryone who bought property has done really well,\u201d Ms. Cao said.But young college graduates, whose numbers have quintupled in the last decade as China\u2019s universities expand rapidly, worry that they may never be able to afford to buy a new home.Zheng Yilong, a 22-year-old college graduate in Wuhan, an industrial hub of 10 million people in central China, is paid $575 a month in a low-level banking job with limited opportunities for raises. But he has found that even a 540-square-foot apartment on the outer edge of the metropolitan area, with a long commute, costs $98,400, or 14 years\u2019 pay.\u201cI cannot even begin to imagine how I can earn and save enough to buy even a small unit here in Wuhan, so I don\u2019t think about it \u2014 there is no solution,\u201d he said in a telephone interview Wednesday.The money supply and credit data released Wednesday morning show that the central bank has begun to tackle the problem, but only slowly. The broad measure of money supply, known as M2, grew 13.6 percent last year, barely less than its increase of 13.8 percent a year earlier, the Chinese central bank said in a news release.This means the money supply is still charging well ahead of inflation-adjusted economic growth, which has been about 7.6 percent; the exact figure for the fourth quarter of last year is scheduled for release on Monday.Growth in M2 almost reached 30 percent at the end of 2009, when China was using monetary policy to offset the effects of the global financial crisis. China has reduced the pace of money supply growth since then, but kept it well above the pace of economic growth throughout, which means it has done little to sop up the extra cash issued during the crisis.The question now is whether the central bank can further slow the growth of credit and the money supply without causing a slump in housing prices or a sharp slowdown in the credit-dependent corporate sector. Even the very modest slowdown in money supply growth so far has already contributed to two sharp, but short-lived, increases in interbank interest rates in June and December, which roiled markets in China and around the world.China\u2019s central bank \u201cis in a very difficult situation; it needs to tighten, but the whole system is not used to tightening, they are used to money printing,\u201d said Shen Jianguang, a China monetary economist in the Hong Kong office of Mizuho Securities, a Japanese investment bank.M2 encompasses money in circulation, checking accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit. It is the main money supply indicator watched by the People\u2019s Bank of China in trying to balance the need for economic growth with the dangers of inflation.M2 has grown so fast in China not just because the central bank has been issuing a lot of renminbi, but also because the state-owned banking system has lent and relent those renminbi with encouragement from the government, creating a multiplier effect.China has also undergone a financial liberalization in the past five years that has accelerated the pace of lending. An extensive and loosely regulated shadow banking system has emerged, partly because of the willingness of regulators to allow banks to classify loans to new financing companies not as corporate loans but as interbank loans, for which little capital needs to be reserved.The Federal Reserve pays little attention to money supply measures, since they do not provide much guidance to setting monetary policy. While the Fed\u2019s ultra-low interest rates and extra monetary stimulus have helped revive the housing market and lifted the stock market, the broadly measured money supply has increased more slowly in the United States because American banks have been much more cautious about lending money.Consumer inflation has not yet become a big problem in China: Falling commodity prices and widespread manufacturing overcapacity held down consumer inflation to 2.6 percent last year.But asset price inflation, notably the country\u2019s soaring real estate prices and corresponding decline in housing affordability, has been a constant worry for the authorities.Hilda Wang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Asia\u2019s Aging Population Will Be a Topic at Davos", "Date": "2014-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorld Economic Forum in DavosHONG KONG \u2014 When Ankur Gupta tells people what he does for a living, he often gets surprised looks. Mr. Gupta works in India, but instead of catering to the nation\u2019s youthful consumers with baby food or toys, he looks after a portfolio of retirement homes for Ashiana Housing, a property company.\u201cHere I am, in one of the youngest societies of the world, selling retirement homes to seniors \u2014 no wonder people sometimes think I must be crazy,\u201d Mr. Gupta said.Ashiana Housing\u2019s three retirement homes in India each have badminton courts, jogging tracks and gardens, as well as a meditation hall and temple. Their residents are upper-middle-class Indians \u2014 retired businessmen, doctors and army officers. Two more homes already are in the pipeline as Mr. Gupta and his colleagues bet on rising demand from a richer and older India. The median age of the country\u2019s 1.2 billion residents is just under 27 years, a decade younger than in the United States and nearly two decades younger than in Germany. But India, like much of Asia, is aging rapidly, and only slowly waking up to that fact. By 2030, according to United Nations projections, 565 million Asians will be aged 65 years or older \u2014 up from about 300 million now. By 2050, that number will soar to 900 million \u2014 about one in every six Asians. Those aged 80 or above will account for 4.3 percent of the Asian population, more than three times the number they represent today.\u201cPeople haven\u2019t fully realized the speed with which this demographic turn is approaching,\u201d said Frederic Neumann, a co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC in Hong Kong. Asia\u2019s \u201cdemographic dividend,\u201d the flood of young workers that helped drive the region\u2019s rapid growth in recent decades, is coming to an end, Mr. Neumann said.As business and political leaders gather in Davos, Switzerland, much of the conversation about Asia will focus on the immediate challenges facing the region: China\u2019s economic overhaul; the upcoming elections in India, Indonesia and Thailand; Japan\u2019s efforts to ramp up growth; and the impact of the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s moves to dial back its support of the American economy.But it is Asia\u2019s rapid aging that is \u201cperhaps the single biggest economic and social obstacle\u201d confronting its future, said Donghyun Park, a senior economist at the Asian Development Bank in Manila. \u201cEven in younger countries, the share of the elderly is rising \u2014 the demographics of the region will change beyond recognition over the next few decades.\u201dAsia\u2019s aging has big implications globally. It ultimately means fewer workers and higher wages, adding to the cost of goods manufactured in Asia. And it could mean less dynamic growth in a region that is increasingly important to the world economy.Throughout the region, companies, governments and ordinary citizens aim to profit from or prevent the aging trend.Some of the most headline-grabbing responses have been government-sponsored, like China\u2019s revision of its one-child policy. Others have been enterprising at a micro level, like speed-dating events in Singapore. And some have been more entrepreneurial, like Mr. Gupta\u2019s retirement homes in India.The challenges of the aging process are nothing new for Japan, where roughly a quarter of the population is 65 or above, far more than in the United States or Europe. For decades, Japan has sought to stem the slide, and the government\u2019s efforts to haul the economy out of its long slumber are largely motivated by the prospect of still more, and rapid, population aging.Japan\u2019s corporate sector has for years sought to reduce its dependence on the country\u2019s shrinking population by expanding abroad. The $10.6 billion bid last week by Suntory, a brewing and distilling company, for the maker of Jim Beam whiskey is just one example of this trend.Others companies have changed their product lineups. Unicharm, which makes diapers for infants, has expanded into incontinence products for the elderly \u2014 just one example of how companies are trying to tap into the increased spending power of Asia\u2019s seniors.Singapore\u2019s efforts to cope with changing demographics include a government agency that promotes boy-meets-girl events, offers advice on dating, and works with dating agencies to try to raise the country\u2019s fertility rate, which, at just 1.2 births per woman, is among the lowest in the world. Last week, the agency promoted a lunch talk on \u201cHow Simple Gestures Can Cause The Opposite Sex To Reject You!\u201d Next month, there is a back-to-school-themed \u201cdating fest\u201d featuring two local celebrities.Hong Kong, which is in the midst of reviewing its population policy, is mulling measures like raising the retirement age for civil servants, ways to encourage more women to join the work force and, on a more offbeat note, possible subsidies for fertility treatment.China, with 1.3 billion inhabitants and an economy that dominates the region, presents some of the greatest population challenges \u2014 and opportunities.Roughly 9 percent of Chinese, well over 110 million people, are now aged 65 or older. That percentage is only slightly below that in the United States. Moreover, it will rise to more than 16 percent by the end of the next decade, according to United Nations projections, meaning that by then China\u2019s population will be roughly as old as Europe\u2019s is now.The authorities have taken note, and recently announced a relaxation of the decades-old one-child policy that was widely seen to have contributed to the demographic woes that China now faces. The tweak will allow couples to have two children if either parent was a single child, and could lead to hundreds of thousands of additional births a year. But, analysts say, it is unlikely to change China\u2019s demographic profile any time soon, not least because many of those who are eligible may stick with one child, after all, in a bid to focus their financial resources.\u201cDemographics are like natural forces: You can ease the pain, but you cannot not prevent them altogether,\u201d said Mr. Neumann, the HSBC economist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Sochi, a High Bar for Putin", "Date": "2014-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 The majestic view at sunset from the terrace of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s dacha overlooking the Black Sea told you right away why he fought so hard to bring the 2014 Winter Olympics to this resort. Sochi is one of Mr. Putin\u2019s favorite places.On a visit to his presidential mansion in 2007, shortly after Russia had won the 2014 Games, a group of us listened intently as he looked forward to the Games as vital proof that Russia was back and that he had restored his country to its rightful role in the world. Sochi, he said, would give back to Russia its lost glory. This month, he added that the Games will be a \u201cmoral moment\u201d for Russia.The Olympic Games are supposed to symbolize international cooperation as well as competition. Of course, any country hosting the Games wants to highlight its best features. But Sochi may be one of those times in Olympic history when a leader wants to use the Games for a much more specific political purpose \u2014 in this case, to prove that the system he presides over is preferable to that in many participating countries. To that end, he is insisting that Russia is the guardian of a culture that sets superior moral and political standards.Sochi may well represent a milestone for Russia, but perhaps not the one Mr. Putin has envisaged. For all its beauty and history, Sochi and the circumstances around the Olympics have dampened, rather than heightened, the luster evoked by the Russian leader, and not just because Sochi\u2019s subtropical climate will be a challenge for Winter Olympics. More important is its proximity to the volatile North Caucasus, where Islamic militants clash daily with Russian forces; that backdrop has forced extraordinary security measures, heightened after two bombings in Volgograd that killed 34 people in December, and recent reports that female suicide bombers may have entered the Olympic Games enclave. The cost of building the untested facilities has been reported to be an unprecedented $51 billion. And Russian legislation banning homosexual \u201cpropaganda\u201d has prompted calls for protests and boycotts.Moreover, Sochi has now become a symbol of how Russia is defining itself as a unique civilization no longer interested in integration with the West. With increasing forcefulness, Mr. Putin is offering instead a model for a world he portrays as weary of the West\u2019s arrogance and attempts to impose its values.Sochi\u2019s message: Russia is a status quo power, while the United States is a revisionist power seeking to use the principles of democracy promotion and humanitarian intervention to force change on other governments around the world \u2014 including on Russia\u2019s borders and in Russia itself. Internationally, this self-image translates into support for absolute sovereignty and not meddling in other countries\u2019 domestic politics \u2014 at least in principle, if not in practice, when it comes to its own nearest neighbors, like Ukraine and Georgia.Around the world, Moscow\u2019s message to authoritarian regimes is: We won\u2019t interfere in your internal affairs; your system of government is up to you. And vice versa.Recently, President Putin asserted that Western Christianity had lost its moral compass by supporting L.G.B.T. rights and that the Russian Orthodox Church was the true guardian of Christian values. And, he added, these values are also compatible with traditional Islamic values \u2014 an important message in a country where ethnic and religious tensions are on the rise. The signal from Sochi is that the West has no right to impose its alien conceptions of \u201chuman rights\u201d on Russian Christians and Muslims, and that athletes and spectators should respect Russia\u2019s laws and customs. To that end, they should also refrain from using the special protest zone near the Games to express their opposition to Russia\u2019s laws.Russia\u2019s quest for recognition has already suffered because of the refusal of Western leaders to attend the Games\u2019 opening ceremony, even though China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, is going. The contrast with the high-level attendance at the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008 is striking. Neither President Obama nor Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will attend, a decision made after Russia granted asylum to Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked agency documents.Instead, the American delegation is to include several prominent gay athletes in an obvious rebuke to Russia\u2019s anti-gay laws. This is an appropriate response. A boycott reminiscent of the one against the 1980 Moscow Olympics would have hurt the American athletes without having any impact on Russia\u2019s L.G.B.T. legislation.To be sure, the international community\u2019s reticence seems to have had some effect. In response to growing criticism of Russian human rights violations, and seeking to pre-empt any more, Mr. Putin unexpectedly granted amnesty before Christmas for the former oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, two members of the punk band Pussy Riot and other political prisoners. These releases, however, should not be mistaken for harbingers of liberalization, since many opposition activists remain in jail.Sochi ought to have demonstrated how different Russia today is from the ailing country Mr. Putin inherited in 2000. If the Games go off without any terrorist incident or serious political clash, and if Russian athletes excel, Sochi may well fulfill the Russian president\u2019s immediate hopes. But the shiny new sports facilities only mask the deeper problems that Russia faces \u2014 a declining population, mortality rates for young men similar to those in sub-Saharan Africa, a growth rate predicted to remain at 1.4 percent for the next year and an economy that remains too dependent on the price of oil and on income from other energy exports.The Sochi Olympics will not be the game changer Mr. Putin initially hoped for. After the spotlight is removed from the palm trees lining the Black Sea shore, the Kremlin will, true to its past, continue to assert itself forcefully on the international stage while postponing efforts to deal with its internal challenges.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "National Park Proves a Hard Gift to Give", "Date": "2014-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPATTEN, Me. \u2014 Lucas St. Clair pulled up to an overlook in Maine\u2019s North Woods to a stunning vista of Mount Katahdin, the state\u2019s highest peak and the endpoint of the Appalachian Trail. Stretched out below was a vast green carpet of pine and spruce flecked with golden aspens and blazing red maples; Millinocket Lake glistened in the distance.\u201cI think it\u2019s national-park worthy,\u201d he said.This was not an idle observation. Mr. St. Clair and his mother, Roxanne Quimby, who owns the land, have been trying for years to turn these woods into a national park. But ferocious opposition has stalled their plan, partly out of antipathy toward Ms. Quimby, who, against Maine tradition, closed off her lands to hunters and snowmobilers, and partly because many in this fiercely independent region loathe the idea of giving Washington a toehold.Besides, it is actually hard to create a national park.However, they insist, the land that they want for a national park must be designated a park, not a national forest or monument.\u201cNational parks are the gold standard for tourism, for conservation and for recreation,\u201d Mr. St. Clair said as he drove through the woods and pointed out the land\u2019s attributes: its expanse of forest, the granite outcroppings, the abundance of wildlife. And, he said, a full-fledged national park is the only \u201cbrand\u201d that could accomplish one of their goals: to draw enough tourists to help revitalize the local economy.Some say that Mr. St. Clair\u2019s campaign may have created some slight cracks in the region\u2019s fierce resistance.George Smith, a former executive director of the Sportsman\u2019s Alliance of Maine and proud owner of a \u201cBan Roxanne\u201d bumper sticker, once flatly opposed the idea. Now an outdoors writer, he is still not enthused about a park, but his hostility has ebbed, and here, that is considered progress.\u201cLucas has been remarkably successful \u2014 not to the point where he\u2019s going to get his national park anytime soon, but I\u2019m hearing more supportive statements\u201d from those who think a park could help the economy, Mr. Smith said. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost 5,000 jobs in Millinocket, and those jobs aren\u2019t coming back.\u201dBut opposition runs deep. Beyond the years of resentment toward Ms. Quimby for closing her lands, there is a towering distrust here of the federal government. Many residents worry, contrary to Mr. St. Clair\u2019s assurances, that the government would seize control of local decision making, take over even more land, ban hunting and snowmobiling, and ruin the forest products industry by restricting air emissions from the mills and limiting the timber supply.\u201cIf a park comes in, it would shut the mills,\u201d said Mark Marston, a selectman in East Millinocket and vice chairman of the Maine Woods Coalition, which opposes the park. \u201cPeople in Millinocket don\u2019t make what they used to, but at least they\u2019re working, which is better than seasonal jobs at a park.\u201dAnd like many others, he doubted that these woods hold any special attraction for tourists. When visitors stay at his nearby camp, which has swimming and boating, he said, \u201cThey say to me: \u2018But what is there to do? The bugs are bad and my cellphone doesn\u2019t work.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. St. Clair has not drawn up a specific park proposal; there is no point unless he wins enough local support to convince Maine\u2019s congressional delegation that the residents want a park, and then the delegation has to convince the rest of Congress. Three of the four members of the delegation oppose the idea, though they said in interviews that they were watching developments.Senator Susan Collins, a Republican who has long opposed a park, said that Mr. St. Clair\u2019s approach was a \u201csea change\u201d from his mother\u2019s because he was listening to people. She still opposes a park for fear of harming the forest products industry but says she has \u201cnot shut the door.\u201d\u201cLucas has made real progress on the recreational issues,\u201d she said, \u201cbut there\u2019s still a long way to go on the economic issues and on the philosophical question of federal ownership of the land.\u201dSenator Angus King, an independent, described himself as \u201copposed and skeptical but listening.\u201d\u201cThere is more receptivity to the idea because of the tough economic circumstances in that area,\u201d Mr. King said. To change his mind, he said, he would \u201cneed to be convinced that the benefits of economic development would outweigh the costs of losing control over a resource\u201d to the federal government.Representative Michael H. Michaud, a Democrat in whose district would be home to the proposed park, once worked in the mills and is running for governor. He, too, is concerned about the economy. Ed Gilman, his spokesman, said in an email that Mr. Michaud \u201cwants an in-depth and complete consideration of the North Woods\u2019 economic development options before he can say whether or not he supports the park.\u201dRepresentative Chellie Pingree, a Democrat who represents Southern Maine, which is more liberal than northern Maine, is the only one to favor a park. \u201cMy constituents are very supportive of a national park and see it as a way to preserve much of the natural habitat and help the economy,\u201d she said.The rest of the delegation will move \u201conly when they feel their constituents move,\u201d Ms. Pingree said.That may not be for a long time. But Mr. St. Clair seems prepared to wait. \u201cIt\u2019s often a knock-down, drag-out fight to create a park, and sometimes it takes 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the outcome is always positive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And, at the stroke of midnight in Eastern Europe on Tuesday, the currency even added a new member.Latvia is the 18th nation to adopt the euro, a development that might have seemed unlikely only two years ago, when many wondered if the euro would even survive.But now that the European economy has stabilized \u2014 and talk has quieted that Greece may leave and splinter the Europe\u2019s currency union \u2014 the euro is actually appreciating in value. The euro rose 4.5 percent against the dollar in 2013, its best showing in years. The euro is now worth $1.38.\u201cThis is a major event, not only for Latvia, but for the euro area itself, which remains stable, attractive and open to new members,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, said in a welcoming statement on Tuesday.The tiny Baltic nation is the first to join the euro zone since neighboring Estonia in 2011. With 2.2 million people, Latvia is unlikely to shift the balance of power in the euro zone, which will have a total of 333 million residents. But Latvia at least keeps alive the idea that despite its problems the euro club still has potential to grow.Polls showed that many Latvians were ambivalent about giving up their own currency, the lats. As a member of the currency union, Latvia no longer has the option of using the exchange rate as a safety valve in times of crisis.However, the lats has been closely tied to the euro in any case. Many Latvians have mortgages or other loans denominated in euros, as is typical among countries in the European Union that are not also members of the euro zone. Latvia\u2019s central bank has sought to maintain a stable exchange rate, in part to protect borrowers whose loan payments would soar if the lats lost value.\u201cYour country\u2019s strong economic recovery offers a clear message of encouragement to other European countries undergoing a difficult economic adjustment,\u201d Olli Rehn, vice president of the European Commission responsible for economic and monetary affairs and the euro, said in a statement.As a euro member, Latvia also gains more influence over monetary policy. The governor of the central bank, Ilmars Rimsevics, will automatically become a member of the governing council of the European Central Bank, which sets benchmark interest rates for the euro zone.Mr. Rimsevics, who earned degrees at St. Lawrence University in Canton, N.Y., and Clarkson University in Potsdam, N.Y., will have one vote on the council as its 24th member. At least on paper, he has the same clout as presidents of the central banks of larger countries like Germany or France.Despite whatever doubts some Latvians may have about yoking themselves to a currency still emerging from a severe crisis, the euro signifies another stage in the country\u2019s trek from Soviet state to a full-fledged member of Europe.\u201cJoining the euro marks the completion of Latvia\u2019s journey back to the political and economic heart of our continent, and that is something for all of us to celebrate,\u201d Mr. Rehn said.Lats will continue to circulate alongside the euro for two weeks, at which point the euro will become the sole legal tender. However, lats can still be exchanged for euros at the central bank indefinitely. Automatic teller machines in Latvia are supposed to begin issuing euros within half an hour after the new year begins.Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about Latvia\u2019s admittance to the euro zone on New Year\u2019s Day misstated the euro\u2019s value at that time. It was worth $1.38; it was not \u201c1.38 to the dollar.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egypt\u2019s Ruler Eyes Riskier Role: The Presidency", "Date": "2014-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 When Egypt\u2019s first freely elected president, Mohamed Morsi, named Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi defense minister, the officer pledged to keep the military out of politics and make way for civilian democracy.A year later, General Sisi ousted Mr. Morsi, insisting the military was answering the people\u2019s call to secure \u201ctheir revolution.\u201d Just three weeks later, he once again said he was turning to the people when he urged them to take to the streets to give him a personal \u201cmandate\u201d to crush Mr. Morsi\u2019s base of support in the Muslim Brotherhood.Then on Monday, Field Marshal Sisi \u2014 he added the title the same day \u2014 took the first formal step to become Egypt\u2019s next president, insisting he was yielding once again to \u201cthe free choice of the masses\u201d and \u201cthe call of duty.\u201d With that, he paved the way for Egypt to return to the kind of military-backed governance that was supposed to end with the Arab Spring of 2011.In his two years in public life as defense minister and then de facto ruler, Field Marshal Sisi has combined the cunning of a spymaster with the touch of a born politician to develop an extraordinary combination of power and popularity not seen here since Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser ended the British-backed monarchy six decades ago.But by moving to formally take the reins as head of state, Field Marshal Sisi is taking on a far greater and riskier challenge. Promoted by the state and private news media as a national savior, Field Marshal Sisi will have to manage an increasingly unruly domestic population, including an elite expecting a full restoration of its privileges; generals who may see him as only the first among equals; a broad section of the public that still feels empowered to protest; at least hundreds of thousands of Morsi supporters who openly reject the new government; and a terrorist insurgency determined to thwart any hope of stability.\u201cI think the economy eventually will be the undoing of anyone in that position, because all the same issues that led to the 2011 uprising are still there \u2014 the youth unemployment, their marginalization from politics, the overly bloated Civil Service, the unsustainable food and energy subsidies,\u201d said Samer S. Shehata, a University of Oklahoma political scientist.Now the continuing protests and violence have squashed any hope of a swift recovery of the crucial tourism sector, he said, and \u201cno one has the will required to take the necessary and painful steps required to move the country forward.\u201dField Marshal Sisi\u2019s backers argue that his status as a charismatic national hero will enable him to break the logjam. \u201cThose who love you will swallow bricks for you, and your enemies would wish you make a mistake,\u201d Ahmed El Nagar, an Egyptian economist, declared in a recent television interview about the prospect of a Sisi presidency, quoting an Egyptian proverb. \u201cNo matter how bitter the prescription of reforming the economy is, if it comes from someone the people love, they will endure it.\u201dBut Khaled Salah, editor of Youm el-Saba, a popular pro-Sisi newspaper, said that expectations were the problem. \" \u2018Let Sisi solve it\u2019 \u2014 this idea is most dangerous in the public now,\u201d Mr. Salah said. \u201cThe very big dreams and expectations won\u2019t work.\u201dField Marshal Sisi has given almost no indications of what policies or platform he might pursue as president. The most notable characteristic of his six months as Egypt\u2019s de facto ruler since the takeover has been the often lethal and ruthless crackdown on the Brotherhood and, increasingly, liberal dissenters as well.But the nearly universal expectation that he would run for president was confirmed Monday when he presided over a meeting of his top generals to bless his candidacy. In a statement, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces called his presidential campaign \u201can onus and an obligation,\u201d and said that Field Marshal Sisi considered it \u201ca call that demands compliance.\u201dAlthough at least two other candidates in the 2012 presidential elections have left open the possibility of running, few believe they might stop Field Marshal Sisi from becoming Egypt\u2019s sixth president and its fifth from the ranks of the military.But he has close ties with his Western military counterparts. He trained at military colleges in Britain and the United States, and as chief of military intelligence was a key conduit for communications between Egyptian and Israeli military leaders.Egypt\u2019s three-year experiment with democracy has ousted Hosni Mubarak and deposed Mohamed Morsi, the country\u2019s first elected leader. Explore key moments of their rule and the aftermath.His military career began as an escape from hard circumstances. Born on Nov. 19, 1954, Field Marshal Sisi grew up in the overcrowded dirt lanes of the neighborhood of Al Gamaliya, in a district of Cairo. Military colleagues say his father ran a stall in the Khan al-Khalili market, the bazaar patronized by generations of tourists. He escaped that career by winning a place in a prestigious air force high school.His military colleagues say he shares the dutiful piety of average Egyptians. He is up at 5 a.m. for dawn prayers. And his wife, unlike the spouses of any previous president except Mr. Morsi, covers her hair with a head scarf. Where Egypt\u2019s previous military presidents sometimes incorporated Islam into their public personae or speeches \u2014 most notably Anwar el-Sadat \u2014 Field Marshal Sisi has displayed a more natural fluency in the verses of the Quran.Before becoming defense minister, Field Marshal Sisi had risen through the ranks to chief of military intelligence, where, some scholars, say he may have cultivated his political wiles. As late as the spring of 2013, just months before he led Mr. Morsi\u2019s ouster, he publicly reiterated his pledge to keep the army in the barracks, warning that military intervention in politics could drag the country backward.As discontent with Mr. Morsi grew, Field Marshal Sisi suggested protests might nonetheless move him to intervene. And after millions turned out in response, he declared on July 3, 2013, that the armed forces were still \u201cfirst to announce their need to remain distant from political action\u201d but felt compelled by the public calls to save the country from ruin.As president, Field Marshal Sisi would have to manage a set of demands that are far more complicated than those he faced as the commanding officer in a period of crisis, and than those previous presidents encountered. The tumult of the revolt has highlighted the failings of a system in which each institution of government operates quasi-independently with a self-interest all its own. Then there is post-revolutionary public.\u201cIt is a society in complete mobilization mode, totally restive,\u201d said Mona El-Ghobashy, a political scientist at Barnard.\u201cIt is not the monarchical presidency that Nasser created and Sadat and Mubarak inherited,\u201d she said, making a reference to President Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted in 2011. \u201cSisi faces an entirely different setup than the autopilot Mubarak was on.\u201dMayy El Sheikh contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ireland's Rebound Is European Blarney", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorDUBLIN \u2014 I was talking just before Christmas to a young man who sells shoes in a department store in Dublin. He told me that a television news crew had filmed interviews in the store the previous day. They wanted to know if sales were picking up during the vital holiday period, indicating that the battered Irish economy was, after five grim years, on the rise at last.Most of his colleagues said that, actually, sales were rather sluggish. One was more hopeful and said that there were signs of improvement. When the young man watched the TV news that night, he was not entirely surprised to find that the only interview that had made the cut was the one with the optimist.Everyone wants Ireland to be a good-news story, proof that a willingness to take the pain of prolonged austerity will be rewarded in the end. Ordinary citizens are hungry for some hope. The government, in the words of Deputy Prime Minister Eamon Gilmore, was \u201cdetermined that Ireland would be Europe\u2019s success story.\u201d An influential board member of the European Central Bank, J\u00f6rg Asmussen, says, \u201cThe Irish program is a success story.\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany praised Ireland as an example of how crisis countries could turn themselves around.The only problem is that, for most of us who actually live here, Ireland\u2019s success story feels less like \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d and more like \u201cRocky.\u201d We haven\u2019t been joyously liberated; we\u2019ve just withstood a lot of blows. We\u2019re still standing, but we\u2019ve taken so many punches that it\u2019s hard to see straight.Yes, things are finally looking up, but the hopeful vision is clouded by two nagging questions. Did they need to be so bleak for so long? And has the harsh medicine actually cured Ireland\u2019s ills?For conservatives, in particular, Ireland is the Tyra Banks of nations: a model country. The only problem is that they can\u2019t quite decide what Ireland is a model of. For a long time, when Ireland was booming, it was the perfect face of light regulation and low taxes. (With impeccably bad timing, Senator John McCain cited Ireland\u2019s low corporate taxes as a model for the United States in his presidential election debates with Senator Barack Obama in 2008 \u2014 just as Ireland was sliding into crisis.) Now, with Ireland tentatively emerging from its long slump, it is being cited as the great exemplar of the virtues of austerity.As the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, a fiscal hawk, put it in October: \u201cIreland did what Ireland had to do. And now everything is fine.\u201d Ireland was a success story when it was partying wildly and it is a success story when it is the Grim Reaper of international economics. Binge or purge, we can do no wrong.We Irish are eternal optimists, but Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s belief that everything is fine is a rare example of a German outdoing us in irrational exuberance. It is certainly true that, if you were to walk around the rebuilt Dublin docklands, with their shiny European headquarter offices for Google, Twitter, Facebook and Yahoo, and their slick cafes and hotels, you might conclude that if this is what an Irish crisis looks like, an Irish boom must be quite something to behold.The supercool new Marker Hotel and apartment complex, which opened its doors in April and cost 120 million euros ($163 million), could be in Los Angeles or Dubai. It looks down on the buoyant American architecture of Martha Schwartz\u2019s Grand Canal Square and a plush Daniel Libeskind theater. In a country wrecked by a spectacular property bubble, house prices in Dublin have begun to soar again, rising 13 percent in the last year. But Ireland has two economies: a global one dominated by American high-tech companies, and a domestic one in which most Irish workers have to make their living. The first is indeed booming. Not least because of those low corporate taxes, large global corporations find Dublin convivial for reasons other than its pubs and night life. The sheer scale of Ireland\u2019s dependence on this kind of investment for its exports can be judged by the fact that Irish gross domestic product took a serious hit in 2013 when Viagra (which is made by Pfizer in County Cork) went off patent in Europe. Broadly speaking, however, the global side of the Irish economy has remained robust.But home is where the heartache is: in the domestic economy outside the gated community of high-tech multinationals. Outside Dublin, property prices are still falling. Wages for most workers have dropped sharply. Unemployment remains very high at 12.8 percent \u2014 and that figure would be higher if not for emigration. There\u2019s always been a simple way to measure how well Ireland is doing: Go to the ports and airports after the Christmas vacation and count the young people waving goodbye to their parents as they head off to the United States, Canada, Australia or Britain, where they have gone to find work and opportunity.Other people protest in bad times; the Irish leave. And they\u2019ve been doing so in numbers that haven\u2019t been recorded since the 1980s. Nearly 90,000 people emigrated between April 2012 and April 2013 and close to 400,000 have left since the 2008 crisis. For a country with a population about the size of Kentucky\u2019s (about 4.5 million), that\u2019s a lot of people.There\u2019s no great mystery about why they\u2019re going: They don\u2019t believe in the success story. A major study by University College Cork found that most of the emigrants are graduates and that almost half of them left full-time jobs in Ireland to go abroad. These are not desperate refugees; they\u2019re bright young people who have lost faith in the idea that Ireland can give them the opportunities they want. They just don\u2019t buy into the narrative of a triumphant rebound.When the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank \u2014 the so-called troika \u2014 took over Ireland\u2019s fiscal governance in December 2010, they somehow convinced themselves that sharp cuts in public spending and reductions in wages would go hand in hand with economic growth. The I.M.F., for example, told us that the Irish economy would grow by 5.25 percent between 2011 and 2013. In fact, it grew at around half that rate.Common sense would have suggested that in an economy in which private investment had dried up (Irish investment rates are now about half the average for the euro zone), there might be a problem with slashing public investment as well. After five years of austerity, it is shocking but hardly surprising that one in four Irish children are growing up in households in which no one at all is in paid employment.Nor is it surprising that the departure of the troika at the end of 2013 and some modest signs of economic recovery have not been greeted by Riverdancing on the rooftops. Irish people were prepared to take some punishment; there\u2019s enough Catholic guilt still around for a story of sin and atonement to have considerable psychological purchase. People do look back ruefully on the Celtic Tiger years and admit that we deserved a whipping for thinking we could get rich by selling one another million-dollar houses. But they are not convinced that the cruel scale of the punishment was necessary or that the nasty medicine has, in fact, worked.Behind both of these propositions looms the great contradiction in the supposed success story of Irish austerity. It was austerity only for citizens.Running parallel to all the cuts in public spending and all the calls for fiscal responsibility has been a program of spending so lavish that it makes a drunken sailor look stingy. One part of the troika program was to cut wages, welfare, health care and education. The other was to insist that Ireland continue to put vast resources into its teetering banks, including the notorious, now liquidated, Anglo Irish Bank.The policy of No Bondholder Left Behind, on which the European Central Bank insisted, has been staggeringly expensive. To put it in perspective, the European Union has just agreed to create a fund of $75 billion to deal with all future banking crises in its member states. Tiny Ireland has spent $85 billion bailing out its own banks.Particularly galling to most Irish people is that there is now an almost casual admission that this was a pretty crazy idea. Olli Rehn, the European Union\u2019s economic affairs commissioner and one of the chief architects of Irish strategy since the crash, now says, \u201cIn retrospect, I think it is quite easy to spot some mistakes like the blanket guarantee for banks.\u201d This admission, though, does not imply any change of policy. \u201cBut that is now water under the bridge,\u201d he went on to say, \u201cand now we have redirected the river.\u201d Ireland, Mr. Rehn reassured us, is in \u201ca better place for the moment.\u201dBut the river has not been redirected: A torrent of debt continues to flow from the catastrophic decision to save bad banks at all costs. Hopes that Ireland\u2019s debts might be alleviated by its European partners in recognition of the country\u2019s role in saving the euro are now fading.Little Ireland took one for the team. In return, it gets a pat on the head and the dubious pleasure of being called a success story.This is why, in the end, the austerity program has not succeeded even in its basic aim of bringing down Ireland\u2019s sovereign debt, which actually rose sharply over the last five years. In 2009, it was 64 percent of G.D.P. Last year, it peaked at 125 percent. The debt has doubled while public spending has been slashed.In this, Ireland may be a model indeed: suffering to maintain an unreal image of slimmed-down perfection.A columnist for The\nIrish Times and a\nvisiting lecturer at\nPrinceton.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Uber\u2019s Surge-Pricing an Example of High-Tech Gouging?", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyAt 10 p.m. on New Year\u2019s Eve, I hailed a taxi outside my apartment in Adams Morgan and directed it to a friend\u2019s apartment in Shaw, a nearby neighborhood, also in Northwest Washington. It took a mere minute to find an open car, and the traffic-clogged two-mile trip cost $13, including tip.Three hours later, early in the morning on New Year\u2019s Day, I figured that hailing a cab would be difficult if not impossible, and I requested a black car from the app-based service Uber. It took three minutes for a sleek sedan to arrive, and Uber let me know that I would be charged two and a half times its normal fare \u2014 part of its \u201csurge pricing\u201d strategy, implemented to help keep supply in line with demand, the company says. That ride home cost $47, no tip necessary.The same service. The same amount of time. The same trip, if in reverse. And a price differential of three and a half times. That kind of arithmetic has, of late, enraged many of Uber\u2019s users, who accuse the company of ripping off consumers when they need a ride the most: during holidays, deluges and snowstorms. The reaction from Uber has been equally strong. In short: Don\u2019t want to pay the fare? Fantastic. Don\u2019t use the service.From the perspective of the San Francisco-based start-up, the dispute is born of a mistaken identity more than anything else. Uber seems to be a fancy taxi company. It works much the way a taxi dispatcher does. It competes directly with taxi services in cities like Boston, Washington and New York \u2014 and it is rapidly expanding to cities including Doha, Hyderabad and Shenzhen. But Uber considers itself a market maker rather than a service provider. It\u2019s a network that connects drivers to fares, more like a travel agent than an airline.By bringing technological savvy and slick user experience to a highly regulated and often deeply inefficient market, Uber has won a dedicated following. Say goodbye to the clunky old taxi model, with wildly varying and often invisible demand met by wildly varying and often inaccessible supply. Say hello to a more transparent market, where Uber has real-time data on demand, nudges supply to meet it and makes it vastly easier for drivers and riders to connect.Everybody is better off when the market clears, the company argues, and an essential part of that is making riders pay the true market price of their ride. But the Uber experience has left some longing for inefficiencies they never knew they were benefiting from.Uber is upscale, and typically costs about 50 percent more than the local competition. More important, lately anyway, its rates fluctuate with demand. When a lot of people are looking for an Uber car \u2014 like during a recent New York snowstorm, or Washington on New Year\u2019s Eve \u2014 it sets the rate higher, in the hope of increasing supply, by enticing more of its drivers to come out or stay out. (Regardless of intent, the prices jump quickly, and from a user\u2019s point of view, work more as a form of demand-limiting price discrimination than supply-inducing incentive.)During a recent New York snowstorm, some rides cost 8.25 times the standard price. The response from the tiny violin chorus was fervent. Salman Rushdie took to Twitter to kvetch about surge pricing. Tim O\u2019Reilly, the digital-media guru, accused the service of price gouging. Even Jessica Seinfeld, recipient of so much syndication bounty, Instagrammed a receipt for a $415 Uber ride with the hashtags #neverforget, #neveragain and #real. And in one spectacular, if anonymous, freakout, an enraged user wrote to the company saying that he used to find the service \u201camazing,\u201d until he spent $360 on two rides on a Saturday. The kicker: \u201cI WILL NEVER USE YOUR COMPANY AGAIN! I AM OUTRAGED AND DISGUSTED THAT YOU WOULD JACK UP YOUR CHARGES THAT MUCH BECAUSE OF A SNOW STORM!!!\u201dThat complaint got a formal response from Uber\u2019s chief executive, Travis Kalanick. \u201cGet some popcorn,\u201d he advised readers on his Facebook page before publishing his own long retort. \u201cWe do not own cars nor do we employ drivers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHigher prices are required in order to get cars on the road and keep them on the road during the busiest times. This maximizes the number of trips and minimizes the number of people stranded. The drivers have other options as well. In short, without Surge Pricing, there would be no car available at all.\u201dOver email, Kalanick said that Uber\u2019s proprietary surge-pricing algorithm tries to maximize the number of rides, not revenue. It would prefer to match 1,000 fares at the baseline price than 100 fares at 11 times that rate; in other words, even if that might mean less money for Uber. (The company takes 20 percent of all fares.) \u201cIf we can do more trips at a lower surge multiple, then the algorithms will automatically lower the multiple,\u201d Kalanick said. \u201cSurge pricing is critical to get suppliers on the road and on our system. Without it, we would do significantly fewer trips.\u201dBut on a night like New Year\u2019s Eve, does a multiple of seven really draw out more drivers than a multiple of five? According to Kalanick, yes. But there is no way for customers to gauge supply and demand for themselves beyond looking at the dynamic-pricing multiple. And dynamic pricing is still not the same thing as true market pricing \u2014 like an auction system in which riders and drivers bid for one another\u2019s services. Its opacity goes a long way to explaining the frustration it has generated.For Uber, one risk seems to be that its surge pricing might work in the short term but alienate customers in the long term. Say you decide to blow $100 on a short ride one rainy night, when the algorithm fails to entice enough drivers onto the road and the prices surge. Like Jessica Seinfeld, you decide \u201cnever again.\u201d Is the algorithm really ensuring the maximum number of rides in that scenario? (A leaked spreadsheet of Uber\u2019s financials seems to indicate strong demand, regardless.)And with a normal cab, of course, sometimes a rider really lucks out. Another Washingtonian eager to get to her New Year\u2019s Eve party probably would have happily thrown a driver a fiver to pick her up instead of me. In effect, I and every other person in central D.C. who managed to catch a cab on New Year\u2019s Eve actually got a ride on the cheap.Market efficiency is not always the same thing as consumer benefit \u2014 a lesson worth learning in the digital age, for Uber riders as well as everyone else. There are far more sly forms of technology-enabled price discrimination out there, from airlines charging more if you are using a savvy web browser to online retailers charging you more if you are from a posh ZIP code. But on the Internet, the deck is still stacked on the consumer\u2019s side, given the web\u2019s powerful ability to facilitate comparison shopping. Shocked by Uber\u2019s surge prices, after all, there\u2019s nothing from holding an Uber user back from hoofing it home free or trying her luck waving her arms at the passing, fixed-price cabs on the street.Annie Lowrey is an economics reporter for The Times.Deep Thoughts:\n1. The market for taxi rides is highly\ninefficient. 2. Technological efficiency\ndoesn\u2019t mean lower fares. 3. It\nmeans paying true market value. 4.

{"Headline": "Obama Fights a Push to Add Iran Sanctions", "Date": "2014-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With the United States and Iran about to embark on a critical phase of nuclear talks, President Obama is waging an intense rear-guard action to prevent Senate Democrats from supporting strict new sanctions that could upend his diplomatic efforts.Sponsors of the bill, which would aim to drive Iran\u2019s oil exports down to zero, have secured the backing of 59 senators, putting them within striking distance of a two-thirds majority that could override Mr. Obama\u2019s threatened veto. Republicans overwhelmingly support the bill. So far 16 Democrats have broken with the president, and the bill\u2019s sponsors hope to get more.Iranian officials have threatened to leave the bargaining table if the United States enacts any new sanctions during the negotiations.The White House has cast the issue in stark terms, saying that a vote for new sanctions would be, in effect, a \u201cmarch toward war\u201d and challenging those lawmakers who support the bill to acknowledge publicly that they favor military action against Iran.\u201cIt just stands to reason if you close the diplomatic option, you\u2019re left with a difficult choice of waiting to see if sanctions cause Iran to capitulate, which we don\u2019t think will happen, or considering military action,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser.Yet senators from both parties angrily reject that characterization, saying that congressional pressure to impose sanctions is what brought Iran to the negotiating table to begin with. If anything, they said, the West needs the specter of more sanctions as a \u201cdiplomatic insurance policy,\u201d in case Iran reneges on the interim deal or the talks ultimately fail.Behind these positions is a potent mix of political calculations in a midterm election year. Pro-Israel groups like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or Aipac, have lobbied Congress to ratchet up the pressure on Iran, and many lawmakers are convinced that Tehran is bluffing in its threat to walk away from the talks.The signing of the interim agreement, congressional aides said, could cut both ways. While some senators might be more inclined to give diplomacy a chance, others might be troubled by the terms of the six-month deal. The full text of the agreement has not yet been released, arousing the suspicions of critics, though the White House said on Monday that it would soon be made available to lawmakers.Mr. Obama and other senior officials have met repeatedly with lawmakers to defend their diplomatic efforts and to try to stop the rush to sanctions. They cite an intelligence assessment that sanctions could undermine the negotiations. And they argue that Congress can always act swiftly to impose sanctions if the talks do collapse.\u201cMy preference is for peace and diplomacy, and this is one of the reasons why I\u2019ve sent the message to Congress that now is not the time for us to impose new sanctions,\u201d Mr. Obama said to reporters on Monday after meeting with Spain\u2019s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy. \u201cNow is the time for us to allow the diplomats and technical experts to do their work.\u201dMuch will depend on the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, who has so far resisted pressure to allow a vote on a sanctions bill. Mr. Reid is balancing a record of robust support for Israel with an equally strong alliance with the White House. Aides say Mr. Reid will not bring a bill to the floor before the State of the Union address on Jan. 28.Democrats, they say, recognize the delicacy of Mr. Obama\u2019s signing a veto on the Iran bill, especially if Congress delivers the first veto override of his presidency on a matter that is so clearly a presidential prerogative.\u00a0But Democrats said the current lull can hold only for a matter of weeks, not months.Prominent Democrats like Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, have recently thrown their support behind the bill. Aides say enough Senate Democrats would support the sanctions bill to override a presidential veto, and the House probably has a veto-proof margin as well.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.The fate of the bill, some on Capitol Hill said, is likely to rest with news from Iran. If newspapers begin running front-page articles about a resurgent Iranian economy or news breaks of burgeoning trade between Iran and its allies, Mr. Reid may be pressured to allow a vote. Proponents of sanctions say there is already ample evidence of both.\u201cThe Iranian economy has stabilized and is now starting to go on a positive trajectory,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cThis is due in a significant way to changing market sentiment.\u201dReports of an oil-for-goods swap being negotiated between Iran and Russia have prompted some Democrats to accuse Tehran of violating the terms of the interim deal. The White House said it shared those concerns, noting that Secretary of State John Kerry raised the matter with Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, on Monday.Such a deal would be \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the agreement and \u201ccould potentially trigger U.S. sanctions,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, Caitlin M. Hayden.There is also a spirited debate about whether the Senate legislation can be reconciled with a nuclear deal. A study by the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation said the bill \u201cmoves the goal posts\u201d by making a deal with Iran contingent on Iran\u2019s not launching ballistic missiles, and requiring it to have no involvement in terrorism against the United States, directly or through proxies.Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, chairman of the Armed Services Committee and a vocal opponent of the bill, said the signing of the accord strengthened his position. \u201cIt should make it harder for people to act in a way which might undermine the chances of there being a comprehensive agreement,\u201d he said.As the debate has intensified, some Democrats are taking umbrage at the White House\u2019s tone, pointing to a statement last week from a National Security Council official that said, \u201cIf certain members of Congress want the United States to take military action, they should be up front with the American public and say so.\u201dSenator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland and a strong supporter of the legislation, bristled at the White House\u2019s pressure, especially its \u201cmarch to war\u201d language. \u201cI think they should regret using that language,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bad actor is Iran.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about President Obama\u2019s struggle to prevent Senate Democrats from backing a bill that could thwart his diplomatic efforts with Iran referred incorrectly to Mr. Obama\u2019s threatened veto of the legislation. If he vetoes the bill, it will be the third veto of his presidency, not the first. (He vetoed the Interstate Recognition of Notarizations Act of 2010 and a Continuing Appropriations bill in 2009.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Low Turnout in Bangladesh Elections Amid Boycott and Violence", "Date": "2014-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Amid a deepening conflict between Bangladesh\u2019s two main political parties, the scene here in the capital as polls opened for the general elections on Sunday was ominous, with black-clad special forces units and soldiers in combat gear patrolling nearly empty boulevards.Though final results had not been released by early Monday, official counts from Dhaka suggested that the turnout here averaged about 22 percent \u2014 a steep decline from the last general elections, when more than 87 percent voted.At least 19 people were reported to have been killed in political violence, and 440 polling places were closed early because of security concerns. Bangladeshi television stations broadcast images of rural polling places charred by arson attacks, and of bodies wrapped in red blankets.As the largely uncontested elections drew closer, the opposition began a campaign to suppress turnout, hoping it would pressure the government to scrap the results and prepare for new elections under conditions that the B.N.P. would accept. Opposition leaders exulted as the polls closed on Sunday.\u201cI think this so-called election has been clearly and firmly rejected by the people,\u201d Shamsher Mobin Chowdhury, the B.N.P.\u2019s vice chairman, said in a telephone interview.But it is far from clear that the Awami League is ready to compromise with its rival.Bangladesh\u2019s leader, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has signaled her willingness to call early elections ahead of schedule, acknowledging that the new government would have a weak mandate. But in interviews, Awami League leaders laid out a formidable list of preconditions for the B.N.P., including renouncing violence; ending its alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami, the country\u2019s largest Islamic political party; and dropping its demand for a caretaker government.\u201cYou have to understand, a party like the Awami League cannot surrender to another political party on the basis of their demands,\u201d said Tofail Ahmed, one of the Awami League\u2019s leaders. \u201cWe will try our best to have negotiations with the opposition, so that in the future there is a participatory, credible election where all parties will participate. Both sides will have to sacrifice. I cannot give you a date. I cannot give you a time.\u201dThe lack of competition produced a bizarre election, especially given Bangladesh\u2019s tradition of boisterous democracy. Pro-government candidates ran unopposed in more than half of Parliament\u2019s 300 seats; in those districts, local elections were not held, leaving 48 million registered voters without any opportunity to vote.The teams of American and European observers who have been a regular presence in Bangladesh declined to monitor the process this year, saying the elections were flawed, leaving only delegations from India and Bhutan.Starting in the morning, there was a sense of foreboding. Television stations led with the news of the fatal beating of an assistant poll supervisor in the northern district of Thakurgaon. Later in the day, the police in that district opened fire on opposition activists who were trying to prevent voters from reaching polling places, killing two of them. A fourth man was killed in a clash between activists, said Faisal Mahmud, the district\u2019s assistant police superintendent.The news made people jumpy. Ataur Rahman, a street vendor from Thakurgaon, said he had spent the morning calling his relatives and begging them not to vote, for their own safety.Mohammad Ibrahim, a lawyer and B.N.P. activist, said he had spent a month going door to door in his apartment building trying to persuade residents to boycott the polls. The news coverage of the attacks on polling stations had greatly helped his efforts, he said.\u201cWe are not threatening anyone, but definitely they are scared, because they are watching television all the time,\u201d Mr. Ibrahim said. He added that the violence was \u201cmore or less on the shoulders of B.N.P.\u201d because it had called on supporters to oppose the elections. \u201cIn one sense, this is wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the other sense, this is right, because no one is listening to our voice. This is the only way to resist the elections.\u201d\u201cThis is not a situation where you can blame one side,\u201d said Mahfuza Jasmine, 40, a journalist, who added that worried relatives had dissuaded her from working on Sunday. \u201cOur whole politics have come to this situation, because our politicians are driven by their own egos.\u201dFor weeks, political analysts and foreign observers have held out hope that once the elections were over, the two parties would see no option other than to compromise. But the tolerance of each side for the other has been diminishing for years, and it is unclear whether it is possible to break the deadlock, even under intense pressure, said Zafar Sobhan, the editor of The Dhaka Tribune.\u201cIn the past, there was some kind of compact between the Awami League and the B.N.P. \u2014 they didn\u2019t like each other, but they could coexist,\u201d Mr. Sobhan said, adding that this appeared to have changed.\u201cI don\u2019t really see that there is much scope for them to find common ground,\u201d he said. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any ground common enough.\u201dJulfikar Ali Manik contributed reporting from Dhaka.Advertisement"}

Roberts Jr. wrote on Tuesday in his annual report on the state of the federal judiciary. He said the mandatory budget cuts known as sequestration had taken a disproportionate toll on the federal court system and were poised to \u201cpose a genuine threat to public safety.\u201dUnlike federal agencies, the chief justice said, the federal courts do not have discretionary programs they can postpone or eliminate, \u201cbecause virtually all of their core functions are constitutionally and statutorily required.\u201dChief Justice Roberts said the judicial branch had worked to reduce its costs for almost a decade, \u201clong before the talk of fiscal cliffs and sequestration came into vogue.\u201d This included, he said, restraints on courthouse construction and hiring.The cuts that went into effect in March reduced judiciary funding by 5 percent, or nearly $350 million, the chief justice wrote, though Congress restored some of the financing in October. The reductions have created widespread delays in civil and bankruptcy cases, he wrote. Over time, he said, these delays will give rise to \u201ccommercial uncertainty, lost opportunities and unvindicated rights.\u201dSome consequences have already materialized, he said.\u201cThere are fewer probation and pretrial services officers to protect the public from defendants awaiting trial and from offenders following their incarceration and release into the community,\u201d he wrote. Judges, court personnel and the public are also at greater risk, he said, as a consequence of cuts in financing for security guards at federal courthouses.\u201cThere are fewer public defenders available to vindicate the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of counsel to indigent criminal defendants,\u201d he added, \u201cwhich leads to postponed trials and delayed justice for the innocent and guilty alike.\u201dChief Justice Roberts made clear that he did not relish the task of asking another branch of government for money. Visiting judges from other nations \u201craise an eyebrow,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhen I point out the vital role of the legislative branch of government\u201d in making an independent judiciary possible.\u201cIt takes no imagination,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto see that failing to meet the judiciary\u2019s essential requirements undermines the public\u2019s confidence in all three branches of government.\u201dHe urged lawmakers to approve an appropriation of about $7 billion for the 2014 fiscal year. This would amount, he said, to \u201conly the tiniest sliver of federal revenues, just two-tenths of 1 percent of the federal government\u2019s total outlays.\u201dAn appendix to the report provided a mixed picture of the federal courts\u2019 workload. Trial courts were busier in 2013, with filings in civil and criminal cases growing by 1 percent.Filings in appeals courts dropped by 2 percent, and in the Supreme Court by 2.6 percent. Filings in bankruptcy courts dropped by 12 percent, a sign of a strengthening economy.Some \u201cseasonal cycles\u201d and \u201cpredictable constants\u201d are welcome, Chief Justice Roberts wrote, mentioning \u201cScrooge\u2019s ghost and George Bailey\u2019s guardian angel.\u201d\u201cThere are, however, some cycles from which we would all wish a break,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt the top of my list is a year-end report that must once again dwell on the need to provide adequate funding for the judiciary.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Edamame Economy", "Date": "2014-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the age of rail, luxury hotels mimicked European palaces. When rich people arrived at their destination, they wanted to be treated like nobility. Then in the age of the jet, a new sort of hotel emerged, sleek Hiltons and Sheratons. These hotels offered the comfort of familiarity. You could go around the world and the hotels were largely the same. They were efficient and bland, offering quality service and ease of movement. A business traveler could stay in one of these hotels for days and barely notice anything about the place. The computer age has brought yet another new kind of hotel: the mass boutique. Boutique hotels started in the early 1980s in London, with Blakes, and in San Francisco, with the Bedford. These hotels had entirely different goals than the big hotels at the time. Instead of offering familiarity, they offered difference. Instead of offering beige, they offered edginess, art, emotion and a dollop of pretension. The first boutique hotels were founded by entrepreneurs who seemed more like rock producers or psych professors than corporate executives. Chip Conley founded Joie de Vivre Hospitality in the Bay Area when he was 26. He designed his hotel Phoenix around the personality of Rolling Stone magazine. He later organized his business strategy around Abraham Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs.At the bottom of the pyramid, Conley\u2019s hotels offer a comfortable bed, but at the top of the pyramid, Conley says that his hotels offer \u201cidentity refreshment\u201d and \u201cmass therapy.\u201d As he writes in his book \u201cPeak,\u201d \u201cIf we get it right at our boutique hotels, we don\u2019t just satisfy our guests\u2019 physiological, safety, social and esteem needs: We bring them an awareness of self-actualization.\u201dBoutiques cater to the sort of affluent consumer who is produced by the information economy, which rewards education with money. This is a consumer who is prouder of his cultural discernment than his corporate success; who feels interested in, rather than intimidated by, a hotel room stuffed with cultural signifiers \u2014 cerulean sofas or Steichen photos. Boutique hotels hold up a flattering mirror. When guests arrive, they are supposed to feel like they are entering an edgy community of unconventional, discerning people like themselves. In an age when Hotels.com and Travelocity turn hotel rooms into commodities, these are customers who are willing to pay extra, sometimes a lot extra, for a hotel with sensibility. The boutique Soho Grand in New York is currently offering rooms at $339 a night. The Hilton Garden Inn, a very adequate hotel a couple of blocks away, is charging $139.It seems as if there is an endless supply of middle-class consumers who have boutique identities and aspirations, especially among people in their 20s. Consumers now use hotels differently. They bring their laptops down to the lobby rather than working in their rooms. Fewer people bother to unpack their bags. Therefore, room desks and closets are less important, but having a happening lobby scene is more important. People need a civic space where they can have their contiguous but individualized iPad experiences.Boutique hotels are, on one level, kind of ridiculous. They are almost invariably too dark throughout, making it hard to read. The bed is often too low. The bathroom door is sometimes a flimsy sliding shutter, sacrificing privacy for style. But they do exemplify a shift in the consumer market, which you might call the shift from the lima bean economy to the edamame economy. It\u2019s easy to forget how much more boring the marketplace was a few decades ago \u2014 more boring cuisine, more boring restaurants, more boring hotels. Recently, there\u2019s been a creative brand explosion, to go along with nichification and segmentation. Companies are much more interested in creating emotional arousal. Hotels, sneakers, iced tea and even ice cream is now marketed to people on the basis of psychographic profiles and the result is a profusion of unusual products and distinctive experiences. Consumers have been educated by the market and now the median level of cultural competence is much higher. A basic rule of happiness is don\u2019t buy things; buy experiences. The market has taken one commodity product after another and turned it into an emotional experience \u2014 even hotel stays. I don\u2019t know how you measure how much better off we are because of that, but we are significantly better off. The world\u2019s a sweeter place when, for an extra 200 bucks a night, you can lodge like Afrojack. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Back to the Digital Drawing Board", "Date": "2014-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 IN less than 20 years, ubiquitous, reliable high-speed Internet access has gone from a vision to a novelty to a fundamental part of the American economy \u2014 not to mention our civic, social and personal lives. Central to this is the principle of net neutrality: that the cables that bring the Internet into our homes should be there for all to use equally. Whether you are a content provider or a subscriber, as long as you pay your bill, it shouldn\u2019t matter whether you use them to send email or connect to Netflix or YouTube.That, however, may change, thanks to a circuit court ruling this week in the case of Verizon v. the Federal Communications Commission. The decision deferred to an old F.C.C. determination that telecom cables, the primary conduit for Internet access, are not utilities, and cannot be regulated as such, leaving American businesses unprotected from the depredations of a handful of giant Internet access providers. Service providers can now strike a deal with YouTube to get faster delivery speeds to customers, and Comcast, which owns sizable content assets itself, can use its control of the cables to get an edge over rival content providers. But rather than despair, this is a moment of opportunity. The court didn\u2019t make its decision because it was opposed to net neutrality, but because the F.C.C. had painted itself into a regulatory corner, having developed a convoluted, contradictory set of rules regarding Internet access over the last decade. The decision now forces the commission to go back to square one and reverse the industry-compromised decisions that set it on this path in the first place and that have long undermined its authority over this crucial infrastructure.The problem began in 2002, when Michael K. Powell, the F.C.C. chairman who now heads the cable industry\u2019s trade association, decided to exempt high-speed Internet access from so-called common carriage regulation. Those rules, applied most notably to phone service, bar providers from discriminatory service \u2014 everyone who pays a phone bill gets the same quality of service. But Mr. Powell reasoned that Internet access was an information service, distinct from the traditional communications infrastructure, and that competition would be better than oversight at protecting Americans from any abuses by access providers. It\u2019s a good thing the F.C.C. is staffed by so many lawyers, because it was soon faced with complaints by consumer groups and Internet content providers alleging that companies like Comcast, far from being checked by competition, were using the lack of competition in local Internet service, combined with the lack of oversight, to favor their own commercial interests. After it was revealed in 2008 that Comcast had interfered with access to certain file-sharing networking applications, the commission performed an about-face, ordering the company to adhere to a new approach for managing bandwidth demand. This put the commission in a logical bind. It claimed, somehow, that it both repudiated the need for \u201ccommon carriage\u201d rules and, at the same time, had the power to prevent discrimination by service providers. Comcast, Verizon and other Internet service providers quickly filed suit. Though the commission fought a valiant fight, defending this contradiction was always a losing battle. The commission first lost following a challenge by Comcast in 2010, after which it recast its net neutrality stance, mandating that service providers not choose winners and losers among providers of online content or require them to pay fees as a condition of carriage. Verizon then challenged that mandate, and the result was this week\u2019s court ruling. Unlike the 2010 decision, this time the circuit court left little room for the commission to revise its rules yet again. The court did, however, offer a way forward, if the commission was willing to take it. The agency must revisit and reverse Mr. Powell\u2019s 2002 decision, relabeling high-speed Internet access a common carriage service. That has always been the obvious solution. But for years the commission has refused to do so, because its jury-rigged, contradictory stance worked well enough. Now it has no choice.And it must act, soon. Otherwise, we will have an Internet in which, say, Google can pay extra to give Gmail users faster access to their email than Hotmail users. And Microsoft, which owns Hotmail, will have no choice but to pay more, too, because each Internet service provider has a monopoly, or close to one, over local networks. In the end, the providers\u2019 slicing, dicing and gouging is great for their shareholders, but not for the country. We\u2019ll end up with a digital replica of pay TV, rather than the Internet that has prompted such economic growth and innovation in America. Without the right administrative label applied to these services, every step the commission takes to address these problems will be subject to a protracted battle over whether the F.C.C. is impermissibly treating the network providers as \u201ccommon carriers.\u201d In the meantime, we will be no closer to having the reliable, ubiquitous, neutral, world-class communications infrastructure we need than we are today. High-speed Internet access isn\u2019t a luxury; it is basic infrastructure, like electricity, clean water and a functioning street grid, that is essential for the free market to function. The F.C.C. can show its strength by having the guts to change its mind.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Help College Students Graduate", "Date": "2014-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAMERICAN students are enrolling in college in record numbers, but they\u2019re also dropping out in droves. Barely half of those who start four-year colleges, and only a third of community college students, graduate. That\u2019s one of the worst records among developed nations, and it\u2019s a substantial drain on the economy. The American Institutes for Research estimates the cost of those dropouts, measured in lost earnings and taxes, at $4.5 billion. Incalculable are the lost opportunities for social mobility and the stillborn professional careers.There\u2019s a remedy at hand, though, and it\u2019s pretty straightforward. Nationwide, universities need to give undergraduates the care and attention akin to what\u2019s lavished on students at elite institutions. If that help is forthcoming, graduation rates more than double, according to several evaluations of an innovative program at the City University of New York\u2019s community colleges. Nearly 90 percent of students who attend a top-ranked university earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in four years. While these undergraduates may well be among the best and brightest, they also get kid-gloves treatment. If they run into trouble, an army of helpmates stands at the ready. \u201cFrom moving day as a freshman through graduation and beyond,\u201d Harvard assures its students, \u201cour advisers are here to help and support you at every step.\u201d The situation is entirely different for most undergraduates, especially poor and minority students. All too often they\u2019re steered to schools where they receive little if any support in mastering tough courses, decoding arcane requirements for a major, sorting out life problems or navigating the maze of institutional requirements. Graduation rates at these so-called dropout factories, especially those in urban areas that largely serve low-income, underprepared minority populations, are as abysmal as 5 percent.Six years ago, CUNY decided to confront the high dropout rate at its community colleges with the ASAP initiative. The results are stunning: 56 percent of the first two cohorts of more than 1,500 students have graduated, compared with just 23 percent of a comparable group that didn\u2019t have the same experience. What\u2019s more, most of those graduates are currently pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree. The program for community-college students addresses money issues, which are typically students\u2019 top concern, by covering tuition that\u2019s not paid for by federal and state grants, as well as paying for public transit and giving students free use of textbooks, saving them upward of $900 a year. To help balance the demands of college with work, life and family obligations, students take their classes in a consolidated course schedule (morning, afternoon or evening).These results have persuaded CUNY to triple the size of the community college program to 4,000 students by fall 2014, and the system is considering expanding ASAP to its other schools. But this strategy merits a nationwide rollout, for it promises a significant increase in the number of educated workers that the nation badly needs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Energy Official Sounds a Warning", "Date": "2014-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s new energy minister on Tuesday struck a sobering tone about the country\u2019s ambitious goals for making its energy sector more reliant on renewable sources, saying that rising costs risked losing public support and jeopardizing the powerful German industrial base.The minister, Sigmar Gabriel, in his first major policy speech, said at an annual energy conference organized by the publication Handelsblatt in Berlin that annual consumer costs for renewables of about 24 billion euros, or about $32.5 billion, were already pushing the limits of what the German economy, Europe\u2019s most powerful, could handle.\u201cWe need to keep in mind that the whole economic future of our country is riding on this,\u201d said Mr. Gabriel, who is responsible for the Energiewende, or energy transformation. \u201cThe energy transformation has the potential to be an economic success, but it can also cause a dramatic de-industrialization of our country.\u201dMr. Gabriel\u2019s proposals for overhauling the energy law will be presented to Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s new cabinet on Wednesday. He is chairman of the Social Democratic Party, which formed a coalition government in December with Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats. The country has been awaiting his plans for overhauling the Energiewende, which was put in place in 2011 by the chancellor\u2019s previous government in response to the nuclear disaster in Japan.The German proposals are being discussed even as the European Union on Wednesday planned to announce its climate and energy goals for 2030. Officials are trying to balance the interests of business with the imperative to reduce emissions of the gases that cause global warming.Germany sees itself as an exemplar of the way to adopt cleaner energy sources. Berlin now wants to ensure that its own energy transformation does not jeopardize its progress on emissions reductions.Getting German energy on the right path is so important to the new coalition government that Mr. Gabriel has been put in charge of two previously separate portfolios in a sort of super ministry that combines energy and the economy.His proposals would curb some of the subsidies paid to producers of electricity generated by solar and wind production, cutting them by about a third by 2015, while setting limits to improve control of the expansion of onshore wind and solar farms, according to documents, versions of which have been widely reported in the German news media.\u201cWe need to control the expansion of renewable energy, and not have the anarchy that we have seen previously,\u201d Mr. Gabriel said. \u201cWe need to reduce costs so that it remains affordable.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Gabriel has sought to dampen expectations that he can bring about radical changes. He has repeatedly emphasized that he is not promising to bring down electricity prices, which are already among the highest in Europe.Germany faces a delicate balance. It wants to keep momentum for renewable energy, while ensuring that it remains affordable. The country seeks to phase out its nuclear reactors by 2022, while increasing the share of power generated by renewable sources to 40 percent or 45 percent by 2025.Last year, 23.4 percent of all energy produced in Germany came from renewable sources.Ms. Merkel\u2019s government wants to push the revamped laws through Parliament by midyear in an effort to stem the rising costs. Adding to the pressure is an investigation by the European Union into exemptions for energy-intensive operations in Germany, which Brussels says might violate trade laws but that Berlin argues are necessary to maintaining the country\u2019s competitive edge.Mr. Gabriel said that he would push back against Brussels, arguing that Germany was conducting an experiment from which the entire 28-nation bloc could benefit.\u201cWe are trying to ease burdens that don\u2019t exist elsewhere in Europe,\u201d Mr. Gabriel said. \u201cGermany is paying for the learning curve that others don\u2019t need to pay for, that we need to keep this affordable for the German industry.\u201dGermany also faces the challenge of ensuring stability in the energy market. Conventional energy providers have suffered devastating losses because of imbalances in the energy market caused by the heavily subsidized renewables. Several have demanded that the government compensate them for keeping unprofitable plants active in order to ensure stability on the market.Peter Terium, the head of the German power company RWE, said at the conference that nuclear energy might be phased out even earlier than the government has planned, given that it is no longer profitable. \u201cIt would not be responsible to allow a reactor to continue to run when it is losing money every day,\u201d Mr. Terium said.Mr. Gabriel has rejected subsidies for conventional plants but said he would hold talks with industry leaders over how best to address the problem.An adverse effect of Germany\u2019s energy transformation has been an increased use of brown coal, or lignite, one of the cheapest and dirtiest sources of energy. Germany is already the world\u2019s largest miner of brown coal, and last year it produced more electricity from brown coal than any time since 1990.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Houston and Its Strip Clubs Call a Truce", "Date": "2014-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 As 2013 wound down, this city appeared to finally free itself from one of its longest-running legal battles.For 16 years, Houston spent millions of dollars litigating a subject other cities regard as a low-level nuisance or ignore altogether: strip clubs. Then in November, city officials finally worked out a deal with the 16 biggest clubs in town.But rather than settle the issue, the agreement instead opened a new chapter in Houston\u2019s strip club war, an unusual culture clash in a booming city known more for a lack of zoning than a lack of clothing.At issue is a 1997 law that imposed tough restrictions on the location and operation of strip clubs, regulating everything from a dancer\u2019s state of undress to the dimness of the lighting. But while the city and several club owners were busy suing one another over the law and other measures, the number of topless bars steadily increased, and their managers were ignoring or sidestepping the restrictions. The new agreement freed the 16 clubs involved in the lawsuits from abiding by the 1997 law and required the owners to contribute $1 million annually to a unit in the Houston Police Department devoted to fighting human trafficking. But a number of religious leaders and advocates for sex-trafficking victims have opposed the deal. They said it sent the wrong message about Houston\u2019s tolerance for such entertainment, and allowed the 16 clubs to buy their way out of complying with the law. The Houston Area Pastor Council is considering suing the city over the agreement.The controversy has the potential to hurt Mayor Annise D. Parker, a Democrat who recently won re-election to a third and final term.\u201cThe mayor is very popular,\u201d said Bob Sanborn, who leads the advocacy group Children at Risk. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to come out against the mayor, but indeed they\u2019re very happy to say that this is not the deal that we need in this city. We certainly do not want these clubs to dictate the terms of a surrender.\u201dMayor Parker defended the arrangement, describing one of the stipulations \u2014 that the owners eliminate all private rooms, often viewed as sites for prostitution \u2014 as a victory for the city.\u201cI think a lot of the discussion out in the community is from people who simply do not like the adult entertainment industry,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThis is not about the adult entertainment industry, how I feel about it or not. This is about the settling of a 16-year lawsuit and actually getting something for that settlement.\u201dAs Houston\u2019s economy, population and national reputation as a tourist and business destination have grown, so has its tawdry night life. The city is home to one of the largest concentrations of strip clubs in America, with more than 100 believed to be operating at varying levels of legality. One lawyer for the city said a primary source of criminal activity was not the 16 clubs, but smaller \u201crogue clubs\u201d that have an anything-goes atmosphere and have exploited and prostituted girls as young as 11 and 12.Both critics and supporters agree it is a booming industry. Liquor, beer and wine sales at the 16 clubs totaled nearly $25 million in 2012, including $4.1 million at one club alone: Treasures, a two-story venue that claims to be the biggest strip club in Texas and offers a free buffet and a shoeshine stand.The 1997 ordinance, known as the Sexually Oriented Business Law, regulated the clubs at a micro level. In addition to banning topless lap dances \u2014 strippers had to stay three feet from a customer while performing \u2014 the law required clubs to maintain sufficient lighting \u201cof not less than one footcandle as measured at four feet above floor level,\u201d an effort to prevent clubs from using the darkness to conceal illegal activity. It also prohibited a dancer from touching a patron \u201cwhile engaging in entertainment.\u201dThe clubs \u2014 or rather, their lawyers \u2014 found a way around many of the restrictions. Because the dancers covered their breasts with pasties or liquid latex, the clubs maintained they were not sexually oriented businesses and therefore not subject to the ordinance.The settlement allowed the 16 clubs to offer topless lap dancing once again, although the clubs agreed to the lighting requirement contained in the 1997 law. And the deal permitted touching, making the claim that any that occurs during a lap dance \u201cmay be presumed to be without intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.\u201d But complicating matters, the 1997 law remains in effect for the rest of the clubs in Houston.Houston\u2019s city attorney, David M. Feldman, who led the negotiations for the city, said the settlement does not give the 16 clubs a pass. Undercover vice-squad officers will continue to investigate the clubs, and the owners must now report to the city any acts of prostitution, drug offenses and other crimes that take place at their venues.\u201cThrough this agreement, they\u2019re effectively opening their doors to the Houston Police Department,\u201d Mr. Feldman said. \u201cYou better not have anything to hide in order to do this.\u201dOn a recent evening at Treasures, down the street from the Galleria mall and the Memorial Lutheran Church and School, the shoeshine booth was empty, but the tables were crowded with men, who sat drinking $7.50 beers while watching scantily clad or topless women on the main stage. The door to the upstairs private rooms was locked, and as part of the agreement the rooms have ceased operating.Casey Wallace, a lawyer for Treasures who worked on the settlement, said the things that people assumed were happening in the clubs and private rooms were untrue, and described the agreement as fostering unprecedented cooperation between the city, law enforcement and the 16 clubs.\u201cComing in here you might be a little intimidated or a little scared, but most of the people here, they come here to talk,\u201d said Jolie, a dancer who would use only her stage name because she did not want to jeopardize her other job. Jolie said the lap dancing was sensual but never crossed a legal line. Even the time she re-enacted one man\u2019s favorite scene from a \u201cPeter Pan\u201d movie, she said it was purely theatrical. \u201cI guess that would be considered bizarre,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no harm in that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The sharp decline, with the peso dropping the most since Argentina\u2019s 2002 financial crisis, raises concerns that inflation could accelerate even further.Since the start of the year, the Argentine peso has weakened 18 percent, ranking it among the world\u2019s worst-performing currencies against the dollar. President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner\u2019s cabinet chief, Jorge Capitanich, insisted on Thursday that the plunge was not a devaluation but the result of the forces of supply and demand.Still, local news media said the peso closed at 7.75 to the dollar, after weakening earlier on Thursday to about 8.24, with the central bank intervening late in the trading session. Argentina\u2019s international reserves have been tumbling, hitting a seven-year low last week of about $29.5 billion.Though Mrs. Kirchner has vowed not to devalue the peso, the central bank has let the currency slide gradually in recent months. But there was a change in approach this week, said Gast\u00f3n Rossi, a former deputy economy minister under Mrs. Kirchner. \u201cDepreciating in stages was causing the reserves to contract further,\u201d Mr. Rossi said. \u201cThe government has said, \u2018We\u2019re deliberately not going to sacrifice the reserves anymore.\u2019\u00a0\u201dWith the authorities tightening currency controls in an effort to reduce capital flight, Argentines have resorted to buying dollars illegally, in the black market. The so-called blue dollar rate reached 13 on Thursday, according to the Argentine news media.With Argentina\u2019s currency weakening, concern is growing that inflation could climb as imported goods become more expensive. The authorities in Argentina say inflation in 2013 was 10.9 percent, while private economists contend that consumer prices actually climbed more than 28 percent last year.The prospect of abrupt shifts in Argentina\u2019s economy sent tremors into the financial markets of other Latin American countries. In neighboring Brazil, which has the region\u2019s largest economy, the currency weakened more than 1.2 percent to 2.40 reals to the dollar, and the country\u2019s main stock index fell almost 2 percent.Jonathan Gilbert contributed reporting from Buenos Aires.Advertisement"}

It seemed to reflect the degree to which both nations rely on oil from the South to keep their economies afloat.But the suggestion of sending Sudanese troops to help the government of South Sudan while it is descending into civil war quickly provoked criticism.\u201cIt showed that Sudan is on one side against the other,\u201d said a Sudanese columnist, Faisal Mohammad Salih. \u201cIt is in Sudan\u2019s strategic interest to see a settlement in South Sudan and build trust with all sides, especially if you don\u2019t know what the outcome of the talks will be.\u201dThe ministry\u2019s statement on Tuesday reiterated another one of the announcements made the day before: that 900 Sudanese technicians were being sent to the oil-rich areas of South Sudan to help run the oil fields, at the request of the South Sudanese government and under its administration.The conflict has killed well over 1,000 people, has displaced around 200,000 and has disrupted oil production in South Sudan, as many foreign oil company workers have been evacuated. South Sudan\u2019s oil runs northward through Sudan to be exported, for a fee.The opposing sides in the South Sudanese conflict are in talks in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.Before Mr. Karti\u2019s statement, Sudan\u2019s official position on the fighting in South Sudan had been to support regional efforts to bring both sides to the negotiating table.

{"Headline": "Bernanke Proved Them Wrong", "Date": "2014-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 When President George W. Bush was considering candidates to be chairman of the Federal Reserve in the autumn of 2005, the rap on Ben S. Bernanke, a brilliant economist, was that he had never faced a crisis, might be too soft for a challenge and wasn\u2019t politically astute.As he prepares to conclude his eight-year tenure as central bank chief at the end of the month, Mr. Bernanke is one of the most significant figures in contemporary United States government. Few have risen more boldly to confront a crisis, and his political talents were underestimated \u2014 the 60-year-old scholar of the Great Depression is about as soft as cast iron.\u201cHistory will ultimately judge how effective all of the innovations he led were, but I think his leadership has been brilliant,\u201d said Joshua B. Bolten, who was Mr. Bush\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cHe has led the Fed into new territory, but probably territory where it needed to be.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s one of the best public officials I have ever seen,\u201d said former Representative Barney Frank, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts who served 32 years in the House and was one author of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul legislation. \u201cHe was right during the crisis, has proven absolutely right about quantitative easing and the emphasis on employment, is opening up the Fed and has been cooperative on reforms.\u201dThis praise isn\u2019t universal. Under Mr. Bernanke, the Fed\u2019s unprecedented intervention in the economy is reviled by some politicians on the right like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and is criticized by some mainstream conservative economists. On the left, critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts praised his stewardship during the crisis but said he had not done enough in the aftermath to rein in the power of big Wall Street banks. The five largest banks have more total assets today than they did six years ago.Still, few dispute that Mr. Bernanke\u2019s bold, decisive and sometimes experimental actions in 2008 and 2009 saved the global economy.\u201cThe Bernanke mantra: whatever it takes,\u201d David Wessel wrote in his book \u201cIn Fed We Trust: Ben Bernanke\u2019s War on the Great Panic.\u201d He \u201cwould not go down in history as the chairman of the Federal Reserve who dithered and delayed during a financial panic that threatened America\u2019s prosperity.\u201dAs the global economy teetered, and with his unsurpassed knowledge of mistakes made during the Depression, he opened the spigots of credit, took interest rates to zero and rescued major financial institutions. Again with the 1930s in mind, he was willing to experiment much as Franklin D. Roosevelt did; some actions worked; others did not.The supposedly na\u00efve academic was remarkably persuasive in getting Congress to go along with huge government intervention. And he persuaded some of his reluctant Fed colleagues to present a pretty united front.After the meltdown, he played an important role in fashioning financial and banking overhauls. He followed the advice of the central bank\u2019s skillful spokeswoman, Michelle Smith, by initiating greater transparency about the Fed\u2019s policies and increasing public outreach to explain them. He even held periodic news conferences.As the United States struggled to recover, Mr. Bernanke kept his foot on the gas. With interest rates at zero limiting monetary action, he pushed quantitative easing, the purchase of long-term securities, to stimulate the economy.That controversial approach appears to have been modestly successful, spurring faster growth without inflation. When the chairman announced last month that the bank would begin cutting back its asset purchases, the market\u2019s initial reaction was positive, though some experts still believe this transition will be difficult.As Mr. Bernanke completes his service, here\u2019s the picture: a financial system restored to health; an economy on the way back and doing better than those of Europe and elsewhere; one of his top picks, Janet L. Yellen, on deck to succeed him as chief; and his professor and mentor Stanley Fischer stepping into the vice chairman\u2019s seat. And never again will anyone describe Ben Bernanke as soft or na\u00efve. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Economic Debate Opens Ahead of 2015 Vote", "Date": "2014-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 With elections 16 months away, British politicians have headed into battle over the economy.That vow followed a call on Sunday by Ed Miliband, the Labour leader and head of the opposition, for better protection for low-wage workers.Only a year ago, Britain faced the risk of a return to recession, and Mr. Osborne\u2019s austerity program was getting much of the blame. But Britain is now expected to be one of the fastest-growing advanced economies in 2014, and that turnaround has left political parties scrambling for advantage at the start of the new year.While the economic uptick is good news for the Conservative government, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, Mr. Osborne warned against a \u201cdangerous new complacency,\u201d arguing that, if given the chance, the opposition Labour Party would squander the gains made rather than consolidate them.Despite its claims that austerity has laid the foundation for recovery, the government was put on the defensive late last year when the Labour Party campaigned over the cost-of-living squeeze felt by many voters whose pay increases have lagged behind big jumps in energy and other bills.Calling for stiffer fines for companies that breach minimum-wage laws and a ban on recruitment agencies hiring only foreign workers, Mr. Miliband also sought to defuse the debate over immigration and worries that workers from Eastern Europe were undercutting pay levels.\u201cUnless we act to change our economy, low-skill immigration risks making the problems of the cost of living crisis worse for those at the sharp end,\u201d Mr. Miliband wrote. \u201cIt isn\u2019t prejudiced to believe that.\u201dMr. Osborne, speaking on Monday at a factory in Birmingham, sought to put the focus firmly back on deficit reduction, asserting that his economic program \u201cis working,\u201d but that an additional 25 billion pounds in spending cuts, about $41 billion, would be needed after the next elections, due in May 2015, including \u00a312 billion from the welfare budget. The speech effectively challenged Mr. Osborne\u2019s opponents to say whether they would match his target and, if so, how they would achieve it \u2014 if not through restricting welfare payments.Mr. Osborne highlighted some potential welfare savings, including cuts to housing benefits for people younger than 25, and the new restrictions on subsidized housing for those over certain salary thresholds.Yet on Sunday, Mr. Cameron made clear that significant increases in the state pension would continue, insulating many older people from the squeeze on public spending. Political parties are wary of upsetting retired people because they tend to vote more than other age groups.Labour countered Monday that it would focus more on growth as a way to reduce the scale of cuts. \u201cWe will get the deficit down in a fair way,\u201d Labour\u2019s finance spokesman, Ed Balls, said in a statement. \u201cWe know that the way to mitigate the scale of the cuts needed is to earn and grow our way to higher living standards for all.\u201dMeanwhile, Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, the junior party in the coalition government, distanced himself from Mr. Osborne\u2019s comments on welfare. The Conservatives are making a \u201cmonumental mistake\u201d in a remorseless search for cuts and in focusing the burden of consolidation on the working poor, Mr. Clegg, who is deputy prime minister, said at a news conference on Monday in London.Although Britain\u2019s next general election is more than a year away, elections for the European Parliament in May this year will provide a test of the parties\u2019 relative popularity with the British public.As the general election approaches, and with opinion polls pointing to an inconclusive outcome, Mr. Clegg\u2019s party is trying to distinguish its image from that of the Conservatives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Military Museum Confronts Past", "Date": "2014-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMuseumsDRESDEN, Germany \u2014 In 2001, when the Museum of Military History here called for bids to redesign a section of the 19th-century arsenal where it is housed, the museum received numerous proposals from around the globe.The assignment was ambitious: Redesign a museum that would explore Germany\u2019s anguished relationship with its military past. The winner was the renowned architect Daniel Libeskind, the son of Holocaust survivors.This past fall, Mr. Libeskind returned to the museum, which once housed exhibitions organized by National Socialist leaders, and later by Soviet and East German officials extolling revolution, to celebrate the two-year anniversary of its 2011 reopening. Welcomed like a rock star \u2014 and playing the part, sporting alligator-skin cowboy boots and a black leather jacket \u2014 he took to the stage of a packed auditorium within the museum.\u201cThis museum calls for a new and better understanding of war and humanity and our vulnerability,\u201d said Mr. Libeskind. He joked that he did not want to be known as an \u201carchitect of tragedy,\u201d despite having designed his first war museum in Manchester, England, in 2001, and working currently on a reconciliation center in Belfast. \u201cThis museum is not intended to be one of peace. It\u2019s a museum, however, that gets the closest ever to asking, \u2018Why are there wars?\u201d\u2019The question continues to be compelling not only for the museum, but also for Germany as it observes three anniversaries this year: 100 years since the start of World War I, 75 years since World War II began, and 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall.This month the museum has opened a special exhibition to mark the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp at Majdanek in Poland \u2014 the first among the camps to be liberated as the Allies closed in on Nazi Germany \u2014 as well as the International Remembrance Day of the Holocaust, which took place on Monday. While such displays continue to be common around Germany, this is the first major exhibition in Dresden to specifically examine the Holocaust and it offers another opportunity to examine how the museum presents itself.The museum extension designed by Mr. Libeskind is an immense wedge made of concrete and steel, which cuts through the former armory. The original armory was built in 1876 for Kaiser Wilhelm I, and in 1897, it was transformed into a museum. Because of its location outside the city center, it survived the Allied bombing of Dresden on Feb. 13, 1945. It was shut down in 1989 when government leaders couldn\u2019t decide how to approach its controversial past.In creating his design, Mr. Libeskind said he recalled Albert Speer, the Nazi regime\u2019s architect, and his obsession with perfect axes and angles.\u201cBut architecture can\u2019t be just abstract, perceived in Cartesian spaces,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s an emotional component to it, it\u2019s almost mystical, and with this museum, you can see a sudden conflict and transformation.\u201dManaged today by Germany\u2019s federal armed forces, the museum\u2019s nearly 10,000 exhibits fill four stories. The newer displays, housed in the Libeskind extension, eschew a chronological review of military history. One exhibit examines the role animals have played in battle; another illustrates the economy of war. The older part of the building holds exhibits surveying the Late Middle Ages, world wars and modern warfare.In organizing the Majdanek exhibition, \u201cShoes of the Dead,\u201d the museum secured cooperation with the camp museum, as well as with Auschwitz, which, one of the curators, Steffen Liebscher, said, rarely lends from its collections to other museums. The exhibition title is based on a poem composed by a 12-year-old Jewish girl at the camp who, along with 300 women prisoners, was forced to sort victims\u2019 shoes. A prisoner\u2019s suitcase from Auschwitz, an original deportation list from Leipzig\u2019s Jewish community archive and privately owned items belonging to Holocaust survivors are included in the show.Mr. Liebscher said that the exhibition, which runs through March 25, aims to highlight the Holocaust in Dresden, which is predominantly known for the fire-bombing in 1945. \u201cThe bombing is a very dominating point in Dresden,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also want to focus on the fact that for a very long time before 1945, people were hurt and killed by the Nazis, beginning in 1933.\u201dApproximately 6,000 Jews lived in Dresden in 1933; estimates vary as to how many died in the war versus how many managed to emigrate. But by January 1945, the city\u2019s Jewish community numbered about 170, said Mr. Liebscher. Underscoring this, the exhibition spotlights the lives and fates of some two dozen of Dresden\u2019s Jews. Displays include a deportation list dated March 3, 1943, with 293 names of Dresden residents; and an amulet passed on from the resident Dora Staub to her granddaughter, Anneliese, shortly before being deported in 1943 to the Theresienstadt camp in present-day Czech Republic. Mrs. Staub\u2019s son survived the war, emigrated to the United States and was able to send for his family in Dresden. A plant grown from cuttings of a plant belonging to him is also part of the exhibition.Dresden\u2019s local media have applauded the show, with the local edition of the tabloid Bild calling it \u201cthe most significant\u201d ever staged in the city. A German national news channel, ARD, featured the exhibition the day it opened, on Jan. 23, commenting on how today\u2019s federal armed services reflect on the country\u2019s Nazi past and World War II.Mr. Libeskind said that the exhibition reflected his own belief in reconciliation. \u201cGermany is the culture engine of Europe,\u201d he said in an interview after his lecture, \u201cand we are no longer in the Europe of the goose step.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kenya\u2019s Banking Revolution Lights a Fire", "Date": "2014-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 African leaders are often asked to look to countries like Singapore and Taiwan for examples of the transformative impact that clean, effective government can have in turning around a nation\u2019s economy. But they might do better to look closer to home.Those models are certainly valid: The \u201cAsian Tigers\u201d lifted millions of people out of poverty by relying on an efficient public sector based on rigid meritocracy and little tolerance for corruption. But, oddly enough, it was the reverse of these very conditions in Kenya \u2014 the realities of corruption, nepotism and sheer inefficiency of the state telecommunications monopoly \u2014 that helped inspire a banking and finance revolution that is spreading from sub-Saharan Africa to India, Afghanistan and beyond. There are few more stunning success stories in the developing world than the explosion in the use of mobile phone money transfers. The service has brought millions of people into the formal financial system, hobbled crime by substituting cash for pin-secured virtual accounts, and created tens of thousands of jobs. It is important to bear in mind that these achievements were spurred in no small way by the inefficiency of what came before. Africans took to mobile phones with such great enthusiasm because the alternatives were so dire. In Kenya, the land lines maintained by the state monopoly were more regularly out of use than in service. Telephone booths were legendary for gobbling shillings to no purpose.The Kenya Posts & Telecommunications Corporation was a model of the ills of political patronage. A 2005 audit of one of its successors, Telkom Kenya, found the company had hundreds of idle employees whose major qualification was their political connections. Eighty percent of the recurrent expenditures went to labor costs, including the salaries of over 2,000 messengers and porters with job descriptions that \u2014 in a company with far more drivers than vehicles \u2014 were vague at best. Overall, the corporation had one employee for every 28 customers; the industry\u2019s international standard is 1 for every 400. Its revenue per employee was $14 against an international average of $120.The Kenyan mobile giant Safaricom was spun off this sprawling morass of inefficiency. Because it was largely given the room to operate using rational management practices, it grew to become the biggest company in East Africa by revenue and Kenya\u2019s largest taxpayer. In partnership with Vodafone, it went on to form M-Pesa (Pesa is a Swahili word for money), which allows subscribers to use a pin-secured virtual bank account on their mobile phones. Each account can hold a maximum of just over $1,000 at any time. This transforms the phone into a mobile wallet. Using a text message, one can send money to a friend, buy goods in a supermarket, settle utility bills or pay for a cab without using cash.Launched in 2007, there are now 18 million active subscribers to the service. In 2012 M-Pesa processed transactions amounting to 31 percent of the country\u2019s G.D.P. of about $37 billion. Similar money transfer platforms have been adopted in many other countries where many people don\u2019t have formal bank accounts. The leading mobile money firm in India counts 75 million subscribers on its network, and other such services have taken off from Qatar to Tanzania to Afghanistan.It would be superficial to argue that the mobile phone industry\u2019s success in sub-Saharan Africa proves the merits of privatization in every instance. There also have been failures, including a botched privatization of railroad services in East Africa. The question of less-versus-more government involvement leads to a cul-de-sac of ideological debate. The past 50 years have shown that both approaches can work. Freed from Soviet domination, for example, the Czech Republic and Estonia followed the free market path with notable success. On the other hand, Singapore and Taiwan opted for significant state involvement. Much depends upon the circumstances, but what matters most is the quality of leadership. The impact of efficient management on the lives of ordinary people and on job growth is undeniable. There were approximately 65,000 M-Pesa agents in Kenya at the end of 2013 \u2014 each employing one or two cashiers. Can this success be replicated in other sectors, like Kenya\u2019s inefficient power, transportation and health services? Evidently so. A recent report by the International Budget Partnership, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that campaigns for transparency in how governments manage public funds, pointed out that while the Kenyan national health insurance fund spent 45 percent of its budget on administration expenses in 2010, the administration costs for its Estonian equivalent were less than 1 percent.Kenya\u2019s government leaders would do well to ask which industrial sectors can be run like Safaricom. This is not a call for blanket privatization. We Africans should drop the ideological debates over whether we need less or more government and heed the pragmatic advice of the great Ghanaian Pan-Africanist Kwame Nkrumah: \u201cWe face neither East nor West; We face forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Roger Ailes\u2019s Permanent Pushback Campaign", "Date": "2014-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Media EquationRoger Ailes, the chairman of Fox News Channel, has little left to accomplish in a remarkable television career. He has made billions for his owners, created an entirely new genre of TV and, in doing so, he has changed the way politics is conducted. His business legacy is secure. Besides, there are only two audiences that would seem to matter to him \u2014 Rupert Murdoch and Fox News viewers \u2014 and neither could give a rip what \u201cThe Loudest Voice in the Room,\u201d an unauthorized biography of Mr. Ailes by Gabriel Sherman that goes on sale Tuesday, says about their guy.So why is the consummate P.R. pro, the man who taught both Richard Nixon and Bill O\u2019Reilly to connect with the masses despite their flaws, pushing back on the book and blowing air into it in the process? It would be a very simple matter for Mr. Ailes to tuck in behind Gov. Chris Christie, another Republican accused of being a bully, and let Mr. Sherman sell his own books.Some of it is reflex, part of the permanent campaign that Mr. Ailes, a former political consultant, has been running all his life. I\u2019ve dealt with Mr. Ailes while covering the news media, and beyond his charms and smarts, he is animated by a belief that just about everyone would like to see him laid low. Even as he has vanquished his opponents, he clings to the role of aggrieved underdog, and Mr. Sherman\u2019s critical book reinforces that worldview. To those of us who have reported on Fox News, Mr. Sherman\u2019s portrayal of the operation \u2014 with its loyalty tests, its culture of fear and reprisals, and its deep involvement in stories it was supposed to be covering \u2014 is hardly shocking. But it is not a pretty picture, and Mr. Ailes must know that. He has been calling around to some of the people who show up in the book to apologize and spin, saying Mr. Sherman used accounts of disgruntled ex-employees to distort events. Allies of Mr. Ailes initiated counter-ops against the book almost as soon as Mr. Sherman began reporting nearly three years ago, with tweets, blog posts and blind items impugning his motives and work. As a career control freak, Mr. Ailes, 73, can\u2019t abide losing custody of his own narrative. \u201cUp until now, Roger Ailes had been able to control his story in a masterful way,\u201d Mr. Sherman told me the other day. \u201cI think the book provides a nuanced portrait of a man with a bottomless well of ambition and his path to power, telling the story of how he used television to advance his politics.\u201dTo be fair, Mr. Sherman has been on a ferocious campaign of his own, appearing on cable and network television to promote the book while assigning all manner of might and motive to Mr. Ailes, whom he calls \u201cthe man behind the curtain.\u201dMr. Sherman\u2019s book is a thoroughly reported look behind that curtain, describing Mr. Ailes\u2019s operational aggression, but there is nothing in it that is off brand or inconsistent with what we\u2019ve learned about Mr. Ailes over the years. He is who we think he is. Part of the reason he and his allies have campaigned against the book is not because it is false, but because it tells a true story. Mr. Ailes has run Fox News as a political operation from the start, enthusiastically serving as a kingmaker in Republican politics. After all, the man in charge of the Fox News decision desk for the highly contested 2000 presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore was John Ellis, a cousin of Mr. Bush\u2019s. According to Mr. Sherman\u2019s book, as vote totals in Florida crept in on that fateful night, Mr. Ellis got off the phone at 2 a.m. and exclaimed, \u201cJebbie says we got it!\u201d The walls between the respective estates have never been thinner than that. The book portrays life at Fox News as occasionally brutal, run by a leader Mr. Sherman describes over and over as paranoid. My favorite line comes in an account of the very fraught morning meetings Mr. Ailes runs. The goal was not to become the focus: \u201cIf you move, will the T-Rex see you?\u201d said one attendee. What it really tells you is everything you need to know about the reality distortion field around Fox News. It refused to engage with Mr. Sherman, and then attacked him for not engaging. It rebuffed his repeated requests to interview Mr. Ailes, but still believes it would have been appropriate for him to go over all the accusations in the book, arguing that not doing so is irresponsible and not in keeping with standard journalistic practice. In my experience, that would have been the beginning of a grinding war of attrition, with Fox executives pushing back on everything while yielding nothing. On Sunday, a Fox spokeswoman described Mr. Sherman\u2019s appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources\u201d as \u201canother example of the agenda-driven cottage industry built on attacking Fox News. The author\u2019s failure to secure an interview with the principal subject does not absolve his fact-checking obligations with the network.\u201dThere are a plenty of unnamed sources in the book attributing specific dialogue to Mr. Ailes, but picking on Mr. Sherman over facts will not change the narrative. He spent three years on the book, interviewed over 600 people, had two fact-checkers spend 2,000 hours going over his work and rendered his sourcing and reporting mostly transparent. The most devastating takeaway in Mr. Sherman\u2019s book is the idea that Mr. Ailes, a man who carried more bananas for the elephant than almost anyone, did significant damage to the Republican Party. Mr. Ailes is, in essence, a fairly moderate Republican, a fan of both Bushes, a promoter of Mr. Christie and the former military leader David Petraeus. Those versions of middle-of-the-road Republicans would have an awfully hard time running the Tea Party gantlet Mr. Ailes all but invented in his push for ratings. As Mr. Sherman writes near the end of his book, Mr. Ailes discovered that \u201ctelevision and politics were different disciplines.\u201d Fox News doesn\u2019t need a working majority, it does not have to govern or compromise, it does not need to do anything other than win enough ratings to stay on top.But in the last election, Mr. Ailes conflated his two passions to damaging effect. He gave jobs to many Republican candidates, offered oodles of advice to them, and provided hundreds of hours of airtime for the cooking and serving of conservative red meat. With an economy in shambles and a foreign policy that was all over the road, the incumbent seemed vulnerable. But that was before the conservative fringe, with a big assist from Fox News, all but kidnapped the Republican side of the argument. In Mr. Sherman\u2019s book, Mr. Ailes is quoted by fellow Fox News executives as saying, \u201cI want to elect the next U.S. president.\u201d It could be argued that he succeeded, although it wasn\u2019t the candidate he wanted.Email: carr@nytimes.com; \nTwitter: @carr2n Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Britain Scrambles to Fill Skills Gap", "Date": "2014-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTAFFORD, England \u2014 For the last two years, Josh Younger, 19, has been learning how to fuse heavy steel pipes used in nuclear power plants, spending hours each day behind a welding helmet and surrounded by the acrid smell of burned metal.The job, called high-integrity welding, is one that most young people in Britain probably do not know or care much about. But it is essential to keeping the economy turning. And so are many other jobs that British youths tend to overlook.Despite relatively high unemployment in Britain, especially among young people, there is a marked shortage of skilled manufacturing workers. The problem is so acute that the government and industrial companies are behind an unprecedented push to get teenagers like Mr. Younger into apprenticeships, to close that gap.The programs are untested and face many obstacles. But as an apprentice at the British unit of Alstom, a French utilities and transport construction group, Mr. Younger is the type of worker that Britain sorely needs as it tries to rebuild its flagging industrial base, compete against other countries and improve its trade balance.\u201cI wanted to get a hands-on experience, and I was sick of doing A-levels,\u201d said Mr. Younger, referring to Britain\u2019s college entrance exams. Even with a university degree, he said, \u201cyou\u2019re not guaranteed a job, nor do you have any work experience.\u201dHis friends at university are saddled with student debt, Mr. Younger said, while he is already earning an annual salary of about 23,000 pounds, or $38,000. And annual wages for an experienced welder can top \u00a340,000 \u2014 twice the national median income.The British government is trying to catch up with countries like Germany and Switzerland, which have retained their competitive edge with the help of well-honed apprenticeship programs with ancient roots in the guild system. But even those countries face the same problems that are hobbling Europe\u2019s labor market, as too few graduates and long-time unemployed have the skills needed to fill the growing number of innovation-based jobs.A third of employers across Europe have said that the lack of skills is causing major business problems in terms of higher costs, insufficient quality and lost time, according to a recent survey by the consulting firm McKinsey. At least 27 percent of the 2,600 companies surveyed said they had left an entry-level vacancy unfilled over the past year because there were no eligible applicants.Statistics like that, and the fact that about a quarter of people under 25 are jobless in Europe, prompted Britain to act. A record 868,700 people did apprenticeships in Britain last year, up 77 percent from three years ago. The government committed \u00a31.57 billion to the training last year, about half of that to programs for 16- to 18-year-olds.\u201cWe\u2019re 10 years too late in being proactive in getting apprenticeships,\u201d said Jim Mcilrath, a welding engineering manager at Alstom who is in charge of the training center in Stafford.Only a few hundred high-integrity welders are left in Britain, Mr. Mcilrath said, and there are too few younger ones coming along to replace them. He is worried that work on a nuclear power station set to begin in the next few years at Hinkley Point in Somerset will absorb all of Alstom\u2019s welders, meaning a shortage of welders for other projects.\u201cWe need skilled workers just to keep the lights on in this country,\u201d he said.The complaint is heard across Britain\u2019s manufacturing industries, with smaller businesses down the supply chain bearing the brunt of the shortage. Even at a big company like Alstom, there are not enough people technically competent to work in a unit that specializes in smart grids, a type of digital technology that delivers electricity efficiently.According to a recent survey conducted by EEF, a British trade group, four out of five manufacturers currently have trouble recruiting. Those that do apply for jobs, they said, often lack even basic technical skills.About 2.74 million new jobs in British manufacturing are expected by 2020, of which 1.86 million will require engineering skills, EEF said. Companies will need to double both the current number of qualified recruits and of apprenticeships to fill those positions.Britain is among the worst in the developed world at equipping its young people with numeracy and literacy skills, according to a recent survey by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. A separate report about the career aspirations of high school students showed them to be heavily skewed toward jobs in acting, media and professional sports. Engineers and skilled workers were as unpopular as locksmiths and plumbers.\u201cWithout that manufacturing base that other countries have, we will continue to be in a deficit, and I don\u2019t know how long that will be sustainable,\u201d said Tony Dolphin, the chief economist at the Institute for Public Policy Research, a research group in London. \u201cIf we\u2019re not paying our way in the world, we\u2019re losing the global race.\u201dBrompton Bicycle is an example of how such programs can help. The apprenticeship system it started more than 20 years ago has helped turn a small builder of handmade foldable bikes into a global leader in that category.All of the employees at Brompton, which is based in Middlesex, near London, start out as apprentices on the factory floor. The system helps to ensure that the intellectual property and craftsmanship stays in Britain.Liam Brooker, who started as an apprentice at age 19, is now, six years later, Brompton\u2019s star at brazing \u2014 a complex form of welding that is key to keeping the bikes\u2019 frames supple and light.\u201cBrompton has made the rule that \u2018Made in England\u2019 involves highly skilled people,\u201d Mr. Brooker said during a break. \u201cIt makes me proud when I see a Brompton bike. It\u2019s a real craft.\u201dBut how much apprenticeships will improve Britain\u2019s employment picture more generally is an open question. Critics, including academics who study youth unemployment, say the quality of the programs needs to improve and doubt that increasing the numbers will translate into more jobs for young people.Some manufacturers have said that young people do not have basic skills and at times not even the motivation and self-discipline to follow through with an apprenticeship. One executive at a manufacturing company, who asked not to be identified, complained that one young woman asked to start the workday at 10 a.m. because she was not an early riser and to finish before 4 p.m. so she could get home for her favorite television show.Part of the challenge for Britain is turning around the bad reputation that apprenticeships can have, often being associated with dull, menial tasks that evoke images of Oliver Twist, the Dickens character who faced life as an apprentice to a chimney sweep.Britain, like Germany, has a record of apprenticeships back to medieval times, when boys were hired as young as 7 and often worked in brutal conditions. But the nature of apprenticeships improved with the advent of tighter labor laws.By the late 19th century, apprenticeships had expanded from artisan trades to newer industries like engineering and shipbuilding, and later to trades like plumbing and electrical work. But they began to disappear in the 1960s as manufacturing activity shrank and full-time education became available to everyone. Many people started viewing apprentices as youngsters who were not intelligent enough to go to university.\u201cIn the culture of the country, putting apprenticeships on a pedestal takes time,\u201d Matthew Hancock, Britain\u2019s minister of state for skills and enterprise, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s only when the training becomes high quality that apprenticeships will be widely regarded as being as good as an academic education.\u201dMr. Younger, the apprentice welder at Alstom, says he is happy with the direction he sees his career heading. While he has two more years to go in his apprenticeship, he intends to pursue degrees related to welding engineering and management at a local university, all sponsored by the company.\u201cWhen I began my apprenticeship I hadn\u2019t done any welding before and had to start from the basics,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good opportunity. Nowadays, for young people to get a job, it seems that experience matters more. And so far, I haven\u2019t been struggling for money.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The F-150\u2019s Aluminum Diet", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDetroit Auto ShowDETROIT \u2014 When Ford rolls out its redesigned F-150 pickup truck here on Monday morning to kick off two days of press previews for the 2014 North American International Auto Show, the automaker will be making one of the boldest product gambles in its 111-year history. The calculated risk Ford is taking \u2014 casting aside the traditional and long proven welded steel construction of the truck\u2019s cab and cargo bed and switching to a body that is largely lightweight aluminum \u2014 is sure to rank among the most important news items coming from the automakers\u2019 displays at the show. In most years, the star attraction of this annual industry showcase is something like the lustworthy Chevrolet Corvette Stingray of last January. That the headline-grabber of the 2014 show might turn out to be a vehicle as utilitarian and practical as the F-150 says a lot about what a great leap this pickup is. The much-anticipated switch in materials \u2014 an investment of billions of dollars by Ford in factory updates, production tooling and engineering expertise \u2014 is a breakthrough in scale and a first for pickups. It is aimed at drastically reducing the F-150\u2019s weight to improve fuel economy. According to engineers involved in its development, the new truck is expected to be some 15 percent lighter over all than the steel 2014 version, with the aluminum body and bed alone shaving more than 450 pounds. Including engine and suspension components, aluminum is expected to account for as much 1,000 pounds of the truck\u2019s weight. Cutting weight is widely regarded as the most cost-effective way to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gases. Industry experts say that trimming weight by 10 percent results, on average, in a fuel-economy improvement of 6 to 7 percent. By Ford\u2019s calculations, the 2015 truck, equipped with a new 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6 and a 6-speed automatic transmission, will be capable of achieving \u201cclose to\u201d 30 miles a gallon in the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s highway test when it goes on sale this year, according to engineers who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the ratings have not been formally announced. A 30 m.p.g. rating would catapult the F-150 well beyond its competitors, led by the 2014 Ram 1500 HFE at 25 m.p.g. highway, and would handily top the thriftiest (23 m.p.g. highway) 2014 F-150. And \u2014 this is the payoff \u2014 it would bring Ford\u2019s most profitable vehicle line closer to meeting the government\u2019s future fleet mileage standards, which call for vehicles with a footprint as large as a full-size pickup to average 30.2 m.p.g. by 2025.The new F-150 arrives after a giddy 2013 for automakers, in which vehicle sales in the United States rose 7.6 percent, to 15.6 million. Now entering its 13th generation, the F-150 has been America\u2019s best-selling vehicle for 32 consecutive years \u2014 763,402 were sold last year \u2014 and the top-selling truck for 37 years. The F-Series accounts for 35 percent of Ford\u2019s North American revenue, according to IHS Automotive, a market analysis firm.The new F-150 is Ford\u2019s first step in a broad strategy to shift all of its full-size truck bodies, including the F-250 and F-350 Super Duty pickups and the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator S.U.V.\u2019s, to primarily aluminum construction over the next three years, Ford engineers said. The plan will create common manufacturing processes and tooling in Ford\u2019s three United States truck plants. \u201cFord is stepping out ahead of the other truck makers with the aluminum strategy,\u201d said Richard Schultz of Ducker Worldwide, which tracks industrial materials usage. Engineers involved with the program credit Alan Mulally, Ford\u2019s chief executive, with supporting the lightweight F-Series plan throughout the financial crisis, when Ford was forced to drop some vehicle programs and mortgage assets to avoid the financial hardships that hit General Motors and Chrysler.Despite aluminum\u2019s widespread use in heavy-truck cabs and in military vehicles, aircraft and warships \u2014 where its combination of strength, durability, weight savings and corrosion resistance is paramount \u2014 there are still critics among pickup customers who equate the light metal with beer-can flimsiness. But engineers say that a stamped-aluminum body can equal or even outperform steel in overall strength, dent resistance and crash protection, depending on the material used, its thickness and how the structure is designed and assembled. There are challenges: While it will probably be months before the 2015 prices are announced, industry experts say that the use of aluminum will raise the cost of producing F-150s by several hundred dollars.Ford is using 5000- and 6000-series sheet \u2014 the numbers indicate the particular alloys \u2014 supplied by Alcoa and Novelis. These alloys are popular with automakers because they are easy to form, rugged and, in the case of 6000, provide the smooth \u201cclass A\u201d surfaces required for visible panels like fenders. About half of the truck\u2019s stampings will use the more expensive 6000-series sheet, heat-treated to a T4 condition, a manufacturing step that significantly toughens the material by heating it to 750 degrees Fahrenheit for two hours, followed by immediate quenching in water. The material hardens further when the body goes through the paint-drying oven. Ford engineers said the F-150\u2019s body and box strength also comes from the combination of structural adhesive \u2014 basically industrial glue \u2014 and some 4,000 rivets used to join much of the aluminum, replacing about 7,000 spot welds of a steel truck. While the bodies will shift to aluminum, F-Series models will continue to use separate steel ladder-type frames, which are the foundation of the trucks\u2019 towing and payload capabilities. The frame of the F-150 is a new design that is stronger, yet 80 pounds lighter, than the 2014 version. Its front section is made using a process called roll forming, which results in an exceptionally robust yet lighter structure, Ron Krupitzer, head of automotive applications at the Steel Market Development Institute, said. Other parts remaining in steel include side-impact door beams and the front and rear bumpers.While Ford has experimented with various aluminum-intensive concepts since the 1980s, the focus was mainly on unibody designs, which do not have separate frames. The automaker came close to producing an all-aluminum sedan in the mid-1990s, according to Mr. Schultz, who at the time was an executive at Alcoa. Instead, company leaders decided to invest in aluminum bodies for Jaguar, which Ford owned in 1990-2007, and from that relationship Ford is said to have retained intellectual-property rights to much of the aluminum forming and assembly technologies. Ford\u2019s only production vehicle with an aluminum-intensive body was the Ford GT supercar, built in small numbers in 2004-6.As global fuel-economy laws have become more stringent, aluminum\u2019s use in automotive applications has steadily grown. But volume production of all-aluminum bodies had been limited to luxury makes like Audi, Jaguar Land Rover and Mercedes. With the 2015 F-150, Ford changes everything. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wintry Blast Chills Sales of Houses", "Date": "2014-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Sales of new single-family homes fell more than expected in December, but lean inventories and steady price gains suggested the housing market recovery remained intact.Economists did not appear to be too concerned about the second monthly decline in home sales, attributing it to frigid weather in parts of the United States. Home sales for the full year hit their highest level since 2008. \u201cIt\u2019s cold out there for the economy,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. \u201cThe drop in new-home sales is not a sign the economy at large is starting to slow in a worrisome manner.\u201dThe Commerce Department reported on Monday that new-home sales fell 7 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 414,000 units. Sales were at a 445,000-unit pace in November and economists had expected them to slow to only a 457,000-unit rate in December.Apart from the bitterly cold weather, last month\u2019s decline in sales was most likely a continuation of a slowdown after October\u2019s outsize 14.9 percent increase. Sales in the Northeast, which was hard hit by cold weather, tumbled 36.4 percent to their slowest pace since June 2012.Home sales are usually weak during the winter, but a cold snap last month could have exaggerated the scale of the slowdown. New-home sales stumbled in the summer after mortgage rates jumped, but economists said a lack of supply could also be curbing activity.\u201cThere has been some pause in sales, some of that may be supply-related rather than demand-related,\u201d said Samuel Coffin, an economist at UBS. \u201cIf you look at the inventory data for new and existing homes, they don\u2019t look consistent with a big falloff in demand.\u201dLast month, the supply of houses on the market fell 2.8 percent to 171,000 units. That was the lowest since July.At December\u2019s sales pace it would take five months to clear the supply of houses on the market. That was up from 4.7 months in November. A supply of six months is considered healthy.Housing is expected to have contributed significantly to economic growth last year, through residential investment and rising home prices that have increased the net worth of households, allowing for greater discretionary spending.\u201cWe expect new home sales activity should pick up in the coming year along with improving economic growth,\u201d said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.For all of 2013, a total of 428,000 new single family homes were sold, a 16.4 percent increase from 2012. The median price of a new home last month rose 4.6 percent from December 2012. For the year as a whole, prices were up 8.4 percent, the most since 2005.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Critics Say Spill Highlights Lax West Virginia Regulations", "Date": "2014-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast week\u2019s major chemical spill into West Virginia\u2019s Elk River, which cut off water to more than 300,000 people, came in a state with a long and troubled history of regulating the coal and chemical companies that form the heart of its economy.\u201cWe can\u2019t just point a single finger at this company,\u201d said Angela Rosser, the executive director of West Virginia Rivers Coalition. \u201cWe need to look at our entire system and give some serious thought to making some serious reform and valuing our natural resources over industry interests.\u201dShe said lawmakers have yet to explain why the storage facility was allowed to sit on the river and so close to a water treatment plant that is the largest in the state.Ms. Rosser and others noted that the site of the spill has not been subject to a state or federal inspection since 1991. West Virginia law does not require inspections for chemical storage facilities \u2014 only for production facilities.Some other states do require inspections of chemical storage facilities. Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said he was working with Randy Huffman, the secretary of the State Department of Environmental Protection, to come up with recommendations aimed at avoiding future leaks.The Charleston Gazette-Mail reported Sunday that a team of experts from the United States Chemical Safety Board asked the state three years ago to create a new program to prevent accidents and releases in the Kanawha Valley, known as Chemical Valley.Critics say the problems are widespread in a state where the coal and chemical industries, which drive much of West Virginia\u2019s economy and are powerful forces in the state\u2019s politics, have long pushed back against tight federal health, safety and environmental controls.\u201cWest Virginia has a pattern of resisting federal oversight and what they consider E.P.A. interference, and that really puts workers and the population at risk,\u201d said Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a lecturer in environmental health at George Washington University.But Mr. Huffman disputed that accusation, noting that West Virginia\u2019s economy is more heavily dependent than other states on the coal and chemical industries. \u201cBased upon the types of industrial activity, how does it compare to the rest of the country? It\u2019s not in context.\u201d Although he added, \u201cThat\u2019s no excuse for any incident where someone gets hurt.\u201dEfforts to clean up the spill showed signs of improvement on Sunday.\u201cThe numbers look good, and like last night, they are very encouraging,\u201d Governor Tomblin said in a news conference on Sunday. \u201cI believe we\u2019re at a point where we can say we\u2019re seeing light at the end of the tunnel.\u201dOfficials said tests conducted at a water treatment plant downstream from the site of the leak showed little to no traces of contamination on Sunday morning, allowing testing to move to the next phase.Once the testing is complete, the water company plans to begin lifting the do-not-use ban by zones. The work will start in downtown Charleston and three other \u201cpriority zones\u201d that include the city\u2019s four major hospitals and 25,000 customers who use more than half of the company\u2019s water, said Jeff McIntyre, the president of West Virginia American Water.\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019re several days from starting the lift, but I\u2019m saying not today,\u201d Mr. McIntyre said.Government offices and many businesses planned to reopen on Monday, while many schools in the affected areas would remain closed, officials said.\u201cStores are open,\u201d said Jimmy Gianato, the state director of homeland security. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get back to normal.\u201dEmergency rooms have treated about 169 patients for symptoms related to chemical exposure, said Karen Bowling, the state health secretary. Ten people were admitted to three hospitals with symptoms that were not life threatening, she said.The chemical in last Thursday\u2019s spill was 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, known as MCHM. The leak at the Elk River storage facility came from a ruptured tank storing this chemical, which is used to wash coal.No charges have been filed against Freedom Industries, the company that owns the plant, but the United States attorney\u2019s office has already begun an investigation into the spill.This is not the first chemical accident to hit West Virginia\u2019s Kanawha Valley.After an explosion at a West Virginia chemical plant owned by Bayer CropScience killed two employees in 2008, a 2010 congressional investigation found that managers refused for several hours to tell emergency responders the nature of the blast or the toxic chemical it released. It also found that they later misused a law intended to keep information from terrorists to try to stop federal investigators from learning what had happened. The plant manufactured the same chemical that was being processed at the time of a gas release in 1984 that killed 10,000 in Bhopal, India.West Virginia is also no stranger to accidents in the coal industry.In June 2009, four environmental groups petitioned the E.P.A. to take over much of West Virginia\u2019s handling of the Clean Water Act, citing a \u201cnearly complete breakdown\u201d in the state.\u201cHistorically, there had been a questionable enforcement ethic,\u201d said Matthew Crum, a former state mining director at the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection.Cindy Rank, chairwoman of the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy\u2019s mining committee, said that the coal lobby has wielded great influence in crafting state environmental regulations. \u201cAccidents are always preventable. For the most part I think that\u2019s true in these disasters that keep happening,\u201d she said. She recalled negotiations over a groundwater protection bill from the early 1990s. \u201cWe swallowed hard and allowed the coal industry to get away with a lot in that bill,\u201d she said.An article on Monday about the chemical spill in West Virginia misstated the year and the circumstances of the Bhopal disaster in India. It was 1984, not 1985, and the deaths were caused by a release of gas, not by a giant explosion.Coral Davenport reported from Washington, and Ashley Southall from New York. Daniel Heyman contributed reporting from Charleston, W.Va., and Jack Begg from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Natural Gas Prices Soar as Mercury Plummets", "Date": "2014-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Natural gas prices spiked by nearly 10 percent on Friday to levels not seen since 2010 as another wave of freezing weather brought surges of heating and electricity demand.Bone-chilling weather had already strained the natural gas pipeline system serving the Northeast in early January, and the thermometer\u2019s latest plunge caused natural gas prices to rise by more than 5 percent nationally on each of four consecutive days. Friday\u2019s price of $5.20 per thousand cubic feet was the first time gas had crossed the symbolic $5 threshold in three and a half years, although the current price is still roughly a third of the gas price before the 2008 financial crisis and the surge in domestic production since then.Energy experts said the new price increases were likely to mean higher electricity and heating costs over the next year, although utilities typically use hedging instruments and strategies on commodity exchanges and other markets to stabilize retail prices. There has also been some fuel switching from natural gas to coal, partly reversing a trend of recent years.The sudden surge in gas prices, following a slow climb over the last year and a half, represents a break from a deep slump in gas prices between 2009 and early 2012 because of a frenzy of drilling in shale gas fields across Texas, Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Arkansas.With gas prices plummeting to a low of $1.92 per thousand cubic feet in April 2012, less than one-fifth of gas prices in Europe and Asia, the domestic fertilizer, plastics and chemical industries began to enjoy an upturn, with some industries relocating plants from abroad back to the United States. At the same time, cities and businesses began to convert their bus and truck fleets to run on natural gas to take advantage of the low gas prices, further bolstering demand, and natural gas producers slowed their drilling.Energy analysts say that the sudden price increase this month is almost entirely related to the weather, but it appears to be lasting.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be facing higher prices through the winter at least,\u201d said Addison A. Armstrong, senior director of market research at Tradition Energy, a consultancy, \u201cbecause of the double shot of Arctic weather, which is expected to extend at least into early February, and because forecasts for inventories for the end of winter look to be the lowest in a decade.\u201dInventories a week ago were 2.42 trillion cubic feet, 13 percent below the five-year average for mid-January. The natural gas price, up by nearly a third over the last two weeks, is roughly 50 percent higher than last year. Mr. Armstrong said it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that gas prices would go below $4 per thousand cubic feet for the rest of the year despite the near-record domestic gas production.Higher natural gas prices should help oil and gas company profits at a time when oil and gasoline prices have been declining and production costs rising. It should also encourage more natural gas drilling in areas of northern Texas, Arkansas and northwestern Louisiana, where drilling booms bolstered local economies until a price bubble burst and drilling wound down in recent years.But at least temporarily, energy experts said the cold weather could stymie some gas production because of power outages and freezes inside pipes at well sites in Pennsylvania and North Dakota. Freezing temperatures have even interrupted some oil and gas field work as far south as Texas, which experienced rare sleet and ice storms on Friday. Advertisement"}

The new orders index came in at 49.8, the first contraction in six months.Figures on Monday showed China\u2019s annual economic growth slowed to a six-month low of 7.7 percent in the October-December quarter.Momentum has slowed because of a weakening in exports and the government\u2019s shift toward restructuring the economy.While the economy narrowly missed expectations for full-year growth to fall to a 14-year low in 2013, some economists say a further slowdown appears inevitable this year as the Chinese government makes some difficult changes. These include reducing government intervention to allow financial markets to have a bigger say in allocating resources, and promoting domestic consumption at the expense of investment and exports.Full-year growth in 2013 was 7.7 percent, steady from 2012 and just slightly above market expectations for a 7.6 percent expansion, which would have been the slowest since 1999.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Time for a Deal in Ukraine", "Date": "2014-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe political crisis in Ukraine has reached a critical turning point, at which each side must consider what it stands to lose from further conflict. On Saturday, President Viktor Yanukovych unexpectedly offered serious concessions to opponents camped out on the Maidan, as Independence Square in Kiev is known, including senior government posts to two of the opposition leaders. On Tuesday, his prime minister and close political ally, Mykola Azarov, resigned, while the Parliament voted to repeal most of the laws passed earlier in the crisis limiting freedom of speech and assembly. Then on Thursday, the president went on sick leave, but without signing into law the repeal, leaving both the measure and a broader, negotiated solution with the opposition hanging in the air. Mr. Yanukovych has to be aware that his grip on power is slipping fast, and that his political survival depends on cutting a deal. That might seem to argue for the opposition to continue fighting until his corrupt administration is ousted. But danger lies that way. For one thing, the Ukrainian economy is disintegrating. The Russian aid that helped persuade Mr. Yanukovych to reject an agreement with the European Union last November \u2014 and thus triggering the protests \u2014 has provided a slim financial lifeline. Perhaps ominously for Mr. Yanukovych, reports from Kiev on Wednesday suggested that Russia might refuse to come through with the next $2 billion of its $15 billion package. Another problem is that the opposition is united largely in its disgust with the corruption and authoritarianism of the Yanukovych-led political elite and a vague longing for Westernization and transparency. Beyond that, the protesters are sharply divided. The differences were on display Wednesday when five people were wounded in a spat over who would control the occupied building of the Agriculture Ministry.  No matter how incompetent, discredited or unhealthy he may be, Mr. Yanukovych is the democratically elected president, and to oust him by street protests and without a coherent plan or united leadership would be a recipe for further turmoil and a dangerous precedent. This is not the time to spurn negotiations. Though the opposition rightly rejected Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s offer of two government positions, it should take his concessions seriously and join him in seeking a suitable compromise. The West could help by seriously considering emergency aid and by proposing to actively mediate. A popular revolt that began with hope in the West should not end in disillusionment with the West.

{"Headline": "Planet Hillary", "Date": "2014-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHillary Clinton was nodding solemnly to the mother of a 9/11 victim when Huma Abedin, standing across the room, called out, \u201cLet\u2019s load!\u201d to the staff members and bodyguards. The former secretary of state had yet to pick up her award from the Voices of September 11th, but her entourage was already preparing to shuttle her off to the next event, a benefit for God\u2019s Love We Deliver, which was co-hosted by the designer Michael Kors and where she would sit next to the Vogue editor and former Obama bundler Anna Wintour. It was just another hectic fall evening in Manhattan for Clinton, and she was keeping herself busy as usual in the \u201cis she or isn\u2019t she\u201d interim. There were paid speeches to give (at $200,000 a pop) to the American Society of Travel Agents and the National Association of Realtors, filled with the wisdom gleaned from being the nation\u2019s top diplomat (\u201cleadership is a team sport\u201d was one favorite; \u201cyou can\u2019t win if you don\u2019t show up\u201d was another). There were awards to receive, like the one from Chatham House, a think tank in London, to which Clinton traveled on a commercial 757 like the one she used to command while working at the State Department. (\u201cThat was fun!\u201d she said of the flight.) And there were Beverly Hills galas to attend, which soon turned into schmooze sessions, like the ones with Harvey Weinstein and Richard Plepler and Jeffrey Katzenberg, yet another major Obama bundler.Through it all, the former first lady/secretary of state/likely Democratic candidate for president seemed gracious and untroubled, and yet it was hard not to feel an enjoy-it-while-it-lasts sort of sympathy for Clinton. She had, after all, spent four years at the State Department displaying great political and diplomatic and managerial skill, and in that process shed much of the baggage generally associated with the Clintons. Yet that very organizational meshugas already threatened, once again, to entangle her. Before Clinton had even left the State Department, last February, Ready for Hillary, a political-action committee supported by some of her old pals, had emerged. Emily\u2019s List, another PAC, introduced its Madam President initiative. While working on Barack Obama\u2019s re-election, Jim Messina, the savvy operative, had already courted Bill Clinton. There would even be Correct the Record, an initiative designed to defend Clinton against media attacks. Conservative groups had begun calling her still-presumptive campaign the Queen\u2019s Machine. They had a point.Unlike Barack Obama, who will leave the White House with more or less the same handful of friends he came in with, the Clintons occupy their own unique and formidable and often exhausting place in American politics. Over the decades, they\u2019ve operated like an Arkansas tumbleweed, collecting friends and devotees from Bill Clinton\u2019s kindergarten class to Yale Law School to Little Rock to the White House to the Senate and beyond. James Carville has compared the Clinton world, perhaps not so originally, to an onion (it\u2019s safest, he has said, to exist in the third or fourth layer), while other Clinton staff members, past and present, have an endless litany of other metaphors to make sense of it. One former aide told me that working for the Clintons is like staying at the Hotel California (\u201cYou can check out, but you can never leave\u201d); another person compared it to prison (\u201cNot everyone can adjust to life on the outside\u201d). Others compared it to a marriage, one as complicated and built on blind loyalty as Bill and Hillary\u2019s own. One former aide noted, succinctly, \u201cPeople want to feel important, and the Clintons don\u2019t snub people very well.\u201dThis may represent Hillary Clinton\u2019s biggest challenge for a hypothetical 2016 campaign. How can Clinton, who is 66, make American voters think about something other than her fraught personal and political past? How can she present herself as someone hungry to serve rather than as someone entitled to office? It starts, perhaps, by figuring out how to deal with many of those characters assembled along the way. \u201cI love Barbra Streisand,\u201d says Donna Brazile, the Democratic strategist who worked on both of Bill Clinton\u2019s campaigns, \u201cbut Beyonc\u00e9 is what\u2019s happening now. I love Peter, Paul and Mary, but she needs to be Justin Timberlake. She can\u2019t afford to kick people out, but she can afford to let new people come in. I realize that\u2019s uncomfortable.\u201d Put another way, the members of America\u2019s most dysfunctional extended political family are about to meet a lot of young new operatives who don\u2019t work in the same way. The Clintons may have come to power when an offensive election strategy meant digging up files of opposition research, but presidential politics are increasingly the province of number-crunching quants and code-breaking hackers. \u201cThe challenge is to create ways for people to help but also to figure out who the next generation is,\u201d says Steve Elmendorf, deputy campaign manager on John Kerry\u2019s 2004 presidential run. \u201cEven David Plouffe is a generation removed. Who is the 32-year-old version of David?\u201dIt\u2019s an organizational conundrum that even members of Hillary Clinton\u2019s innermost circle already concede. \u201cThe Next Generation launched a coup to dispose [of] the old fogies,\u201d Philippe I. Reines, Clinton\u2019s principal gatekeeper, jokingly told me this summer, when I asked if he had joined her post-State personal staff. (Reines, who worked for Chelsea Clinton in 2008, self-effacingly included himself in the Old Generation.) The fault line, it seemed, was drawn at the 2008 campaign. A few months later, over lunch near the White House, Reines laughed as a couple of meddlesome emails popped up on his BlackBerry from two older Clinton loyalists who had re-emerged since she left State. In between bites of a shrimp cocktail, he called these noodges \u201cspace cowboys,\u201d referring to the 2000 film in which Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland play aging pilots who reunite to disarm a Soviet-era satellite on one last mission. (Reines was quick to add that these old-timers ultimately saved the world.)Several people close to Clinton have already discussed installing someone to play the role of \u201cchief listener,\u201d whose job would be to make these well-meaning old-timers feel \u201cheard\u201d while simultaneously buffering their noise \u2014 a position that didn\u2019t exist in 2008. If she decides to run, says Melanne Verveer, Clinton\u2019s White House chief of staff, \u201cthe next question is how is she going to organize this group of people\u201d who all want to contribute. The complication, of course, will be doing so without creating the vitriol and noise that scuttled her last campaign. \u201cI think she understands she has to be, and will be, welcoming to new people, especially people with technical expertise and know-how,\u201d one former Obama aide says. \u201cBut the knives will be out from people protecting their place in the world.\u201dThe cloistered State Department offered Clinton a chance to define herself away from her husband and to shed the stench of managerial dysfunction that still lingered from the campaign. Legally she could not participate in fund-raising or political activity, and so the period, noted one staff member, seemed like a quiet four-year pause. \u201cI had a lot of anxiety before I took the job,\u201d Thomas R. Nides, who served as deputy secretary of state for management and resources under Clinton, told me. \u201cI had never worked for them before, and I didn\u2019t know what I was getting myself into. Was every day going to be the outside claqueurs coming in and asking, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 and wanting to be a part of everything?\u201d Nides, who is now vice chairman of Morgan Stanley, said he was impressed by Clinton\u2019s ability to shut out the opinions of old political aides. \u201cTo the Clintons\u2019 credit, they communicate with a lot of people, but I think she has a filter now \u2014 to filter some of that out of her head and basically take the advice she is getting from her team.\u201dThe job of keeping out the claqueurs now falls partly on Reines, who is known in the Clinton world as slightly paranoid, often hilarious and somewhat quirky. He is 44 and lives in a Dupont Circle apartment with his cats Uday and Qusay, named after the thuggish sons of Saddam Hussein. He once accidentally stuck his fingers in my water glass over breakfast to clear a stain from his dress shirt. At lunch, he orders an Arnold Palmer and a Diet Coke, seemingly just because. He also instills a healthy dose of terror in the extended Clinton family that his boss is said to appreciate. Almost everyone I talked to dutifully emailed Reines to ask for permission before they spoke to me. \u201cIf Philippe told me not to talk to you, I wouldn\u2019t have talked to you,\u201d Lanny Davis, a lawyer who served as a special White House counsel under Clinton, told me. (Reines, for the record, said he named his cats Uday and Qusay merely because they\u2019re brothers and \u201cwere little terrorists when they were kittens.\u201d)At breakfast, at lunch, on emails, on conference calls, over dumplings at Pei Wei Asian Diner and in meetings with Clinton\u2019s inner sanctum, Reines is often joined by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and Clinton\u2019s press secretary, Nick Merrill. Merrill, who is fresh-faced and plays the perfect good cop to Reines\u2019s bad cop, is also a junior Clinton lifer. Together, the combined forces of Nickilippe project a tightly knit, loyal-till-death image that\u2019s already reflected in Clinton\u2019s personal staff. Until recently, her seven personal aides worked out of a tiny Washington office (\u201csmaller than my first N.Y.C. apartment,\u201d one aide said in an email) on Connecticut Avenue. Soon, though, she will move Merrill and the others, whom she pays out of her own pocket, into a Manhattan office, which, contrary to previous reports, will not be in the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation offices in the Time & Life Building. Ted Widmer, a former speechwriter for President Clinton, is on hand to assist with writing Hillary\u2019s memoir about her time at the State Department, set to be published by Simon & Schuster this summer. Reines will presumably work on the book rollout and tour, which could serve as a campaign prologue.Huma Abedin, who began her career as a White House aide while studying at George Washington University, serves as Clinton\u2019s chief of staff. Abedin is, of course, married to Anthony Weiner. (Bill Clinton officiated the ceremony.) After Weiner\u2019s latest round of sexting was revealed, Clinton\u2019s inner circle rallied to support Abedin while protecting their boss\u2019s image; some of them encouraged Abedin to consider divorce; others, including past advisers outside the inner circle, have suggested that she be moved off the campaign (um, if there is a campaign) to a role at the foundation headquarters. Instead, in a move that aides say revealed Clinton\u2019s unflinching allegiance \u2014 and perhaps a level of sympathy only she could feel \u2014 Clinton kept Abedin attached at the hip. She \u201cinspires loyalty, and she\u2019s loyal back,\u201d another person close to the inner circle says.Clinton, who has done her fair share of damage control, seems less concerned with things like the potential embarrassment of Abedin\u2019s spouse than with building up a system that keeps out the \u201cnight stalkers,\u201d as termed by one former aide. In addition to the chief listener, one strategy that has sprung up appears to be to spread enough work around to make many in the old guard \u2014 from Little Rock friends to survivors of the 2008 campaign \u2014 feel useful and busy. One project is Ready for Hillary, which has become a kind of clearinghouse for people angling to get in early with the hypothetical campaign. Former White House aides, like Ann Lewis, Craig T. Smith (whose relationship with the Clintons goes back to Arkansas) and Harold M. Ickes (who took care of so many dust-ups during the White House years that he was known as the director of the sanitation department) have advised, raised money or visited battleground states on behalf of the PAC.But some of the Democratic Party\u2019s deepest-pocketed donors have described Ready for Hillary as a make-work program for former Clinton hands. From its inception, the group didn\u2019t exactly fit everyone\u2019s definition of a sophisticated, modern-day apparatus. It was started by Adam Parkhomenko, who worked as an assistant to Patti Solis Doyle in 2008 until Solis Doyle (who coined the term \u201cHillaryland\u201d back in the White House days) was ousted as campaign manager. Just out of high school, the earnest Parkhomenko started working for a Hillary-related PAC and has been trying to get Clinton elected president for much of his adult life. (He also works a couple of nights a month as a reserve officer with the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington.) The group raised $4 million last year, in part, by hawking iPhone cases with the black-and-white \u201cTexts From Hillary\u201d image of Clinton looking at her BlackBerry onboard a C-17 to Tripoli. Last month, Ready for Hillary held a low-dollar fund-raiser (tickets cost $20.16) at a K Street restaurant that featured photos with a cutout image of Clinton and a cash bar serving a gin and tonic called the Ceiling Breaker. The group scheduled a \u201ckickoff\u201d event this month in Des Moines.One Clinton supporter told me that the very specter of Smith in a swing state is a sign that the old buddy system is still alive and well. To his credit, Smith (whose firm is paid $10,000 a month by Ready for Hillary) said he recognizes that \u201cif there is a campaign, it\u2019s got to be [made up of] people who know how to run a campaign of 2016.\u201d In an effort to step up its grass-roots organizing, Ready for Hillary has already signed up numerous 20-something newcomers. It has also brought on the consulting company 270 Strategies, run by political operatives, including Jeremy Bird and Mitch Stewart, who were largely credited with Obama\u2019s ground strategy in 2008 and 2012.Where things get thorny, though, is that Priorities USA, the big-money group that helped get Obama elected, is situating itself as the dominant money-raiser in 2016. (Sean Sweeney, a founder of Priorities USA, says he supports Ready for Hillary\u2019s \u201cimportant\u201d mission.) In fact, two Obama operatives, Messina and Buffy Wicks, have already signed on to Priorities to turn it into a big-money behemoth devoted to a Clinton candidacy, and some Ready for Hillary supporters have accused Priorities of already trying to take credit for getting their candidate elected. (Never mind that the election is more than two years away and that there\u2019s technically no candidate yet.) Certainly Wicks and Messina offer something that the Clinton old guard doesn\u2019t \u2014 a link to the network of donors who supported Obama. But also crucial is the fact that neither has ever worked for the Clintons, which allows them to navigate the waters more easily. They don\u2019t carry the baggage, for instance, of other old friends who helped get Obama elected. David Axelrod, in particular, was approached by Solis Doyle as early as 2006 to join the Hillary campaign, and his decision to sign on with Obama was the first real signal that the Illinois senator might create a problem. Among Obama aides, there\u2019s a sense that Bill Clinton never quite forgave him. \u201cThe Clintons make you feel like you\u2019re part of their family; that\u2019s just who they are,\u201d says Brazile, whose neutrality during the 2008 Democratic primaries was seen by numerous Clinton hands as an act of betrayal. \u201cTry divorcing them. I did, and oh, my God, that\u2019s not easy. I felt like I had broken up with my best lover.\u201dIt\u2019s not just the rogue friends and former staff members who present potential problems. In the past, the Royal Council hasn\u2019t always gotten along so well with President Clinton\u2019s advisers, referred to sardonically by Hillary\u2019s staff members in White House as \u201cthe White Boys.\u201d The tensions have ebbed and flowed over the years but reached a low in 2007, when there was an early tug-of-war about how the campaign should utilize, and dote on, the former president. Recently, more existential differences have surfaced. People close to Bill Clinton have told me repeatedly that it irks them that Democrats don\u2019t talk about the dignified, slimmed-down, silver-haired former president with the same reverence Republicans give Ronald Reagan. According to those people, Bill Clinton, who is conscious of the demands of a presidential race and what another loss would do to his own legacy and philanthropic work, is deferential about whether his wife should run. When people shout at him that they\u2019re ready for Hillary, he simply responds with a \u201cThank you,\u201d rather than asking for their support as he did leading up to the 2008 campaign. (That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not curious. When Ready for Hillary held a seminar for donors at Le Parker Meridien hotel last fall to discuss what it would take to win in 2016, Bill Clinton personally checked in with an attendee to ask what was being discussed and who was there.)Efforts to cement Bill\u2019s legacy appear somewhat unaligned with Hillary\u2019s forward-looking team. (At a recent book party in New York, Bill started his speech by saying, \u201cI\u2019m not much for living in the past, but I do think it\u2019s worth going back to what we\u2019ve faced,\u201d and then proceeded to talk for 20 minutes about electoral politics and his career, dating to 1968.) Denizens of Hillaryland often express exasperation that even after successfully serving in the Senate and as secretary of state, their boss is still so closely identified with her husband. \u201cIt\u2019s my pet peeve when they\u2019re described as an entity,\u201d Geoffrey Garin, who stepped in as a chief strategist after Mark Penn\u2019s disastrous run in \u201908, told me. \u201cObviously they are married and do things together, but they are two separate people with two separate identities in political life.\u201dThe center of the orbit has become even more crowded now that Chelsea is in the game. The role of Chelsea, to the annoyance of some longtime Clinton aides \u2014 who referred to her as the Child \u2014 has become significantly more pronounced. While some loyalists still think of her as a teenager hanging around the Oval Office, she has become a formidable presence at the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. There she has assembled her own team, led by her chief of staff, Bari Lurie, a former White House aide who traveled with Chelsea during the 2008 campaign. She has her own press secretary, Kamyl Bazbaz, who worked for Hillary in 2008.Chelsea has now ostensibly taken over the foundation, and she wasted little time in putting her stamp on it. She played a key role in the long search for a new chief executive, which ultimately installed her friend and former McKinsey & Company colleague Eric Braverman as the replacement for Bruce Lindsey, who stepped down after working for Bill Clinton for decades. (Lindsey remains the foundation\u2019s chairman.) Braverman, however, soon got a lesson in political bungling when he hired a staffer to help with, among other things, his own publicity. The person he hired turned out to have worked on the eventual botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act, and Braverman was reminded in no uncertain terms that his job was not to seek his own publicity but to complement the Clintons\u2019 mission. (A foundation spokesman denies this.)Chelsea\u2019s ascent has had perhaps the biggest impact on Doug Band, Bill Clinton\u2019s longtime aide who was for years considered a surrogate son. Band clashed with Chelsea over the running of the foundation, and although he had stepped away from day-to-day operations by the time she arrived, he kept a hand in the Clinton Global Initiative, the philanthropic gathering he helped start. When Chelsea helped initiate an outside audit to review the state of the foundation, including the C.G.I., some staff members viewed the move, in part, as a means to denounce the old guard, most notably her surrogate brother. If that\u2019s what it was, it worked. (Lindsey said any assertion that the audit was personal is false.) Band, who has spent two decades in the Clinton world, is a case study in how treacherous it can be to navigate. He has been accused by several aides of being a source of published rumors insinuating that Chelsea and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, had marital problems. A person with knowledge of the situation told me Band was not, in fact, the source \u2014 and several others said, emphatically, that the couple have a happy, committed relationship. (Band declined to comment for this article.)In some way, Chelsea\u2019s rise could provide a natural bridge between the Old Generation with its lingering obsessions and grievances \u2014 the words \u201cimpeachment\u201d and \u201cWhitewater\u201d came up dozens of times in the reporting of this article \u2014 and the younger, number-crunching analysts. But Chelsea\u2019s assertiveness at the foundation, while seen as a blessing by her parents, has rubbed others the wrong way. Two longtime employees quit, citing, in part, their frustration with the changed atmosphere since she took over. (Five senior foundation employees who work closely with Chelsea told me she has brought only positive change. An aide also added that the handful of people who have historically called her the Child did so in an endearing way.) But one person with intimate knowledge of Clinton dynamics had a simpler explanation. According to this person, staff members \u2014 most notably Band \u2014 who were insecure about Chelsea\u2019s power had simply forgotten that they lived \u201cdownstairs.\u201dStill, even back in the Arkansas days, the Clintons knew how to ice out some of their more complicated friends. One recent Thursday morning, I stopped by the Little Rock apartment of Betsey Wright, just across the Interstate from the Clinton library on a leafy street lined with well-kept clapboard houses with wide porches and upholstered furniture out front. Around the corner is a Holiday Inn with a restaurant called Camp David (\u201ca hidden treasure with a culinary style surely fit for both presidents and first ladies\u201d; kids eat free). Wright, considered a mastermind behind Clinton\u2019s rise in Arkansas, was among the first in a long line of surrogate family members. She headed rapid response (or what she called \u201cbimbo eruptions\u201d) in the 1992 election and was immortalized by Kathy Bates in the film adaptation of \u201cPrimary Colors.\u201d After not joining Clinton\u2019s White House staff, Wright became a lobbyist and eventually returned home and began advocating for prisoners\u2019 rights. In 2009, though, she was arrested on 51 charges of smuggling contraband, including a box cutter and a knife and tattoo needles that were hidden in a bag of Doritos, on a visit to death row. She pleaded not guilty (and, later, no contest to lesser charges) and was released on probation. She did not respond to my many attempts to contact her, including in-person pleas to friends and a note left on her front porch.People who have known the Clintons the longest have all sorts of theories about how one of the country\u2019s most brilliant political minds could have ended up arrested with a bag of Doritos. She may be an extreme case, but Wright is also, some suggested, a kind of cautionary tale in how the sharp-elbowed business of being a Clinton soldier can scar some people. Wright, one Arkansas friend said, had personal issues; she became a liability \u2014 just as Solis Doyle and Penn and Band would later \u2014 and the Clintons cut her loose before they moved into the White House. Max Brantley, who is editor of The Arkansas Times and has known the Clintons for decades, told me over gumbo at the Capital Hotel bar in Little Rock that their relationship with Wright, and other aides, was more complicated than their simply rejecting her. \u201cIs it malicious? Or a business decision justified by circumstances?\u201d Brantley said. \u201cSome people get eaten up by the charisma and forget that, in the end, it is a business.\u201dThe problem, in part, is the Clintons\u2019 unique management style. Sitting at a New York coffee shop one afternoon, a person close to the Clintons, whom Nickilippe had not authorized to talk, pulled out a felt-tip pen and drew a triangle and a circle on a white cocktail napkin. The triangle, this person said, represented Obama\u2019s team, with the president on the top and everyone else clearly in their hierarchical place. The circle represented the Clintons, with everyone in a vortex angling for the innermost rings. Over the years, this amorphous setup has led to a fair amount of resentment and infighting. After Solis Doyle was pushed out in 2008, she went to work for the Obama campaign. Begala and Carville heralded Penn\u2019s struggles; Penn has said he sidelined them in the 1996 re-election, though neither was formally involved in the campaign. (Penn notably re-emerged to play a small part in advising President Clinton on his blockbuster keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.)Steve Ricchetti, a deputy chief of staff in the Clinton White House who now works for Vice President Biden, was considered so loyal to the first lady that President Clinton\u2019s staff called him Steve Rodham Ricchetti. Years later, one person close to the president accused Ricchetti of being a source in a controversial 2008 Vanity Fair article about the president\u2019s private life. (Ricchetti declined to comment.) Todd S. Purdum, a former New York Times reporter and the husband of Dee Dee Myers, a White House press secretary under Clinton, wrote that article.Clinton ran a relatively leak-free operation at State, but as the circle widens, the possibilities for people speaking out of school grows considerably. A recent leak to Politico about a private Clinton strategy session was a \u201cviolation\u201d that should serve as a red flag, one Obama aide said. When I asked Ickes why, as an obsessive diarist, he hadn\u2019t written a memoir after he was fired as deputy chief of staff in 1997, he cited loyalty. \u201cAs hard as it may be to imagine,\u201d Ickes told me, \u201cthere are people who feel loyal to the person they\u2019re serving.\u201d Then he offered a more revealing answer. \u201cThe Clintons are still major players in the national political scene, and even if people were inclined to write a book \u2014 and I\u2019ve never been inclined that way \u2014 they [have to] think the Clintons have a big reach and continue to influence the Democratic Party. Why do I need to get on the wrong side of them?\u201dThe de Blasio inauguration served as a reminder of another nuanced management challenge \u2014 her image \u2014 that Clinton will face in 2016. In their four decades in public life, as they\u2019ve amassed their chaotic and devoted network, the Clintons have undergone their own extraordinary transformation. This past fall, I watched Hillary try to navigate that tricky course between showing off her public-service chops and delaying the inevitable. Between rubbing elbows with celebrity bundlers, she conducted closed-door presentations to Wall Street bankers, in which she sprinkled phrases like \u201cof all the presidents I\u2019ve known.\u201d She referred to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor and unofficial steward of the European economy, as \u201ca close, personal friend\u201d whom \u201cI\u2019ve known for 20 years.\u201d At a Goldman Sachs event at the Conrad hotel in Lower Manhattan, Clinton answered a question about the Affordable Care Act, a topic she has carefully avoided in public, by denouncing conservatives\u2019 obstruction of the law and playing down the rocky rollout. \u201cThey\u2019ll either work it out or they won\u2019t,\u201d she said of the website\u2019s early glitches, which one person interpreted to mean that if Obama couldn\u2019t figure it out, her administration would.For all the pieces now falling into place, the staff members new and old looking for a seat at the table, the super PACs looking to take credit and the speeches to Wall Street executives (at one session with a hedge fund in 2013, Clinton conceded that any hypothetical candidate would have to decide \u201ctoward the middle of next year\u201d) \u2014 for all of the inevitable inevitability, perhaps the most important thing Hillary Clinton has to do is not appear like a big-footing Goliath who is finally getting her due. Six years ago, Iowans rejected Clinton, in part, because she seemed too entitled. I remember talking to caucus-goers who were turned off by the \u201cI\u2019m in to win\u201d video that kicked off her candidacy and others who cringed at the loud landing of the Hill-a-Copter, which cost several thousand dollars a day in a state where voters prefer their candidates in Greyhounds.When I asked David Axelrod what he thought Clinton had to do to win in 2016, he referred to the change she underwent during the last campaign. \u201cShe stumbled in 2007, when she was encased in a presumption of inevitability,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cAnd she was a very good candidate in 2008 after she got knocked back. Instead of a battleship, she became a speedboat, and she got down on the ground and really, I thought, really connected to the middle-class voters and people who were struggling. People who were struggling connected with her when she looked like she was struggling.\u201dIn her final months as secretary of state in the summer of 2012, when her approval ratings and press coverage were at all-time highs, I asked Bill Clinton what he thought of his wife\u2019s transformed image. Over coffee at the Hilton in Nicosia, Cyprus, he told me the story of having just finished working on the McGovern campaign, his official, and intoxicating, introduction into presidential politics. He said he told Hillary he\u2019d met some of the most prominent people of their generation, and she was by far the most gifted. \u201cYou should be in public life,\u201d he told her back then. \u201cShe said: \u2018Look at how hard-hitting I am. Nobody will ever vote for me for anything.\u2019 \u201d The former president also gave some thought to her current image. \u201cI think the country sees her the way those of us who know her see her.\u201dClinton seemed to be implying that Hillary was gifted and driven and committed to public service and also was someone who genuinely liked to knock back beers in Cartagena and hit the dance floor in Pretoria. And it was sweet to hear the former president talk about his wife this way. But it also seemed like an exercise in magical thinking, as if the intervening decades of public life \u2014 with all the attendant drama and political missteps and immense power accrued and wielded \u2014 hadn\u2019t complicated that vision of her. Hillary Clinton\u2019s truest challenge, it would seem, is not to make the country glimpse who she was 40 years ago; it\u2019s to recognize that for all the layers that have been added to the onion, there\u2019s still something at the center that\u2019s aching for the rest to be peeled away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Compromise: Not a 4-Letter Word", "Date": "2014-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFORMER SENATOR ALAN SIMPSON likes to say that if you can\u2019t learn to compromise on issues without compromising yourself, you should not be in Congress, be in business or get married. It is amazing how many people violate that rule, but especially in Congress and especially among the Tea Party types, where calling someone a \u201cdeal maker\u201d is now the ultimate put down. What makes it crazier is that in American education, innovation and commerce today, \u201ccollaboration\u201d is being taught and rewarded as the best way to do anything big, important and complex. Indeed, in Silicon Valley, a \u201ccollaborator\u201d means someone with whom you\u2019re building something great. In D.C., it means someone committing political treason by working with the other party. And that is why Silicon Valley is now the turbo-engine of our economy and D.C. is the dead hand.To be sure, in politics compromise is not a virtue in and of itself. There are questions of true principle \u2014 civil rights, for instance \u2014 where compromise might kill the principled choice. But there has been an inflation of \u201cprinciples\u201d lately that is inhibiting compromise. A certain tax rate or retirement age is not a principle. It\u2019s an interest that needs to be balanced against others. Today, we would be best served in meeting our biggest challenges by adopting a hybrid of the best ideas of left and right \u2014 and the fact that we can\u2019t is sapping our strength.For instance, on the debt/spending issue, Congress should be borrowing money at these unusually low rates to invest in a 10-year upgrade of our crumbling infrastructure (roads, bridges, telecom, ports, airports and rail lines) and in a huge funding increase for our national laboratories, research universities and institutes of health, which are the gardens for so many start-ups. Together, such an investment would stimulate sustained employment, innovation and the wealth creation to pay for it. But this near-term investment should be paired with long-term entitlement reductions, defense cuts and tax reform that would be phased in gradually as the economy improves, so we do not add to the already heavy fiscal burden on our children, deprive them of future investment resources or leave our economy vulnerable to unforeseen shocks, future recessions or the stresses that are sure to come when all the baby boomers retire. President Obama has favored such a hybrid, but it was shot down by the Tea Party wing, before we could see if he could really sell it to his base.We should exploit our new natural gas bounty, but only by pairing it with the highest environmental extraction rules and a national, steadily rising, renewable energy portfolio standard that would ensure that natural gas replaces coal \u2014 not solar, wind or other renewables. That way shale gas becomes a bridge to a cleaner energy future, not just an addiction to a less dirty, climate-destabilizing fossil fuel.In some cities, teachers\u2019 unions really are holding up education reform. But we need to stop blaming teachers alone. We also have a parent problem: parents who do not take an interest in their children\u2019s schooling or set high standards. And we have a student problem: students who do not understand the connection between their skills and their life opportunities and are unwilling to work to today\u2019s global standards. Reform requires a hybrid of both teacher reform and a sustained \u2014 not just one speech \u2014 national campaign to challenge parents and create a culture of respect and excitement for learning. Obama has failed to use his unique bully pulpit to lead such a campaign. Finally, the merger of globalization and the information-technology revolution has shrunk the basis of the old middle class \u2014 the high-wage, middle-skilled job. Increasingly, there are only high-wage, high-skilled jobs. This merger of globalization and I.T. has put capitalism \u2014 and its core engine of creative destruction \u2014 on steroids. That\u2019s why Republicans are wrong when they oppose raising minimum wages and expanding national health care. These kinds of social safety nets make the free market possible; otherwise people won\u2019t put up with creative destruction on steroids.\u00a0But it is capitalism, start-ups, risk-taking and entrepreneurship that make these safety nets affordable, which is why we need more tax incentives for start-ups, the substitutions of carbon taxes for payroll and corporate taxes, and more cuts to regulations that burden business. Unfortunately, promotion of risk-taking and risk-takers is disappearing from the Democratic Party agenda. Its energy and excitement is focused much more today on wealth redistribution than wealth creation. On immigration, Senate Democrats and Republicans forged a sensible hybrid solution, but Tea Partiers in the House are blocking it.These hybrid solutions are not how to split the difference. They\u2019re how to make a difference. But they only get forged if Republican leaders take on the Tea Party \u2014 which transformed the G.O.P. into a far-right party, uninterested in governing \u2014 and remake the G.O.P. into a center-right party again. If that happened, I\u2019m certain that a second-term Obama, who is much more center-left than the ridiculous G.O.P. caricatures, would meet them in the middle. Absent that, we\u2019re going to drift, unable to address effectively any of our biggest challenges or opportunities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Factory Output Growth Eases in China", "Date": "2014-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Growth in China\u2019s factories slowed slightly in December as export orders and output weakened, official data showed Wednesday, reinforcing the view that while the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States remains resilient, it lost some steam in late 2013.The official purchasing managers\u2019 index, published by the National Bureau of Statistics, dipped to 51 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index to ease to 51.2 from the November reading of 51.4. The 50-point mark separates expansion in activity from contraction.Many economists had said China\u2019s economy was likely to show weaker momentum in the final three months of 2013 after a rebound between July and September, because of slowing credit growth and a drop in restocking demand.\u201cBoth domestic and overseas demand was weaker than expected,\u201d said Li Heng, an economist at Minsheng Securities in Beijing. \u201cDomestically, tight liquidity is weighing on factory output and orders. The economy is under some downward pressures, but the slowdown remains modest.\u201dHe said his company estimated China\u2019s economic growth at 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, and growth for all of 2014 at around 7.5 percent. The government has said that industrial output may have grown 9.8 percent in 2013 and that economic growth could come in at 7.6 percent, just above the official target of 7.5 percent and slightly below the 7.7 percent pace in 2012.The purchasing managers\u2019 survey showed that new export orders contracted in December for the first time since July, pointing to weakness in overseas demand. Manufacturing employment contracted further in December.\u201cThe decline in the December P.M.I. points to some slowdown in economic growth,\u201d said Zhang Liqun, an economist at the Development Research Center, which helps compile the P.M.I. \u201cIndustrial output growth is likely to slow in the future, and export growth could also ease.\u201dThe official P.M.I. broadly mirrors the preliminary survey released in mid-December by HSBC and Markit Economics, which showed that factory sector activity grew at the slowest pace in three months because of subdued output. The final HSBC survey is due on Thursday. It is more weighted toward smaller and private companies than the official one, which contains more large and state-owned companies.Separately, two private surveys showed that Chinese property prices rose again in December but were displaying signs of stabilizing following government measures aimed at cooling the housing market and averting the threat of a bubble.Prices of new homes in 288 cities rose 0.37 percent in December from November, when they had risen 0.77 percent from the previous month, a poll by the real estate services firm E-House China showed on Wednesday. The prices climbed 10.04 percent from a year earlier, little changed from the annual rise in November of 10.11 percent. December was the seventh consecutive month of double-digit annual gains in the E-House survey.The other survey, by China Real Estate Index System, a consulting firm linked to China\u2019s largest online property information firm, SouFun Holdings, on Tuesday showed average prices in the 100 biggest cities rose 0.7 percent in December from November, when they had risen 0.68 percent from the previous month. It was the 19th straight monthly gain. On average, prices rose 11.5 percent in December from a year earlier, the company said in a statement, with prices in seven cities, including Beijing and Xiamen, increasing by 20 percent to 30 percent.\u201cWith the housing supply increasing in 2014, shortages are likely to be eased and developers will become more rational,\u201d the company statement said, adding that \u201cthere might be increasing divergence between big and small cities.\u201dHouse prices have surged in the past year, in part because of the view among Chinese that property remains one of the best investments. That has prompted the government to try to head off bubbles in the market without damaging one of the pillars of growth in a slowing economy. The steps include clampdowns on mortgage lending, increased construction of affordable homes and promises of more land for building.Official data released in December for 70 cities showed that prices rose 0.5 percent in November in month-on-month terms, with the pace slowing for a third consecutive month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Flood Next Time", "Date": "2014-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy DegreesThe little white shack at the water\u2019s edge in Lower Manhattan is unobtrusive \u2014 so much so that the tourists strolling the promenade at Battery Park the other day did not give it a second glance.Up close, though, the roof of the shed behind a Coast Guard building bristled with antennas and other gear. Though not much bigger than a closet, this facility is helping scientists confront one of the great environmental mysteries of the age.Scientists have spent decades examining all the factors that can influence the rise of the seas, and their research is finally leading to answers. And the more the scientists learn, the more they perceive an enormous risk for the United States.The detective work has required scientists to grapple with the influence of ancient ice sheets, the meaning of islands that are sinking in the Chesapeake Bay, and even the effect of a giant meteor that slammed into the earth.Tide gauges along the East Coast show a long-term increase in relative sea levels.That may not sound like much, but scientists say even the smallest increase causes the seawater to eat away more aggressively at the shoreline in calm weather, and leads to higher tidal surges during storms. The sea-level rise of decades past thus explains why coastal towns nearly everywhere are having to spend billions of dollars fighting erosion.Scientists say the East Coast will be hit harder for many reasons, but among the most important is that even as the seawater rises, the land in this part of the world is sinking. And that goes back to the last ice age, which peaked some 20,000 years ago.As a massive ice sheet, more than a mile thick, grew over what are now Canada and the northern reaches of the United States, the weight of it depressed the crust of the earth. Areas away from the ice sheet bulged upward in response, as though somebody had stepped on one edge of a balloon, causing the other side to pop up. Now that the ice sheet has melted, the ground that was directly beneath it is rising, and the peripheral bulge is falling.Some degree of sinking is going on all the way from southern Maine to northern Florida, and it manifests itself as an apparent rising of the sea.The sinking is fastest in the Chesapeake Bay region. Whole island communities that contained hundreds of residents in the 19th century have already disappeared. Holland Island, where the population peaked at nearly 400 people around 1910, had stores, a school, a baseball team and scores of homes. But as the water rose and the island eroded, the community had to be abandoned.Aside from this general sinking of land up and down the East Coast, some places sit on soft sediments that tend to compress over time, so the localized land subsidence can be even worse than the regional trend. Much of the New Jersey coast is like that. The sea-level record from the Battery has been particularly valuable in sorting out this factor, because the tide gauge there is attached to bedrock and the record is thus immune to sediment compression.Up and down the Eastern Seaboard, municipal planners want to know: How bad are things going to get, and how fast?People considering whether to buy or rebuild at the storm-damaged Jersey Shore, for instance, could be looking at nearly a foot of sea-level rise by the time they would pay off a 30-year mortgage, according to the Rutgers projections. That would make coastal flooding and further property damage considerably more likely than in the past.Even if the global sea level rises only eight more inches by 2050, a moderate forecast, the Rutgers group foresees relative increases of 14 inches at bedrock locations like the Battery, and 15 inches along the New Jersey coastal plain, where the sediments are compressing. By 2100, they calculate, a global ocean rise of 28 inches would produce increases of 36 inches at the Battery and 39 inches on the coastal plain.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Call for a \u2018Year of Action\u2019", "Date": "2014-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetters To the Editor:\u201cYes I can, because they won\u2019t\u201d is what happens when reality meets soaring expectation. Gone is the vision of a new world in which great change is inevitable. What remains is much smaller, more manageable. In his sixth year on the job, President Obama has been forced to abandon even the pretense of hope for a united state of American politics.This has become a place where executive order substitutes for congressional action. Where cheerleading for states to move, without federal mandate, from the ludicrously inadequate minimum wage to a living wage becomes the new cry. Where exhortations for enacting big, sweeping legislation on issues like gun control now merit merely a passing comment. Where almost nothing feels probable and very little feels possible from those sitting in the chamber where the president was speaking.In this environment, it is really quite remarkable that anything at all has been accomplished. The president began his address with an overview of the progress that has been made in recent times. Despite the worst of intentions by the Republican Party, in some areas things are indeed better. But this has come despite the intransigence of those whose mission has been to make the president ineffective and inconsequential.And so, Mr. Obama does what he can with the cards he has been dealt. Little things around the edges. It is a long way from that night in Chicago when everything seemed possible.To the Editor:What President Obama has managed to accomplish in his years in office is extraordinary, given the opposition he faces. Against the forces of Koch money and Citizens United, deeply rooted racism, a G.O.P. that is committed to obstructing his agenda at all costs, climate change deniers, \u201cbirthers\u201d and worse, he has doggedly pursued his progressive agenda.The results are manifest. The work that remains to be done is daunting. His resolve to keep at it is inspiring.I am so tired of my liberal brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 complaints. Do you think you could have accomplished more? Read the comments all over the Internet and feel the pulse of hatred that comes through. Much of America despises this man, and yet he continues to fight for all of us.It is deeply saddening to hear our president declare war against Congress. It is a last-resort strategy, and I for one understand why he waited as long as he did. As a constitutional scholar, he knows that if he pushes our system of checks and balances too far, it will break.To the Editor:If raising the minimum wage for America\u2019s lowest-paid workers is worth fighting for, President Obama should fight for it. By signing an executive order (that applies only to federal contractors), he will fuel the fire of his opponents who charge that he puts himself above the law and is dismissive of the democratic process.Put those who oppose a living wage on the record. Yes, it will take some effort, but the president should make a credible argument about why this is good for America. As a lawyer, Mr. Obama should recognize the power of trial by jury. Here, he wants to be the trial judge and make the decision all by himself, dismissing the power given to America\u2019s political representatives. That is a passive-aggressive maneuver. Fight, sir, for what you believe in.Mr. Obama\u2019s method just guarantees another round of Fox News talking-head rants and a back-and-forth with his opponents \u2014 in other words, more of the same. It all gets very tiring, no matter how noble the cause.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Basketball Player\u2019s Guide to the (European) Galaxy", "Date": "2014-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALICANTE, Spain \u2014 You are a star high school basketball player, a whirlwind on the court. You score points, get rebounds and cover the ball on the defensive end. You get a scholarship and enjoy college. The N.B.A. draft is approaching and you can\u2019t wait to cash in.But then something happens: The projections come out and you\u2019re slipping; it\u2019s clear you need another option.One of your friends mentions Europe. Of course, you think. That is where good players go to get paid, make some noise and catch on in the N.B.A. afterward. Your agent makes a deal with a team whose name you can\u2019t pronounce. You get your passport. You pack your bags. You figure you\u2019ll be back in a year. Maybe two.\u201cAnd then, that part right there, is where it usually falls apart,\u201d Darryl Middleton said, laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s where the story changes for most guys.\u201dMiddleton knows. He is 47 and by all accounts one of the most famous American players in European basketball history. He was a star at Baylor who was drafted in the third round by the Atlanta Hawks in 1988 but couldn\u2019t make a loaded roster. So that fall he went to Europe and, for the most part, didn\u2019t come back.Sitting in his apartment with the Mediterranean not far away, he roared, loud and long, when asked what advice he would give to a young player considering a move to European basketball. \u201cTry playing baseball?\u201d he said, grinning. Then, turning serious, he made a list.Don\u2019t be afraid of the Uzis. During the summer of 1988, Middleton played in the United States Basketball League hoping to get noticed. His agent had told him he was unlikely to make the Hawks, so Middleton played in front of sparse crowds in tiny gyms and waited for something to happen.One night after a game, he was approached by a coach. Middleton and his older brother, Saint-Julien, were excited but quickly became confused when the coach asked Middleton if he might be interested in Turkey.\u201cI was like, Is this guy talking about turkey sandwiches?\u201d Middleton said.After some explanation \u2014 and an extended conversation with his agent \u2014 Middleton headed overseas for the first time to play for Cukurova Sanayi, in southern Turkey.He shook his head, adding: \u201cThink about it: I grew up in Queens. I\u2019d seen guns. But not a bunch of dudes holding Uzis while you just, like, get your suitcase. That\u2019s when I knew this was going to be different.\u201d Never inbound the ball. Middleton is 6 feet 8 inches and plays power forward, so he was charged with taking the ball out of bounds. In the United States, this is rarely a problem.In Europe, though, Middleton quickly learned that inbounding was an occupational hazard.He made a face. \u201cIt happened to me early on. I took the ball out after a foul and I felt it on the back of my neck \u2014 someone had spit on me from behind,\u201d he said. \u201cIn America, that\u2019s it \u2014 you\u2019re out of there. In Europe, they don\u2019t care. Everyone does it. I turned around and looked and it was a grandma who\u2019d spit on me. She was like 80 years old. It was ridiculous. From that day forward, I made sure I never took the ball out again.\u201dMiddleton was named the Turkish league\u2019s most valuable player in his first season. He then returned to the United States and played in the N.B.A.\u2019s summer league, figuring he would catch on somewhere. When he didn\u2019t, he returned to Europe \u2014 this time to Milan.Naming all his teams is difficult. Middleton began counting on his fingers (and borrowed a friend\u2019s hands) as he tried to recall. After a few minutes, he rattled off a list and seemed satisfied he had remembered every one. But then, in his car about an hour later, he saw a sign for Valencia, about 160 kilometers away. ... but embrace Europe. Because he has lived in Europe longer than he lived in the United States, Middleton does not hesitate to describe himself as European. Even for shorter-stay players, though, Middleton says it is easier to embrace cultural differences than to fight them. That is why Middleton takes siestas. He refers to his former country of residence as \u201cthe States,\u201d uses Skype constantly and scoffs at tipping 20 percent in restaurants. He does not eat hot dogs. He gives distances in kilometers.Most of the time, Middleton says, he does not miss living in the United States. But there are moments when he realizes how removed he is from the world he left behind. He did not learn right away of the Sept. 11 attacks or that Barack Obama had been elected America\u2019s first black president. And when the holidays come around each year, he is reminded of nieces and nephews whom he has never met.And Europe is not perfect. After a few years of trying to fold his oversize frame into Citro\u00ebns or Renaults, Middleton gave up and paid \u201ca small fortune,\u201d he said, to ship over his old SUV and make the necessary modifications to get it registered.It makes for a bizarre sight. On the street outside Middleton\u2019s apartment, there is a row of tiny hatchbacks, slanted wagons and narrow sports cars. Then there is a black 1999 Lincoln Navigator.\u201cI can\u2019t mess with these minis,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cThis was the best money I ever spent.\u201d Don\u2019t be a dumb American. In 2005, Middleton moved to Russia to play for Dynamo St. Petersburg. In general, the players were treated well; Middleton even had a driver who took him to practices and handled the seemingly requisite daily bribery of the local police to keep from getting traffic tickets.Not everyone was so warm, though. When Middleton was looking for an apartment, the real estate agent recommended by the team was \u201ca total salesman,\u201d Middleton said. At one point, the agent took Middleton to a somewhat isolated apartment. Middleton looked around curiously as the agent raved about its amazing lake views.Middleton played with Panathinaikos, a top Greek team, from 2000 to 2005, winning four Greek league titles, two Greek Cup trophies and one Euroleague championship. But the most unforgettable moment came during a bus ride through Athens to a game against the team\u2019s bitter rival, Olympiacos.Middleton was relaxing when he was jolted by the sound of glass shattering. He looked up and the windows all around him were shattering. Fans of Olympiacos \u2014 undeterred, apparently, by the police escort leading the Panathinaikos bus \u2014 were hurling large rocks.\u201cThere was blood everywhere, all over the seats and the floor,\u201d Middleton said, adding that a half-dozen of his teammates ended up in the hospital. \u201cIt was crazy \u2014 fans threw coins and things at us during games, but I\u2019d never seen boulders coming through the windows of a bus.\u201dBus attacks, Middleton went on, are not uncommon before games between rivals. Given that, he adopted a new policy: Never, ever sit by the window. Work hard and play hard. America and the N.B.A., Middleton counsels, are a long way away.Instead of holding training camps at well-appointed practice centers, some teams go to remote locations for boot camps. Instead of traveling on chartered jets, many teams take bus rides that can stretch as long as 15 hours. And instead of everyone making a minimum of about $500,000, Middleton said, some players make as little as $3,000 a month. The most he ever made in a season, he said, was about $750,000.\u201cOne of the lower-league teams in Spain that I played on, we had to bring our own water to practice,\u201d he said.Middleton said American players needed to prepare for harder practices than they are used to (\u201cThey don\u2019t do light practices here; a lot of teams go two-a-day even during the season\u201d) as well as games that can be downright dirty.\u201cAt first, I didn\u2019t know how to handle it, but I got some advice,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a guy is grabbing your jersey all the time? Punch him in the mouth. It\u2019s all good. Once I played against a guy who was flopping all the time, so when he tried it near halfcourt I just ran by him and kneed him in the face. He didn\u2019t flop after that.\u201d Have a plan. While playing for Barcelona in the mid-1990s, Middleton began taking cooking classes as a way to meet people and pass the time during the off-season. He said he had always enjoyed cooking and began doing more of it, including making an American-style Thanksgiving dinner for his teammates each year.Then, about two years ago, he jumped into the kitchen at a restaurant for the first time after trying \u2014 and gagging on \u2014 the \u201cNew Orleans-style\u201d food that a na\u00efve owner had attempted. Middleton befriended the owner and offered to help revamp the place during the summer.That experience crystallized a reality for Middleton: He was approaching 50 and needed to do something else. So, after meeting Inigo Gartzia, a top chef, while playing in Alicante, he and Gartzia decided to go into business together and renovate a restaurant near the port here.The restaurant, Gastrokomia, reopened late last year, and Middleton cooks there most nights. His oversize hands (good for rebounding; not so good, he says, for making cannelloni) move deftly around saucepans and spices, and he acknowledged that after more than two decades of international basketball, he may have finally found his exit.\u201cCooking relaxes me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in Europe or the States \u2014 you can\u2019t play forever. No one can. Not even me.\u201dAn article on Monday about Darryl Middleton\u2019s long career in European professional basketball leagues misstated the season Dominique Wilkins played for Panathinaikos in Greece. It was 1995-96, not 1996-97.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Welcomes Start of Nuclear Deal", "Date": "2014-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 Iranian officials said they expected positive economic changes with the lifting of some sanctions against the country as part of a deal struck with world powers, which begins on Monday.The interim deal, signed in November in Geneva and completed last week, will temporarily freeze much of Tehran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for limited relief from the Western economic sanctions. The deal will last for six months, giving Iran and six countries involved \u2014 Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States \u2014 time to negotiate a permanent deal.Nuclear inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations\u2019 watchdog group, who will monitor the Iranian elements of the agreement, arrived in Tehran over the weekend, local news media reported.\u201cThrough these talks in Geneva, we are heading in a direction in which not only the sanctions are being lifted, but also Iran\u2019s political isolation is coming to an end,\u201d Mohammad Sadr, an adviser to Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, told the Iranian Student News Agency on Sunday.\u201cIt will take time, but these two fundamental problems will be solved,\u201d he said.If Iran starts diluting parts of its stockpile of uranium that has been enriched up to 20 percent, which is close to weapons-grade material, it will be rewarded with the release of some of its funds that have been frozen abroad, up to $4.2 billion.Describing Iran\u2019s economy as having its arms and legs tied to \u201cthe ropes of the sanctions,\u201d President Hassan Rouhani said last week that he expected the economy to improve under the deal.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.\u201cOne of these ropes will be cut,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said, according to state television. \u201cOver all, in my opinion, we will witness a positive, acceptable and outstanding change in the country\u2019s economic sector in the next six months.\u201dMr. Rouhani is scheduled to address the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, and he is expected to highlight the opportunities the Iranian market has to offer.Austrian Airlines announced last week that it was resuming flights to Iran after a one-year break forced by the sanctions, and several European political and trade delegations have visited the country in recent weeks.Inside Iran, some hard-liners are complaining that the government is trying to silence critics of the deal, which some here say was a loss for the Iranians, who refused any compromise with the West for more than a decade.\u201cCriticizing the Geneva agreement is like denying the Holocaust,\u201d said Hamid Rasaei, a hard-line member of Parliament, according to the semiofficial Fars news agency. His newspaper and another weekly were closed after they spoke out against the agreement, said Mr. Rasaei, a Shiite Muslim cleric. \u201cAnybody who dares to speak out against parts of the agreement will be confronted,\u201d he said.Mr. Rouhani, in a speech broadcast nationally on Thursday, warned that some people in the country did not want the sanctions to be lifted, accusing them of benefiting politically and economically from the measures.\u201cI have a lot to say, but today is not the right time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a group of people are against the establishment of normal conditions in the country because of their own interests and that of their group.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "2004, the Year That Changed How We Dine", "Date": "2013-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOh, and Danny Meyer, the restaurateur behind Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe, made the crazy decision to open a burger stand. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that all those restaurants came out of 2004,\u201d Mr. Leventhal said. \u201cThat\u2019s fascinating. It\u2019s a serious list.\u201dIndeed. But why did it happen? The way some observers see it, 2004 was the year in which New York\u2019s economy (and spirit) started to bloom again after a stock-market meltdown in 2000 and the terrorist attack in 2001. \u201cIt did feel exciting, and it partly felt exciting in contrast to the slowness and the quietude of the years that preceded it,\u201d said Dana Cowin, the editor in chief of Food & Wine magazine. \u201cRestaurants were trying to figure out what direction to take, and it was so extraordinary when 2004 came, and it turned out that it wasn\u2019t one direction, but it was five different directions.\u201d Those directions may have been disparate \u2014\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s the seminal gastropub, it\u2019s the seminal farm-to-table, it\u2019s the seminal sushi restaurant,\u201d as Ms. Cowin put it. But, she said, \u201cmost of the places that we\u2019re talking about are unified by an appreciation of really extraordinary ingredients.\u201d That philosophy applied to a tasting menu at Per Se or Blue Hill at Stone Barns as much as it did to what was scattered atop a pizza at Franny\u2019s or a bowl of ramen at Momofuku Noodle Bar. Mr. Leventhal agreed that a sense of financial and cultural uplift fostered the feeling that it was time to cut loose and try something new. \u201cI think restaurants felt comfortable enough with the economy that they could take some risks and have some fun,\u201d he said. Which meant that deftly executed cooking might manifest itself in places that previously would have been dismissed as dives. \u201cI think that Freemans and Spotted Pig and Noodle Bar really, to me, speak to a driving interest in doing something different, something refreshing and something that\u2019s sort of invigorating,\u201d he said. \u201cFreemans \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s a restaurant down an alley with a bunch of taxidermy on the wall, a restaurant that\u2019s essentially like a ski lodge down an alley on the Lower East Side. That\u2019s kind of radical.\u201d Suddenly a luxurious feast might involve sitting on a wobbly stool listening to indie rock at a pub, like the Spotted Pig. \u201cThere was so much energy that got pumped into the way we go out and the way we want to go out,\u201d Ms. Cowin recalled. If there was a movement taking shape, its key players admit they didn\u2019t notice until after the fact. And many of them spent the year struggling. Mr. Chang was desperate for customers in the early days at Noodle Bar, and kicking himself for having failed to apply for a kitchen job at Per Se or Masa. \u201cI remember thinking very clearly, \u2018What am I doing?\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201c\u00a0\u2018This is stupid. I should be working at Masa!\u2019\u00a0\u201dIn some cases, 2004 was an outright fight. At the Spotted Pig, Mr. Friedman and Ms. Bloomfield, who had arrived from England, envisioned the vibrant bo\u00eete as \u201ca really cool bar that happened to have food as good as any restaurant in town,\u201d Mr. Friedman said. \u201cWho made the rule that you can\u2019t have a real chef instead of someone who defrosts the frozen French fries?\u201dBut in his mind, \u201ccool bar\u201d signified \u201cno reservations,\u201d and that policy raised a few hackles as buzz began to build and some customers bristled at waiting hours for a table. \u201cThey were like: \u2018What do you mean you don\u2019t take reservations? Don\u2019t you know who I am? I\u2019m a real foodie, I\u2019ve been to the French Laundry, I get into everyplace,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Friedman said. \u201cI would get into fistfights almost every night. I would kick people out and tear up their checks. April would be like: \u2018Why\u2019d you tear their check up? At least make them pay.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Even when it looks brilliant in retrospect, change is rarely easy. Back then, Mr. Barber was wondering whether hungry pilgrims were really going to make the trek up to Westchester County, while Thomas Keller remembers the twinges of angst and doubt he felt after Per Se had to be shut, one week after it had opened in the Time Warner Center, because of a fire. \u201cI was just ready to quit,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m going back to California.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIn the end, the setback was a blessing in disguise, because it gave the Per Se team time to fine-tune a wide range of details. \u201cIt allowed us to really finish the restaurant,\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cYou\u2019re in New York City, and you think you want to give up, and then you realize that there\u2019s just no giving up.\u201dNew York without Per Se? Without the Spotted Pig, Spice Market or Shake Shack? Without Freemans, Frankies, Franny\u2019s and the rest of the class of 2004? Frankly, it would be a lot less fun \u2014 and a lot less delicious. \u201cIt was a very fine year,\u201d Ms. Cowin said. \u201cIt really was.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fog-Wreathed Paradise, Built by a Billionaire Under a Cloud", "Date": "2014-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJiuzhaigou JournalJIUZHAIGOU, China \u2014 Inside the hotel\u2019s front entrance, a white mechanical yak nods and says \u201cMoo.\u201d Beyond it is the centerpiece of the compound: a vast glass atrium with a replica of a Tibetan and ethnic Qiang village filled with three-story stone and wood buildings, each housing a restaurant or bar. Corn husks sit atop the roofs.For visitors, this is the first sight of paradise, or more precisely Jiuzhai Paradise. One of the biggest hotels in China when measured by number of rooms \u2014 1,010 of them spread across seven buildings \u2014 it is part of a mountain resort nestled in a fog-wreathed forest in a Tibetan area of western China. What draws tourists is its proximity to the Jiuzhaigou Nature Reserve, the most famous park in the country, a wonderland laced with emerald lakes that is China\u2019s equivalent of Yellowstone or Yosemite.That this kind of hotel could be built on such pristine land is a testament to the political connections of its founder, Deng Hong, a billionaire and one of the most famous businessmen in Sichuan Province.On Nov. 8, Xinhua, the state news agency, posted on its website an article from Beijing News that said Mr. Deng had been formally arrested. Police officers in the city of Xianning, where Beijing News said Mr. Deng was being detained, declined to comment, as did representatives of Mr. Deng\u2019s company.Mr. Deng, 50, the son of an air force officer, made his fortune in the hotel and exhibition center business. He was listed by the 2013 Hurun Rich List as the 290th richest person in China, with a net worth of about $1 billion.\u201cI think the whole hotel represents his vision,\u201d said Tyson Wang, the general manager, who works for InterContinental Hotels Group, a British company. It has been contracted to manage 13 properties developed by Mr. Deng\u2019s company, including resorts in the Maldives and Micronesia and a 2,000-room hotel in Lhasa, Tibet. Mr. Deng envisioned Jiuzhai Paradise as what the Chinese call a \u201clost city in the mountains,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cFrom a distance, you see nothing. All of a sudden, there\u2019s a giant five-star.\u201dBut Mr. Deng has not been to the resort in about a year, Mr. Wang said, and the Beijing News article said his last public appearance was in Chengdu in February last year. The corruption investigation in Sichuan appears to run parallel with an even more delicate one that is scrutinizing former executives at state oil companies and the family of Zhou Yongkang, a former Sichuan party chief who retired in 2012 after years overseeing China\u2019s state security apparatus and legal system while on the elite Politburo Standing Committee.It is unclear exactly how Mr. Deng fits into that puzzle, though party investigators often use bribery confessions by businesspeople to build a case against officials. The company founded by Mr. Deng, Exhibition and Tourism Group, or ETG, based in Chengdu, declined to comment. Asked about Mr. Deng\u2019s detention, Mr. Wang said, \u201cWe can\u2019t talk about that.\u201dMr. Wang is a polished, English-speaking hotel manager who understands the vagaries of the justice system \u2014 he was a police bodyguard in Harbin before being assigned in 1994 to a joint hotel venture between the police department there and Holiday Inn. Later, Holiday Inn hired him away.Jiuzhai Paradise opened in 2003 under the management of ETG. In 2007, the company signed InterContinental as the manager, the first of their 13 ventures together.Paradise is what the hotel aims to sell. It can arrange horseback rides with Tibetan nomads, rafting in Goddess Lake and tickets to a dance show that features 150 ethnic Tibetan and Qiang performers. Attendants in the lobby are mostly Han, the dominant ethnic group in China, dressed in traditional Tibetan robes.Standard rooms at the hotel go for about $305 a night, excluding taxes. In 2012, the hotel had revenue of nearly $50 million, Mr. Wang said.The design of the rooms is a cross between a Tibetan home and a British pub. The rooms sell out during national holidays.\u201cI\u2019ve turned my phone off so officials can\u2019t call asking for a room,\u201d Mr. Wang said during a holiday weekend last fall. \u201cWe\u2019re totally full.\u201dHotel guests visit the nearby Jiuzhaigou or Huanglong nature reserves and sit in the replica Tibetan and Qiang village around boiling hot pots of food. At the door of the Sichuan restaurant, lamb turns on a spit. Next to the Tibetan restaurant in the rear courtyard rises an 11-story stone edifice resembling a traditional Qiang village tower.Some guests indulge in Tianyu Spa, which is 11,960 square yards and includes both a swimming pool and an indoor hot spring.One Tibetan man in the area said the hotel had helped the local economy, even if the Tibetan employees mostly held menial jobs. (Mr. Wang said 10 percent of the 1,350 employees were from the area.) The Tibetan man did complain, though, that the hotel was a \u201cHanification\u201d of the area\u2019s Tibetan culture.One morning, a tourist from Jiangsu Province, Ma Minjun, 63, took photographs of the village as he and his wife walked through the central atrium. \u201cI think this hotel is very beautiful; you don\u2019t find others like this,\u201d he said. Mr. Deng began his entrepreneurial ventures selling clothes in Chengdu while practicing his art, Mr. Wang said. After living in the United States for a spell, he returned to China with enough capital to put together land development deals, a common route to vast fortunes in this country.But that route also raises questions about corrupt relationships with local governments, because developers often rely on officials to grant them the land.

{"Headline": "Buffing a Battered City\u2019s Image", "Date": "2014-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 Ever since Detroit filed for bankruptcy six months ago, political and business leaders here have insisted that the city\u2019s long-awaited comeback has already begun.This week is their chance to prove it, as thousands of automotive executives, suppliers and members of the news media descend on downtown for the annual North American International Auto Show.The auto show has historically been a financial boon to the city, and this year is no exception. Organizers estimate that it will contribute $365 million to the local economy in wages and other spending.\u201cMy hope is that the show will give visitors an understanding of the real changes happening in the city, and that they\u2019re not just cosmetic,\u201d said Arthur C. Liebler, a former marketing executive with Chrysler and Ford.While Detroit\u2019s neighborhoods are deeply troubled by crime, abandonment and substandard city services, its downtown is benefiting from a wave of investment and corporate expansion. As recently as 2006, work crews prepped the city to host the Super Bowl by painting over graffiti and putting pictures of flower pots and curtains on the windows of empty buildings.Now dozens of structures are in various stages of rehabilitation, and companies like the mortgage firm Quicken Loans have filled up much of the vacant office space. Streets that were once desolate are slowly coming to life as young professionals move into restored lofts and apartments.Detroit still faces huge challenges as it grapples with an estimated $18 billion in debt in United States Bankruptcy Court and tries to upgrade basic services like police protection, street lighting and garbage removal. But the glamour and glitz of the auto show are a welcome relief from negative news, and an opportunity for Detroit to put on its best face for industry executives and other attendees from around the world.\u201cIt is very important for the auto show to go off without a hitch,\u201d said Jeffrey Stoltman, a business professor at Wayne State University, in Detroit. \u201cThis is a compelling story that the whole world is following.\u201dThis year\u2019s show has attracted 17 major auto companies, headlined by the hometown carmakers General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. More than 50 new vehicles will be unveiled at news conferences this week before the show opens to the public on Saturday.For the manufacturers, the Detroit show is a bellwether of an industry that has come back strong after bottoming out during the recession. Automakers sold 15.6 million vehicles in the United States last year, a 7.6 percent increase from the previous year and the industry\u2019s best overall performance since 2007.And as the only car company with headquarters in the city, G.M. is emphasizing its Detroit roots during the auto show. The company chose to reveal a new version of its GMC Canyon pickup on Sunday night at the Russell Industrial Center, a hulking former auto plant north of downtown that has been converted into studio space for artists.\u201cIt is rustic, but it\u2019s symbolic of the revitalization of Detroit,\u201d said David Barnas, a G.M. spokesman. \u201cIt is important for us to have showcase events in locations like this.\u201dThe excitement surrounding the show has, however, been tempered by the harsh reality of Detroit\u2019s financial collapse.After the city filed for Chapter 9 in July, some auto executives in Europe raised concerns to the show\u2019s organizers, the Detroit Auto Dealers Association, about public safety in the city.\u201cThere were a few comments about whether we\u2019d even be having the show this year,\u201d said Joe Rohatynski, a spokesman for the dealer group. \u201cWe had to come up with a statement that this show is not going anywhere.\u201dDetroit\u2019s municipal problems have hurt the show in the past. In 1999, city snowplows struggled to clear streets leading to Cobo Center after a blizzard dumped a foot of snow on the region. And five years ago, the future of the show\u2019s downtown location was in jeopardy when Cobo\u2019s roof leaked during a custom-car exhibition.After that low point, the city transferred ownership of Cobo to a new regional convention authority. Since then, a $279 million renovation program transformed the run-down building into a modern facility with new banquet halls, meeting rooms and a Detroit-themed food court.The chief executive of the convention authority, Patrick Bero, said the makeover was critical to keeping the auto show downtown, as well as attracting other conventions in the future.Mr. Bero acknowledged that the convention center, like so much of the city, had been badly neglected for years. \u201cWhat was missing before was a feeling that results matter,\u201d he said. \u201cToo often, that\u2019s where we fell short in the past.\u201dLast week, Detroit\u2019s new mayor, Michael Duggan, toured the auto-show floor as workers hustled to finish the elaborate stages and exhibits for the new cars.Mr. Duggan said that the auto show had the potential to send a powerful message to out-of-town visitors and suburbanites that Detroit could thrive again.\u201cCobo has never looked better, and I don\u2019t think the auto show has ever looked better,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping people will come down and check it out.\u201dThe larger question is whether the show will be simply a brief respite from the pain of bankruptcy, or a milestone in Detroit\u2019s turnaround.Mr. Liebler, for one, says he is convinced the building blocks are in place.After retiring from Chrysler, he bought the iconic Whitney restaurant on Woodward Avenue, one of the city\u2019s main thoroughfares. For several years, the business struggled. But the fledgling recovery downtown has brought in new customers \u2014 and a measure of hope for Detroit.\u201cOnce the bankruptcy issues are resolved, I truly believe there will be no stopping us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd after 45 years living in this town and watching it spiral downward, I\u2019m more than ready for the change.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Spain, a Home for Relaxation", "Date": "2014-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEL PORT DE LA SELVA, Spain \u2014 Melinda Taylor and Geoff Roberts, both international criminal defense lawyers, have worked in some far-flung locations, like Cambodia, Kosovo, Libya and Lebanon.But for relaxation the couple prefer this peaceful spot along the Costa Brava, where they recently built a vacation home near the Cap de Creus nature reserve.The four-bedroom house, created from 10 cubes covered in white stucco, looks like something that Picasso might have dreamed up. \u201cThe cubes make the house striking but also functional by separating off the different bedrooms and providing privacy with separate views and little terraces,\u201d said Mr. Roberts, 35.But the architects, Eduardo Cadaval and Clara Sol\u00e0-Morales, also tried to maximize the views of the Mediterranean and to ensure that the house could withstand the area\u2019s notoriously harsh winds.\u201cWe had to be really careful and use reinforced glass,\u201d Mr. Cadaval said. He and Ms. Sol\u00e0-Morales are partners in the Cadaval & Sol\u00e0-Morales architectural firm, based in Barcelona, Spain, and Mexico City.The house was initially inspired by a desire for sunshine.Mr. Roberts said the couple began thinking about a vacation home in a warm climate when they visited the Greek island of Santorini in 2004. They had the idea of opening a bar where guests could watch the sunset while sipping cocktails, and actually called a seller\u2019s telephone number scribbled on a brick wall.\u201cThankfully, no one answered,\u201d he said.Ms. Taylor really started looking in March 2010, while she was working in The Hague and Mr. Roberts was in Lebanon.\u201cMel found the land when I was on a mission in Beirut,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was jealous of me being in a warm country, so passed the time by doing random Google searches of seafront land.\u201d But for Ms. Taylor, 37, a home in the sunshine was more than just a whim. She had grown up in sunny Brisbane, Australia, and she wanted her children to enjoy the same kind of relaxed seaside environment that she had experienced. (Mr. Roberts is from Hartley Wintney, a village in the English county of Hampshire, south of Reading.)The family is based in The Hague, where the couple both work at the International Criminal Court. Ms. Taylor is in the Office of Public Counsel for the Defense, while Mr. Roberts is on one of the defense teams at the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. The tribunal, which opened in 2009, is handling trials for people accused in the 2005 attack that killed Rafik Hariri, Lebanon\u2019s former prime minister, and others.They have two children, 4-year-old Yasmina and 8-month-old Tareq, and two dogs, Anya, a 6-year-old mix from Cambodia, and Finch, a 4-year-old cocker spaniel that more or less came with the job.\u201cAnya was given to me in a bar in Phnom Penh, Cambodia,\u201d said Mr. Roberts, who worked on the Khmer Rouge tribunal in 2008. The animals looked perfectly at home in Spain in August, when the final touches were being completed on the two-level house, which has about 200 square meters, or 2,153 square feet, of living space, and a 100-square-meter terrace with an infinity pool.Ms. Taylor\u2019s search for land turned up a 500-square-meter plot. \u201cWe found it online and went to visit it a couple of weeks later,\u201d Mr. Roberts recalled. \u201cWe loved the land but weren\u2019t sure we could afford it. We carried on looking and found it advertised through a different agent for less and bought it through them.\u201d The land, purchased in August 2010, cost 260,000 euros, or about $355,000. But with the Spanish economy in crisis, finding a mortgage was difficult. \u201cIt was complicated, as we are a British and Australian couple and we live and work in The Netherlands,\u201d Mr. Roberts said. After contacting about 15 banks, they had success with the help of a bank manager in the nearby town of Roses.Construction, which ended up costing around \u20ac580,000, began in May 2012. The heart of the four-bedroom, three-bath home is the living room, with its panoramic sea views. It was designed with a large window on the upper half of the rear wall, which fills the space with sunlight, and a high ceiling. The ground level also has a dining room and a kitchen, while the bedrooms are upstairs.\u201cThe house is the most relaxing place we have ever stayed,\u201d Mr. Roberts said. \u201cWith the large floor-to-ceiling windows in every direction looking directly out to the sea, you almost feel you are in a boat.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time Warner Is Planning a Move to Hudson Yards", "Date": "2014-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTime Warner Inc. announced on Thursday that it plans to move its headquarters from Columbus Circle to a new, 80-story skyscraper on the Far West Side of Manhattan, ensuring the development of a vast neighborhood made up of office towers, residential buildings, a shopping mall and a park, all built over a 13-acre railyard.At the same time, Time Warner announced it was selling its existing headquarters, about 1.1 million square feet, in what is known as the Time Warner Center, for $1.3 billion to a partnership of two sovereign wealth funds and the Related Companies.Time Warner would take about 5,000 employees to a once industrial neighborhood on the West Side, immediately establishing a new business and residential district, much the way it did when the media company moved to Columbus Circle a decade ago. Time Warner anticipates that in late 2018 it will consolidate its executive offices and its HBO, Turner Broadcasting and Warner Bros. divisions in the base of a newly opened, 1,227-foot-tall tower at the southwest corner of 10th Avenue and 33rd Street.Until then, the company will remain at Time Warner Center, a two-towered complex built by the Related Companies, the same developer behind the Hudson Yards project.\u201cThe sale of our office space in Time Warner Center to Related Companies and its partners,\u201d Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chairman of Time Warner, said, \u201cis an important step toward moving our New York City-based employees into a dynamic new complex that will foster even more collaboration, creativity and efficiency across our businesses.\u201dTime Warner\u2019s decision to move to a new home is something of a vindication for Stephen M. Ross, the chairman of the Related Companies, and his partner, who have made an enormous real estate bet on the West Side, where brick warehouses, factories, shops and tenements once sat near the Hudson River docks.\u201cThe world\u2019s changing; New York\u2019s changing,\u201d Mr. Ross said on Thursday evening. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stay ahead of the curve. I really believe it\u2019s going to be the new heart of the city. Time Warner made a smart move, capturing the value at Columbus Circle and embracing the new technology and efficiency at Hudson Yards.\u201dIn 2008, just before the economy collapsed, Related signed a $1 billion deal to buy the development rights over the railyards that stretch from 30th to 33rd Street, between 10th and 12th Avenues.One of former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s signature initiatives was rezoning the neighborhood for high-rise development, which he said was needed for the city to grow and prosper. The $15 billion proposal by Related, and its partner, Oxford Properties, for the railyards constituted one of the largest private real estate projects in the country.Related has continued to buy land in the neighborhood, beyond the railyards. It is completing a 32-story, 390-unit apartment tower at the southwest corner of 30th Street and 10th Avenue and has assembled at least five other major development sites nearby.\u201cRelated believes that the future of New York is on the West Side,\u201d said Elliott Sclar, a professor of urban planning and economics at Columbia University. \u201cAnd there\u2019s an enormous number of foreign investors pouring money into New York real estate, expecting a safe return. I just wonder how far ahead of demand are they running?\u201d Mr. Ross believes that the Time Warner Center \u2014 a 2.8-million-square-foot complex that includes office space, condominiums, a Mandarin Oriental hotel, upscale shopping, a floor of expensive restaurants and Jazz at Lincoln Center \u2014 transformed Columbus Circle, the once dowdy traffic circle at the southwest corner of Central Park, into a luxury commercial and residential neighborhood. As developers moved into the neighborhood, profiting from the changes that Related wrought with the center, Mr. Ross regretted not buying other parcels in the area.\u201cWe built Time Warner Center and didn\u2019t invest in the neighborhood,\u201d a Related executive said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to make the same mistake at Hudson Yards.\u201dBut it has not been easy to lure prime office tenants to the West Side in a market in which corporations are increasingly cost-conscious and risk-averse. Hudson Yards is also competing for office tenants with new skyscrapers in Lower Manhattan.The eastern railyard project requires the construction of a $750 million platform over the railyards on which most of the new buildings would sit. The western yard, between 11th and 12th Avenues, is mostly residential and will start in the coming years.Mr. Ross and Related adopted a strategy to lease or sell the office space at cost, figuring the profits would come from the residential component and one million square feet of retail shops and restaurants.In the spring, Related finally signed a deal with Coach, the luxury retailer, to be the anchor tenant for the first office tower, a 52-story building at the northwest corner of 30th Street and 10th Avenue. L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA, the beauty products company, and SAP, a software company, have since joined Coach in the building now under construction.Under the deal with Time Warner, the media company would be the anchor for a second, even larger tower. After the final contracts are signed, it will own almost 40 percent of the 2.6 million-square-foot tower.Related said it expected to begin construction of the platform for the eastern yard in the coming weeks, opening the way for the second office tower, the shopping mall, two residential buildings, a park and a cultural center.Time Warner used Eastdil Secured, a real estate company, to sell the building and hired Studley, a broker, to represent the company in the negotiations for the new space. Related\u2019s partners in buying the Time Warner space at Columbus Circle are the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation.Mr. Bewkes is hoping to bring the company\u2019s far-flung New York operations under one roof. It will be a slimmer version of the once giant media company, having spun off Warner Music, AOL and Time Warner Cable. The company is in the process of doing the same with Time Inc. and its roster of magazines, including Sports Illustrated, People and Time.An article on Friday about plans by Time Warner Inc. to move its headquarters to the Far West Side misstated, in some editions, the middle initial of the chairman of the Related Companies, which developed the sites of both the old and new headquarters of Time Warner. He is Stephen M. Ross, not Stephen J. The article also misstated, in some editions, the number of stories of an office tower on the Far West Side where Related signed a deal with Coach to be the anchor tenant. It will have 52 stories, not 47.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s New Obsession: French Wine", "Date": "2014-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionBORDEAUX, France \u2014 WHEN the Bordeaux International Wine Institute, which offers business management training in the oenological arts, opened its doors in 2004, it had 20 students, mostly from domestic French wineries. Today it has 105. What is most striking about this year\u2019s class isn\u2019t its size, but its composition. Though students come from places as diverse as India and Turkey, one group of foreigners stands out: Chinese students make up almost 30 percent, the largest group by nationality behind the French. Their American classmates comprise less than 4 percent.Meanwhile, the Burgundy Business School in Dijon has also recorded a rise in Chinese students in its wine management programs. Between 2009 and 2012, Chinese students made up barely 10 percent of the graduate ranks; now, 33 of this year\u2019s 100 students hail from China.Wine has always been an essential part of the French tradition, both culturally and economically, but the world\u2019s growing middle class has made it a global one: worldwide wine consumption is expected to grow almost 9 percent, to $182 billion, by 2016, with a large chunk of the demand coming from China.Some in France, however, view this development with unease, which has at times exploded into violent xenophobia. In August a group of Frenchmen assaulted a group of Chinese oenology students at a wine school in nearby Sauternes, sending several to the hospital. Along with a general fear of change within the centuries-old wine world, there is concern that China, with its huge population and geography, could someday eclipse France\u2019s place in wine production. Some even fear that these students could mark the first stage of a Chinese takeover of the French wine industry, buying up vineyards in the same way the country bought up huge tracts of Africa. Such concerns are misplaced. Not only does the explosion in China\u2019s interest in wine bode well for the French economy, but the connections built between French vintners and their Chinese students will pay enormous cultural dividends for both countries.Most people are surprised to learn that China already has a strong winemaking tradition. Indeed, many of the students at the French schools are working at the graduate level, having already completed undergraduate courses in oenology back home. One student in Bordeaux, Zhang Xuan, began his wine studies in one of the new oenology programs at China\u2019s Northwest University of Agriculture and Forestry, in the central Chinese city of Yangling, and later interned with a Chinese winery before coming to France.Others grew up working on their family\u2019s vineyards, or selling wine at a family-owned shop. Whatever their background, most of them plan to return to China after their studies \u2014 and to take their new, French-inflected skills with them. Another Bordeaux student, Wu Zhaolong, discovered his passion for wine while working in the hotel and restaurant industry in Shanghai. He plans to go into restaurant management, integrating French food and wine styles with traditional Shanghainese dining.As they move on, they will take along a respect for French culture, which they will later share with their co-workers and customers, in much the same way that the French winemaking know-how imported to California in the 1950s and \u201960s helped initiate a new wave of interest in French cuisine and culture nationwide.At the same time, these students will build strong binational business relationships: Zhu Qiyao, who ran a wine sales company in Hangzhou before coming to Bordeaux, wants to perfect her wine-negotiation skills and expand her business network before returning to China. But the real benefit for France, and one that these students will help strengthen, is economic. French wine already accounts for 48 percent of Chinese wine imports, and Bordeaux\u2019s reds are a particular favorite of the Chinese elite. And the Chinese market can only grow. A report presented last summer at Bordeaux\u2019s enormous VinExpo predicted that Chinese wine consumption would grow 40 percent from 2012 to 2016. And Chinese drinkers don\u2019t want plonk: While China ranks only 20th in per capita wine consumption, it ranks fourth in terms of the value of the wine it consumes.A good bit of this demand will be met domestically, of course: China is already the fifth-largest wine-producing nation, and France\u2019s Center for Scientific Research recently predicted that it would double its production in five years. Some in France fear that China\u2019s growing love of wine will drive wealthy Chinese investors to gobble up French vineyards. Chinese have been snatching up Bordeaux chateaus at roughly one a month. Last year a Chinese industrialist raised alarms in Bordeaux after buying a top-class, or grand cru, wine producer, Ch\u00e2teau Bellefont-Belcier. But such concerns are overblown. With upward of 8,000 properties, there are still plenty of French-owned vineyards. And there has been plenty of investment in the other direction. In the last few years, many renowned French wine companies have rushed to open joint-venture vineyards and wineries in China. In July, Mo\u00ebt Hennessy\u2019s Chandon subsidiary opened its Ningxia Winery in central China, which will be dedicated to producing sparkling wine. Not far away, Pernod Ricard, a renowned wine producer, recently took over another large winery, Helan Mountain.Globalization is reshaping every industry, even one as hidebound as French wine. But its partisans should be more optimistic. Far from destroying French wine traditions, forces of globalization, even one as large and powerful as China, can only help them.And in any case, at least some in Bordeaux are keeping their prejudices closer to home. As one leading vintner said wryly, \u201cI don\u2019t care who buys these chateaus, as long as they are not from Paris.\u201dAn M.B.A. candidate at the Bordeaux International Wine Institute.

{"Headline": "Eminent Domain: A Long Shot Against Blight", "Date": "2014-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou can\u2019t fight city hall, the saying goes. But Gayle McLaughlin, the mayor of Richmond, Calif., a city of 100,000 souls, would tell you that fighting Wall Street is harder. Even for city hall.Ms. McLaughlin has a plan to help the many Richmond residents who owe more money on their houses than their houses are worth, but it\u2019s one that banks like Wells Fargo, large asset managers like Pimco and BlackRock, real estate interests and even Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants, have tried to quash. Her idea involves a novel use of the power of eminent domain to bail out homeowners by buying up and then forgiving mortgage debt. But the financial institutions have warned that mortgage lending would halt in any city that tried eminent domain \u2014 and they have lobbied Congress to ensure that the threat is not an empty one. Opponents have filed federal lawsuits, while real estate interests have made robocalls to residents and sent mass mailers warning that the plan would allow \u201cslick, politically connected\u201d investors to \u201ctake houses on the cheap.\u201d (The idea is actually to buy mortgages, not houses.)Under similar pressures, at least four other cities that considered the eminent domain strategy have backed away, deeming the risks too great. But advocates in Richmond say their city is different. They hope a unique alignment of anti-corporate political leadership, a concerted grass-roots campaign and union support will lead to a different outcome in this working-class, largely black and Hispanic community in the Bay Area. For a dozen or so other cities that have similar demographics and are also plagued by foreclosures, Richmond has become a national test case. Those cities, scattered in states from New Jersey to Washington, have watched as the controversial proposal has threatened Richmond\u2019s access to capital: When the city tried to market a highly rated set of bonds in mid-August last year, there were no takers. In September, the Richmond City Council was preparing to take one of a series of votes on the eminent domain proposal. Before the meeting, opponents amassed at a hot-dog stand near city hall. A local real estate association, backed by money from the National Association of Realtors, offered free dinners to those who showed up to don red \u201cA Bad Deal for Richmond\u201d T-shirts; the group included a huddle of fraternity brothers brought in from Berkeley. If eminent domain were used, a young man who declined to identify himself was telling them, a for-profit company would make big money, and teacher and firefighter pensions would be hurt.The eminent-domain strategy is not a fabulous idea. Like virtually every other proposal to help homeowners hurt by the housing crash, it tries for simplicity but falters in the face of the enormity of the post-financial-crisis mess, and, as markets improve, it may come too late to make much difference. The plan\u2019s legality and wisdom have been debated in editorials and blog posts, with questions ranging from the true value of the mortgages to whether the chosen homeowners deserve the help.But to advocates, eminent domain offers perhaps the only chance to remedy the failure of the federal government and mortgage servicers to offer widespread, meaningful relief to the hardest-hit communities.The local foreclosure rate is declining, but it\u2019s still much higher than the national one. In light of this, the mayor shows no sign of backing down. \u201cThe risk that is really confronting us,\u201d she said, \u201cis waiting on the sidelines for the next wave of foreclosures.\u201dWhen the council first voted on eminent domain, in April, members were unanimously in favor. But then the opposition campaign began. Ms. McLaughlin predicted that her motion that September night would pass with five of seven council votes, but it squeaked by with just four. Jeffrey Wright, a real estate broker who is leading the local opposition, was satisfied. \u201cThis underwater mortgage bailout program,\u201d he said later, \u201cis on life support.\u201dThe day after the vote, Ms. McLaughlin was in her office, working on an entirely different project: getting ready for a trip to Ecuador, at the invitation of that country\u2019s president, to tour the damage that courts there have ruled was caused by oil drilling by Texaco, now owned by Chevron. Richmond held sessions where homeowners could meet with bank representatives and legal aid groups, but too often, the mayor says, the efforts came to naught. Last summer, underwater homeowners owed, on average, 45 percent more than the value of their homes, according to the city manager. The A.C.C.E. thought an earlier attempt to use eminent domain, in San Bernardino County, had failed because of a lack of grass-roots support. So in Richmond it held a door-knocking campaign. Its success was seen when more than 100 people, most in favor, signed up to speak at the September meeting. It lasted seven hours. The problem was that the mortgages had been bundled into pools and resold to thousands of investors all over the world. The rules governing many of the pools forbade the investors\u2019 representative, known as the trustee, from selling off mortgages or modifying them unless they were already in default, even though it might be in the investors\u2019 interest to do so.Scholars suggested that eminent domain could give trustees the legal cover they needed to get rid of the bad loans. So far, though, the investors have not seen it that way. In Richmond, investors (including BlackRock and Pimco) asked their trustees, Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank, to sue the city to stop the program. Eminent domain allows governments to condemn property for a public purpose, like building a road or eliminating urban decay, and applies to intangible property like mortgages as well as to real estate. Richmond argues that its public purpose is to prevent foreclosures and the blight of vacant properties. The idea is to buy those mortgages out of the bundles and restructure them, restoring equity to the homeowners and keep them from defaulting. Opponents of the plan argue in legal briefs that the risk of default now, so long after the crash, is vastly overstated. More than half of the 624 homeowners initially identified for the program are current on their payments. Not only that, 91 of the loans have already received a modification that included debt forgiveness \u2014 though many early modifications were unsustainable. Then there is the question of whether homeowners who got cash by refinancing their homes during the bubble \u2014 taking out new, riskier mortgages, as many of these did \u2014 deserve help now. (Ms. McLaughlin says the homeowners fell prey to unscrupulous lenders.) Lastly, opponents calculate that with rising home values, almost a third of the homeowners aren\u2019t even underwater, a figure that Mortgage Resolution Partners disputes. Opponents argue that the plan may help certain homeowners but hurt other working-class people whose pension funds invested in the loans. But pensioners and those stuck in underwater mortgages are often the same people, said Stephen Abrecht, an official of the Service Employees International Union, which supports the use of eminent domain. \u201cWe have members who are locked into these kinds of situations and can\u2019t get out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a drag on the economy and we\u2019re interested in seeing the economy take off again.\u201dMr. Wright, the real estate agent, said that what bothers him most about the plan is that it will help so few; no one with loans backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, which guarantee a majority of mortgages, is included. \u201cThey\u2019re bearing these placards saying, \u2018Save our homes\u2019 and they don\u2019t even realize that this program won\u2019t benefit them,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of false hope and that irritates me, that really irritates me.\u201dWall Street also objects to the plan on principle, portraying it not as a targeted response to an extraordinary event \u2014 the housing crash \u2014 but as a dangerous precedent that disrupts contracts and would all but end mortgage lending. Sifma and its allies have lobbied Congress to obstruct lending in any area where mortgages are vulnerable to government condemnation and have urged support for a bill from Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, that would bar any federal guarantee for such loans.After Richmond voted to pursue eminent domain, Sifma officials flew out to meet with city officials, providing them with a thick binder of analysis and research reports warning of potential negative consequences. Then these officials went a step further, said Bill Lindsay, the city manager, by placing a phone call to the city\u2019s bond underwriter and complaining that the disclosure language in a coming offering \u2014 to refinance some old economic development bonds \u2014 did not adequately disclose the legal risks of the mortgage plan.Cheryl Crispen, a spokeswoman for Sifma, said the call was routine. \u201cSifma staff regularly inquire with underwriters to understand market trends, and did so to better understand the impact the threat of taking mortgages was having on the offering and consequently the municipal bond market more broadly,\u201d she said. The underwriter, RBC Capital Markets, concurred that Sifma did not try to interfere in the offering, which was halted when there was no interest from investors. But Mr. Lindsay said all the attention was unusual. \u201cI\u2019ve handled 40 different bond issuances,\u201d he said. \u201cI never even heard of Sifma before this.\u201dIn 2002, the Georgia Legislature passed the toughest predatory-lending law in the country. Hailed as a victory for consumers, it was intended to prevent abusive practices like steering customers to high-interest loans. Lenders immediately started trying to dismantle the law, warning that the \u201cgood guys\u201d would no longer make loans to people with poor credit. Some lenders did pull out of the state, and two of the three ratings agencies said they could no longer rate Georgia loans for resale to investors because they could be sued under the law. The state banking commissioner estimated that the mortgage market shrank by 15 percent. The following year, after a nasty fight, lawmakers gutted the statute. Sifma officials point to this affair as proof that messing with housing finance can have ruinous effects. But it is an example that offers other lessons, too. The loans that disappeared from the market after the law was passed were the same kinds of subprime loans that set off the foreclosure wave; conventional 30-year mortgages were not affected. The lenders whose departure was met with such alarm included Countrywide Financial, whose practices during the housing boom have cost billions in legal settlements. Richmond has not yet tried to use eminent domain. The City Council must vote again before that happens. But the beating the city is taking from financial institutions makes the idea less likely to catch on in places like Irvington, N.J., and El Monte, Calif., which have expressed interest. Richmond\u2019s mayor says she has always known it would be a slog. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to minimize what we\u2019re dealing with; it\u2019s just like, if you\u2019re willing to buck up against an unjust set of circumstances, you\u2019re going to have those attacks coming at you,\u201d Ms. McLaughlin said. \u201cAnd in some sense that says you\u2019re doing your job.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert Hess, 57, Dies; Led Homeless Services Under Bloomberg", "Date": "2014-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe cause was liver cancer, his wife, the former Tish Garmer, said.Mr. Hess was appointed in 2006 by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who had pledged two years earlier to reduce New York\u2019s homeless population by two-thirds by 2009. As the leader of homeless services in Philadelphia, Mr. Hess had overseen a 60 percent reduction in homelessness there. But his job in New York was far more daunting: Roughly 31,000 people relied on New York\u2019s shelter system every night in 2006, compared with around 3,000 per night in Philadelphia. Mr. Hess revamped a voucher program to help homeless people afford housing; focused on designing shelters specifically for homeless veterans and building them for the chronic street homeless; used city employees and volunteers to persuade homeless people to enter shelters; and administered programs to help people leave the shelter system. These and other measures, coupled with a relatively strong economy, helped reduce the number of people living on the street to slightly more than 2,300 in January 2009, down from more than 3,700 in January 2007, according to city estimates. Then the recession struck. In 2009, the population in the shelter system exceeded 37,000, about 2,000 more than in 2008, and by the end of the year the number of people living on the street had increased by about 1,000.As the numbers climbed, advocates for the homeless and public figures like William C. Thompson Jr., the comptroller, and Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, became outspoken critics of the Bloomberg administration\u2019s record on homelessness. (Both men later campaigned to succeed Mr. Bloomberg.)But Mr. Hess said the problem was not one the city could control entirely. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the devastating effect of this unprecedented poor economy on our streets.\u201d he said at a news conference in March 2010. He stepped down as commissioner that April and was replaced by Seth Diamond, formerly an executive deputy commissioner at the Human Resources Administration.At the time of Mr. Hess\u2019s departure, Mayor Bloomberg said at that news conference, \u201cWe all know the bursting of the housing bubble and the downturn on the national economy was like a one-two punch on our shelter system.\u201dRobert Vernon Hess was born on Feb. 24, 1956, in Baltimore. He graduated from Towson Catholic High School in 1974, then served in the Army. He later earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business management at the University of Maryland. In Baltimore, he ran a thrift store for veterans and came to know many who lived on the street. He worked with several homeless aid organizations and in 2001 became Philadelphia\u2019s deputy managing director of special needs housing.In addition to his wife, he is survived by their daughters, Christi and Brittany Hess; his mother, Barbara Ann Neumeister Hess; a brother, Steve; and a sister, Lynda Hess.The homeless population has grown to record-breaking levels since Mr. Hess\u2019s departure, reaching more than 50,000 in shelters on Monday, according to a department survey.Advertisement"}

And, in a better world, our leaders would be doing all they could to address both faults.Unfortunately, the world we actually live in falls far short of that ideal. In fact, we should count ourselves lucky when leaders confront even one of our two great economic failures. If, as has been widely reported, President Obama devotes much of his State of the Union address to inequality, everyone should be cheering him on.They won\u2019t, of course. Instead, he will face two kinds of sniping. The usual suspects on the right will, as always when questions of income distribution comes up, shriek \u201cClass warfare!\u201d But there will also be seemingly more sober voices arguing that he has picked the wrong target, that jobs, not inequality, should be at the top of his agenda.Here\u2019s why they\u2019re wrong.The flip side of this attempt to use fiscal scare tactics to worsen inequality is that highlighting concerns about inequality can translate into pushback against job-destroying austerity, too.But the most important reason for Mr. Obama to focus on inequality is political realism. Like it or not, the simple fact is that Americans \u201cget\u201d inequality; macroeconomics, not so much.The point is that of the two great problems facing the U.S. economy, inequality is the one on which Mr. Obama is most likely to connect with voters. And he should seek that connection with a clear conscience: There\u2019s no shame is acknowledging political reality, as long as you\u2019re trying to do the right thing.So I hope we\u2019ll hear something about jobs Tuesday night, and some pushback against deficit hysteria.

When the majority leader, Harry Reid, exhorted colleagues to \u201cdeal with the issue of income inequality,\u201d the talk took a spiritual turn.\u201cYou know,\u201d declared Senator Bernard Sanders, the Vermont independent, who caucuses with Democrats, \u201cwe have a strong ally on our side in this issue \u2014 and that is the pope.\u201dThat Mr. Sanders, who is Jewish, would invoke the pope to Mr. Reid, a Mormon, delighted Roman Catholics in the room. (\u201cBernie! You\u2019re quoting my pope; this is good!\u201d Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois recalled thinking.) Beyond interfaith banter, the comment underscored a larger truth: From 4,500 miles away at the Vatican, Pope Francis, who has captivated the world with a message of economic justice and tolerance, has become a presence in Washington\u2019s policy debate.\u201cHe has given a number of us in the political ranks encouragement, and really a challenge, to step up and remember many of the values that brought us to public life,\u201d Mr. Durbin said.Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, a potential 2016 presidential candidate who speaks of poverty in the context of his faith, has praised Francis for \u201cbreathing new life into the fight against poverty,\u201d and is working on a Republican plan to address the issue. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and now a co-host of CNN\u2019s \u201cCrossfire,\u201d said he would talk more about poverty on the program.\u201cI think every Republican should embrace the pope\u2019s core critique that you do not want to live on a planet with billionaires and people who do not have any food,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cI think the pope may, in fact, be starting a conversation at the exact moment the Republican Party itself needs to have that conversation.\u201dIn many respects, Francis\u2019 economic views are consistent with church doctrine and the views of previous popes, though John Paul II spoke more about the benefits of capitalism in the context of his anti-Communist views. But with his humble style and off-the-cuff remarks, Francis is seen as shifting the church\u2019s emphasis and tone.Mr. Durbin, who attended Catholic schools but, as a senator, switched parishes to avoid being denied communion because of his support for abortion rights, no longer feels \u201cbeleaguered by the conservative leadership.\u201d Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, a Democrat who served as an altar boy from grade school through college, described himself as feeling \u201cliberated\u201d after a recent speech to a university center on Catholic intellectual life brought nary a question about his support for abortion rights. He credited Francis for changing the tone.\u201cI felt such a relief,\u201d Mr. Leahy said.Pope Francis is, of course, a religious figure \u2014 not a political one \u2014 and faith has long mixed uneasily with politics in American public life. John F. Kennedy, the only Roman Catholic president, felt compelled as a candidate to pledge not to take cues from the pope. Today, with evangelical Christians a potent political force, especially among Republicans, talk of God during political campaigns is routine.Catholics account for about 24 percent of voters; for national candidates, courting them is essential. Since 1972, just one presidential candidate, George W. Bush in 2000, has won the White House without winning the Catholic vote. Catholic lawmakers in both parties know Francis is not changing church doctrine, including opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. \u201cI haven\u2019t yet seen anything that departs from Catholic teaching,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, an economic conservative. \u201cWhat Francis is saying goes to the soul of the party,\u201d said John Feehery, a Republican strategist, who is Catholic. \u201cWhat does the party actually believe in? What is its purpose? Is it just to have unbridled capitalism without any moral core?\u201dFor Democrats, the pope\u2019s apparent progressive leanings provide a fresh point of entry to reach Catholic voters, who often serve as a proxy for how middle-income Americans will cast their ballots. The Catholic vote is clearly contestable; in 2012, Mr. Obama won Catholics by a slim margin, 50 percent to 48 percent, over Mitt Romney.Still, some Catholic lawmakers sound uneasy, wary of appropriating a religious leader as their own.\u201cI don\u2019t talk about the pope that much,\u201d said Senator Joe Donnelly, a freshman Democrat from Indiana and a graduate of Notre Dame. \u201cHe\u2019s not there to promote the Republicans or promote the Democratic Party.

{"Headline": "Red Tape Snarls Projects in India", "Date": "2014-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 The Mumbai Trans Harbor Link, a 14-mile series of pillars supporting an eight-lane highway and a rail line, was supposed to be an artery relieving pressure on India\u2019s financial capital, while feeding a new city and fresh growth.The trouble is, it has never been built. Instead, the project \u2014 which would be the country\u2019s longest sea bridge and is now estimated to cost $1.5 billion \u2014 is both a symbol of India\u2019s emerging economic aspirations and the entrenched bureaucracy hindering its development.Proposed in the early 1970s, the bridge was designed to relieve traffic congestion in Mumbai by reducing travel time between the city center and Navi Mumbai, or New Bombay, to the north.\u201cNavi Mumbai was conceived as a well-connected parallel city that would act as a magnet and pull businesses, banks and state administration toward that area and take some pressure off the city,\u201d said Pankaj Joshi, director of the Urban Design Research Institute, a planning and conservation organization for Mumbai.The Mumbai Trans Harbor Link is one of numerous infrastructure projects in India that are sorely needed to create economic growth but have stalled because of seemingly intractable red tape. Projects worth $110 billion have been delayed by difficulties in acquiring land, getting environmental and other regulatory approvals, and obtaining long-term financing, according to data compiled by a consortium of state-run banks last March.\u201cPeople have lost confidence that they will be able to execute anything on time,\u201d said Vikram Limaye, managing director and chief executive of IDFC, an infrastructure financing firm in Mumbai. \u201cThat confidence needs to be restored if the investment cycle in infrastructure has to pick up.\u201dAs government officials in India increasingly find themselves embroiled in allegations of corruption, they have become wary of making swift decisions. While private sector spending on infrastructure has increased 10 times over the last decade, the government is seen as falling short in handling contracts and disputes.\u201cTo facilitate the development of infrastructure, there needs to be a time-bound program for giving clearances for projects, along with cohesion between the state and central governments for policy implementation,\u201d said Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and group chief financial officer of JSW Steel, a unit of the construction company JSW Group.Officials overseeing infrastructure development struggle to reconcile the concerns of various departments whose clearances are required for each project.\u201cIndia is caught in a dilemma where you have to lift the poor out of poverty, but while doing that you have to protect both the social and environmental aftereffects,\u201d said a senior Finance Ministry official, who was not authorized to speak for the ministry. \u201cIt got to the point where numerous projects were mired in red tape and a potential investor in infrastructure was unclear when he would get his clearances.\u201dSince July, a committee started by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has given fast-track regulatory approval to 125 previously stalled infrastructure and manufacturing projects worth $64 billion, but that is still considered inadequate. \u201cThis is not a solution for the industry\u2019s problems. This is an exercise in crisis management,\u201d said Madhu Terdal, chief financial officer of GMR Infrastructure, a Bangalore-based builder of airports, energy projects, highways and urban infrastructure.The state of Maharashtra, which includes Mumbai, gave the Mumbai bridge project the green light in 1996. But environmental clearance from the central government \u2014 the last of the regulatory approvals required \u2014 came only in October 2012.Over those years, India\u2019s economy has gone from a boom to a slowdown, and potential builders are now less than eager to sign on. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority has opened the project for bidding as a public-private partnership three times since 2008, each time failing to elicit adequate response from private companies.In such a partnership, the builder would collect tolls to recover costs and make a profit. In the most recent tender, last August, construction companies pointed to reduced traffic forecasts stemming from the economic slowdown and delays in building an airport for Navi Mumbai, affecting the projected revenue from toll collections.Since 2005, the estimated cost of the project has more than doubled, from $632 million. Now, the state government is considering using a cash contract \u2014 in which the project is funded entirely by the government but built by a private contractor \u2014 and is looking to raise debt from foreign funding agencies. While the official estimate for completion is 2019, further delays are widely expected.Over the last year, economic malaise, slowing demand and rising interest rates have put infrastructure companies in a financial bind, and this has increased the difficulty in finding a contractor for the bridge. \u201cDespite the fact that we had substantially de-risked the project when we restructured it, the private sector failed to respond because most of the Indian companies that we had shortlisted were facing their own financial issues,\u201d said Ashwini Bhide, who oversees the bridge project and other infrastructure programs at the Mumbai development authority.A Credit Suisse report last August found that infrastructure companies like the Jaypee Group, GMR Infrastructure, GVK, Lanco Infratech and the JSW Group were among the Indian conglomerates with the highest debt.Many of these companies have begun to sell assets to pare debt, and some are considering raising money overseas through equity issues. In March, GMR Infrastructure offloaded $327 million worth of assets to lighten a debt burden that was recently still about $6 billion.\u201cProblems arose as every project got delayed because of indecision at the government level,\u201d said Mr. Terdal of GMR. \u201cIf raw materials were made available, environmental approvals had come through in time and acquisition of land made possible, all the projects would have been earning very well, and companies would have cleared their debt.\u201dThe lack of long-term financing for infrastructure companies is another hurdle. During the October meeting of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Washington, the Indian minister, P. Chidambaram, said development banks such as the World Bank should help ensure financing for infrastructure in developing countries. India introduced its own infrastructure debt fund last June.Advertisement"}

He has no neighbors, but plenty of company: hundreds of abandoned cows he has vowed to protect from the government\u2019s kill order.A large bulldozer \u2014 meant to keep out agricultural officials \u2014 stands at the entrance to the newly renamed Ranch of Hope like a silent sentinel, guarding a driveway lined with bleached cattle bones and handwritten protest signs. \u201cLet the Cows of Hope Live!\u201d says one. Another, written on a yellow-painted cow skull, declares: \u201cNuclear Rebellion!\u201d Inside the now overcrowded ranch, bellowing cows spill from the overflowing cattle sheds into the well-worn pasture, and even trample the yard of the warmly lit farmhouse.\u201cThese cows are living testimony to the human folly here in Fukushima,\u201d said Mr. Yoshizawa, 59, a gruff but eloquent man with a history of protest against his government. \u201cThe government wants to kill them because it wants to erase what happened here, and lure Japan back to its pre-accident nuclear status quo. I am not going to let them.\u201dMr. Yoshizawa is no sentimentalist \u2014 before the disaster, he raised cows for slaughter. But he says there is a difference between killing cows for food and killing them because, in their contaminated state, they are no longer useful. He believes the cows on his ranch, abandoned by him and other fleeing farmers after the accident, are as much victims as the 83,000 humans forced to abandon their homes and live outside the evacuation zone for two and a half years.\u201cIf authorities say kill the cows,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I resolved to do the opposite by saving them.\u201dThe cows at the Ranch of Hope are what is left of a once-thriving beef industry in the towns around the plant. Entire herds died of starvation in the weeks after the residents left. The cows that survived escaped their ranches to forage for food among the empty homes and streets, where they became traffic hazards for trucks shuttling workers and supplies to and from the stricken plant. Proclaiming the animals \u201cwalking accident debris,\u201d officials from the Ministry of Agriculture ordered them to be rounded up and slaughtered, their bodies buried or burned along with other radioactive waste.Outraged, Mr. Yoshizawa began returning to his ranch soon after to feed the remnants of the herd he had been tending. He eventually decided to return full time to turn the ranch into a haven for all of the area\u2019s abandoned cows. Of the approximately 360 cows at his 80-acre spread, more than half are ones that others left behind.Although he describes his protest in mainly political terms, his explanation for returning despite the possible danger is tinged with a hint of emotion. He describes his horror on visiting abandoned farms where he found rows of dead cows, their heads fallen into food troughs where they had waited to be fed. In one barn, a newborn calf hoarsely bawled next to its dead mother. He said his spur-of-the-moment decision to save the calf, which he named Ichigo, or Strawberry, was his inspiration for trying to save the others left behind.He still searches the evacuation zone for the often emaciated survivors, which he often has to pull by their ears to get them to follow him home. He tries to dodge police roadblocks; it is technically illegal for anyone to live inside the evacuation zone. Nonetheless, he has been caught a half-dozen times and forced to sign prewritten statements of apology for entering the zone. He has done so, but only after crossing out the promises not to do it again.Mr. Yoshizawa is no stranger to challenging authority, having protested against nuclear power before. But he says he felt particularly bitter after the Fukushima accident, which he fears could permanently ruin the ranch that he inherited from his father.It does not help that his town, Namie, felt especially deceived by its leaders. After he heard the explosions at the plant, whose smokestacks and cranes are visible from his kitchen, he and many other townspeople ended up fleeing into the radioactive plume because the government did not disclose crucial information about the accident.\u201cI needed to find a new philosophy to keep on living,\u201d said Mr. Yoshizawa, who is unmarried and lives alone on the ranch. \u201cThen I realized, why is Japan being so meek in accepting what authorities are telling them? I decided to become the resistance.\u201dOn a recent cold morning, Mr. Yoshizawa used a small bulldozer to carry bales of yellow rice stalks to feed the cows, about two to three times the number that he says his ranch can sustainably support. The cows, mostly a breed known as Japanese Black prized for its marbled wagyu-style beef, hungrily mooed as they jostled one another to get a mouthful.Mr. Yoshizawa says one fear is running out of feed. With the oversized herd having already grazed his pastureland to stubble, he now relies on contributions of feed and money. Another worry is what living amid the contamination is doing to the cows, and to him.A checkup soon after the accident showed high levels of radioactive cesium in his body, though he said the number had decreased over the last two years. He tries to keep his contamination as low as possible by using filtered water and buying food on trips out of the area.The cows, however, are constantly ingesting radioactive materials that remain in the soil and grass; since most of the donated feed he receives is from the region, it, too, is contaminated.Ten of the cows have developed small white spots on their heads and flanks that he thinks are a result of exposure to radiation. Experts said they had never seen such spots before, but they said other causes were also possible, including a fungal infection from the overcrowding.Mr. Yoshizawa has attracted a small following of supporters, but has his critics, too, who say he is keeping the animals alive in less than humane conditions in order to make a political point.\u201cLooking at the over-concentration of animals, I personally don\u2019t think this is very humanitarian,\u201d said Manabu Fukumoto, a pathologist at the Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer at Tohoku University who studied the white spots.Mr. Yoshizawa notes wryly that the cows are living much longer than they would have if they had been led off to slaughter.For now, the local authorities have come up with a very Japanese solution to Mr. Yoshizawa\u2019s defiance: turning a blind eye. Town officials in Namie deny knowledge of him or anyone else living inside the evacuation zone \u2014 despite the fact that they have restored electricity and telephone service to the ranch.\u201cNot all Japanese are passive,\u201d Mr. Yoshizawa said. \u201cMy cows and I will show that there is still a chance for change.\u201dHisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The War Over Poverty", "Date": "2014-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFifty years have passed since Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty. And a funny thing happened on the way to this anniversary. Suddenly, or so it seems, progressives have stopped apologizing for their efforts on behalf of the poor, and have started trumpeting them instead. And conservatives find themselves on the defensive.It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. For a long time, everyone knew \u2014 or, more accurately, \u201cknew\u201d \u2014 that the war on poverty had been an abject failure. And they knew why: It was the fault of the poor themselves. But what everyone knew wasn\u2019t true, and the public seems to have caught on. The narrative went like this: Antipoverty programs hadn\u2019t actually reduced poverty, because poverty in America was basically a social problem \u2014 a problem of broken families, crime and a culture of dependence that was only reinforced by government aid. And because this narrative was so widely accepted, bashing the poor was good politics, enthusiastically embraced by Republicans and some Democrats, too.Yet this view of poverty, which may have had some truth to it in the 1970s, bears no resemblance to anything that has happened since. Or to put it a different way, the problem of poverty has become part of the broader problem of rising income inequality, of an economy in which all the fruits of growth seem to go to a small elite, leaving everyone else behind.So how should we respond to this reality?The conservative position, essentially, is that we shouldn\u2019t respond. Conservatives are committed to the view that government is always the problem, never the solution; they treat every beneficiary of a safety-net program as if he or she were \u201ca Cadillac-driving welfare queen.\u201d And why not? After all, for decades their position was a political winner, because middle-class Americans saw \u201cwelfare\u201d as something that Those People got but they didn\u2019t.But that was then. At this point, the rise of the 1 percent at the expense of everyone else is so obvious that it\u2019s no longer possible to shut down any discussion of rising inequality with cries of \u201cclass warfare.\u201d Meanwhile, hard times have forced many more Americans to turn to safety-net programs. And as conservatives have responded by defining an ever-growing fraction of the population as morally unworthy \u201ctakers\u201d \u2014 a quarter, a third, 47 percent, whatever \u2014 they have made themselves look callous and meanspirited.Meanwhile, progressives are on offense. They have decided that inequality is a winning political issue. They see war-on-poverty programs like food stamps, Medicaid, and the earned-income tax credit as success stories, initiatives that have helped Americans in need \u2014 especially during the slump since 2007 \u2014 and should be expanded. And if these programs enroll a growing number of Americans, rather than being narrowly targeted on the poor, so what?So guess what: On its 50th birthday, the war on poverty no longer looks like a failure. It looks, instead, like a template for a rising, increasingly confident progressive movement. Advertisement"}

ANONYMOUSIt sounds as if you have tried everything, and that may be part of the problem: If you followed confrontation with an attempt at friendship, I doubt that your nemesis was fooled.At this stage, you need to step back and ask yourself if you want to try to coexist with this person.

The chances are good that she\u2019s not your biggest fan, either, so you have to be willing to listen, and even compromise, not just dictate.

The C.E.O. could set aside one weekday a month \u2014 a Friday lunch from noon to 2 p.m., for instance \u2014 and invite five or six of these entrepreneurs to come in for pizza and ask away. That\u2019s two hours, once a month, and it would give this C.E.O. back his weekends, and his sanity. And it has numerous other benefits, including fostering a support network among these entrepreneurs who may then be able to help out one another.

As one reader put it: \u201cThey may find that a lot of them have the same questions, or would have the same questions if they thought of it, and they may benefit from hearing all the answers.\u201dAnother reader suggested replying to initial inquiries with a six-page PDF \u201cresource piece\u201d that answers commonly asked queries. Yet another asked: \u201cWhy not start a class or lecture series, with perhaps four sessions a year? Ask around for other C.E.O.\u2019s to join, and do a series with a seminar approach, limited to perhaps 20 attendees.\u201dMaybe these strategies are more efficient than anything I suggested. But is efficiency the issue? At some point, a serious aspiring entrepreneur wants to get personal, not attend a de facto seminar. That\u2019s why I\u2019m more in favor of strategies that weed out anybody seeking boilerplate tips and find those who have done their homework: Going one-on-one has more value for the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and it is more satisfying to the mentor.I\u2019m also not convinced that these various strategies will save the C.E.O. time and energy in the long run.

{"Headline": "Welcome or Not, 4,000 Football Fans Will Be Afloat at a Hudson River Pier", "Date": "2014-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor five days next week \u2014 before, during and after Super Bowl XLVIII \u2014 the roster of hotels in New York will grow by one. The city\u2019s newest hotel will have almost as many rooms for guests as the New York Hilton or the Marriott Marquis, two of the largest hotels in the city.And then that hotel will shut down. Eventually, it will float away.It is a cruise ship \u2014 specifically, a Norwegian Cruise Line vessel, 1,062 feet long, the Norwegian Getaway. But it will undergo a makeover so complete that virtually every sign of the Getaway\u2019s name in every stateroom will be replaced before the first passenger boards, even though the ship is brand new. The passengers are scheduled to go ashore for four nightly concerts in a tent in a parking lot featuring bands including the Foo Fighters. That has landlubbers near the New York Passenger Ship Terminal worried about aggravating noise and unruly crowds.The Super Bowl always inspires audacious promotions, but even so, the ship stands out. It has a fanciful painted hull showing a mermaid carrying the sun above the waves. It has 18 decks, 22 bars and lounges and 27 dining menus. It has an aqua park with two swimming pools and four hot tubs. It also has a nine-hole miniature golf course, a rock-climbing wall and an eight-foot platform over the side for anyone who is tempted to walk the plank like a mutineer. The ship is being taken over by Anheuser-Busch InBev, and over 26 hours on Wednesday and Thursday, it will undergo a transformation. Out will go anything that says Norwegian Getaway. In will come replacements that say Bud Light. That means new signs, new pillows, new hand towels, new key cards, new notepads by the phones and new bottles of shampoo in the bathrooms.Bud Light is calling the 4,000 people who have been invited aboard \u201cguests,\u201d not passengers, and is referring to the ship as the Bud Light Hotel. The brewing company is not taking reservations; admission is by invitation only.The ship is the fifth Bud Light Hotel, and the largest. Anheuser-Busch officials boasted when they announced plans for the ship that they could accommodate 10 times as many people as in past hotels in Super Bowl cities. It said the guests would include consumers who had won Super Bowl-related contests, along with retailers and people the company described as its invited \u201cbusiness partners.\u201dThey will not spend all their time on Norwegian Getaway \u2014 there is the game, of course, and many on board will presumably disembark on Feb. 2 for the journey to MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. But they can clamber off the ship before that. Bud Light is also taking over the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum, a World War II-era aircraft carrier docked at the pier next door. And Bud Light has put up a tent in a parking lot across 12th Avenue from the Intrepid.\u201cThe concern is rock concerts in a parking lot,\u201d said Jean-Daniel Noland, a member of Community Board 4, whose jurisdiction includes Hell\u2019s Kitchen and the piers. \u201cAre people going to be able to sleep at night?\u201d He said other rock concerts on the piers, like Pier of Fear, at Pier 94, had disrupted the neighborhood. \u201cYou could hear it blocks and blocks away,\u201d he said. Referring to the schedule for the Bud Light concerts, he said, \u201cThis could be worse.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever been down there when the cruise ships come in,\u201d Mr. Noland added, \u201cit\u2019s a mess.\u201dRobert J. Benfatto Jr., the district manager for Community Board 4, said he hoped that five days of a floating hotel would not \u201cbe that bad.\u201d \u201cIt will be a lot of people,\u201d who could crowd the neighborhood, he said, but he guessed that the people aboard would be \u201cmore corporate types, so it won\u2019t be that rowdy of a crowd.\u201d\u201cI get a kick out of the fact that the game is in New Jersey, yet everyone is staying in New York,\u201d Mr. Benfatto said. \u201cThankfully, Super Bowls don\u2019t come along every day.\u201dThe two-state committee coordinating the Super Bowl has long said that the game will boost the economy \u2014 the city\u2019s and, more broadly, the region\u2019s. But Mr. Noland said he saw no upside. \u201cHow does the city benefit from this?\u201d Mr. Noland asked. \u201cWe were told the Bud Light Hotel will pay docking fees, and then all these football fans will go enjoy the city, go to the Metropolitan Opera and to the New York City Ballet and the theater to bring revenue to the city. I\u2019m sure the city is calculating that someone is going to make money, I suppose in bars and restaurants, but is the city really benefiting? How does the city analyze the discomfort of citizens measured against revenue?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Caution in Davos Over Report of Growth in Europe", "Date": "2014-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 An index of industrial activity in the euro zone has reached its highest level since mid-2011, according to a report released on Thursday. But policy makers, business leaders and economists gathered at the World Economic Forum here seem deeply skeptical about whether growth will be strong enough to cut high levels of youth unemployment in the bloc.\u201cWe have turned the corner, but we cannot say we are out of the crisis with such high levels of unemployment,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, said here on Thursday.In contrast to the last few years\u2019 meetings in Davos, this year the state of the European economy is not the dominant topic of debate. Fears of the imminent collapse of the euro zone, which hung over the forum\u2019s previous sessions, have eased. This time, more energy and debate are being directed to issues like the civil war in Syria, Iran\u2019s nuclear program and global economic inequality.James Howat, an economist in London with Capital Economics, said in a research note that the data suggested that the zone\u2019s gross domestic product grew about 0.4 percent over the latest quarter. That would be about 1.6 percent on an annualized basis, better than the 1.1 percent the European Central Bank is forecasting for 2014.But in Davos, the Markit report generated little optimism. There is widespread worry that the euro zone could face years or even decades of only slow growth, breeding a generation of frustrated young people who could be a source of political turmoil.Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard, one of many prominent economists here this week, pointed out that some euro currency countries, like Germany, have climbed back to the same level of economic output they had before the financial crisis began.\u201cIt will be another five years at least for a number of countries,\u201d Mr. Rogoff said at a panel discussion on Wednesday.Financial markets have calmed, and countries like Italy and Spain are able to raise money on capital markets at lower rates. But many countries remain burdened by high debt, aging populations and weak banks. Devastatingly high youth unemployment, well above 50 percent in Spain and Greece, will stunt the professional development of millions of young people for years.\u201cThe recovery is lackluster. It\u2019s uneven across Europe. It\u2019s not enough to bring down unemployment,\u201d Axel A. Weber, chairman of the Swiss bank UBS and former president of the German central bank, said at the same panel discussion Mr. Rogoff attended.The Markit survey on Thursday was among a number of hopeful signs for the European economy in recent months, including improvements in sentiment among consumers and businesses and relatively robust industrial production.Still, unemployment for the euro zone as a whole has been hovering around 12.1 percent for months, and deflation has begun to appear as a real threat.The Markit survey tracks both services and manufacturing, and it showed that euro zone factory output expanded at the fastest rate in nearly three years. Services increased more modestly.Germany, the largest of the 18 European Union member economies that use the euro currency, picked up pace, according to the survey. France, still showing a modest contraction, moved closer to the break-even point.But many business leaders at Davos said that Europe remained unfriendly to business in many ways.Pierre Nanterme, chief executive of the consulting firm Accenture, complained about the costs of varied labor regulations in European countries, which he contrasted with those in the United States. To grow more strongly, Europe must act more aggressively to improve its competitiveness, Mr. Nanterme, who is French, told an audience in Davos.If Europe fails, he said, \u201cwe could have not five years but 10 years, if not 20 years, of mediocre\u201d growth.Jack Ewing reported from Davos, Switzerland, and David Jolly from Paris.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Arab Neighbors Take Split Paths in Constitutions", "Date": "2014-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 One is setting a standard for dialogue and democracy that is the envy of the Arab world. The other has become a study in the risks of revolution, on a violent path that seems to lead only in circles.Tunisia and Egypt, the neighbors whose twin revolts ignited the Arab Spring, are a dual lesson in the pitfalls and potentials for democracy across the region.On the third anniversary of the flight of the former strongman, President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia\u2019s constituent assembly was poised on Tuesday to approve a new constitution that is one of the most liberal in the Arab world. A carefully worded blend that has won the approval of both the governing Islamist party and its secular opposition, the new charter presents the region with a rare model of reconciliation over the vexing question of Islam\u2019s role in public life.Egyptians, meanwhile, trudged to the polls on Tuesday and Wednesday for their third referendum in three years to approve a new constitution: this time for one that validates the military ouster of their first fairly elected president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, and gives power and immunity to both the military and the police.\u201c \u2018Train wreck\u2019 might be a charitable way to describe where Egypt is right now,\u201d said Nathan J. Brown, an expert on Arab legal systems at George Washington University. In Tunisia, he said, \u201ceverybody keeps dancing on the edge of a cliff, but they never fall off.\u201dThe difference, scholars said, lies in the shape of the shards left after each country\u2019s revolt. Tunisia\u2019s brutal security police virtually collapsed during its revolt, while its small, professionalized military historically had no interest in political power. In civilian politics, its Islamist and secular factions were relatively evenly matched, with the Islamists winning only a plurality in Tunisia\u2019s first free vote. Each side needed the other to govern.In Egypt, where the military has been a political player since Gamal Abdel Nasser\u2019s 1952 coup, the generals stepped in to remove President Hosni Mubarak, himself a onetime military man, and never fully receded. Further complicating matters, each side of the political divide had reason to hope it might rule alone: The Islamists dominated the elections, while their opponents knew the military was waiting in the wings.\u201cThe opposition knew that, first, it might never win another election and, second, the military was there,\u201d Mr. Brown said.\u201cIn Tunisia, we have turned the page completely, and you really feel that a revolution has taken place,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Egypt, that is debatable.\u201dTunisia, scarred by its own grinding and sometimes violent conflict between secular autocrats and political Islamists, was trapped in an even more restrictive police state than was Egypt, with less space for political participation or dissent before the revolt.Until mid-December, its process also appeared to teeter on the brink of collapse. There were assassinations of left-leaning political leaders and allegations that the moderate Islamist ruling party, Ennahda, had done too little to combat a militant Islamist insurgency. For five months, a political deadlock halted the drafting of the constitution. Perhaps prodded by the overthrow of the elected Islamists in Egypt, however, the two sides finally reached an accommodation last month, settling on a caretaker prime minister for the government and getting back to work on the charter.Ennahda won wording stating that Islam is the religion of Tunisia but gave up on any reference to Islamic law. \u201cTunisia is a free, independent and sovereign state, Islam is her religion, Arabic her language and republic her regime,\u201d a clause of the preamble reads. The more liberal parties, with strong lobbying from civil society groups, secured guarantees that Tunisia would remain a civil state with separation of powers and pledges of freedoms and rights. \u201cTunisia is a state of civil character, based on citizenship, the will of the people and the primacy of law,\u201d the counterpart clause of the preamble reads.Neither clause can be amended by future governments.The constitutional assembly \u201cfinally found some equilibrium,\u201d said Ghazi Gherairi, secretary general of the International Academy of Constitutional Law in Tunis, the capital. \u201cIt is a result of consensus, and this is new in the Arab world.\u201dEgypt\u2019s referendum on Tuesday appeared to be set to produce a near-unanimity in votes but hardly a consensus. A landslide approval is expected to open the presidential campaign by the military leader who removed Mr. Morsi, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi. Voters at several polling places seemed to doubt that anyone might vote against it.\u201cWhat? Everybody is voting yes to the constitution,\u201d one man exclaimed on leaving a polling place after he mistakenly thought he had overheard another say he had cast his ballot against it.\u201cNo, I meant I voted against the last one,\u201d that voter, Sami Hadid, 73, clarified, referring to the constitution drafted by an Islamist-led assembly and approved in the referendum a little more than a year ago. \u201cI hate the Muslim Brotherhood.\u201dThe public debate has been one-sided, to say the least. The Brotherhood boycotted the referendum, dismissing the vote as an attempt to legitimate an illegal coup. The government has shut down Egyptian news media outlets sympathetic to the group, declared the Brotherhood a terrorist organization, jailed its leaders, seized its assets and criminalized membership.In recent days, the new government has arrested at least seven activists merely for trying to hang signs or stickers opposing the new charter. On Tuesday, more were arrested, state news media reported.The voting began with a small explosion near a court building in the Imbaba neighborhood of Giza, across the river from Cairo, damaging the facade but injuring no one.Egypt\u2019s three-year experiment with democracy has ousted Hosni Mubarak and deposed Mohamed Morsi, the country\u2019s first elected leader. Explore key moments of their rule and the aftermath.By nightfall, the Ministry of Health said that at least 11 people had died, but even the deaths were disputed. The Brotherhood said at least four of the dead were civilians, including a child, who had been killed by the police. The Interior Ministry said the four had been killed by members of the Brotherhood. Dozens of other supposed members of the Brotherhood were arrested on charges of attempting to disrupt the vote, but there were no major protests.\u201cThis time it has surpassed Mubarak at the height of his authoritarianism,\u201d said Hossam Bahgat, the founder of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights.For virtually the first time since the 1999 one-candidate plebiscite that granted Mr. Mubarak a fourth term, Mr. Bahgat planned to sit out the vote, he said. \u201cLike most Egyptians, I guess that I am indifferent,\u201d he said.About a third of the electorate turned out in December 2012, to vote on the last charter, which passed by a ratio of about two to one. During the run-up to the vote, anti-Islamist politicians, judges, government officials and most of the privately owned news media attacked the draft of the charter for opening a door to potential religious restrictions on individual rights.The new charter retains the main clause stipulating that the principles of Islamic law are the wellspring of Egyptian jurisprudence. But it removes a more controversial clause that sought to constrain the way judges interpret those principles, by defining them according to the broad schools of mainstream Sunni Muslim scholarship.Many voting Tuesday said they sought mainly to be rid of the Brotherhood, which had failed to master the bureaucracy, revive the economy or calm the streets. With patriotic music blaring from military vehicles outside and helicopters flying low overhead, polling places had the feel of a kind of martial pageant.\u201cIt is all for the love of our country and the love of Sisi!\u201d said Nadia Sayed, 64, sitting with a group of female friends in Nasr City. \u201cHe will do everything good for our grandchildren,\u201d she said, before the women broke into ululation and a pop song, \u201cBless the Hands,\u201d celebrating the army and police for removing Mr. Morsi.An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Hosni Mubarak was elected to a fourth term.

{"Headline": "Life Story of Wendy Davis Swings From Strength to Flash Point in Texas Campaign", "Date": "2014-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Wendy Davis is learning the perils of campaigning on her personal biography.The controversy has turned her underdog campaign to become Texas\u2019s first Democratic governor in 20 years into a hotbed of second-guessing over her omissions and has prompted a debate over culturally charged questions about a woman\u2019s balance of work, ambition and parenthood.In a state with a booming economy but simmering problems with its public schools and water infrastructure and with high rates of poverty and people without health insurance, one of the central questions hanging over the race is how long, exactly, Ms. Davis lived in a trailer in Fort Worth as a single mother. Supporters of Ms. Davis and some analysts of gender issues in politics said the scrutiny of her choices as a working wife and mother was something no male candidate would be subject to. Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who once worked for Ms. Davis, pointed out that when Rahm Emanuel was running for mayor of Chicago, he left his family behind in Washington so his children could finish school.\u201cAnd nobody ever said a thing about it,\u201d she said. \u201cThink about the number of women who put their husbands through school, and the wife is a self-sacrificing role model.\u201dAlice Tripp, 67, a mother, grandmother and longtime gun lobbyist in Austin who is supporting Mr. Abbott, said the issue was about honesty, not gender.\u201cI\u2019m a gun lobbyist, a job seldom thought of as being a woman\u2019s job,\u201d she said. \u201cMy criticism of Wendy Davis has nothing to do with her gender or her age or anything. If you\u2019re going to run for politics, you have to understand you\u2019re going to be fact-checked. And you best not wander and embellish your own story.\u201dFor at least some of the fallout, Ms. Davis had herself to blame. She has been traveling the state and the country since her 11-hour filibuster at the Texas Capitol last year to block abortion restrictions, largely campaigning on her narrative of rising from a 19-year-old single mother in a trailer to a Harvard Law School graduate and a state senator. But her campaign has essentially acknowledged that she misstated certain details and omitted certain facts in her biography. For instance, she has said in interviews and in testimony in a redistricting lawsuit involving her State Senate district that she was divorced by the time she was 19 and lived as a single mother in a trailer. Her campaign has since clarified that while she separated at 19 and lived in the trailer with her daughter, she filed for divorce at 20 and the divorce became final when she was 21.Nor had she focused on the role of her second husband, Jeff Davis, whom she divorced after a nearly 17-year marriage. He told The Dallas Morning News that she left him the day after the final payment was made on the loan for Harvard. She has denied the claim. The Dallas newspaper also said he had won custody of their two children. Her campaign said the couple had joint custody. In a letter released Tuesday, Ms. Davis\u2019s daughters, who were 2 and 8 when Ms. Davis entered Harvard, issued full-throated defenses of her, saying that she was always a presence in their lives, even when away at law school, and that they had initially gone to Boston with her.Amber Davis, 31, called the criticism of her mother \u201cludicrous.\u201d Dru Davis, 25, wrote: \u201cI can tell you that my mom was a remarkable mother and continues to be so to this day. She was there on my first day of school and my last, and so many days in between. She never missed a school performance or a parent-teacher conference. Even if that meant she had to miss something else important.\u201dThe issue has produced a freewheeling debate on social media and cable television that sometimes followed familiar partisan lines and sometimes crossed them. A blog post by Ms. Palin, a daughter of the 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, whose teenage pregnancy became a social media moment of its own during the Republican convention, criticized Ms. Davis\u2019s parenting history and compared Ms. Davis unfavorably to her mother.\u201cGosh, children are sooo inconvenient, huh?\u201d Ms. Palin wrote. \u201cI\u2019m glad my mother didn\u2019t put motherhood on the shelf when she was elected to City Council, then became our mayor, then governor.\u201dIn a speech on Tuesday, Ms. Davis, who is 50, said the controversy was a result of political attacks by Republicans.\u201cThese false attacks say more about my opponent\u2019s character than they do about me,\u201d she said before a crowd of supporters at a dinner sponsored by the Travis County Democratic Party. She added: \u201cFor those who have mangled the story of my life, either carelessly or purposely, know this. I never gave up custody of my children, I never lost custody of my children, and to say otherwise is an absolute lie.\u201dSome Republicans agreed that the issue reflected a double standard for female candidates.When Sarah Palin, then the governor of Alaska, was chosen as the Republican candidate for vice president, Ms. Conway said she remembered that commentators immediately began asking why she would accept the nomination with five children, including a baby with Down syndrome. \u201cIf female voters conclude that a woman politician was a physically absent mother, they usually stop listening to the rest of your platform,\u201d Ms. Conway said. \u201cThat\u2019s a bridge too far. Your foremost responsibility is as a mother.\u201d\u201cOn the one hand, people are embracing more flexible views of gender; they\u2019re much more open to flexible working and family arrangements,\u201d Mr. Wilcox said. \u201cBut at the same time, there is a more residual, traditional orientation that suggests that moms are the primary caretakers. And most married moms would prefer to work part time or in the home. In a way that might color their view of the situation.\u201dThe impact the debate will have on her campaign is uncertain. But some say it is a reminder that for all the changes in gender roles in American life, much remains unchanged.

{"Headline": "NASA Extends the Life of the International Space Station", "Date": "2014-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInstead of splashing into the Pacific Ocean in 2020 as planned, the International Space Station will continue circling Earth for at least an additional four years, NASA announced on Wednesday.William H. Gerstenmaier, NASA\u2019s associate administrator for human exploration and operations, said the extra time would lead more scientists to propose experiments, spur a young commercial space industry and allow the space agency to solve health and technical challenges before sending its astronauts on more distant missions.If the station were destined for destruction just six years from now, scientists and companies would be more reluctant to invest their time and money, Mr. Gerstenmaier said. \u201cPotentially, that creates a new economy in space,\u201d he said.Two companies, SpaceX and the Orbital Sciences Corporation, fly cargo to the space station, and NASA is looking to hire commercial \u201cspace taxis\u201d to take astronauts beginning in 2017. Mr. Gerstenmaier said he thought that more companies would now also look at how they could take advantage of the weightlessness of space for profit.Last year, NASA studied the station and concluded that it could last until 2028. The other space agencies participating in it, including the European Space Agency and those of Russia and Japan, have not decided whether they, too, will continue beyond 2020. \u00a0\u201cIn general, they\u2019re all pretty supportive,\u201d Mr. Gerstenmaier said, adding that if necessary, NASA would go it alone.When President Obama entered the White House, NASA was working to send astronauts back to the moon, and the space station, which was still being built, was to be nudged to a fiery ocean crash in 2016. The cost of operating the station, about $3 billion a year, could then be devoted to the moon program.However, it always seemed unlikely that the station, which was built at a cost of $100 billion and completed just three years ago, would be discarded that soon, and when the Obama administration announced it wanted to cancel the moon program, it gave the first extension, stretching the life of the station to 2020.Mr. Gerstenmaier said that unexpected challenges would still pop up at the station. \u201cThis is going to be life on the frontier,\u201d he said. Last month, a valve in a cooling pump failed, curtailing work on the station until astronauts installed a spare pump, an incident that illustrated the need for more reliable systems for deep space missions.\u201cIf I\u2019m going to go beyond low-Earth orbit, I have a lot of work that I still need to do,\u201d Mr. Gerstenmaier said. \u201cI need to understand how the human performs in spaceflight. How can I make sure I have a pump system for a three-year or two-year trip to Mars and back?\u201dA cargo rocket that was to be launched to the space station on Wednesday by Orbital Sciences was delayed until at least Thursday, because of an explosion on the sun and the torrent of charged particles that could have interfered with the spacecraft\u2019s electronics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Incredible Shrinking Presidency", "Date": "2014-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was hard to watch President Obama during Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address and not see a man who has had his coat trimmed and his ambitions adjusted.He touted his accomplishments, as he should have, but in laying out the parameters of his \u201cyear of action\u201d he outlined goals that didn\u2019t ask America to dream as much as adjust to the paralysis, abandoning big moves for smaller ones.So, the president pledged Tuesday that he would work with Congress where he could, but would move forward without Congress if necessary, saying, \u201cWherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201dHis plans were noble enough, and they were poll-friendly \u2014 raising the minimum wage, working for universal high-quality pre-K, equal pay for women, a new \u201cMyRA\u201d retirement savings plan \u2014 but they are not nearly large enough proposals to solve our most intractable problems.There was only one line devoted to fixing our \u201cupside-down tax code\u201d for individuals, and that was in reference to the retirement account. Gone were the appeals to get Congress to have the wealthy pay their fair share.Last year, the president put it this way:\u201cWe can\u2019t ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful.\u201dHe continued:\u201cMost Americans \u2014 Democrats, Republicans and independents \u2014 understand that we can\u2019t just cut our way to prosperity. They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue, and with everybody doing their fair share.\u201dLast year, on the issue of new gun control legislation, the president said:\u201cIt has been two months since Newtown. I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence. But this time is different. Overwhelming majorities of Americans \u2014 Americans who believe in the Second Amendment \u2014 have come together around common-sense reform, like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun.\u201dThis year, he mentioned gun violence only once, saying:\u201cCitizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day.\u201dThe only big proposal that even has a chance this year is comprehensive immigration reform, and its prospects are far from certain.Last year, the president spoke extensively about passing immigration reform, repeating, \u201cNow is the time to do it. Now is the time to get it done. Now is the time to get it done.\u201d He spoke about stronger border security, a pathway to citizenship and decreasing waiting times for highly skilled immigrants.This year, he spoke of immigration in a single passage, with no specifics other than to cite this: \u201cIndependent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades.\u201dThe president seems to have been reduced by the resistance. He seems to be concentrating on what can be done rather than on what should be done. This is a rational reaction, I suppose, to irrational opposition, but nonetheless it\u2019s a sad indictment of our politics.The president has had failures and missteps, to be sure. Every administration has some. None are perfect. But the idea of grinding government to a halt in opposition to one leader \u2014 as Republicans have done \u2014 has been an extraordinary and infuriating thing to behold.And it has been sad to watch a president full of hope and promise be stymied at nearly every turn and have to reframe his objectives.\u201cAnd I think America was very lucky that Abraham Lincoln was President when he was President. If he hadn\u2019t been, the course of history would be very different. But I also think that, despite being the greatest President, in my mind, in our history, it took another hundred and fifty years before African-Americans had anything approaching formal equality, much less real equality. I think that doesn\u2019t diminish Lincoln\u2019s achievements, but it acknowledges that at the end of the day we\u2019re part of a long-running story. We just try to get our paragraph right.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Prices Rise Again, but the Pace Could Slow", "Date": "2013-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It was a great year for the stock market. And it was also a pretty good year for many people\u2019s biggest investment: their homes.In 2013\u2019s last glimpse at the housing market, figures released on Tuesday showed that home prices in major metro areas kept rising in October. Year-over-year, prices were up 13.6 percent, the biggest gain in more than seven years.After plummeting during the housing bust, prices have increased steadily since the spring of 2012. Prices in 20 major American metro areas increased a modest 0.2 percent between September and October, without seasonal adjustment, evidence that the quick rebound in prices is slowing, according to the closely watched S&P/Case-Shiller data. Higher mortgage rates might continue to slow the pace of improvement going forward, analysts say.Nationally, the increase in home prices is moderating, the S&P/Case-Shiller analysis said. Prices decreased in nine metro areas between September and October, including Denver, Chicago and Washington, whereas just one saw price decreases between August and September.\u201cThe key economic question facing housing is the Fed\u2019s future course to scale back quantitative easing and how this will affect mortgage rates,\u201d Mr. Blitzer said. \u201cOther housing data paint a mixed picture suggesting that we may be close to the peak gains in prices.\u201d He added: \u201cMost forecasts for home prices point to single-digit growth in 2014.\u201dIn many metro areas where prices declined sharply \u2014 particularly those encompassing Sun Belt and Rust Belt cities like Phoenix, Las Vegas and Detroit \u2014 similarly sharp rebounds followed. But generally, prices have not touched their pre-bust heights, with prices across the country remaining about 20 percent lower, the S&P/Case-Shiller data show. In Dallas and Denver, however, prices have hit new peaks, the report said.Many economists expect price increases to moderate next year, with higher prices and higher mortgage costs making homes less affordable, even though the labor market recovery might pick up some steam and inventory might increase in some areas.In December, the Fed said that improving economic conditions warranted the central bank starting to ease up on its stimulus efforts. The Fed said it would cut its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to $75 billion a month from $85 billion a month.\u201cEven after this reduction, we will be still expanding our holdings of longer-term securities at a rapid pace,\u201d Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said at a December news conference, his last before Janet L. Yellen takes over, pending Senate confirmation. \u201cOur sizable and still-increasing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and make financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote further progress in the labor market.\u201dBut mortgage rates have risen, and the pace of sales has slowed in many metro areas. According to the National Association of Realtors, a trade organization, existing-home sales dropped 4.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.9 million in November. New-home sales dropped 2.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 464,000, the Census Bureau said.In some areas, limited housing supply has pushed prices high. \u201cHome sales are hurt by higher mortgage interest rates, constrained inventory and continuing tight credit,\u201d said Lawrence Yun of the National Association of Realtors, in an analysis. \u201cThere is a pent-up demand for both rental and owner-occupied housing as household formation will inevitably burst out, but the bottleneck is in limited housing supply, due to the slow recovery in new home construction.\u201dMany economists do expect jobs and income growth to improve, and to have a resulting effect on housing. \u201cWe expect that the improving employment picture next year will be accompanied by a sustained increase in interest rates, which in turn will roll over into the mortgage market,\u201d said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae. He said the housing recovery might continue on a \u201cmodest upward trend.\u201dIn the S&P/Case-Shiller report, a survey of 10 major metro areas, as well as a broader survey of 20 major metro areas, showed year-on-year price increases of about 13.6 percent in October, the biggest such rise since early 2006.Economists have said foreclosures and short sales are making up a smaller proportion of sales, making housing price gains look larger, since those homes can trade at steep discounts.Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about recovery trends in the housing market described the National Association of Realtors incorrectly. It is a trade group \u2014 not \u201ca government-backed mortgage finance company,\u201d such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.Advertisement"}

Extreme inequality, it turns out, creates a class of people who are alarmingly detached from reality \u2014 and simultaneously gives these people great power.And there are a number of other plutocrats who manage to keep Hitler out of their remarks but who nonetheless hold, and loudly express, political and economic views that combine paranoia and megalomania in equal measure.But every group finds itself facing criticism, and ends up on the losing side of policy disputes, somewhere along the way; that\u2019s democracy. The question is what happens next. Normal people take it in stride; even if they\u2019re angry and bitter over political setbacks, they don\u2019t cry persecution, compare their critics to Nazis and insist that the world revolves around their hurt feelings. But the rich are different from you and me.And yes, that\u2019s partly because they have more money, and the power that goes with it. They can and all too often do surround themselves with courtiers who tell them what they want to hear and never, ever, tell them they\u2019re being foolish. They\u2019re accustomed to being treated with deference, not just by the people they hire but by politicians who want their campaign contributions. And so they are shocked to discover that money can\u2019t buy everything, can\u2019t insulate them from all adversity.I also suspect that today\u2019s Masters of the Universe are insecure about the nature of their success. We\u2019re not talking captains of industry here, men who make stuff. We are, instead, talking about wheeler-dealers, men who push money around and get rich by skimming some off the top as it sloshes by. They may boast that they are job creators, the people who make the economy work, but are they really adding value? Many of us doubt it \u2014 and so, I suspect, do some of the wealthy themselves, a form of self-doubt that causes them to lash out even more furiously at their critics.President Obama has not, unfortunately, done nearly as much as F.D.R. to earn the hatred of the undeserving rich. But he has done more than many progressives give him credit for \u2014 and like F.D.R., both he and progressives in general should welcome that hatred, because it\u2019s a sign that they\u2019re doing something right.

{"Headline": "Democracy in Peril in Asia", "Date": "2014-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialStreet protests in three Asian countries \u2014 Cambodia, Bangladesh and Thailand \u2014 are a vivid reminder of the fragile state of democracy in many developing countries, particularly those that do not have independent judiciaries and professional police forces and militaries.While the immediate causes for the turmoil are different in each country, they share several shortcomings. The lack of sufficient democratic checks and balances in all three countries has undermined faith in elections and helped to create the conditions for civil unrest. Autocratic and corrupt political leaders have used government agencies, in some cases over decades, to serve themselves and their cronies. In Cambodia, in recent days, military police officers have opened fire on protesters, killing several people. The protests started after Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia through intimidation and violence for nearly three decades, was declared the winner of an election in July that international monitoring organizations say was riddled with irregularities. Workers in the country\u2019s clothing factories also joined the protests to demand that the government set the minimum wage for the industry at $160 a month; the government has offered to raise the minimum to $100 a month, up from $80 now. While the economy has grown fast in recent years, lifting up living standards, about one-fifth of the country\u2019s population lives below the country\u2019s poverty line.In Bangladesh, the current prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, and her party won an election held on Sunday because the main opposition party boycotted it. In the weeks leading up to the vote, more than 100 people were killed in political violence as the opposition Bangladesh National Party protested Ms. Hasina\u2019s refusal to appoint a neutral caretaker government to oversee the vote. Ms. Hasina and the opposition leader Khaleda Zia have taken turns running the country since 1991. While Bangladesh has made significant progress in reducing poverty and improving public health, Ms. Hasina and Ms. Zia have often sacrificed the country\u2019s stability to settle scores with each other and have done little to strengthen institutions like the judiciary and the police.In Thailand, the country\u2019s Election Commission said on Friday that elections scheduled for next month would go ahead despite efforts by protesters to sabotage them. Led by opposition politicians, the protesters want to replace the country\u2019s elected government with an appointed council of technocrats because they have been unable to win elections against the party of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. There are no easy or quick solutions to the crisis in these three nations. While elections are vital, they are not sufficient to create stable democracies. Until these countries build institutions capable of serving as a check on political leaders, they will remain vulnerable to civil unrest. Advertisement"}

On the line was Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s first deputy commissioner for consumer affairs, looking for insight and advice on carrying out New York City\u2019s proposed paid sick-day law.Her staff hammered out the rules and regulations governing San Francisco\u2019s new ordinance and consulted extensively with anxious business owners who feared that the cost of providing paid leave would threaten their bottom line.Her message to the de Blasio administration? \u201cWe know that this can work,\u201d Ms. Levitt said.The measure, which is likely to be approved by the City Council, would go into effect in April, leaving some small-business owners worried and uncertain. The good news, though, is that there are lessons to be learned from a look beyond New York City\u2019s borders.Already, four municipalities and the State of Connecticut have implemented paid sick-leave laws. Assessments of the programs in San Francisco, Washington and Seattle \u2014 the cities whose plans most closely resemble New York\u2019s \u2014 indicate that the new policies have taken effect without harming local economies, touching off an exodus of businesses or being abused by workers.Mr. Lazarus said that most companies who instituted new sick-leave policies in response to the law handled sick days informally, with one worker covering for another, instead of hiring replacement labor, which has reduced costs.\u201cBy and large, this has not been an employer issue,\u201d Mr. Lazarus said. \u201cSan Francisco\u2019s economy is booming.\u201dIn Washington, where all businesses have been required to pay for sick days since 2008, the city auditor surveyed 800 businesses and found that 88 percent of respondents said the requirement would not cause them to leave the city.About 11 percent said they increased prices as a result of the new law. The survey was conducted in 2009, two years after the ordinance went into effect.On the flip side, the research group emphasized, workers in San Francisco typically took fewer than half the sick days they were eligible for. And a vast majority of employers, who supported the new law, did not report any negative impact on profitability.Who knows, he says, how it will play out here?\u201cWe are in the beginning of the sixth year of the weakest recovery on record,\u201d Mr. Peltz said. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult environment to absorb new costs. That makes any new mandate difficult to handle.\u201dNew York officials say they plan to follow Seattle\u2019s and San Francisco\u2019s lead, emphasizing efforts to reassure, educate and involve the business community.\u201cInitially there were a lot of complaints and concerns,\u201d Ms. Levitt said. \u201cWe don\u2019t hear those anymore.\u201dEmail: swarns@nytimes.com \nTwitter: @rachelswarns Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Diminished State of the Union", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialEvery winter since 2009, President Obama has stood at the podium of the House and pleaded for the cooperation of Congress. For the last three State of the Union speeches, he has largely been ignored. That has left a growing trail of unfinished business: background checks for gun buyers, immigration reform, a higher minimum wage, tax fairness, universal preschool.This year was different. Mr. Obama\u2019s speech on Tuesday night acknowledged the obvious: Congress has become a dead end for most of the big, muscular uses of government to redress income inequality and improve the economy for all, because of implacable Republican opposition. As a result, the remainder of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency will be largely devoted to a series of smaller actions that the White House can perform on its own.\u201cAmerica does not stand still, and neither will I,\u201d he said. \u201cSo wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201dBut he left out an executive ban on discrimination by contractors against employees based on sexual orientation and gender identity. That would have made a strong statement about fairness in spending taxpayer money. He could also have prohibited contractors from retaliating against employees who disclose or seek salary information, which would help women know when they are being paid less.The only way to truly affect the economy on a mass scale, and to make a difference for tens of millions of people instead of a few hundred thousand, is to persuade Congress to go along on the major initiatives the president was forced to repeat in his remarks, such as extending jobless benefits, creating high-quality preschool for all 4-year-olds, and especially raising the minimum wage.\u201cThis will help families,\u201d he said of the wage. \u201cIt will give businesses customers with more money to spend. It doesn\u2019t involve any new bureaucratic program. So join the rest of the country. Say yes. Give America a raise.\u201dPushing for a vote would reveal whether Republicans are so opposed to anything Mr. Obama wants that they would reject their own ideas.

{"Headline": "Investors Still Wary of Efforts to Shore Up Currencies", "Date": "2014-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Emergency measures by Turkey and South Africa to stop a headlong flight of foreign investors had little effect on Wednesday. The financial markets all but ignored increases in official interest rates aimed at strengthening the countries\u2019 currencies.Russia\u2019s ruble was also affected by the currency plunge in emerging markets, while the Argentine peso continued its plummet.Major indexes in Europe slipped Wednesday, with modest declines of less than 1 percent. American markets opened lower and then dropped lower in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve announced it would continue to scale back its bond-buying program.The Turkish lira initially rose Wednesday morning after the country\u2019s central bank announced overnight that it was increasing the rate for one-week loans to banks to 10 percent, more than doubling the rate from its previous level of 4.5 percent. The move was an attempt to slow inflation, restore the central bank\u2019s reputation, and increase demand for lira by offering investors a better return.But Turkey\u2019s move did not seem to calm investors on Wednesday, and appeared to risk causing collateral damage to the rest of its economy.By afternoon, the Turkish currency had given up the gains and at one point fell close to its low of 43 cents \u2014 the price in dollars to purchase one lira. The higher rates also threatened to stifle economic growth by substantially raising the cost of borrowing money.\u201cThe central bank is doing whatever it can to control the fluctuation; however, the Turkish economy is not strong enough to absorb any global instability,\u201d said Oya Karaca, manager at Tolga Currency Exchange in Istanbul. The weakness of the lira \u201creflects on all aspects of daily life and is not good for people,\u201d he said.Similar but much subtler action by the South African central bank, which on Wednesday increased its benchmark interest rate to 5.5. percent from 5 percent, also failed to prevent a decline in the country\u2019s currency. Some analysts said the rate increase in South Africa was intended more to control inflation than to underpin its currency, the rand, which fell 1.7 percent against the dollar Wednesday to a level close to a five-year low.In a statement on Wednesday, Gill Marcus, governor of the South African Reserve Bank, summed up the forces buffeting developing countries. In addition to depreciating currencies and capital flight, she said, growth is slowing and inflation is rising. Countries suffer from trade deficits and budget deficits, as well as sinking confidence. \u201cWe are now entering a phase of the crisis that is creating new challenges for emerging market economies,\u201d Ms. Marcus said.The Russian ruble was also hurt by a broad plunge in the value of currencies of emerging markets. The ruble fell 1 percent against the dollar, to its lowest point since February 2009. Investors were particularly harsh on countries that they regard as poorly governed, including Russia and Argentina, and countries that have been rocked by public protests, like Ukraine and Thailand.Anshu Jain, co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank, the world\u2019s largest currency trader, said Wednesday that markets were likely to remain unsettled for some time, but that the effects were manageable.\u201cNo doubt there has been a great deal of volatility during the last quarter,\u201d Mr. Jain said at a news conference in Frankfurt. \u201cOur own situation is very orderly.\u201dBut some analysts warned that declines in emerging market currencies could affect the United States, Europe and Japan. Developing countries, until recently the engines of global growth, will not have the same purchasing power and may buy fewer exports, said Julian Callow, an economist at Barclays.\u201cThe direct effects of the recent emerging market foreign exchange turbulence, if contained, are not likely to prove substantial\u201d for growth in the United States, Europe and Japan, Mr. Callow said in a note to clients. \u201cHowever, at the same time, the implications are not negligible either, especially for the euro area,\u201d he said, because of Europe\u2019s greater dependence on exports to developing countries.The quandary that policy makers in emerging markets face is that they cannot raise interest rates without endangering economic growth. The policy moves are not convincing, because currency investors do not believe the central banks will be able to keep rates high for long, said Klaus Bauknecht, an analyst at IKB Deutsche Industriebank in D\u00fcsseldorf.\u201cI can\u2019t think of one case in emerging markets where a hike in interest rates has succeeded,\u201d Mr. Bauknecht said. During previous crises in Asian countries and Russia, he said, \u201cEveryone knew those rates were not credible because they would kill the economy, and will have to loosen.\u201dThe flight of foreign capital, which is a primary reason for the currency declines, is a result of investors\u2019 putting money back into developed countries as their economies improve \u2014 and as the United States central bank pulls back on its stimulus. The Fed\u2019s moves are expected to eventually raise market interest rates in the United States and other Western economies.Global investors are anticipating better returns on their money in the United States and Europe, which are seen as less risky than places like Russia. And investors are singling out countries like Turkey that are perceived to be economically weak and politically tumultuous.Analysts said Turkey provided a study in what happens when a central bank squanders its credibility. The rate increase by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey was much bigger than analysts had expected. But investors said they continued to believe that the bank is subject to meddling by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has been outspoken in his opposition to higher interest rates.While technocrats at the central bank \u201cwere able to win the argument this time around,\u201d Naz Masraff, an analyst at the political consultancy Eurasia Group, said in a note to clients, \u201cthe future course of currency and monetary policy remains uncertain.\u201dWith Turkey already ensnarled by a political crisis, the plunge in its currency has raised the price of imported goods like food and oil, and helped push inflation to 7.4 percent, according to official figures. Many businesses are already feeling the pain.\u201cWe\u2019ve been in crisis for the last two years, but the political crisis in December came as the final blow,\u201d said Nilgun Aksa, owner of Smile Advertisement Company, a television production house in Istanbul. She was referring to an extensive graft probe against the government, which led Mr. Erdogan to conduct a purge of the judiciary and the police force. Firing so many people in the legal system was seen as a government effort to derail the corruption investigation and was part of what some say is Mr. Erdogan\u2019s steady creep toward authoritarianism.\u201cWe have been sitting empty-handed at the office for months now, when we should be shooting an average of 40 commercials in a month,\u201d Ms. Aksa said. She has had to lay off 12 of her 14 employees, and said she expected the situation to get worse.Mr. Bauknecht, the analyst in D\u00fcsseldorf, said he thought the decline in the Turkish lira was out of line with the country\u2019s economic fundamentals and that the currency would recover. But it could take months or a year for the rebound to come, he said.\u201cThe markets will continue to be nervous,\u201d he said, \u201cuntil there is some stabilization of the internal situation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuban Vendors, in Rare Move, Stage a Protest", "Date": "2014-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 In a rare demonstration of public dissent, dozens of Cuban artisans and vendors protested in the city of Holgu\u00edn this week, marching to local government offices and demanding the right to work without government harassment, witnesses said.The march \u2014 which took place on Tuesday in a provincial capital just an hour or so from Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s childhood home \u2014 was a surprising and spontaneous response to a crackdown earlier in the day at a local market, residents said. Inspectors enforcing rules prohibiting the self-employed from selling products that are either imported or possibly pilfered from government shops confiscated a variety of items from several sellers, prompting them and many others to take to the streets.Some residents said in telephone interviews that the protest involved just a smattering of people who were lawbreakers with invalid complaints. Others, especially those who identified themselves as government opponents, said there were 100 to 150 protesters, whom they described as brave and justifiably angry.\u201cThe government revoked their licenses and took away their resources, their work,\u201d said one local dissident who declined to be named for fear of reprisals. He added that several protesters were beaten when confronted by the authorities, and that at least three people were detained and then released. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most important things to have happened in Cuba in 54 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a protest by workers; it wasn\u2019t dissidents. We support them, but we didn\u2019t do this.\u201dBut even pro-government residents in Holgu\u00edn \u2014 including a taxi driver and an employee at a hospital near the market \u2014 acknowledged that the protest occurred and was led by people licensed to work for themselves as part of Cuba\u2019s limited effort to encourage private employment.Ted Henken, a professor at Baruch College and president of the Association for the Study of the Cuban Economy, said that any worker revolt in Cuba, however small, reflects frustration with Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s attempt to improve the nation\u2019s communist economy through calculated, cautious economic openings. Though around 445,000 Cubans now legally work for themselves, according to government figures, growth among the self-employed has plateaued and complaints about stricter enforcement have been growing for months.\u201cIt\u2019s been so far fairly easy for the government to dismiss or defame most dissidents given their small number and total lack of exposure in the mass media,\u201d Mr. Henken said. \u201cIt will be much harder to control and contain everyday citizens who are protesting not about the lack of political freedoms but over their rising frustration at the on-again-off-again pace of Ra\u00fal\u2019s so-called economic reforms.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even as Wages Rise, China Exports Grow ", "Date": "2014-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Cheng Chunmeng, the general manager of a manufacturer of colorful children\u2019s chairs in east-central China, gave his workers a 30 percent raise last year to keep them from leaving. His labor costs are rising even faster in dollar terms, as the Chinese currency slowly climbs against the United States dollar.Yet Mr. Cheng, like many Chinese exporters, enjoys growing sales to the United States. \u201cI saw a remarkable increase in orders from the United States starting in March, and getting better and better since then,\u201d Mr. Cheng said. \u201cI feel 2014 will be an even better year.\u201dExport gains like Mr. Cheng\u2019s suggest that despite years of predictions of trouble for China\u2019s export juggernaut, it has not yet been derailed by fast-rising costs for blue-collar labor, by an appreciating Chinese currency or by foreign investment shifts toward other, lower-wage Asian countries.China announced on Friday morning its largest annual trade surplus in dollar terms since 2008, as the surplus widened another 12.8 percent compared with 2012, reaching $259.75 billion. China has kept its export machine running even while wages rise. Blue-collar pay has soared between fivefold and ninefold in dollar terms in the last decade, wrecking China\u2019s reputation as a low-wage place for export-oriented manufacturing. Rocketing wages and benefits reflect an acute shortage of manufacturing labor, as a younger generation goes to college instead of heading for factories and as rural China has mostly run out of young adults to send to the cities.China\u2019s exports, while growing more slowly than a few years ago, are still far from stalling despite the disappearance of its advantage in labor costs. Chinese exporters say they have been able to keep prices low and retain overseas customers because factories are becoming more productive. Much of the manufacturing has stayed in China because the highly developed supply chains leading to and from the factories remain among the best in the world.\u201cWe haven\u2019t started thinking of moving to another country,\u201d said Xiang Wenwei, the sales director of the China Mybaby Group, a 3,000-employee manufacturer of baby strollers in Ningbo that makes and assembles all of its major components. It relies on a dense web of suppliers near the factory for everything from raw materials to factory equipment maintenance.The trade gains for China are magnified because over the last several years many companies have shifted the production of components from high-wage Asian countries like Japan and South Korea to China itself. So China is producing more of the value in each product, and not just doing the final assembly of products produced elsewhere.China has begun to account for more than half the American trade deficit in some months, including last November, partly because of rising production of shale gas and shale oil that has reduced America\u2019s need to import energy. China was only a quarter to a third of the American deficit before the global financial crisis began in 2008. As the American economy continues to improve, economists predict that Americans will import even more from China.\u201cThe pickup in China\u2019s trade surpluses could lead to rising trade tensions if they are perceived as holding back job growth in the U.S. and dampening the economic recovery,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a Brookings Institution economist specializing in China.The gradual recovery in demand in the United States and Europe is being partly absorbed by Chinese exporters instead of stimulating longer hours and further investment at factories closer to home. The unexpected strength in China\u2019s export sector has weakened the West\u2019s economic recovery and retarded job creation in the United States and Europe.Asked this week for their view on China\u2019s trade surpluses, United States Treasury officials reiterated their opinion that the renminbi, China\u2019s currency, remains significantly undervalued, which China denies, and said that rebalancing the Chinese economy remained incomplete. The composition of the American trade deficit with China is also shifting in ways that could affect employment in the United States, according to the latest American data, released on Tuesday. The American deficit is increasingly in goods classified by the United States Commerce Department as advanced technology products, notably consumer electronics, while starting to shrink in categories of lower value like shoes.Chinese leaders and some economists have contended for years that a decline in China\u2019s export competitiveness is imminent, but their country has continued to post trade surpluses. They have used their predictions of slowing exports to justify resistance to pressure from Washington for faster appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar. The renminbi rose only 3.1 percent against the dollar last year, and weakened 1.2 percent against the euro.The question is how much longer China can remain the dominant exporter. Many economists still predict trouble ahead for Chinese exporters. \u201cEven if there is an increase in the trade surplus, this is temporary,\u201d said Diana Choyleva, a China specialist who is the head of macroeconomic research at Lombard Street Research in London.She noted that when calculated in renminbi and adjusted for inflation, China\u2019s exports actually fell in some months last summer, although they have strengthened considerably since last October. China\u2019s trade surplus is also less than half as large as a share of national economic output compared with five years ago when the surplus was slightly larger in dollar terms. The Chinese economy has grown nearly 80 percent in nominal renminbi terms since then and doubled in dollar terms.Export figures for China were exaggerated by a few percentage points early last year as exporters overstated their shipments to circumvent Chinese controls on moving money into the country to speculate on further appreciation of the renminbi. But while some overstating of shipments may still take place, the strength in exports in recent months appears more genuine, particularly compared to an artificially high base of exports a year ago, said Louis Kuijs, a China economist in the Hong Kong office of the Royal Bank of Scotland.\u201cI have much more faith in the veracity of the numbers now,\u201d he said.In separate interviews this week with nearly a dozen Chinese exporters, at Hong Kong trade fairs or by telephone, all said that their biggest problem lay in labor: finding enough blue-collar workers and paying for their soaring wages.Mr. Cheng said that a decade ago he paid about $75 a month for entry-level industrial workers and provided virtually no benefits. Now, he said, his 200-worker business, the Hangzhou Luyi Arts & Crafts Company, pays $570 a month plus $100 a month in government-mandated benefits.That works out to compensation roughly three times as high as in Indonesia, four times as high as in Vietnam, five times as high as in Cambodia, and as much as 10 times as high as in Bangladesh. But all of those countries have other problems, such as overburdened, unreliable electricity grids, which force companies to install costly generators and buy expensive diesel instead.Like many companies in China, Hangzhou Luyi has responded to surging wages with increased investments in automation. \u201cThis machine takes the place of five workers,\u201d Mr. Cheng said, sitting in a booth at a Hong Kong trade fair this week and pointing at a poster on his wall of a computer-controlled, die-cutting machine for producing chair components.Similar investments at factories across China mean that fewer hours of labor typically go into each product. So labor costs per unit do not rise nearly as quickly as wages.Extremely heavy investment in new factories and new equipment, as the state-owned banking system continues to pump out credit at a remarkable pace, has also created considerable overcapacity. Exporters are unable to raise prices without losing overseas markets to nearby rivals. This prompts managers like Chen Yaping, executive director of the Zhejiang Daseng Stationery Company, a toymaker in Yiwu City, to focus increasingly on research and developing their own brands.Foreign investment in China has stagnated while surging in Southeast Asian rivals like Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam, setting off hand-wringing in Chinese media. But China still invests heavily in China. Domestic investment dwarfs foreign investment elsewhere in the region, leaving Chinese entrepreneurs and state-owned enterprises with more than enough cash to keep buying machinery.A result of rising productivity and manufacturing overcapacity is that average prices for American imports from China have actually dropped 0.9 percent in the last year even as the renminbi has risen and Chinese wages have soared, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington. That decline in prices has kept the pressure on Western competitors \u2014 and kept Chinese exports buoyant.Hilda Wang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Urges Germany to Do More on Banks and Economy", "Date": "2014-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Jacob J. Lew, the U.S. Treasury secretary, urged Germany and its European partners on Wednesday to take even bolder steps in terms of banking reform, as his German counterpart, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, defended the complicated and still incomplete blueprint agreed to by European finance ministers in December.Mr. Lew\u2019s American avuncular finger-wagging \u2014 a time-honored tradition of touring U.S. Treasury secretaries \u2014 came as European Union lawmakers themselves were at odds with Berlin over the plans approved last month for overseeing and financing a system meant to deal with troubled banks in the euro zone.Mr. Lew, in a news conference here with Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, gave the Europeans credit for making \u201csignificant progress\u201d with that agreement. But he stressed that beyond salvaging damaged banks, Washington would like Europe to head off trouble by requiring \u201cbackstops,\u201d higher capital reserves for banks that would enable them to better withstand crises.\u201cIt is important to have backstops in place,\u201d Mr. Lew said before he departed for Portugal, where he was to meet later on Wednesday with Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho.\u201cWe make no secret that we think that more is better,\u201d Mr. Lew said. \u201cWe strive to do better and encourage our friends to do what would most protect the German and European economies in a crisis.\u201dMr. Lew, who began his brief European tour with a stop in Paris on Tuesday for talks with the French finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, also emphasized to Mr. Sch\u00e4uble Washington\u2019s belief that Germany needed to do more to increase domestic spending to help address a trade imbalance in which the country exports much more than it takes in from its European neighbors.\u201cWe continue to believe that policies that would promote more domestic investment and demand would be good for the German economy and the global economy,\u201d Mr. Lew said in Berlin.Criticism of the export-heavy German economic model from a United States Treasury report released in October outraged many in Germany, who take pride in their record exports as a reflection of their competitive industrial sector and highly skilled work force. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble argued on Wednesday that the German numbers must be viewed in the wider European context.\u201cWe are doing our part for a balanced situation\u201d in Europe, he said. If it were not for Germany\u2019s trade surplus with countries beyond the euro zone, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said, the euro zone would have an overall trade deficit.At the same time Mr. Sch\u00e4uble acknowledged that more effort was needed to boost domestic spending in Germany. He said that a proposed national minimum wage and investment in infrastructure agreed to by the new government of Chancellor Angela Merkel would be important steps to this end.Data released on Wednesday by Germany\u2019s Federal Statistical Office showed that exports increased by 0.3 percent in November to 93.2 billion euros, or $126.4 billion, when adjusted for seasonal and calendar factors. Imports were down 1.1 percent, to 75.4 billion euros, for the same period, the data showed.But this week, the front-burner dispute between Germany and most of the rest of the European Union involves the system for winding down weak banks. The agreement hashed out by finance ministers in Brussels last month was widely seen as a set of compromises. And resumption of the debate indicates that differences with European lawmakers remain and could prove difficult to bridge.Germany has largely resisted committing taxpayer money to bail out banks in other countries in the Union. And it has made no secret of its desire to see changes to the treaty that governs the 28-member bloc to ensure that handing over authority on the banking issue to a European-level administrator would be legally watertight against attempts to challenge it in Germany\u2019s powerful Constitutional Court.A 55-billion-euro resolution fund that could be tapped to unwind failed banks, which European Union ministers agreed to as part of the December deal, has come under fire as too small to be effective. But Berlin has defended its size, arguing that the first costs should be borne by shareholders.Mr. Sch\u00e4uble pointedly noted in Wednesday\u2019s news conference that he had explained the details of the European agreement to Mr. Lew, noting that to create a mechanism for 28 countries would require a different structure than for an individual country like the United States.Members of the European Parliament, whose backing would also be required for the December banking deal, began debating the issue in Brussels on Wednesday. They are eager to reach an agreement before Europeans elect new representatives for the Parliament in May.Martin Schultz, the Parliament\u2019s president, who hails from Germany, said in Brussels on Tuesday that the European lawmakers\u2019 position was \u201cfar apart\u201d from the deal agreed to by the finance ministers, the German news agency DPA reported. A key sticking point involves the treaty change insisted upon by the Germans, to be drawn up among the 28 European Union countries to set up financing arrangements. Such a process would bypass the European Parliament, by leaving the decision making to the individual member states.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Delicate Balance for the Turnaround Chief of ThyssenKrupp", "Date": "2014-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the company, one of the largest steel makers in Europe, has continued to suffer steep losses \u2014 about 6.6 billion euros ($9 billion) in the last two years \u2014 and it remains entangled in scandals. Now, it faces an erosion of support from the Krupp Family Foundation, which has been the company\u2019s controlling shareholder since the late 1990s.The decisions Mr. Hiesinger makes in the coming years will go a long way in determining the future of one of Europe\u2019s and Germany\u2019s largest and, historically, most influential businesses.But there will be limits to investors\u2019 patience. The company eliminated its dividend in December 2012 for the second year. And its stock price is down about 4 percent over the last year in a bull market.Mr. Hiesinger is making headway in the revamping. He has sold eight businesses with revenue equivalent to about 30 percent of 2012 sales of \u20ac39 billion. Mr. Hiesinger has also replaced about 70 percent of the 40 top managers and cut annual costs by \u20ac600 million. \u201cWhen you change a company like ThyssenKrupp that has been getting into a crisis for years, it will take a while until you get the company back on track and ready for the future,\u201d Mr. Hiesinger said at the company\u2019s annual news conference on Nov. 30.\u201cI felt like I was coming into a company that was 10 years behind,\u201d said the person, who spoke on the condition he not be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. \u201cIt was an old boys\u2019 network.\u201dMr. Hiesinger has also had to deal with a series of scandals. German officials are investigating ThyssenKrupp in connection with possible price-fixing on steel products supplied to the German auto industry, a crucial customer. Mr. Hiesinger warned last month that \u201csignificant adverse consequences\u201d from this investigation \u201ccannot be ruled out.\u201dIn the last two years ThyssenKrupp has paid a total of \u20ac191 million in fines to settle another case of price-fixing on supplies to the railroad industry. In the spring, Mr. Hiesinger set up an amnesty program for employees to disclose wrongdoing. The Krupp name first came to prominence as the maker of the heavy cannons that battered the French army in the Franco-Prussian War and later was a key armorer for Adolf Hitler\u2019s forces. The present company, formed by the merger of the Thyssen and Krupp steel interests in 1999, has 150,000 employees worldwide. The steel operations weigh heavily on the overall business, even though they accounted for only about 30 percent of the company\u2019s revenue last year. Mr. Hiesinger wants to reduce this volatile business even further. At the same time, he is focusing on steadier higher-tech businesses like building factories and elevators. The elevator business is a world leader with \u20ac6 billion in revenue and an estimated 15 percent global market share. He wants to trim overhead and expand in fast-growing China where the company has been a latecomer.While the results for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 represented an improvement, the company still reported a \u20ac1.5 billion loss, compared with a loss of \u20ac5 billion a year earlier.So far, Mr. Hiesinger has not found a buyer for an associated Brazilian steel plant called CSA near Rio de Janeiro. Both plants were built from scratch, part of an ill-timed $12 billion international expansion begun in 2006. The idea was to make raw steel slabs at low cost in Brazil and send them to Alabama for rolling and coating and use in the expanding auto and energy industries. But the plan went badly awry with costs rising in Brazil and demand collapsing in the United States.Mr. Hiesinger also saw the arrangement he made in 2012 to divest ThyssenKrupp\u2019s money-losing stainless steel division partly come undone. \u201cIt is one step forward, two steps back,\u201d said Jeff Largey, an analyst at Macquarie Securities in London.As he looks ahead, Mr. Hiesinger will need to decide how far to go in breaking off parts of the company. He may want to sell some of its many steel operations and businesses like auto parts to raise money for acquisitions in elevators and heavy engineering, analysts said. He will also need to weigh whether raising more capital for acquisitions would alienate already uneasy investors.In need of cash and burdened with \u20ac5.8 billion in debt, the company issued new shares equivalent to 10 percent of its market value on Dec. 3, diluting the shares of current investors. Analysts doubt the \u20ac880 million raised is enough to shore up ThyssenKrupp\u2019s finances for long, let alone give Mr. Hiesinger the firepower he would need for acquisitions.It \u201cis a short-term fix, too small to solve the issue,\u201d says Carsten Riek, a steel analyst at UBS in London. At its annual meeting Jan. 17, the company will ask shareholders to authorize another 25 percent increase, leading analysts to think that another big capital raising may be in the cards.The Krupp Family Foundation, which had controlled 25 percent of ThyssenKrupp\u2019s shares, declined to participate in the December capital increase and saw its stake fall to 23 percent. It will also lose one of its three board seats. The foundation would not comment. But the company believes the foundation was reacting to the cuts in the dividend, which used to fund its activities.\u201cThe Krupp Foundation is typically viewed as a material hurdle to more radical change,\u201d Mr. Largey wrote in a research note.Cevian, the activist investor, feels that the divisions are \u201cunderperforming compared to their respective peers,\u201d according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly.Still, the person said, the investors think that Mr. Hiesinger is \u201cstarting to implement the right measures to get these divisions up to speed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sluggish Economy Prompts Europe to Reconsider Its Intentions on Climate Change", "Date": "2014-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe European Union, which for years has sought to lead the world in addressing climate change, is tempering its ambitions and considering turning mandatory targets for renewable energy into just goals.The union\u2019s policy-making body is also unlikely to restrict exploration for shale gas using the disputed technique known as hydraulic fracturing.A deep and lasting economic slowdown, persistently high prices for renewable energy sources and years of inconclusive international negotiations are giving European officials second thoughts about how aggressively to remake the Continent\u2019s energy-production industries.The details are still being negotiated in Brussels, but officials said the European Commission\u2019s energy and climate proposal will probably include a binding target of reducing emissions by 35 percent to 40 percent by 2030. Some officials wanted to make the new targets for renewable energy nonbinding. But opposition this week appears to have turned the tide in favor of having a binding renewable target \u2014 although it would be applied across the European Union rather than to individual nations, according to an official briefed on the negotiations.An intense lobbying effort is underway, with advocates from various groups picking apart aspects of the package.Jens Tartler, a spokesman for the German Renewable Energy Federation, which represents the wind and solar industry, called an absence of binding goals for renewables \u201ctotally disappointing\u201d and said it would \u201ccontribute to a marked reduction in the pace of expansion of renewables.\u201dBut even some in the renewable-energy industry say that the package that is emerging is the best that could be hoped for given the difficult economic environment.\u201cOf course people say we should be doing more, but we are moving in the right direction,\u201d says Tom Murley, who runs funds with $1.15 billion in investments in renewables at HG Capital in London.The proposals are being influenced by fierce debates over the place of nuclear power in Europe and the costs to governments, businesses and consumers of subsidizing the growing share of renewable energy. Europeans are also witnessing a shale gas revolution in the United States, which has prompted a debate over whether Europe should tap into its own potential shale reserves. The extensive new supply of natural gas in the United States has led to sharp reductions in emissions as utilities switch from dirty-burning coal to cleaner-burning gas for electricity generation.Germany, which has pushed for the energy and climate targets, has been struggling with the realities of shifting its energy mix. Germany\u2019s plan, backed by Chancellor Angela Merkel and opposition parties, to close its nuclear power plants and build up renewable energy is running into problems. German consumers are being hit with rising electric bills, and businesses worry that energy costs are putting them at a disadvantage with competitors in countries like the United States.Even so, German politicians were expressing their fears about the proposals from Brussels. \u201cEurope must remain a leader in climate protection. For this we need clear, distinct goals for climate protection, renewable energy and energy efficiency,\u201d Barbara Hendricks, Germany\u2019s environment minister, said in a statement issued jointly on Wednesday with Sigmar Gabriel, the country\u2019s energy minister.Energy policy has always been thorny for the European Union because of the widely differing economic and political problems of its big member countries. For example, France sees nuclear power as important, while its neighbor Germany is phasing it out. Eastern European countries like Poland are heavily dependent on coal, a leading source of emissions.With Europe experiencing its worst economic crisis in decades, environmental concerns have slipped down the political agenda as the Continent\u2019s economies struggle to generate badly needed growth.In 2007, the European Union agreed to targets including a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2020, an increase in the share of energy consumption produced from renewable resources to 20 percent and a 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency. Europe has achieved most of that first goal, with estimates that it has overall reduced emissions by about 18 percent.But, with 2020 looming, it feels obliged to adopt a new strategy because of the huge financial investments it would take to reach the mandated level.This time, the current emissions cap will be extended to 2030. The proposed cuts of 35 percent to 40 percent would still be among the most ambitious in the world.However, while European nations will still be setting individual targets for carbon emission cuts, they will probably not be ordered to hit specific levels for renewable energy, according to officials briefed on the talks. Instead they will have the flexibility to decide on their own path to a lower carbon economy.There is likely to be an increased target for renewable energy \u2014 around 25 percent to 27 percent \u2014 for the European Union as a whole, without specifying national objectives.The officials drafting the policy, which will still need to be negotiated by member countries and the Parliament, are in part trying to address industry and consumer complaints about electricity costs in Europe, which have risen about 40 percent since 2005, compared with a decrease in the United States.European businesses, though generally in favor of the European Union sticking to one target, still worry that the commission is not doing enough to remove a disadvantage European companies face compared with those in the United States. Markus J. Beyrer, director general of BusinessEurope, an industry group in Brussels, said the European Union was once again in danger of taking too advanced a position.\u201cWe think the targets discussed are too ambitious,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think we should engrave everything in stone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There\u2019s been an upswing in leisure travel, especially over the second half of the year, making it harder to find good seats at good fares, so people are buying earlier.Well, one way of seeing it is that people may view the price of hotel rooms as more stable than airline tickets and so don\u2019t book them with the same priority level.New York has been the top destination for years now. The top 10 are relatively consistent and those are the large cities you might imagine: Chicago, Los Angeles, Las Vegas. An interesting way to look at this is to say, well, that\u2019s booked travel. So what are people searching for that they don\u2019t actually book? Here, we tend to see destinations that are more aspirational, like Honolulu and Miami.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama Announces Institute to Create Manufacturing Jobs", "Date": "2014-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 It was President Obama\u2019s first policy-related trip of 2014, but he used it to take care of some unfinished business from 2013.With less than two weeks till his State of the Union address on Jan. 28, Mr. Obama hastened to make good on a pledge from last year\u2019s speech, announcing the creation of a high-tech manufacturing institute aimed at creating well-paying jobs.Speaking to 2,000 students at North Carolina State University, which is leading a group of universities and companies that established the institute, Mr. Obama said it was the kind of innovation that would reinvigorate the nation\u2019s manufacturing economy.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to turn things around overnight,\u201d Mr. Obama declared, referring to a decade of lost jobs in homegrown North Carolina industries like textiles and furniture making. But, he said, \u201cwe are going to start bringing those jobs back to America.\u201dLast week, the president checked off another initiative from last year\u2019s address, announcing that the government had selected five communities to receive federal resources to help children and the needy. The program, known as \u201cPromise Zones,\u201d does not require new spending but will direct existing aid to these communities.White House officials defended the time it took to announce the first manufacturing institute, saying these ventures require extensive planning and are chosen through competitions.\u201cIf we had announced everything in a week,\u201d the press secretary, Jay Carney, told reporters, \u201cyou would have said it wasn\u2019t serious, it wasn\u2019t real, and the assessments made about where to launch these initiatives weren\u2019t rigorous and substantive.\u201dThis is the first of three such institutes the White House plans to announce in the coming weeks. It will be financed by a five-year, $70 million grant from the Department of Energy, which will be matched by funding from the consortium members, including the equipment maker John Deere and Delphi, an auto-parts maker.The institute will use advanced semiconductor technology to develop a new generation of energy-efficient devices for automobiles, consumer electronics and industrial motors. Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Obama toured a Finnish company, Vacon, that makes drives used to control the speed of electric motors, to increase their energy efficiency.Confessing that there was \u201ca lot of physics\u201d in the company\u2019s presentation, the president seemed most interested in which of the components were made in the United States.Mr. Obama regularly visits such factories to remind Americans that manufacturing has been a bright spot in the job market\u2019s otherwise uneven record during his presidency. But this trip came after the release Friday of a surprisingly weak job report for December, which doused expectations that the job market would finally gain real momentum this year.A day after Republicans and Democrats in the Senate failed to reach a deal to extend unemployment insurance, Mr. Obama noted Wednesday that North Carolina\u2019s jobless rate was higher than the national average and urged Congress to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and find a solution.The president also promoted other policies, including his health care law, which he said had contributed to the slowest growth in health costs in 50 years. At his mention of the glitch-ridden Affordable Care Act, he got a noisy cheer from the friendly young audience.But there was another reliable barometer of Mr. Obama\u2019s diminished popularity statewide: Senator Kay Hagan, a North Carolina Democrat who faces an uphill re-election battle this year, skipped his speech, citing the press of Senate business in Washington. Republicans have singled out Ms. Hagan, hoping to lash her to the troubled rollout of the health care law.Mr. Obama took note of Ms. Hagan\u2019s absence, but said, \u201cI want to thank her publicly for the great work she\u2019s doing.\u201dRepublicans in Congress said that if Mr. Obama were serious about reinvigorating the job market, he would support Republican-backed initiatives and approve the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.The announcement Wednesday of the new manufacturing institute showcased the White House\u2019s determination to press ahead with jobs programs, with or without Congress. Mr. Obama said he was determined to make 2014 \u201ca year of action.\u201dBut it also laid bare the limits of Mr. Obama\u2019s authority, since Congress has stymied his more ambitious proposals that require legislation. In last year\u2019s State of the Union address, the president announced a $1 billion plan, modeled on one in Germany, to create a network of 15 institutes that would develop new industries.Mr. Obama extolled a pilot project in Youngstown, Ohio, that he said had turned a shuttered factory into a lab where workers were honing skills in three-dimensional printing.But setting up 15 institutes would require congressional authorization. So last year, Mr. Obama narrowed his focus to establishing three institutes using existing funds and executive authority. At the same time, he increased his long-term goal to 45 institutes over 10 years, while acknowledging this would require congressional action.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tepid U.S. Sales Are a Drag on Volkswagen\u2019s Ambitions", "Date": "2014-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 Volkswagen has outlined ambitious plans to become the world\u2019s top-selling automaker within the next four years, but its lackluster sales in the United States have been a significant drag on meeting that goal.On Monday at the North American International Auto Show, the German automaker showed that it had no intention of scaling back those ambitions, announcing that it would bring new models to the United States and invest $7 billion in North American production.Volkswagen hopes the new models will bolster its lagging sales and help it reach its goal of selling a million Volkswagen and Audi brand vehicles in the United States by 2018.A day earlier, Martin Winterkorn, chairman of Volkswagen, said the company would invest the money over the next five years to produce a midsize sport utility vehicle for the American market and increase its dealer network.The United States market is crucial to helping Volkswagen achieve its goal to sell 10 million vehicles a year worldwide by 2018, but sales for its Volkswagen brand fell 6.9 percent last year, though the company got a lift from Audi, whose sales rose 13.5 percent.Volkswagen, Kia and Volvo were the only three mainstream brands to post sales declines in 2013. Industry wide sales surged 7.6 percent for the year as consumer confidence rebounded and new models unleashed pent-up demand.The American market \u201cis the second-largest new vehicle market globally and a core part of VW\u2019s strategy to become the No. 1 automaker in the world,\u201d said Tom Libby, an analyst with IHS automotive. \u201cThe company needs to regain the momentum and growth it had here prior to 2013.\u201d Volkswagen trails Toyota and General Motors in worldwide sales.\u201cVolkswagen needs both a compact and midsize S.U.V. here as soon as possible,\u201d Mr. Libby said.The midsize seven-seat sport utility vehicle Volkswagen is building for the United States market will not go on sale until 2016. The automaker has not said where it plans to build the vehicle. At its factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., the United Automobile Workers union has sought to organize the workers.On Monday, VW introduced two variations on its Golf compact car \u2014 a seventh-generation Golf R, which will go on sale in early 2015, and an eGolf electric car, which was first shown at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November.Michael Horn, incoming chief executive and president of the Volkswagen Group of America, on stage next to the Golf R, called it the highlight of the show. \u201cI\u2019ve got it at home in Germany in my garage.\u201dBut the new Golf models are unlikely to appeal to a broad enough market to lift sales by much, said Alec Gutierrez, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.\u201cWhile the Golf R and eGolf are exciting, it\u2019s the full 2015 Golf line that will provide VW with the most significant boost in the near term,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said. \u201cGolf sales were down significantly this year as most consumers interested in a Golf or GTI were delaying their purchase until the intro of the new generation which should launch early this year.\u201dSales of the Golf, Volkswagen\u2019s third most popular car after the Jetta compact and the Passat sedan, fell 24 percent last year to 30,931 vehicles. Production on the new Golf starts on Tuesday, in Puebla, Mexico, and will go on sale this summer.The weak spot in Volkswagen\u2019s lineup, Mr. Gutierrez said, is lack of a more affordable and fuel-efficient update for the Tiguan sport utility vehicle.\u201cThis segment is growing and VW has failed to keep pace due to a high price point and fuel economy well below the industry average,\u201d he said.The automaker will most likely get help from the Audi Q3 entry-level crossover it introduced in Detroit this week. Sales of luxury crossover utility vehicles are one of the strongest segments of the car market, rising 12.2 percent last year to outpace most of the industry, according to Kelley Blue Book.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Continuing Unrest Could Undermine Thailand\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2014-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Thailand\u2019s economy tends to bounce back vigorously from the coups, street protests and natural disasters that trouble it every few years. This time, however, could be different: As the nation\u2019s once buoyant growth is slowing, investors and businesses are growing increasingly frustrated with the current political gridlock.\u201cBack in 2010, Western investors were ready to buy almost anything Asia-related,\u201d said Frederic Neumann, a head of Asian economics at HSBC. \u201cNow, they are asking a lot harder questions and are a lot less tolerant of political uncertainties.\u201dThe risk for Thailand is that investors will choose to send their cash to other places, like neighboring Myanmar, which is emerging from five decades of military dictatorship, or the buoyant Philippines. The Thai stock market has fallen more than 10 percent since November and concerns are growing that tourism will fall, companies may not locate in Bangkok and ambitious infrastructure projects will be delayed.Many companies, already wary of slowing growth in Thailand, have scaled back their advertising budgets and delayed product introductions in recent weeks. The Thailand chief of Toyota, which manufactures more than 800,000 cars a year at its sites in Thailand, warned this month that the company might have to reconsider its plans to invest 20 billion baht, or about $600 million, in the country if the political unrest persists.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a slowdown across all sectors, both from international and local companies,\u201d said Wannee Ruttanaphon, president of the Media Agency Association of Thailand. With sales at many companies slow this month and expected to be weak next month, \u201cThey are adopting a wait-and-see approach.\u201dDevelopers have held off putting new properties on the market this month, and sales of condominiums in central Bangkok have slowed. \u201cWe\u2019re still doing business and getting inquiries for office space rental, for example, but things have slowed down,\u201d said James Pitchon, executive director at the real estate firm CBRE in Thailand.Hotel and flight bookings to Bangkok have plummeted as the weeks of turmoil have stretched into months, prompting governments around the world to advise their citizens against travel to the city, and dealing a severe blow to one of the world\u2019s most popular tourist destinations. To make matters worse, the protests and casualties have coincided with the peak travel season around Christmas and the Lunar New Year, which begins Friday and usually brings an influx of travelers from China and Hong Kong.\u201cUsually, flights to Bangkok, or just about any popular destinations, before Chinese New Year are very full,\u201d said Cloris Yip, an agent with Jolly Holiday, a travel agency in Hong Kong. \u201cThis year is a different story. Right now we have zero bookings to Bangkok, and even though people still go to Phuket, many of them insist on direct flights to avoid connecting flights at Bangkok.\u201dDuring the past crises \u2014 among them unrest that left more than 90 people dead in 2010 \u2014 these sectors recovered swiftly. Tourists were badly spooked by the bloodshed in 2010, but quickly returned once calm was restored. Total visitor numbers that year were 12 percent higher than in 2011, and the Thai stock market ended the year more than 40 percent higher.Four years ago, during the last spasm of unrest, stimulus measures around the globe helped spur not just robust export growth, but also firm demand within Thailand as consumers took advantage of low interest rates and tax breaks to stock up on electronics, cars and other goods. The political troubles were quickly forgotten, as Thailand enjoyed growth of 7.8 percent, its fastest pace in more than a decade.\u201cWe can survive only until the end of the first quarter,\u201d said Sisdivachr Cheewarattanporn, the president of the Association of Thai Travel Agents. \u201cBut if things get prolonged until the second quarter, we will all be dead.\u201dThe current crisis comes at a tougher time for Thailand\u2019s economy than most of the country\u2019s previous bouts of unrest: Thailand\u2019s recent growth momentum is waning. And the turmoil is causing big delays to the public investment plans and economic overhauls that many economists say Thailand urgently needs to secure future growth. \u201cThe starting point of the economy was already quite weak before the current turmoil began,\u201d said Euben Paracuelles, Southeast Asia economist at Nomura.One effect of the stimulus efforts, however, has been that households are now significantly more indebted, and less able to splurge on goods, than they were just a few years ago. The political turmoil and much-reduced revenues from the tourism sector \u2014 which accounts for about 7 percent of the economy \u2014 have further dampened confidence among both consumers and businesses. Even if the turmoil was resolved quickly, consumer spending would be unlikely to rebound as rapidly because of the household debt, Mr. Paracuelles said.The backdrop of the global financial markets has also changed. Investors are factoring in the prospect that the Federal Reserve will further scale back the huge bond purchases that helped keep interest rates low worldwide in recent years. The prospect of higher rates in the United States has made it less attractive for investors to seek out returns in emerging markets, and undermined a crucial driver of capital inflows into places like Thailand.All of this means that state-driven investments and economic overhauls have become more important for Thailand\u2019s ability to shore up growth and preserve its competitive edge within Asia. Plans to roll out antiflooding projects and spend 2 trillion baht on high-speed rail lines and other infrastructure projects were approved by Parliament last year. The political bickering means that many months are likely to pass before construction gets underway.\u201cAmid all the uncertainty we have in Thailand right now, one thing that is certain is that the infrastructure projects will not get going until late this year at best,\u201d said Santitarn Sathirathai, an economist who covers Thailand at Credit Suisse, and who recently lowered his growth forecast for this year to 3 percent from 4.5 percent.All this has many economists worrying that the impact of the current turmoil could last much longer than that of previous crises. The longer the infrastructure projects and measures to improve productivity among Thailand\u2019s rapidly aging population are held up, economists fear, the more Thailand risks losing out to some of its regional neighbors.\u201cMyanmar is opening up, Indonesia is making progress on infrastructure, and you have the Philippines, which is a real bright spot in the region right now,\u201d said Mr. Paracuelles, the Nomura economist. In the long term, he said, \u201cThailand risks losing its international competitiveness. That\u2019s the real worry.\u201dBack in Bangkok, Mr. Pitchon, the real estate executive, said he had not seen any businesses leaving the city yet, even though inquiries from companies seeking to establish a presence in the city had slowed. Thailand is a very resilient place that is used to turmoil, he said. But, \u201cThe longer this goes on, the more worried people get.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Their success in making that argument \u2014 keeping taxes and government investment low \u2014 has helped increase American income inequality to crisis proportions: 95 percent of the income gains since 2009 have gone to the top 1 percent. The majority of the country has stagnated or lost ground, leaving the economy sluggish. This campaign, if Democrats fully pursue it, could help demonstrate to voters how intransigent Republicans have been on the most fundamental and popular elements of a strong recovery. Most do not even acknowledge that the country has an inequality problem, and they have systematically worked to deny those at the bottom and in the middle from access to food stamps, health insurance and unemployment benefits. It\u2019s no surprise that the only thing Republicans want to discuss are the stumbles of health care reform. An aggressive stand on inequality issues could knock them out of that loop.As important as a minimum-wage increase would be, Democrats shouldn\u2019t stop there. It would be heartening to see the party give the same support to other aspects of Mr. Obama\u2019s inequality agenda, including universal preschool, career and technical education, infrastructure investment and stronger collective-bargaining laws.

Many of the brands sold more cars in the first 11 months of 2013 than they did in 2007 before the recession.Among the hungriest consumers for luxury automobiles are entrepreneurs amassing new wealth in industries like technology and energy, and executives in Fortune 500 companies whose stocks have soared along with the broader market, analysts and industry executives say.\u201cPeople were pulling back when they had to let people go,\u201d said Ken Gorin, chief executive and president of the Collection in Coral Gables, Fla. \u201cThey\u2019d come in and buy, but it would be the same color and the same model so no one knew they got a new car.\u201d\u201cNow it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Mr. Gorin said. \u201cYellow cars, blue cars, red cars, white cars, people are feeling better.\u201dSales at the Collection\u2019s Ferrari, Aston Martin, Maserati and McLaren dealerships are up 26 percent from 2012 and 94 percent from the depths of the recession in 2009, Mr. Gorin said.Buyers at the top end of the market say the time feels right for a big-ticket purchase. And dealers across the country say that a majority of these purchases, especially for those above $150,000, are made in cash.\u201cIt never would have crossed my mind to spend that kind of money on a car before,\u201d said Steve Seidman, a radiologist from West Bloomfield, Mich., who bought a Tesla Model S electric sedan in February. \u201cI\u2019m not really confident in the economy, but I\u2019m comfortable in the direction it\u2019s going in.\u201dTesla buyers including Mr. Seidman are spending well beyond the $70,000 Model S base price by opting for a larger battery pack and options, including upgraded interior and technology packages, that can move the price to six figures.\u201cThere seems to be some enthusiasm to take some more risk and say: \u2018O.K., it\u2019s time to buy a new car.

About 40 percent of those sales are to companies that use them to transport clients and executives, the dealership said. It has benefited from the rising fortunes of large public companies in the area like 3M, Target and General Mills.During the recession, \u201cwe were lucky to get one out a month,\u201d said Kenny Reller, a manager at the dealership.A dealer near Cleveland, the Collection Auto Group, which owns 28 dealerships, including Porsche, Lotus, Maserati and Aston Martin, added Rolls-Royce last month, becoming the automaker\u2019s 35th dealership in the United States.\u201cCleveland is in a renaissance,\u201d said Bernie Moreno, president of the dealership. \u201cWe call it the three Ms: medical, manufacturing and media.\u201dRolls-Royce, which is owned by BMW, has bounced back since 2008, recovering in 2009 with the introduction of the Ghost, a smaller sedan with an average price above $300,000.

{"Headline": "Europe, Facing Economic Pain, May Ease Climate Rules", "Date": "2014-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 For years, Europe has tried to set the global standard for climate-change regulation, creating tough rules on emissions, mandating more use of renewable energy sources and arguably sacrificing some economic growth in the name of saving the planet.But now even Europe seems to be hitting its environmentalist limits.High energy costs, declining industrial competitiveness and a recognition that the economy is unlikely to rebound strongly any time soon are leading policy makers to begin easing up in their drive for more aggressive climate regulation.On Wednesday, the European Union proposed an end to binding national targets for renewable energy production after 2020. Instead, it substituted an overall European goal that is likely to be much harder to enforce.It also decided against proposing laws on environmental damage and safety during the extraction of shale gas by a controversial drilling process known as fracking. It opted instead for a series of minimum principles it said it would monitor.Europe pressed ahead on other fronts, aiming for a cut of 40 percent in Europe\u2019s carbon emissions by 2030, double the current target of 20 percent by 2020. Officials said the new proposals were not evidence of diminished commitment to environmental discipline but reflected the complicated reality of bringing the 28 countries of the European Union together behind a policy.\u201cIt will require a lot from Europe,\u201d said Connie Hedegaard, European commissioner for climate action. \u201cIf all other big economies followed our example, the world would be a better place.\u201dBut the proposals were seen as a substantial backtrack by environmental groups, and evidence that economic factors were starting to influence the climate debate in ways they previously had not in Europe.Wednesday\u2019s proposals came from the European Commission, the Brussels-based executive arm of the bloc, and would next require approval by the group\u2019s member states and the European Parliament.The energy and climate debate, which is playing out across Europe, reflects similar trade-offs being made around the world on mending economic problems today or addressing the environmental problems of tomorrow.The political and policy response to climate change has failed to keep pace with increasingly dire warnings from scientists about the cascading effects of increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other global warming pollutants in the atmosphere.What progress has been made has come largely from cost efficiencies adopted by businesses and consumers primarily for financial reasons \u2014 the switch from coal to cheaper natural gas for electricity generation in the United States, for example, and the cumulative effect of years of increasing efficiency in buildings, vehicles, appliances and manufacturing around the globe.Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, defended the new proposals as a hard-fought compromise and proof that it \u201cis possible to make a marriage between industry and climate action.\u201dHe said the measures showed that Europe was still playing a global leadership role in reducing carbon emissions.That drew a tart response from Friends of the Earth, which accused the commission of putting the immediate interests of industry ahead of Europe\u2019s broader welfare.\u201cBarroso and his commissioners seem to have fallen for the old-think industry spin that there must be a trade-off between climate action and economic recovery,\u201d Brook Riley, the group\u2019s climate and energy campaigner, said in a statement. \u201cThis position completely ignores the huge financial cost of dealing with the impacts of climate change and the 500 billion euros the E.U. is spending every year on oil and gas imports.\u201dThe British government, a frequent critic of what it sees as moves by the European Union that inhibit economic performance, welcomed the proposals. It singled out for praise the scrapping of national targets for renewable energy in favor of an overall goal of producing 27 percent of Europe\u2019s energy from renewables by 2030, an approach that will leave countries battling among themselves over who should do more.\u201cIf you set rigid, inflexible targets, that is likely to result in greater costs,\u201d said Edward Davey, Britain\u2019s secretary of state for energy and climate change. \u201cWe believe our existing approach will enable us to meet these objectives without having to take more action, but we believe other countries will have to take more action.\u201dBefore Wednesday\u2019s announcement, business groups lobbied hard against more stringent targets that they worried could endanger Europe\u2019s still very feeble economic recovery and slow the job creation needed to bring down an overall unemployment rate of nearly 11 percent.In a letter sent to the European Commission this month, 14 executives at large companies called for \u201cone single, realistic target\u201d and warned that \u201cthe high-cost of noncompetitive technologies to decarbonise the power sector\u201d will strain businesses already hit by Europe\u2019s high energy prices, particularly for electricity, which costs twice what it does in the United States.Ms. Hedegaard on Wednesday acknowledged that Europe needed to bring down its energy prices but said that the shift to renewable sources played a \u201cnegligible\u201d part in the problem. But she also took a swipe at what she suggested were unrealistic demands by environmental activists, noting that \u201cwe are trying to do something that is achievable, that is doable and practical for 28 governments to back.\u201dIn 2007 the European Union said it wanted to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent in 2020 and was even prepared to reduce them by 30 percent by the same date if other big economies also took significant action. It also set national targets for adopting renewable energy.According to the commission, total greenhouse gas emissions from the 28 members had by 2011 fallen to 16.9 percent below the 1990 level, and to 18 percent lower by 2012. That suggests that the 40 percent reduction target by 2030 should be attainable.But the 2011 and 2012 reductions partly reflect the drop in industrial output in Europe after the financial crisis, which plunged almost all of the bloc\u2019s nations into recession \u2014 something policy makers are desperate to reverse.Europeans have also been disappointed that other big polluters have failed to follow the lead they set in 2007.Andrew Higgins contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Caution at Unilever as Its Sales Slow Down", "Date": "2014-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The global economy might be slowly recovering and consumers gradually gaining confidence. But Unilever, one of the world\u2019s largest consumer products companies, remains cautious.The company, which makes Dove soap, Knorr soup stock and Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream \u2014 despite reporting fourth-quarter sales growth that beat some analysts\u2019 estimates \u2014 warned on Tuesday that global markets would continue to be volatile this year. Like many of its rivals, which include Nestl\u00e9 and Procter & Gamble, Unilever was hit by slowing growth in emerging markets including Vietnam, Thailand and South Africa. The company also said that more positive economic data in developed markets had not yet translated into improved sales.\u201cGrowth continued to slow in emerging markets as a result of the impact of economic uncertainty and currency depreciation,\u201d Paul Polman, Unilever\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cDeveloped markets remained weak with little sign of any overall improvement despite the more positive macroeconomic indicators in recent months.\u201dThe company said that the pace of its sales growth slowed last year for the first time since 2009, mainly related to its operations in emerging markets, where the company makes more than half its revenue. Sales growth for 2013 overall was 4.3 percent, down from 6.9 percent in 2012. More difficult conditions in emerging markets prompted Unilever last September to warn that sales growth in the third quarter of last year was slowing.Still, Unilever said sales in emerging markets increased 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 5.9 percent in the third quarter of 2013.Unilever, which is based in the Dutch city of Rotterdam and London, said sales growth in the fourth quarter was helped by Russia, Turkey, China and Indonesia. But consumers in Vietnam, Thailand and South Africa continued to spend less on its products, Unilever said.On sales of 49.8 billion euros, or roughly $67.4 billion, the company\u2019s fourth-quarter profit rose to \u20ac4.84 billion, up from \u20ac4.37 billion in the comparable period a year earlier.Shares in Unilever finished up 3.4 percent in the New York trading on Tuesday as some investors welcomed the improvement in the quarter.The European Union is widely expected to raise its forecast for economic growth soon. Its commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, Olli Rehn, said this month that the economic recovery was moving ahead faster than anticipated. Growth in emerging markets continued to slow last year and some investors raised concerns that an unwinding of central bank stimulus in the United States could choke capital flows to those regions.\u201cLooking forward, we anticipate ongoing volatility in the external environment and are positioning Unilever accordingly,\u201d Mr. Polman said.Despite the slower growth, \u201cemerging markets very much remains the growth engine for Unilever,\u201d Jeff Stent, an analyst at BNP Paribas in London, said. \u201cThe market has gotten tougher and we might be in a soft patch of the emerging markets cycle, but structurally you just have to be optimistic about consumer goods exposure in emerging markets.\u201dSABMiller, the brewing giant, on Tuesday also said its earnings growth in the quarter that ended in December was driven by demand in emerging markets. Burberry, the luxury clothing and apparel maker, is also among companies whose earnings have also been benefiting from growing sales in emerging markets.Other consumer goods makers, though, have recently been withdrawing from Asia some products whose sales did not meet their expectations. L\u2019Or\u00e9al of France decided to stop selling its Garnier products in China while Revlon said last month that it would exit the market after failing to win market share.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Expressing Our Darker Purpose", "Date": "2014-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 \u201cShakespeare,\u201d wrote the American philosopher Allan Bloom, \u201cwas an eminently political author.\u201d On this matter, at least, the great controversialist was correct: As Mr. Bloom wrote 50 years ago in \u201cShakespeare\u2019s Politics,\u201d there was a time when \u201cthe political man seemed to be the most interesting theme of poetry.\u201dA new \u201cKing Lear,\u201d which opened at London\u2019s National Theater this month, restores this forgotten sense of priority. Already \u2014 deservedly \u2014 the hottest ticket in town, the director Sam Mendes\u2019s production presents the downfall of the aging monarch as much more than a study in human implosion, familial collapse and lyrical introspection. This \u201cLear\u201d deserves a Broadway transfer, and as wide a digital audience as the National Theater can muster.Simon Russell Beale, shrunken, shriveled and broken, shows as convincingly as any actor I have ever seen what it is to lose everything (mind, children, kingdom). Yet his astonishing performance as Lear owes as much to an understanding of political dynamics as it does to the pathos of dementia. When we first meet him, he is a robust, impatient soldier-king, surrounded by an entourage of muscle. He divides his kingdom while seated \u2014 his back to the audience, oozing disdain through his very posture.What is striking is the contemporary resonance of this production, the way in which it nags at the political subconscious and stirs our present anxieties. This is not the leaden \u201cpolitical theater\u201d of didacticism and finger-wagging. Rather, it uses the text of the early 17th century to illuminate the night terrors of the 21st, speaking directly to the pathologies of our time. Mr. Mendes is right to claim that \u201cit feels like a national play.\u201d \u201cKing Lear\u201d was written in the infancy of what became the United Kingdom: Performed at Whitehall, London, in 1606 for King James I, who was also James VI of Scotland, it explores the fears of fragmentation and civil war that marked the declining years of the childless Queen Elizabeth I.Now it returns to the stage only eight months before a referendum on Scotland\u2019s future. The polls suggest that independence will be rejected by the Scots on Sept. 18, but referendums are notoriously unpredictable.Whatever the outcome, the fact that the question is being asked at all is unsettling for a union of nations such as the United Kingdom. Lear divides his kingdom to keep the peace; the outcome is precisely the opposite.At a less literal level, there is an even stronger correspondence between \u201cLear\u201d and the spirit of the age. More than any other play in the language, it navigates the terrain between the personal and the political, the threads that connect decisions of state to the vulnerable individual. By stages, Lear is reduced from a mighty ruler to a naked vagrant, no better than a \u201cpoor, bare, forked animal,\u201d as he puts it to Poor Tom (the loyal Edgar, son of Gloucester, who is disguised and feigning madness).This symbolic landscape is precisely where political battle is being waged in 2014. While the British economy is recovering, its resurgence has yet to translate into a sense of well-being. The fear of personal indigence remains deep. Austerity, insecurity and the cluster of social problems that Prime Minister David Cameron calls the \u201cbroken society\u201d continue to define the times. No politician is more vulnerable than one who is not believed when he claims that things are getting better. Every regime is obsessed by what Lear calls \u201ccourt news\u201d: \u201cWho loses and who wins, who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out.\u201d But a coalition such as the Conservative-Liberal Democrat government headed by Mr. Cameron is conspicuously vulnerable to the charge of introspection and detachment.The next general election, scheduled for May 2015, will be won by the party that persuasively connects the economic recovery to voters\u2019 personal circumstances. In one of the play\u2019s great moments of self-discovery, Lear considers the \u201cpoor naked wretches\u201d of his realm, helpless before \u201cthe pelting of this pitiless storm.\u201d He reproaches himself for his failure to help them when he could: \u201cO, I have ta\u2019en / Too little care of this.\u201d He tells \u201cpomp\u201d \u2014 his own \u2014 to \u201cExpose thyself to feel what wretches feel.\u201d Never has the need for political empathy been so exquisitely expressed.Herein lies the timeless demand made of those who govern on behalf of those with no apparent hope. As Conservative leader, Mr. Cameron has intermittently presented himself as the champion of the vulnerable. But his party is still associated in the eyes of the electorate with \u201cpomp\u201d and indifference to the \u201cwretches\u201d of our own time. The twist is that, just as Lear was hailed for his strong kingship, so, too, the present prime minister is applauded when he is tough on welfare. Even as they reproach his party for its lack of compassion, voters demand crackdowns on benefit \u201cscroungers\u201d \u2014 such is the great knotted dilemma at the heart of modern governance.As Shakespeare knew, the practice of politics is governed not by straightforward rules but by a clutch of paradoxes. His plays are not manuals but mirrors held up to humanity. This is why Nelson Mandela and his fellow prisoners read and reread \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d on Robben Island, and why Abraham Lincoln turned to \u201cMacbeth\u201d as the truest portrait of tyranny and warning against it. Every generation has its defining \u201cKing Lear,\u201d and I am sure this is ours. Shakespeare\u2019s greatest play is an invitation to stare into the abyss and contemplate the fragility of power and decency. As Edgar says to his father, Gloucester, \u201chow fearful / And dizzy \u2019tis to cast one\u2019s eyes so low.\u201d Indeed, but how much worse is the politics of delusion. Advertisement"}

Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you so much.Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, my fellow Americans, today in America, a teacher spent extra time with a student who needed it and did her part to lift America\u2019s graduation rate to its highest levels in more than three decades.An entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup and did her part to add to the more than 8 million new jobs our businesses have created over the past four years. (Applause.)An autoworker fine-tuned some of the best, most fuel-efficient cars in the world and did his part to help America wean itself off foreign oil.A farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest five-year stretch of farm exports in our history.A rural doctor gave a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford. (Applause.) A man took the bus home from the graveyard shift, bone-tired but dreaming big dreams for his son. And in tight-knit communities all across America, fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids, put an arm around their spouse, remember fallen comrades and give thanks for being home from a war that after twelve long years is finally coming to an end. (Applause.)Tonight this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent: It is you, our citizens, who make the state of our union strong. (Applause.)And here are the results of your efforts: the lowest unemployment rate in over five years; a rebounding housing market \u2014 (applause) \u2014 a manufacturing sector that\u2019s adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s \u2014 (applause) \u2014 more oil produced \u2014 more oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world, the first time that\u2019s happened in nearly twenty years \u2014 (applause) \u2014 our deficits cut by more than half; and for the first time \u2014 (applause) \u2014 for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world\u2019s number one place to invest; America is.(Cheers, applause.) That\u2019s why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America. After five years of grit and determined effort, the United States is better-positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on Earth.The question for everyone in this chamber, running through every decision we make this year, is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress. For several years now, this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government. It\u2019s an important debate \u2014 one that dates back to our very founding. But when that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracy \u2014 when our differences shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the United States \u2014 then we are not doing right by the American people. (Cheers, applause.)Now, as president, I\u2019m committed to making Washington work better, and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here. And I believe most of you are, too. Last month, thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans,Congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last year\u2019s severe cuts to priorities like education. Nobody got everything they wanted, and we can still do more to invest in this country\u2019s future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way.But the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new jobs, not creating new crises.And in the coming months \u2014 (applause) \u2014 in the coming months, let\u2019s see where else we can make progress together. Let\u2019s make this a year of action. That\u2019s what most Americans want, for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives, their hopes, their aspirations. And what I believe unites the people of this nation, regardless of race or region or party, young or old, rich or poor, is the simple, profound belief in opportunity for all, the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility, you can get ahead in America. (Applause.)Now, let\u2019s face it: That belief has suffered some serious blows. Over more than three decades, even before the Great Recession hit, massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good, middle-class jobs, and weakened the economic foundations that families depend on.Today, after four years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done better. But average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled. The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by; let alone to get ahead. And too many still aren\u2019t working at all.So our job is to reverse these trends.It won\u2019t happen right away, and we won\u2019t agree on everything.But what I offer tonight is a set of concrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class. Some require congressional action, and I\u2019m eager to work with all of you. But America does not stand still, and neither will I. (Applause.) So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. (Cheers, applause.)As usual, our first lady sets a good example. Michelle\u2019s \u2014 (applause) \u2014 well. (Chuckles.) (Cheers, applause.) Yeah. Michelle\u2019s Let\u2019s Move! partnership with schools, businesses, local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in thirty years, and that\u2019s an achievement \u2014 (applause) \u2014 that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come. The Joining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill Biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400,000 veterans and military spouses. (Applause.)Taking a page from that playbook, the White House just organized a College Opportunity Summit, where already 150 universities, businesses, nonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education and to help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus.And across the country \u2014 (applause) \u2014 we\u2019re partnering with mayors, governors and state legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equality.The point is, there are millions of Americans outside Washington who are tired of stale political arguments and are moving this country forward. They believe, and I believe, that here in America, our success should depend not on accident of birth but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams. That\u2019s what drew our forebears here. It\u2019s how the daughter of a factory worker is CEO of America\u2019s largest automaker \u2014 (applause) \u2014 how the son of a barkeep is speaker of the House \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 how the son of a single mom can be president of the greatest nation on Earth. (Cheers, applause.)Now \u2014 (sustained cheers and applause) \u2014 opportunity is who we are. And the defining project of our generation must be to restore that promise.We know where to start. The best measure of opportunity is access to a good job. With the economy picking up speed, companies say they intend to hire more people this year.And over half of big manufacturers say they\u2019re thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad. (Applause.)So let\u2019s make that decision easier for more companies. Both Democrats and Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here, and reward companies that keep profits abroad. Let\u2019s flip that equation. Let\u2019s work together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship jobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home. (Cheers, applause.)Moreover, we can take the money we save from this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging our commutes \u2014 because in today\u2019s global economy, first- class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure. We\u2019ll need Congress to protect more than 3 million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer. (Cheers, applause.) That can happen.But, but I\u2019ll act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects, so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible. (Applause.)We also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs. And my administration\u2019s launched two hubs for high-tech manufacturing in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Youngstown, Ohio, where we\u2019ve connected businesses to research universities that can help America lead the world in advanced technologies.Tonight, I\u2019m announcing we\u2019ll launch six more this year. Bipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create. So, get those bills to my desk and put more Americans back to work. (Applause.)Let\u2019s do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who create most new jobs in America. Over the past five years, my administration has made more loans to small business owners than any other. And when 98 percent of our exporters are small businesses, new trade partnerships with Europe and the Asia-Pacific will help them create even more jobs. We need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers, protect our environment and open new markets to new goods stamped \u201cMade in the USA.\u201d (Applause.)Listen, China and Europe aren\u2019t standing on the sidelines; and neither, neither should we. We know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow. This is an edge America cannot surrender. Federally-funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind Google and smartphones. And that\u2019s why Congress should undo the damage done by last year\u2019s cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great American discovery. (Cheers, applause.)There are entire industries to be built based on vaccines that stay ahead of drug-resistant bacteria or paper-thin material that\u2019s stronger than steel. And let\u2019s pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation, not costly and needless litigation. (Applause.)Now, one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to American energy. The \u201call the above\u201d energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today America is closer to energy independence than we have been in decades. (Applause.)One of the reasons why is natural gas. If extracted safely, it\u2019s the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change. (Applause.) Businesses plan to invest almost a hundred billion dollars in new factories that use natural gas. I\u2019ll cut red tape to help states get those factories built and put folks to work, and this Congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to American natural gas. (Applause.)Meanwhile, my administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and jobs growth while strengthening protection of our air, our water, our communities. And while we\u2019re at it, I\u2019ll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations. (Applause.)Now, it\u2019s not just oil and natural gas production that\u2019s booming; we\u2019re becoming a global leader in solar too.Every four minutes another American home or business goes solar, every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job can\u2019t be outsourced. Let\u2019s continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that don\u2019t need it so we can invest more in fuels of the future that do. (Cheers, applause.)And even as we\u2019ve increased energy production, we\u2019ve partnered with businesses, builders and local communities to reduce the energy we consume. When we rescued our automakers, for example, we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars. In the coming months I\u2019ll build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump.And taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet. Over the past eight years the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth. (Applause.)But we have to act with more urgency because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought and coastal cities dealing with floods. That\u2019s why I directed my administration to work with states, utilities and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air.The shift \u2014 (applause) \u2014 the shift to a cleaner energy economy won\u2019t happen overnight, and it will require some tough choices along the way.But the debate is settled. Climate change is a fact. (Applause.) And when our children\u2019s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to say yes, we did. (Cheers, applause.)Finally, if we\u2019re serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, law enforcement \u2014 and fix our broken immigration system. (Cheers, applause.) Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have acted, and I know that members of both parties in the House want to do the same. Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades. And for good reason: When people come here to fulfill their dreams \u2014 to study, invent, contribute to our culture \u2014 they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everybody. So let\u2019s get immigration reform done this year. (Cheers, applause.) Let\u2019s get it done. It\u2019s time.The ideas I\u2019ve outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs. But in this rapidly-changing economy, we have to make sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobs.The good news is, we know how to do it. Two years ago, as the auto industry came roaring back, Andra Rush opened up a manufacturing firm in Detroit. She knew that Ford needed parts for the best-selling truck in America, and she knew how to make those parts. She just needed the workforce. So she dialed up what we call an American Job Center; places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job, or a better job. She was flooded with new workers, and today, Detroit Manufacturing Systems has more than 700 employees. And what Andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer and every job seeker.So tonight, I\u2019ve asked Vice President Biden to lead an across- the-board reform of America\u2019s training programs to make sure they have one mission: train Americans with the skills employers need, and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now. (Cheers, applause.) That means more on-the-job training, and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life. It means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs. And if Congress wants to help, you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready-to-work Americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs.I\u2019m also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it\u2019s more effective in today\u2019s economy. But first, this Congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 1.6 million people. (Cheers, applause.)Let me tell you why.Misty DeMars is a mother of two young boys. She\u2019d been steadily employed since she was a teenager, put herself through college. She\u2019d never collected unemployment benefits, but she\u2019s been paying taxes.In May, she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home. A week later, budget cuts claimed the job she loved. Last month, when their unemployment insurance was cut off, she sat down and wrote me a letter, the kind I get every day. \u201cWe are the face of the unemployment crisis,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m not dependent on the government. Our country depends on people like us who build careers, contribute to society, care about our neighbors. I am confident that in time I will find a job, I will pay my taxes, and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love. Please give us this chance.\u201dCongress, give these hardworking, responsible Americans that chance. (Cheers, applause.) Give them that chance. Give them the chance. They need our help right now, but more important, this country needs them in the game. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been asking CEOs to give more long-term unemployed workers a fair shot at new jobs, a new chance to support their families. And in fact, this week many will come to the White House to make that commitment real.Tonight I ask every business leader in America to join us and do the same because we are stronger when America fields a full team. (Applause.)Of course, it\u2019s not enough to train today\u2019s workforce. We also have to prepare tomorrow\u2019s workforce, by guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education. (Applause.)Estiven Rodriguez couldn\u2019t speak a word of English when he moved to New York City at age 9. But last month, thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program, he led a march of his classmates through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors from their high school to the post office, where they mailed off their college applications. And this son of a factory worker just found out he\u2019s going to college this fall. (Applause.)Five years ago we set out to change the odds for all our kids. We worked with lenders to reform student loans, and today more young people are earning college degrees than ever before. Race to the Top, with the help of governors from both parties, has helped states raise expectations and performance. Teachers and principals in schools from Tennessee to Washington, D.C., are making big strides in preparing students with the skills for the new economy \u2014 problem solving, critical thinking, science, technology, engineering, math.Now, some of this change is hard.It requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think, not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test. But it is worth it \u2014 and it is working.The problem is we\u2019re still not reaching enough kids, and we\u2019re not reaching them in time, and that has to change.Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child\u2019s life is high-quality early education. (Applause.) Last year, I asked this Congress to help states make high-quality pre-K available to every 4-year-old. And as a parent as well as a president, I repeat that request tonight.But in the meantime, 30 states have raised pre-k funding on their own. They know we can\u2019t wait. So just as we worked with states to reform our schools, this year we\u2019ll invest in new partnerships with states and communities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest children. And as Congress decides what it\u2019s going to do, I\u2019m going to pull together a coalition of elected officials, business leaders, and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high-quality pre-K that they need. (Applause.) It is right for America. We need to get this done.Last year, I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the next four years. Tonight I can announce that with the support of the FCC and companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sprint, and Verizon, we\u2019ve got a down payment to start connecting more than 15,000 schools and 20 million students over the next two years, without adding a dime to the deficit. (Cheers, applause.)We\u2019re working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training that can lead directly to a job and career. We\u2019re shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information and colleges more incentives to offer better value, so that no middle- class kid is priced out of a college education. We\u2019re offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to 10 percent of their income, and I want to work with Congress to see how we can help even more Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt. (Applause.)And I\u2019m reaching out to some of America\u2019s leading foundations and corporations on a new initiative to help more young men of color facing especially tough odds stay on track and reach their full potential.The bottom line is, Michelle and I want every child to have the same chance this country gave us. But we know our opportunity agenda won\u2019t be complete, and too many young people entering the workforce today will see the American Dream as an empty promise, unless we also do more to make sure our economy honors the dignity of work, and hard work pays off for every single American.You know, today, women make up about half our workforce, but they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. That is wrong, and in 2014, it\u2019s an embarrassment.Women deserve equal pay for equal work. (Cheers, applause.)You know, she deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job. (Cheers, applause.) A mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship. (Applause.) And you know what, a father does too. It is time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a \u201cMad Men\u201d episode. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) This year let\u2019s all come together, Congress, the White House, businesses from Wall Street to Main Street, to give every woman the opportunity she deserves, because I believe when women succeed, America succeeds. (Cheers, applause.)Now, women hold a majority of lower-wage jobs, but they\u2019re not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages. Americans understand that some people will earn more money than others, and we don\u2019t resent those who, by virtue of their efforts, achieve incredible success. That\u2019s what America\u2019s all about. But Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full-time should ever have to raise a family in poverty. (Applause.)In the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage, five states have passed laws to raise theirs.Many businesses have done it on their own. Nick Chute is here today with his boss, John Soranno. John\u2019s an owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis, and Nick helps make the dough. (Laughter.) Only now he makes more of it. (Laughter.) John just gave his employees a raise to 10 bucks an hour, and that\u2019s a decision that has eased their financial stress and boosted their morale.Tonight I ask more of America\u2019s business leaders to follow John\u2019s lead. Do what you can to raise your employees\u2019 wages. (Applause.) It\u2019s good for the economy; it\u2019s good for America. (Sustained applause.)To every mayor, governor, state legislator in America, I say, you don\u2019t have to wait for Congress to act; Americans will support you if you take this on. And as a chief executive, I intend to lead by example. Profitable corporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover. We should too. In the coming weeks I will issue an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally-funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour because if you cook \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 our troops\u2019 meals or wash their dishes, you should not have to live in poverty. (Sustained applause.)Of course, to reach millions more, Congress does need to get on board.Today the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here. And Tom Harkin and George Miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to $10.10. It\u2019s easy to remember: 10.10. This will help families. It will give businesses customers with more money to spend. It does not involve any new bureaucratic program. So join the rest of the country. Say yes. Give America a raise. (Cheers, applause.) Give \u2018em a raise.There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet, and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the Earned Income Tax Credit. Right now, it helps about half of all parents at some point. Think about that. It helps about half of all parents in America at some point in their lives.But I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it doesn\u2019t do enough for single workers who don\u2019t have kids. So let\u2019s work together to strengthen the credit, reward work, help more Americans get ahead.Let\u2019s do more to help Americans save for retirement. Today most workers don\u2019t have a pension. A Social Security check often isn\u2019t enough on its own. And while the stock market has doubled over the last five years, that doesn\u2019t help folks who don\u2019t have 401(k)s. That\u2019s why tomorrow I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings: MyRA. It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg.MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in. And if this Congress wants to help, work with me to fix an upside-down tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save, but does little or nothing for middle-class Americans, offer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job, so they can save at work just like everybody in this chamber can.And since the most important investment many families make is their home, send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again, and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations. (Applause.)One last point on financial security. For decades, few things exposed hard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system. And in case you haven\u2019t heard, we\u2019re in the process of fixing that. (Scattered laughter, applause.)Now -- a pre-existing condition used to mean that someone like Amanda Shelley, a physician\u2019s assistant and single mom from Arizona, couldn\u2019t get health insurance. But on January 1st, she got covered. (Applause.) On January 3rd, she felt a sharp pain. On January 6th, she had emergency surgery. Just one week earlier, Amanda said, that surgery would\u2019ve meant bankruptcy. That\u2019s what health insurance reform is all about, the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes, you don\u2019t have to lose everything.Already, because of the Affordable Care Act, more than 3 million Americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents\u2019 plans. (Applause.)More than 9 million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage \u2014 9 million. (Applause.)And here\u2019s another number: zero. Because of this law, no American, none, zero, can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a pre-existing condition like asthma or back pain or cancer. (Cheers, applause.) No woman can ever be charged more just because she\u2019s a woman. (Cheers, applause.) And we did all this while adding years to Medicare\u2019s finances, keeping Medicare premiums flat and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors.Now, I do not expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of this law. (Laughter.) (Chuckles.) (Laughter.) But I know that the American people are not interested in refighting old battles. So again, if you have specific plans to cut costs, cover more people, increase choice, tell America what you\u2019d do differently. Let\u2019s see if the numbers add up. (Applause.) But let\u2019s not have another 40- something votes to repeal a law that\u2019s already helping millions of Americans like Amanda.(Cheers, applause.) The first 40 were plenty. We all owe it to the American people to say what we\u2019re for, not just what we\u2019re against.And if you want to know the real impact this law is having, just talk to Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky, who\u2019s here tonight. Now, Kentucky\u2019s not the most liberal part of the country. That\u2019s not where I got my highest vote totals. (Laughter.) But he\u2019s like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth\u2019s families. They\u2019re our neighbors and our friends, he said. They\u2019re people we shop and go to church with -- farmers out on the tractor, grocery clerks. They\u2019re people who go to work every morning praying they don\u2019t get sick. No one deserves to live that way.Steve\u2019s right. That\u2019s why tonight I ask every American who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31st. Help them get covered. (Applause.) Moms, get on your kids to sign up. Kids, call your mom and walk her through the application. It\u2019ll give her some peace of mind, and plus, she\u2019ll appreciate hearing from you. (Laughter.)After all, that \u2014 that\u2019s the spirit that has always moved this nation forward.It\u2019s the spirit of citizenship, the recognition that through hard work and responsibility, we can pursue our individual dreams, but still come together as one American family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well.Citizenship means standing up for everyone\u2019s right to vote. (Applause.) Last year, part of the Voting Rights Act was weakened, but conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it. And the bipartisan commission I appointed, chaired by my campaign lawyer and Governor Romney\u2019s campaign lawyer, came together and have offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half-hour to vote. Let\u2019s support these efforts. It should be the power of our vote, not the size of our bank account, that drives our democracy. (Cheers, applause.)Citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day. I have seen the courage of parents, students, pastors, and police officers all over this country who say \u201cwe are not afraid,\u201d and I intend to keep trying, with or without Congress, to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters and our shopping malls, or schools like Sandy Hook. (Applause.)Citizenship demands a sense of common purpose; participation in the hard work of self-government; an obligation to serve to our communities.And I know this chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the United States armed forces. (Extended applause.) Thank you.Tonight, because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free, the United States is more secure. When I took office, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, all our troops are out of Iraq. More than 60,000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan. With Afghan forces now in the lead for their own security, our troops have moved to a support role. Together with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this year, and America\u2019s longest war will finally be over. (Applause.)After 2014, we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future.If the Afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated, a small force of Americans could remain in Afghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow missions: training and assisting Afghan forces and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of Al Qaeda. For while our relationship with Afghanistan will change, one thing will not: our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country. (Applause.)The fact is that danger remains. While we\u2019ve put Al Qaeda\u2019s core leadership on a path to defeat, the threat has evolved as Al Qaeda affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world. In Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, Mali, we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable these networks. In Syria, we\u2019ll support the opposition that rejects the agenda of terrorist networks. Here at home, we\u2019ll keep strengthening our defenses and combat new threats like cyberattacks. And as we reform our defense budget, we have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions. (Applause.)We have to remain vigilant.But I strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our outstanding military alone. As commander in chief, I have used force when needed to protect the American people, and I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold this office. But I will not send our troops into harm\u2019s way unless it is truly necessary, nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts. We must fight the battles \u2014 (applause) \u2014 that need to be fought, not those that terrorists prefer from us \u2014 large-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism.So even as we actively and aggressively pursue terrorist networks, through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners, America must move off a permanent war footing. (Applause.) That\u2019s why I\u2019ve imposed prudent limits on the use of drones, for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence.That\u2019s why, working with this Congress, I will reform our surveillance programs because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence, here and abroad, that privacy of ordinary people is not being violated. (Applause.) And with the Afghan war ending, this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay \u2014 (applause) \u2014 because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action but by remaining true to our constitutional ideals and setting an example for the rest of the world.You see, in a world of complex threats, our security, our leadership depends on all elements of our power \u2014 including strong and principled diplomacy. American diplomacy has rallied more than 50 countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands, and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on Cold War stockpiles.American diplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why Syria\u2019s chemical weapons are being eliminated. (Applause.) And we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the Syrian people deserve \u2014 a future free of dictatorship, terror and fear.As we speak, American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they engage in the difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there; to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians, and lasting peace and security for the state of Israel \u2014 a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side. (Applause.)And it is American diplomacy, backed by pressure, that has halted the progress of Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2014 and rolled back parts of that program \u2014 for the very first time in a decade. As we gather here tonight, Iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium.It\u2019s not installing advanced centrifuges. Unprecedented inspections help the world verify every day that Iran is not building a bomb. And with our allies and partners, we\u2019re engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share: preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. (Applause.)These negotiations will be difficult; they may not succeed. We are cleareyed about Iran\u2019s support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, which threaten our allies; and we\u2019re clear about the mistrust between our nations, mistrust that cannot be wished away. But these negotiations don\u2019t rely on trust; any long-term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb. If John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union, then surely a strong and confident America can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today. (Applause.)The sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible. But let me be clear: if this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto it. (Applause.) For the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed.(Applause.) If Iran\u2019s leaders do not seize this opportunity, then I will be the first to call for more sanctions and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon. But if Iran\u2019s leaders do seize the chance \u2014 and we\u2019ll know soon enough \u2014 then Iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations, and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war.And finally, let\u2019s remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe, to forge greater cooperation, to expand new markets, to free people from fear and want. And no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than America.Our alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever known. From Tunisia to Burma, we\u2019re supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy. In Ukraine, we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully and to have a say in their country\u2019s future. Across Africa, we\u2019re bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty. In the Americas, we\u2019re building new ties of commerce, but we\u2019re also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people.And we will continue to focus on the Asia-Pacific, where we support our allies, shape a future of greater security and prosperity and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster, as we did in the Philippines, when our Marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon, and were greeted with words like, \u201cWe will never forget your kindness\u201d and \u201cGod bless America.\u201dWe do these things because they help promote our long-term security. And we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being, regardless of race or religion, creed or sexual orientation. And next week the world will see one expression of that commitment when Team USA marches the red, white and blue into the Olympic stadium and brings home the gold. (Cheers, applause.)My fellow Americans, no other country in the world does what we do. On every issue, the world turns to us, not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might but because of the ideals we stand for and the burdens we bear to advance them.No one knows this better than those who serve in uniform. As this time of war draws to a close, a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life. We\u2019ll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they\u2019ve earned and our wounded warriors receive the health care -- including the mental health care -- that they need. (Applause.) We\u2019ll keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home, and we will all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families.Let me tell you about one of those families I\u2019ve come to know.I first met Cory Remsburg, a proud Army Ranger, at Omaha Beach on the 65th anniversary of D-Day. Along with some of his fellow Rangers, he walked me through the program, the ceremony. He was a strong, impressive young man, had an easy manner. He was sharp as a tack. And we joked around, and took pictures, and I told him to stay in touch.A few months later, on his 10th deployment, Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan. His comrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain.For months, he lay in a coma. And the next time I met him, in the hospital, he couldn\u2019t speak; he could barely move. Over the years, he\u2019s endured dozens of surgeries and procedures, hours of grueling rehab every day.Even now, Cory is still blind in one eye. He still struggles on his left side. But slowly, steadily, with the support of caregivers like his dad Craig, and the community around him, Cory has grown stronger. Day by day, he\u2019s learned to speak again and stand again and walk again, and he\u2019s working toward the day when he can serve his country again.\u201cMy recovery has not been easy,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing in life that\u2019s worth anything is easy.\u201dCory is here tonight. And like the Army he loves, like the America he serves, Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit. (Cheers, applause.) Cory. (Extended cheers and applause.)My fellow Americans \u2014 my fellow Americans, men and women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy. Our freedom, our democracy, has never been easy. Sometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged.But for more than two hundred years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress: to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement; to free other nations from tyranny and fear; to promote justice and fairness and equality under the law, so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen.The America we want for our kids \u2014 a rising America where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong; where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us \u2014 none of it is easy. But if we work together; if we summon what is best in us, the way Cory summoned what is best in him, with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow, I know it\u2019s within our reach.Believe it.God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Stellar Quarter, Three Funds That Went Over the Top", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEARLY every style of stock fund rose in the fourth quarter of 2013, and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index continued its long sprint, returning 9.9 percent. But the stewards of three of the top-performing mutual funds beat even that heady return, finding gains in sectors as diverse as trucking, technology and automotive paint shops. Hauling ProfitsMr. Henning is a generalist \u2014 meaning that his fund can invest in any sector \u2014 but he has lately favored old-school fare. The portfolio, which contained 30 stocks at the end of September, was heavy on energy and industrial companies, like DXP Enterprises, an industrial equipment maker, and light on technology names. Mr. Henning has been buying shares of Saia, a trucking company, since 2003, after it was spun off by YRC Worldwide, another freight hauler.He said he likes truckers because their revenue tends to grow with the economy. The better ones also have pricing power when the economy slows because weaker players will go out of business, he said, and the remaining outfits can raise rates.The fund\u2019s expenses are high, with an expense ratio of 2.71 percent. That compares with an average of 1.37 percent for stock funds followed by Morningstar. Investors have been attracted to the fund: it recently reached $211.6 million in assets, compared with $92.5 million at the end of 2012; that should bring economies of scale, and so, he said, the ratio should fall. The fund\u2019s long-term performance also partly justifies its high cost, Mr. Henning said. The fund \u201cis not a closet index fund \u2014 our returns have come from stock picking,\u201d he said. Morningstar ranks it as the best performer in its niche of small-cap blend funds over the last decade.Mr. Henning has run the fund since 1993, starting it after a career in insurance, where he helped the Chubb Group start its first variable annuity life insurance policy. That piqued an interest in investing. Since then, the fund has returned an annualized average of 11.45 percent. It returned 14.29 percent in the fourth quarter. Tech and Low TurnoverIn some ways, though, his style resembles Mr. Henning\u2019s. Mr. Shafran too, holds fewer stocks than average \u2014 58 at the end of November \u2014 and often clings to them. The fund\u2019s recent turnover ratio was 50 percent, versus nearly 140 percent for the average technology fund tracked by Morningstar. The portfolio\u2019s holdings in September \u2014 the last reported list \u2014 included two stocks with more than a decade of history in the fund: Euronet Worldwide and Samsung Electronics. Mr. Shafran has also favored health care stocks more than many other tech managers; his health care stake was nearly five times that of the average tech fund tracked by Morningstar. \u201cNo sector is off limits,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for growth that\u2019s technology driven, and we find opportunities in every sector and every geography.\u201d He surmised that retail was the only sector where the fund had not invested in his 12-year tenure.A recent bet was Qiwi, which processes electronic payments in Russia and Ukraine. Mr. Shafran invested because of Qiwi\u2019s strong market position and its partnership with Visa to create the Visa Qiwi Wallet, a payment app for smartphones. According to its last report, the fund was also invested in Brazil, China, India and South Korea. Most technology funds hew more closely to the developed world.One of the fund\u2019s more typical tech holdings was Cree, at nearly 5 percent of the portfolio at the end of November. Cree makes light-emitting diodes, \u201ctaking a systems-based approach\u201d by building light bulbs and arrays, Mr. Shafran said. \u201cLED lighting makes more sense every day \u2014 the technology is getting better, and that\u2019s continuing to drive the cost down,\u201d he said.The Y shares of his fund, which are available to institutional investors, have an expense ratio of 1.01 percent and returned 13.9 percent in the fourth quarter. An Eye on MispricingHe said he trades more often than average because he bases his approach on behavioral economics, which studies the ways that people depart from economic orthodoxy in decision-making. A main behavioral finding is that people exhibit confirmation bias, giving greater credence to information that supports their beliefs and less to contradictory information. This bias can create temporary stock mispricings, he said. When a company reports higher earnings than the analyst consensus, some investors won\u2019t immediately update their views, he said. Weeks or months can pass before the stock price fully reflects the new information. Mr. Scherschmidt sells once the price has adjusted. \u201cThe tendency to stick to established beliefs is one of the most ingrained human tendencies,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when companies are undergoing change, analysts have a tendency to discount information that disagrees with their established views.\u201dEarnings surprises are only part of his formula. He also scrutinizes company fundamentals, screening the markets in which he invests \u2014 mainly developed countries abroad \u2014 for businesses with improving prospects. The companies may be introducing a promising product or technology, entering a market or undergoing a restructuring. Usually, he will sell once a stock\u2019s price has doubled. Occasionally, he will hang on if he expects improvements. Such has been his experience with Duerr, a German maker of equipment and software for automakers\u2019 paint shops. The fund first bought the stock in 2010.Mr. Scherschmidt said he liked Duerr because it sells hardware and software, which isn\u2019t typical in its niche, and because its technology uses less energy than competing ones. The company has shown multiyear, double-digit growth in emerging markets like China and has reported higher operating margins, he said. He began managing the fund in 2007. It has an expense ratio of 1.6 percent and returned 12.66 percent in the fourth quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Harder Look at Welfare Rules as Europeans Flood Countries in Search of Jobs", "Date": "2014-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 When she arrived in Britain a decade ago from Poland, Justyna Mikler worked hard to find cleaning jobs, studied English and, she says, never even thought of applying for welfare.Now the director of a cleaning firm, Ms. Mikler estimates that about a third of the more than 50 Poles she employs claim some form of benefits from the British state.\u201cThe system allows them to do it so easily \u2014 it\u2019s a nonsense,\u201d she said, speaking over a late lunch of soup in a cafe at a Polish center in West London.As part of the 28-nation European Union, Polish citizens have most of the same welfare rights here as Britons, under a European Union policy designed to foster European integration and create a vibrant economic market with mobile workers.Instead, it seems to be driving Europeans apart.At a time when some governments\u2019 austerity policies have led to deep spending cuts, Europe\u2019s ill-tempered debate over immigration has become intertwined with an equally thorny discussion of the costs of welfare, especially after Romanians and Bulgarians gained full access across European labor markets this year.Benefits in Britain may be higher than in former Communist countries now part of the European Union, but they are not especially generous by Western European standards. Yet access to them is relatively easy, for workers as well as the jobless, and, unlike in some European countries, they are not usually based on claimants\u2019 previous social security contributions.More recent suggestions of curbs brought an acid response from Radoslaw Sikorski, Poland\u2019s foreign minister, who, like Mr. Cameron, was educated at Oxford University and was even a member there of the same elite club, the Bullingdon.Nevertheless, rules that allow people to move freely throughout the European Union and give them equal rights are being questioned for the first time in years.The debate in Britain is particularly fevered in part because a government study commissioned before eight former Communist countries were admitted to the Union in 2004 hugely underestimated immigration from Eastern Europe, suggesting there would be 5,000 to 13,000 arrivals a year up to 2010. But only two other European Union nations, Ireland and Sweden, opened their labor markets in 2004, so Britain saw a surge in immigration. A 2011 census listed 521,000 Polish-born people as residents in Britain, the vast majority having arrived after 2004.Most economists believe this influx of mainly young and highly motivated workers gave a lift to the British economy. Studies have shown that such workers pay more in tax and social security into host countries\u2019 budgets than they receive in benefits.But, given the numbers in Britain, it is little surprise that strains in Europe\u2019s welfare architecture are appearing here. Because it was a previous, Labour government that eased restrictions on Eastern European workers, the current Conservative-led administration can reject blame.The hottest welfare issue is payments to parents, which can be claimed even if children are living in another European nation. In Britain, Child Benefit, as it is known, is worth 20.30 pounds, or about $33.40, per week for a first child and 13.40 pounds for subsequent ones. According to British figures, in December 2012 there were Child Benefit awards to 24,082 parents for 40,171 children living elsewhere in Europe, including 25,659 children in Poland.Mr. Cameron wants to reduce or end such benefits for children living abroad, and has suggested limiting the right of migrants to come to Britain if the average income of their home country is far below the European average.Several other European Union countries have similar benefits for children and therefore share Britain\u2019s worries, or have broader concerns about \u201cwelfare tourism,\u201d in which people move abroad to secure payments. Britain says it is working with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and others on possible changes.But the British have special reasons to worry because of the design of the rest of their benefits system. Forged after World War II, the British welfare state is financed mainly from general taxation and is built on the idea that those in need should receive similar amounts, regardless of what they have paid in social security contributions.Its architect, William Beveridge, sought to eliminate poverty, protecting Britons from the \u201ccradle to the grave,\u201d but he could not have foreseen a Europe with a shifting population of mobile workers.The report says those who lose jobs in France, Denmark or Germany can expect to receive 40 percent to 90 percent of their net salary for a specified period, much of it financed by compulsory social insurance or employer contributions. In Britain, the jobless receive a maximum 71.70 pounds per week for six months, however much they have paid in contributions.\u201cBy Western European standards the British system is not very generous in terms of the amount you can claim, though of course this is more than in Eastern Europe,\u201d said Stephen Booth, the research director of Open Europe, who helped draft the report, \u201cbut it\u2019s very generous in terms of giving access to the benefits.\u201dWlodzimierz Mier-Jedrzejowicz, vice-chairman of the Federation of Poles in Britain, said Polish people overwhelmingly came to Britain to work, not to collect social security.\u201cThose who work and do pay taxes frequently claim the benefits they are allowed to,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is legitimate. If the British government feels it is inappropriate, then it is up to them to put in place the appropriate legislation.\u201dStill, the availability of benefits has become a factor and, according to one Polish builder in London, who asked not to be named for fear of the reaction within the community, may have changed the mind-set of recent Polish arrivals in Britain.\u201cTwelve years ago, if somebody wanted to come to England, they knew they had to work hard,\u201d he said. \u201cNow if people come to England they ask, \u2018How soon can I get benefits?\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Central African Leader\u2019s Exit Sets Off Rejoicing in the Streets", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGUI, Central African Republic \u2014 Joyful crowds poured onto the streets of this capital on Friday after the president of the strife-torn Central African Republic resigned under pressure from regional leaders.Singing, dancing on the wide avenues, waving palm fronds and shouting slogans against the departing president, Michel Djotodia, the crowds briefly put a celebratory face on a battered city that has known mostly violence, upheaval and grief over the past year.Mr. Djotodia, whose chaotic nine-month rule has been marked by the abuses of his mostly Muslim rebel movement, was pushed out after being summoned to neighboring Chad by its president, Idriss D\u00e9by Itno, a regional power broker who, along with other neighboring leaders, criticized him for failing to stop the continued sectarian violence in the country.Mr. Djotodia\u2019s rebels descended from the country\u2019s remote north in March, overthrowing the government and unleashing what residents in the largely Christian south here have described as a reign of terror, including looting, killing and kidnapping.Last month, Christian militias struck back. About 1,000 people have been killed, according to some estimates, and nearly a million have fled their homes as a result of the violence pitting Muslims against Christians, and northerners against southerners.\u201cOur country has never lived through anything like this,\u201d Alexandre Ferdinand Nguendet, the Parliament leader who was named Friday to serve as interim president, said in an interview in Ndjamena, the Chadian capital, where the country\u2019s leaders were meeting.Noting that civil servants had not been paid in at least three months, Mr. Nguendet said the country was ready to \u201cexplode.\u201d He will serve for two weeks until a new \u201ctransitional president\u201d is chosen by the temporary Parliament.Residents hoped Mr. Djotodia\u2019s exit would be a turning point in the fortunes of their country, which has seen more coups and episodes of violence than free elections since it gained independence from France in 1960.But pent-up anger over months of repression was still evident. Crowds rushed to loot a store owned by Muslims, and members of Mr. Djotodia\u2019s rebel group, Seleka, were pursued in the streets. The Muslim prayer ritual was mocked in the streets.\u201cWe are liberated,\u201d yelled Ela Bozo, a market seller, dancing a jig.\u201cHe\u2019s killed a lot of Central Africans, and he certainly targeted the Christians much more; he\u2019s a devil,\u201d said Thibault Bomako, a 27-year-old student.\u201cIt\u2019s a great day for all Central Africans,\u201d said Olivier Sandos Oualanga, a 27-year-old law student. \u201cWe are really, really happy. And we will really celebrate when all the Seleka leave.\u201dMr. D\u00e9by, who is often accused of meddling in his much poorer neighbor\u2019s affairs, made it clear that he was fed up with Mr. Djotodia\u2019s handling of his own Muslim rebels and of the increasingly violent reaction against them by Christian militia groups.Chadians residing in the Central African Republic have been among the victims; thousands of Mr. D\u00e9by\u2019s Muslim citizens have been forced to flee the country. Revenge attacks against Muslims take place almost daily here.This week, Mr. D\u00e9by convened other regional presidents, as well as Mr. Djotodia, in Ndjamena to attempt a resolution of the crisis afflicting his neighbor. The conference accepted Mr. Djotodia\u2019s \u201cresignation\u201d in a statement on Friday, calling it a \u201chighly patriotic decision to end the country\u2019s paralysis,\u201d and blasting the \u201cpassivity of the Central African political class faced with the crisis which has gripped the country.\u201dMr. D\u00e9by even took the unusual step of flying the entire membership of the country\u2019s transitional Parliament of 135 members to Ndjamena on Thursday night from Bangui, forcing them to work until the early hours of the morning Friday to come up with a solution.Diplomats, opposition figures and analysts, conscious of enormous challenges facing the country \u2014 an economy that has stopped functioning, schools that have been closed for months, thousands of refugees and daily outbreaks of sectarian violence \u2014 greeted the news of Mr. Djotodia\u2019s departure warily.\u201cThis certainly shows a desire to step forward,\u201d said Martin Zigu\u00e9l\u00e9, a former prime minister. \u201cWill it be effective and productive? We\u2019ll know in the coming days. We are in a catastrophic situation.\u201dReconciliation may not be easy. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got to detain the Seleka, and those who committed abuses must answer for them,\u201d said Parfait D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Zoga, a shopkeeper.Mr. Djotodia insisted that he was not eager to stay in power and was merely preparing the way for future elections. But he barricaded himself in his military camp high above the capital, and advisers had insisted that he was going to stay on.On Friday morning, as people in Bangui awaited the news from Chad, residents took to the streets to proclaim their hatred of Mr. Djotodia, and their eagerness to see his departure.\u201cYou take power and then you kill for nine months? That\u2019s no good,\u201d said one of the demonstrators, Guy-Roger Nambana, an artisan, as French soldiers watched warily. \u201cHe\u2019s got to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Slavery and Its Foes Thrived in Brooklyn", "Date": "2014-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExhibition Review\u201cBrooklyn Abolitionists/In Pursuit of Freedom,\u201d at the Brooklyn Historical Society, puts a spotlight on unsung heroes of the antislavery movement.Heroic terra-cotta busts of Columbus, Franklin, Shakespeare, Gutenberg, Beethoven and Michelangelo gaze down from the lovingly restored 1881 facade of the Brooklyn Historical Society, reminding the approaching visitor of what the place was once meant to represent. The founders of the society \u2014 which is now celebrating its 150th anniversary \u2014 conceived of its building in Brooklyn Heights as a repository of history that would aspire to the greatest achievements of European civilization. And why not? Brooklyn was the third-largest city in the United States, the architect was George B. Post (who later designed the New York Stock Exchange), and the society\u2019s founders were among the elite.These are extraordinary figures all, and the exhibition, with less than 2,000 square feet of space, is really too small for them, for their compatriots and for the theme they illustrate: that the history of slavery and abolition in New York, through the Civil War, cannot be understood without considering the importance of Brooklyn. But however small, the exhibition deserves attention, both for its subject and for what it reflects about the historical society\u2019s evolution under its president, Deborah Schwartz. The show is presented in a new gallery created as part of a $5.5 million project that also opened up classroom space, supplementing a $23 million renovation of the landmark building that began in 1999. Public programming is being expanded in a new auditorium; an education program has also grown.\u00a0And until the spring, a printed 1864 copy of the Emancipation Proclamation, signed by Lincoln, is also on display, accompanied by a selection of the condemnations and acclamations that greeted the document.The abolitionist exhibition itself is a declaration of future intentions: It unveils an area only recently explored in the society\u2019s own holdings (which include some 100,000 volumes, 60,000 photographs, more than 2,000 maps and atlases, along with oral histories, films and family genealogies \u2014 which can be sampled in a stunning landmark wood-paneled library). In 1790, we learn, about a third of the population of Kings County (now Brooklyn) was black, and nearly all of those people were enslaved. But if slavery declined in many Northern cities after the Revolution, in Kings County, it \u201cstrengthened\u201d because it was crucial for the agricultural economy. \u201cSixty percent of white Brooklynites,\u201d we are told, were slaveholders (though, since Kings County consisted of six towns \u2014 Brooklyn, Bushwick, Flatbush, Flatlands, Gravesend and New Utrecht \u2014 it is unclear if the statistic refers to a part or the whole). We learn, through a timeline, of the freeing of slaves by 1827, of the breaking up of farmland, of the 1837 recession that brought down real estate prices and allowed many blacks to buy land, and of the growth of Brooklyn\u2019s waterfront, which resembled Manhattan\u2019s in the importance of sugar, tobacco and cotton \u2014 all associated with slave labor. \u201cBy 1857,\u201d a wall label tells us, \u201cBrooklyn was central to the business of slavery\u201d (an overstatement, surely, but we are uncertain because few details are offered). There is so much here that is important that it often exasperates that only minimal text bites are provided, as if anything more would get in the way. Why doesn\u2019t the exhibition give us detail about Weeksville, for example, which was a community with more than 500 residents in 1855, supporting two newspapers, several churches, an orphan asylum and a home for the aged? On many subjects, we have to seek out documents arrayed in reproduction on dowels, like racks of newspapers \u2014 almost as if reading were being caricatured as old-fashioned. It would have helped, too, to have a clearer exposition of debates within the abolitionist world, or how black and white groups interacted. The style of the exhibition ends up leaving us with impressions rather than a coherent narrative. And some of the figures, like Pennington, are so remarkable that it is a puzzle that they are not brought more vividly to life: His eyewitness reports on the New York City 1863 draft riots, for example, are chilling and would have added to the exhibition. Meanwhile, the 15-year-old Maritcha Lyons\u2019s fleeing of those attacks for Brooklyn\u2019s safety is almost the only thing we learn about her \u2014 not that at the age of 16, after moving to Rhode Island, she stood before the state legislature and successfully argued for the admission of blacks to Providence public schools. One more thing: The language often verges on clich\u00e9. The exhibition, we read, tells part of \u201cthe history of social justice.\u201d Blacks in Brooklyn \u201cactively resisted their oppression\u201d and \u201cbirthed Brooklyn\u2019s antislavery movement.\u201d A community is \u201cmobilized.\u201d Abolitionists \u201cpursued their revolutionary vision.\u201d And after Reconstruction\u2019s failures, \u201cactivists in Brooklyn and beyond continued the struggle for social justice.\u201d None of these formulaic phrases illuminates the history. Instead, they seem inserted to rally contemporary passions. A concluding panel is titled \u201cThe Struggle Continues.\u201d We are told that the \u201cstruggle for freedom and justice continues today\u201d and that \u201cincreasingly, urban communities across the world have taken to the streets demanding a fair and democratic society. Equality in housing, health care, education, employment, food and safety are just some of the issues at stake.\u201d But this invocation of unspecified street demonstrations and a sweeping roster of issues leaves us unsure of precisely what is being alluded to or what it has to do with abolition and slavery. These attempts to create a vital institution are intriguing \u2014 and the society invites multiple visits \u2014 but current-day tastes and a preoccupation with \u201cactivist\u201d politics are only a part of the story. While this approach is meant to be recompense for previous neglect, the busts on the facade remind us that a more ambitious and complete history of Brooklyn and its people is yet to come.

{"Headline": "A Super Bowl Estimate With a Life of Its Own", "Date": "2014-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThe Super Bowl will be just great for New York and New Jersey! That\u2019s what the National Football League and local tourism officials and politicians say, anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a huge economic boon,\u201d Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, the New York Democrat, declared in a celebratory Times Square news conference earlier this month. Super Bowl revelers will generate $550 million to $600 million for the local economy, according to a variety of sources, including Ms. Maloney\u2019s office and N.F.L. officials.Those numbers sound big, round and fairly specific. There\u2019s a problem, though: Where do they actually come from?Unfortunately, I\u2019ve been unable to come up with a clear answer. Everyone who cites that estimate credits someone else for producing it. Which is perhaps not unexpected, because virtually every time a government or athletic organization describes the economic benefits of hosting a major sports event, economists pick apart the calculations as flawed, myopic or outright fraudulent.Usually the criticism is that the number leaves out all kinds of costs, both direct (like security, sanitation and transportation, typically paid for by taxpayers) and indirect (such as what kinds of economic activity and tourism did not happen because the area was snarled with football traffic). The method used to estimate the local benefit for New Orleans, host for the Super Bowl last year, for example, was widely mocked. This time around, of course, there is not even a silly method to mock.Frigid February is usually a slow month for the Big Apple tourism industry, which means that the Super Bowl will probably bring some net increase in visitors. On the other hand, in warm-weather cities like Miami, football tourists probably just displace non-football tourists.Whatever the overall gains, they are concentrated among a few beneficiaries \u2014 like hotels or, most obviously, the N.F.L. itself, which has been given a gigantic stage upon which to project lucrative ads and sell the commemorative paraphernalia it licenses. In other words, the sporting event represents a huge transfer of funds from taxpayers to a handful of special interests.This is the standard assessment for almost any event for which governments bear the costs, including Super Bowls, Olympic Games and World Cups. So a question inevitably arises: Why exactly do governments fall for these pitches again and again? Why would they ever believe that it was in their best interest to host a major athletic event given the limited economic benefits, if any even exist?While a few small interests have a lot to gain, the costs are spread out over a large group of people (that is, taxpayers). The concentrated group of beneficiaries is much more motivated to lobby for their desired outcome than the more diffuse, disorganized group hurt by it. This is a classic political economy problem that occurs with many public policy decisions. (Imposing a sugar tariff, for example, might enrich a small cadre of sugar barons but raise the cost of doughnuts a teeny amount for everyone else.)Politicians may be predisposed to side with the smaller interests that enjoy more noticeable gains, for reasons related to both fund-raising and egos.There is the possibility that politicians and their constituents aren\u2019t being hoodwinked at all: They know deep down that they will lose money, and they don\u2019t care. They just want to have a party. There is, after all, some evidence that hosting a sports event brings more intangible, happiness-related benefits not captured by actual economic activity like consumer spending, and maybe that is good enough; we are spending money to swell spirits, not wallets. And perhaps that is even relevant for other, less-sung-about cities than New York. In these places, which do not claim to be the capital of the world, hosting a sports event achieves political, nonfinancial goals, like \u201cputting us on the map,\u201d or naked propaganda. Think of all the emerging economies \u2014 China, Qatar, Brazil \u2014 willing to build lavish, financially unjustifiable facilities to win bids for prominent athletic events.None of this, of course, excuses the endless repetition of sloppy economic impact numbers. Nor does it take into account alternative uses for these partying funds: improving schools and roads, easing tax burdens, whatever. You know, the bread, rather than the circuses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan and India Sign Energy and Telecommunications Agreements", "Date": "2014-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 India and Japan have signed agreements on cooperation in areas including energy and telecommunications during the visit by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to New Delhi, the countries said over the weekend.Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India held talks with Mr. Abe on Saturday and said that India was taking steps to facilitate Japan\u2019s links with India\u2019s growing economy.Mr. Singh said that India was also discussing with Japan the possibility of buying an amphibious aircraft called the US-2 and co-producing it in India. \u201cMore broadly, we are working toward increasing our cooperation in the area of advanced technologies,\u201d he said. Mr. Abe arrived in New Delhi on Saturday for a three-day visit. He was the chief guest at India\u2019s Republic Day celebrations on Sunday.Japan is eager to increase exports of atomic technology to help revive its economy.\u201cOur negotiations toward an agreement for cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy have gained momentum in the last few months,\u201d Mr. Singh said Saturday. Japan\u2019s sales of nuclear equipment and technology to India have been hampered by sensitivity in Japan over India\u2019s atomic tests and refusal to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.India has announced a moratorium on further nuclear testing, but Japan also wants a clearer commitment from New Delhi.India is seeking to cultivate closer ties with Japan and other Asian countries while upgrading its military capabilities, partly in response to a perceived challenge from China and also neighboring Pakistan.Under the agreements, Japan will provide a loan to increase power generation in India and help India enhance energy efficiency in the telecommunication towers in the country.Japan offered loans for the New Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor project and for high-speed rail systems in India, the two countries said in a news release. Japan agreed to lend $113 million for reconstruction work in a northern Indian state devastated by floods last year, $14.6 million to a children\u2019s hospital in southern India and nearly $2 billion for the expansion of New Delhi\u2019s Metro train services, the statement said.

{"Headline": "Program to End Homelessness Among Veterans Reaches a Milestone in Arizona", "Date": "2014-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHOENIX \u2014 Their descent into homelessness began almost as soon as they had closed a dignified chapter in their lives: their military service.Dexter Mackenstadt, 63, a sailor who spent the Vietnam War tracking submarines along the East Coast, slipped into alcoholism. Robert Stone, 56, who spent three years stationed at naval bases in California, fell to that, too, and to a failing heart. John Hankins, 52, who repaired intercontinental ballistic missiles at an Air Force base in Wyoming, spent years as a drifter, living in a methamphetamine lab in the Arizona desert.In 2011, by a city count, there were 222 chronically homeless veterans here, a vulnerable, hard-to-reach population of mostly middle-age men, virtually all battling some type of physical or mental ailment along with substance abuse. Federal and city officials acknowledged that was not an exact number, but it is widely regarded as the best measure of the veteran population.Last month, the last 41 members of that group were placed in temporary housing. Shane Groen, a director at the Arizona Coalition to End Homelessness, one of the city\u2019s partners in the program, said the goal was to have them all in permanent housing by Feb. 14.Mr. Stone said, \u201cI\u2019m coming up on nine months sober, and a big part of it is because I have a roof over my head.\u201d He lived on the streets off and on for 15 years until he moved into an apartment here in March.Arizona has more homeless veterans than most other states \u2014 roughly one in five homeless adults, according to statistics from the state\u2019s Department of Veterans\u2019 Services. In an interview, Greg Stanton, the mayor of Phoenix and a longtime proponent of increasing investment and partnerships on homeless outreach, characterized the recent achievement as \u201cimportant because we\u2019re helping people in need, but also important because it helps our economy.\u201dAcross the country, the strategy is centered on an approach called Housing First, through which a home is not treated as a reward for good behavior. As Ms. Zeilinger put it, it is instead \u201cthe platform of stability that lets previously homeless people work on the other issues they\u2019re facing,\u201d like mental illness and addiction, which are particularly common among the chronically homeless. The term is defined as those who have continuously lived on the streets for a year or have done so at least four times over three years.There is also the challenge of sustaining the investment, given the steady stream of soldiers back from Iraq and Afghanistan who have been ending up on the streets.\u201cThe question,\u201d said Mr. Peck, who served in the Marine Corps in Vietnam, \u201cis how we create enough housing units to house those who are homeless and where we find the money to provide all the services that are essential to keep them in those units.\u201dIn cities like Philadelphia and Salt Lake City, private donors and religious groups have helped pay for the types of expenses not covered by the vouchers, like furniture and security deposits. Here the United Way is funding 14 workers known as navigators, who have been deployed to walk the veterans through the confusing process of applying for benefits and housing. One of them, James Roberson, 57, who served in the Navy in the Persian Gulf, said the job also involved more mundane tasks, like making sure the veterans had food at home, that they were clean and that their apartments were in order.Patience is crucial, he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t force things on people who have been on the streets so long,\u201d he said. \u201cThey won\u2019t take it.\u201dWhile the retention rate for homeless veterans placed in permanent housing stood at 85 percent nationally after one year, a survey by the Arizona Coalition to End Homelessness put it at 94 percent in Phoenix, a success attributed largely to the navigator program.Mr. Hankins, the former airman, was homeless for six years when a Veterans Affairs social worker stationed at the agency where he had gone to recharge his food stamps card pulled him aside and offered to help. He is one of eight clients of Mr. Roberson\u2019s at Victory Place.\u201cIf I had to do this on my own,\u201d Mr. Hankins said one recent morning as he strolled in Victory Place, \u201cI\u2019d never have made it here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Pushback, Indonesia Is Likely to Ease Ban on Mineral Exports", "Date": "2014-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Indonesia banned all mineral ore exports, as expected, on Sunday, but it will probably permit some major United States mining companies to continue to ship billions of dollars worth of copper overseas. In one of his biggest economic policy decisions since taking office nearly 10 years ago, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono approved a last-minute regulation that would most likely ease the ban\u2019s impact for major mining companies like Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold and the Newmont Mining Corporation. Details of the regulation were not immediately released. Indonesia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of nickel ore, refined tin and thermal coal and home to the fifth-largest copper mine and the top gold mine. Mineral shipments totaled $10.4 billion in 2012, or around 5 percent of Indonesia\u2019s exports, according to the World Bank. The ban aims to bolster Indonesia\u2019s long-term return from its mineral wealth by forcing miners to process their ores domestically. But officials fear that a short-term cut in foreign revenue could widen the current account deficit, which has undermined investor confidence and battered the rupiah, the country\u2019s currency.\u201cStarting at midnight on Jan. 12, 2014, raw ore definitely cannot be exported,\u201d the energy and mines minister, Jero Wacik, told reporters shortly after a marathon meeting with the president and cabinet ministers. Companies that can process the ore, however, will be permitted to export those minerals. \u201cNot only Freeport and Newmont, but we have 66 companies that have said they will build smelters,\u201d Mr. Wacik said. He added that those companies would \u201cget a chance to export processed minerals.\u201d The impact of the ban will probably be felt most keenly by the hundreds of small domestic miners that cannot afford to build a smelter, which can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The uncertainty over the ban led Freeport, Indonesia\u2019s top copper producer, to halt exports until the government provides clarity on which minerals can be shipped, a union official said.\u201cThere will be no concentrate exports from Freeport Indonesia in Papua as long as there is no government policy providing certainty on concentrate exports,\u201d the official, Virgo Solossa, said, referring to the province where Freeport\u2019s Grasberg mine is. He said the company had not made a shipment from its port since Dec. 15.A Freeport spokeswoman, Daisy Primayanti, said the company continued to provide copper to its local smelter for use domestically.Freeport, which holds a 73 percent market share in Indonesia\u2019s copper production, warned last month that unless the ban was revised, it could reduce output at the Grasberg mine by 60 percent and lead the company to lay off half of its 15,000 Indonesian employees.Under the proposed regulation that was being reviewed by President Yudhoyono, Freeport, Newmont Mining and other miners would still be allowed to export copper, manganese, lead, zinc and iron ore concentrate until 2017. But nickel ore and bauxite exports worth more than $2 billion annually would still be banned. Coal and tin shipments would not be affected.It was not immediately clear whether the final regulation had been revised.\u201cIn our discussion, our considerations were first about the work force, which shouldn\u2019t face mass layoffs,\u201d Mr. Wacik, the energy and mines minister, said.\u201cSecond was about the local economy, so it doesn\u2019t face any burden from the new regulations. Then, domestic companies should be allowed to continue operating.\u201dMore than 100 mining companies have been forced to reduce or shut down operations because of the uncertainty surrounding the mineral export ban.A major economic impact could make the ban a major issue in this year\u2019s legislative and presidential elections.Thousands of mine workers have already been laid off ahead of the ban, setting off protests in Jakarta. Police have been stationed at ports and around mines to secure those places in case of public disturbances, a spokesman for the national police said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Window Is Opening for Change in Tax Code", "Date": "2014-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceCould this be the year that a comprehensive tax reform law is passed by Congress and signed by President Obama?On the face of it, the very idea sounds absurd. To call the current Congress dysfunctional would be an understatement. Simply reaching a budget compromise this week was viewed as a surprising accomplishment.Moreover, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Dave Camp of Michigan, faces a deadline. Under Republican caucus rules, he must step down as chairman at the end of this year.Until recently, it appeared his Senate counterpart, Max Baucus of Montana, faced a similar deadline. He had announced plans to retire at the end of this Congress. But Senator Baucus will now leave far sooner than that. He has been nominated to be ambassador to China and will leave the Senate after he is confirmed. The new chairman of the Finance Committee will be Ron Wyden of Oregon.That could be interesting. Few senators have shown as much eagerness to work across the aisle as he has. He has been pushing his own tax plan in concert with Senator Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana. That plan at least broadly follows the lines of any tax overhaul now possible: a reduction in stated tax rates, with the loss in revenue made up by closing loopholes and exemptions.That plan is not, it must be said, a profile in courage. It goes after some loopholes and preferences but not enough of them to justify the cuts in rates that are included in the proposal. He is more specific than some, however, in saying that he would end the practice of not counting as income the value of employee fringe benefits. That would substantially raise the reported income of a lot of people and would not be popular with many, including labor unions. Even so, the net result of the plan, according to an analysis done by the Joint Committee on Taxation in 2011, would have been to lose revenue.That is not what we need now. Federal tax revenue in recent years has been at historical lows, at least as measured by a percentage of gross domestic product. One cause of that was the Great Recession, but it was not the only one. The fundamental problem was that the Bush tax cuts of 2001 were too great. Tax revenue soared in the late 1990s, for reasons that were not well understood. The economic analysis supporting the cuts simply overestimated how much revenue would come in during future years.If Congress is serious about tax reform \u2014 and about curbing the power of special-interest lobbyists to carve out exemptions and special breaks for favored industries \u2014 there is, it seems to me, one relatively simple way to go about that.Congress would start with an estimate of how much money needed to be raised \u2014 an estimate that would be based on what the entire Congress was willing to spend. That estimate would be over a multiyear period, for the course of an economic cycle. The government should be expected to run deficits during recessions, as revenue shrinks and safety net spending grows, and to offset them during good times. They could even program in an assumption of a multiyear surplus.The next step would be to decide how much revenue should come from the corporate income tax \u2014 a tax that now has the highest stated rates of any leading country but that produces shockingly little revenue. That odd combination reflects in no small part the ability of many multinational companies to avoid paying significant taxes. The rest would presumably come from individual taxes, including payroll taxes like Social Security and Medicare.I know none of that would be easy. But if it could be done, the interesting part would start.First, the government could have the tax experts estimate the marginal tax rate needed to produce the desired revenue. If they wanted, they could maintain some progressivity with higher rates on higher incomes.That estimate would produce astoundingly low necessary tax rates. It would do that by assuming the elimination of every tax preference, deduction and credit. It would also assume no deductions for mortgage interest or charitable giving and no exemption for interest on municipal bonds. It would assume that the value of health insurance provided to employees would be taxed just like any other compensation.It would assume the same tax rate for capital gains and other income \u2014 an assumption that would automatically end a lot of games that are played now to convert ordinary income into capital gains. The \u201ccarried interest\u201d tactic used by private equity firms \u2014 the one that enabled Mitt Romney to pay so little in taxes \u2014 is just the most famous of those.On the corporate side, it would assume that all income was subject to tax when it was earned, including overseas income. There would be tax credits for foreign taxes actually paid. But all the special incentives \u2014 to invest in low-income housing, or in wind energy projects, or in a myriad other things \u2014 would be assumed to vanish.With that as the starting point, Congress could debate restoring as many of those as anyone wished. But each proposed amendment would have to pay for itself with higher rates. A vote to preserve the mortgage interest deduction would clearly be a vote to raise taxes on those who don\u2019t receive that deduction. The same goes for the capital gains preference and the charitable deduction.All too often now, we pass tax benefits as if they had no cost to others. This would make it clear that is not the case. If we start with the assumption that a certain amount of revenue must be raised, then giving me a break means making everyone else pay more.On the corporate side, it could lead to a splitting of interests among business groups. If General Electric and Apple can come up with ways to largely avoid actually paying federal income taxes, that means that other companies, including small ones, must pay more. Some of them would suddenly have reasons to lobby against complicated breaks that, in the past, had no real opposition.On the individual side, perhaps, it could lead to a similar change in attitude. If a rich person is able \u2014 through perfectly legal use of tax breaks \u2014 to pay a very low tax rate, then the rest of us will have reason to resent the fact that those breaks exist. If they did not, we could pay lower rates.It might be reasonable to phase out some existing breaks rather than cancel them immediately. Some breaks could be maintained but revised in a way to keep them from being overly generous to high-income people. Currently, a $1,000 charitable deduction from a person in the 39.6 percent bracket saves $396 in taxes, while a similar contribution from a person in the 28 percent bracket saves only $280. Offering a $280 tax credit instead would cost the middle-income giver nothing but would raise revenue from higher-income taxpayers.If this process did lead to a new tax law, it would probably result in a far, far simpler tax code than the current one \u2014 simply because a lot of tax breaks would not pass if the cost to the rest of us was clear.Is all this a fantasy? Probably. The most likely outcome this year is that no bill will be enacted. Achieving significant change would require a willingness on both sides of the aisle to stop seeking easy political gain. That happened in 1986, when the last serious tax reform law was passed, but it is hard to imagine it happening now.It is hard to believe that he and Representative Camp could reach an agreement that would gain support from both parties and both houses. But he might be willing to try.The High & Low Finance column on Friday, about the potential for changes to the tax code this year, misidentified the entity that analyzed a tax plan drafted by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and found that it would lose revenue. It is the Joint Committee on Taxation, not the Congressional Budget Office.Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix. Advertisement"}

Just a Band formed in 2003, the year after he left office at a time of creative ferment following years of repression.Binyavanga Wainaina, a writer and a founding editor of the Nairobi literary magazine Kwani?, said that the changes went beyond his country to include much of sub-Saharan Africa.\u201cThe growth of democracy in Africa in the \u201890s led to the growth of many, many, many independent artistic institutions and artist production houses,\u201d Mr. Wainaina said, \u201csome to do with technology but also increased freedoms for people to imagine things for themselves.\u201dFrom the anti-colonialism movement to the decades after independence, successive waves of African art, whether writers like Chinua Achebe and Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o or musicians like Fela Kuti and Youssou N\u2019Dour, have reached well beyond the continent\u2019s shores.But the growth of democratic expectations, the decline of dictatorships, the expansion of African economies and the explosion of the Internet and other technologies has created new space for African artists to thrive.\u201cReborn Sounds of Childhood Dreams\u201d by the Sudanese artist Ibrahim el-Salahi, exhibited at Tate Modern in London.Significant restrictions on the news media and civil society remain in many countries, but the confluence of greater freedom of expression over all with the Internet\u2019s potential \u2014 as shepherd, teacher and evangelist \u2014 means artists from Africa can reach and attract new audiences. Just a Band performed at TedGlobal last year and has appeared at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex. Google declared the band a \u201cconnected\u201d African success story.Hundreds of people packed a warehouse downtown on a recent Friday night. Behind the turntables was Just a Band\u2019s Daniel Muli. The third member of the group, Mbithi Masya, curated a video installation playing on the back wall that included his own work and that of Ms. Mutu.The chic, young crowd came out to see the award-winning Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie present her latest book alongside the Kenyan writer Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor. Ms. Owuor\u2019s \u201cDust,\u201d which made its debut that night, is a searing work about the killing of a young Kenyan, largely set amid the violence that followed the 2007 election but stretching back to the Mau-Mau revolt against the British.\u201cThere\u2019s something really thrilling about the questions Kenyans ask themselves through their work,\u201d said Ellah Allfrey, a Zimbabwean-born editor and book critic based in London who came to Nairobi for the event. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about celebrating the past and emulating what\u2019s happening elsewhere.\u201dMs. Owuor said it was particularly exciting to publish her first novel as Kenya was celebrating its 50th anniversary of independence. \u201cThings are always in flux, always in convergence, always something new,\u201d Ms. Owuor said, citing the new visual and conceptual art. She called Just a Band \u201cvery Nairobi,\u201d and said, \u201cThey are the pulse in so many ways.\u201dBill Sellanga, known as Blinky Bill, the lead singer of the Kenyan group Just a Band, performed at the Rift Valley Festival. The band\u2019s sound is an eclectic mix of electronica and hip-hop, with clear local influences.This past weekend, the group performed with a seven-piece band at the Blankets and Wine music showcase at Carnivore Gardens in Nairobi, as Mr. Sellanga, the dapper lead singer wearing a black tie and a broad-brimmed hat, egged the audience on to wave their hands and sing along.The members of the group met at Kenyatta University in Nairobi, where they started producing an eclectic mix of electronica and hip-hop, with clear local influences. They grew up with Michael Jackson and can draw on traditions as diverse as Japanese anime and African mythology. A conversation with band members can shift from the energon cubes that power the Transformers robots to plans to sail along the Nile with musical groups from every country along the river\u2019s path.Their first album came out in 2008, but it was not a hit in local radio. They produced their own video for the song \u201cIwinyo Piny,\u201d with Mr. Muli drawing the giant turtle that floats over Nairobi with a DJ on its back. The group was largely self-taught, using YouTube tutorials to pick up new skills, including animation.\u201cYou just jump online and find some way to experiment, fail the first time, but at some point you get it,\u201d Mr. Muli said.\u201cWe went through a few melancholic ideas but most of them seemed a bit contrived; you\u2019re scripting some fake sadness,\u201d said Mr. Masya, 27, the co-director and cameraman for the video. They chose to delve into real events instead. \u201cWe decided to visit a point in our history that\u2019s one of the saddest.\u201dThe video was shot in a grimy, abandoned gym in a friend\u2019s apartment building, with garbage bags taped up to blot out the light. The finished project feels like a scene from a Kenyan version of \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d the victim\u2019s T-shirt covered in blood as he convulses from an electric shock. Yet the scene shifts from torture to bright sunlight, suggesting how life in an open society could be.\u201cThere\u2019s a certain sincerity and innocence in Just a Band that kind of feels like I imagine the \u201860s were, when everyone thought that all kinds of stuff was possible,\u201d said Mr. Wainaina, the writer.During a raucous live set at a recent concert, Just a Band played \u201cUsinibore.\u201d Mr. Sellanga wore a giant afro wig, a hooded sweatshirt that read \u201cAfrica is the Future,\u201d and strummed a black Fender electric guitar with a white pick guard.\u201cJust because I\u2019m an African with black skin, it doesn\u2019t mean that I won\u2019t win if I try,\u201d he sang. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I can and can\u2019t do,\u201d went the refrain, \u201cI can change the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Universal Plans to Expand Harry Potter Theme Park ", "Date": "2014-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Forget the long lines for the rides at Universal\u2019s Wizarding World of Harry Potter here. Nearly four years after opening, the attraction is still so popular that visitors routinely wait more than an hour just to get into a shop that sells wands.Moving to ease the gridlock \u2014 and shower its corporate parent, NBCUniversal, with more profits \u2014 Universal Orlando Resort on Thursday unveiled details for a huge Harry Potter expansion. There will be two major new rides, eight new stores (expect a second Ollivanders wand shop) and a sprawling Leaky Cauldron restaurant, all part of a new section called Diagon Alley, one of the marquee spots in J. K. Rowling\u2019s fiction.A June opening is planned. Analysts estimate the cost to be $400 million.But a question hangs over Hogwarts: With no new Harry Potter books from Ms. Rowling and three years having elapsed since the last blockbuster film, can the boy wizard really power this much added theme park capacity?Rivals like Disney and SeaWorld privately predict that the big pop Universal got from adding Harry Potter in 2010 \u2014 a 30 percent year-on-year rise in attendance \u2014 will be followed by a much smaller bump this time. Theme park experts say Universal also faces the challenge of higher expectations among consumers. The first Harry Potter world was so compelling that it will be difficult to wow visitors a second time.But Universal is confident about its plans.\u201cOne plus one will equal six,\u201d Mark Woodbury, president of Universal Creative, said of the addition of Diagon Alley to the original Wizarding World. Alan Gilmore, an art director for the Harry Potter films who has worked closely with Universal on design, said the theming of the new section \u201cabsolutely raises the bar.\u201dThe new area is \u201ca maze crisscrossing itself,\u201d Mr. Gilmore said as he led reporters on a tour of the Diagon Alley construction site, with narrow, winding streets lined by five-story buildings and a train trestle running overhead. There is also Gringotts Wizarding Bank, replete with goblins at work, a ride plunging through its dark vaults and a fire-breathing dragon on the roof. \u201cWe say that about the dragon, and people think we\u2019re goofing around,\u201d Mr. Woodbury said. \u201cWe\u2019re not. This one blows a giant ball of fire.\u201dMs. Rowling collaborated with Universal to add new elements to Diagon Alley, including a large souvenir-selling space called Carkitt Market.As a sign of increased pressure to produce something dazzling, Universal employed 60 designers on the sequel, compared with 18 on the original.The goal is not only to please Harry Potter fans but to make cash registers ring. Aside from the mountain of added merchandise the resort hopes to sell, Universal Orlando \u2014 made up of two theme parks \u2014 has carefully designed the expansion to increase the sale of more expensive multipark and multiday tickets.Wizarding World opened in 2010 at Islands of Adventure, the newer of Universal\u2019s two parks. Diagon Alley is in the abutting Universal Studios. To ride the Hogwarts Express connecting the two properties, visitors must buy multipark tickets. NBCUniversal has added attractions to its older Studios park over the last couple of years, including a \u201cDespicable Me\u201d simulator that turns riders into Minions. But the Universal Studios property is climbing out of a deep hole created by years of underinvestment by the resort\u2019s previous owners, the Blackstone Group and General Electric. There are still attractions themed around fading movies like \u201cTwister\u201d and characters like Betty Boop.Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal paid $1 billion in 2011 for full control of the resort. Islands of Adventure has annual attendance of about eight million; Universal Studios has a bit more than six million. (To compare, the Magic Kingdom at Disney World annually attracts 17.5 million guests, according to the Themed Entertainment Association.) Theme parks, while vulnerable to the economy and requiring expensive and continuous upkeep, represent one of the few areas of growth outside of cable TV for entertainment companies. For the first nine months of last year, NBCUniversal recorded $747 million in operating cash flow, a 5.6 percent increase. In comparison, the company\u2019s broadcast television business had operating cash flow of $205 million, a 23.4 percent decline, according to financial filings.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "French Leader Brushes Aside Questions Over Affair", "Date": "2014-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 It was arguably the most important speech of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s presidency. His job approval remains at nearly the lowest level of any president in French history. His economic policies have failed to make major inroads in addressing chronic unemployment and persistent deficits. His Socialist Party is restive.Then there was that other matter weighing on him, with 600 journalists assembled to see him at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace and the audience around the world watching with an intensity rarely accorded to a French policy agenda: the revelation last week of his affair with an actress and the drama of France\u2019s brokenhearted first lady checking herself into a hospital, \u201cin shock,\u201d according to her staff.So after a long prelude in which he delivered a sober and detailed analysis of France\u2019s challenges and his proposals for addressing them, the questions began, and the first was on the affair and where it left his companion and official consort, Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler. She had been scheduled to accompany him on his visit to Washington next month but has remained hospitalized.\u201cEveryone in his personal life can go through difficult periods; this is the case for us. These are painful moments,\u201d Mr. Hollande responded, evidently seeking to acknowledge reality. \u201cBut I have one principle: Private matters should be dealt with privately.\u201dHowever, just seconds later it seemed obvious that much in his personal life had yet to be resolved. When the journalist who asked the first question, Alain Barluet, the head of the Presidential Press Association, asked whether Ms. Trierweiler was still the first lady, Mr. Hollande was noncommittal, suggesting that either he had not decided or that he was not about to address the issue publicly while she was still in the hospital.He responded that he would make clear who the first lady is before leaving for Washington in a few weeks.The news conference was heavily covered by foreign news organizations, some of them clearly judging its value to be in something other than Mr. Hollande\u2019s view on government regulation. But his responses will most likely satisfy the French, said Pierre Haski, the top editor at Rue89, an online publication, who was among those attending.\u201cThere was a kind of sincerity in his first statement,\u201d said Mr. Haski, adding: \u201cObviously anyone can be in his shoes and would be so embarrassed to have the dirty laundry of a couple in public. I don\u2019t think this will be analyzed as anything against him, to be honest.\u201dPolling has suggested that most French sympathize with Mr. Hollande and do not believe that he should be evaluated based on the women in his life.The liaisons of French politicians and their demands for privacy are viewed as more acceptable than they are in the United States, which has a more puritanical approach. And as important, the French president still enjoys some of the respect that used to be due a monarch, so his private life is not a matter of discussion unless he chooses it to be.French commentators drew a sharp line between what Mr. Hollande said about his private life and what he said about economics, seeing both as important. On economics, some welcomed what they called a change in tone on fiscal matters, describing him as more decisive, leaderlike and clear.His economic policy moves gratified business and upset labor, but suggested that he was ready to make some of the structural changes, including lowering taxes and cutting the budget, that he had avoided since his election in 2012.Although the center-right opposition criticized him for trying to divert the public\u2019s attention from his private life by outlining a dizzying number of policies, supporters saw it as part of an effort to rebrand himself politically and show that he is not antibusiness.Mr. Hollande proposed a raft of new policies under the rubric of a \u201cresponsibility pact\u201d among business, labor and the government.He promised a roughly $41 billion cut in payroll taxes for business and independent workers and said he would reduce the French budget by about $70 billion by 2017, which would reduce the deficit by 4 percent.Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a political and policy analyst at the Foundation for Strategic Research, noted that whether talking about the economy or his personal life, Mr. Hollande had shown self-control throughout the news conference, refusing to be drawn into emotional displays.Yet, Mr. Heisbourg said, there was a certain vagueness on both counts.While Mr. Hollande was clear on the tax cut, there were few details on how he planned to pay for it or how he proposed cutting the budget.Similarly, the only clear thing about his personal life was that the drama was \u201cnot over,\u201d Mr. Heisbourg said.Mr. Hollande made clear that \u201cthis is going to go on for another few weeks,\u201d said Mr. Heisbourg, referring to the president\u2019s assertion that he will not answer the question of who is the first lady until close to the date of his departure for the United States in the second week of February.\u201cSo it\u2019s messier than we realized,\u201d Mr. Heisbourg said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article mistranslated President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s remarks about the affair. He said, \u201cEveryone in his personal life can go through difficult periods; this is the case for us. These are painful moments,\u201d not, \u201cEveryone in his private life can go through difficult periods \u2014 these are difficult moments.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the year that Mr. Hollande was elected president. It was 2012, not 2011.Ma\u00efa de la Baume and Scott Sayare contributed reporting from Paris, and Alan Cowell from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finally, Congress Does Its Job", "Date": "2014-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe last time Congress approved a series of spending bills to pay for the government \u2014 its most basic job \u2014 was in 2011. Since then, Republican lawmakers, determined to thwart the Obama administration at every step, have forced the government to subsist on stopgap measures that simply carry over or cut previous spending, with no accounting for growth, inflation or changing priorities.Republican moderates, politically burned by the government shutdown last fall, joined Democrats in fending off almost all of the Tea Party\u2019s demands. Right-wing Republicans failed to prevent any money from being spent on implementing the health care law, or enforcing power-plant regulations, or reforming financial practices under the Dodd-Frank law. While the bill still reflects many Republican priorities, most of the worst proposals are gone. So are the deepest cuts of the sequester, following the budget agreement reached last month. Head Start would get $612 million more than last year, enough to restore the 57,000 slots that were cut by the sequester. The bill creates a new $250 million grant program that would encourage states to build or expand high-quality preschool classes for poor families. There would also be significant increases for health agencies whose research budgets had been cut: $1 billion more for the National Institutes of Health, $567 million more for the Centers for Disease Control, and $91 million for the Food and Drug Administration. NASA gets a boost over last year\u2019s amount, and the administration\u2019s transportation grant program for the states, intended to create jobs and rebuild infrastructure, won $600 million, more than the White House requested.Republicans did win some victories. The financial regulators, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, received far less money than they need to do their jobs rigorously, and there was an unnecessary cut to a fund for disease prevention and public health. There will not be enough money for the United States to fulfill its pledges to the International Monetary Fund. One terrible environmental rider was included, a gift to the coal industry that allows continued dumping of toxic coal-mining waste in streams. Also included is the ridiculous provision that prevents enforcement of new light-bulb standards, a triumph for those who consider incandescent lights a symbol of freedom.The right-wing\u2019s larger victory is in the overall spending amount, which is far less than it should be to revive the economy. In 2008, discretionary spending under President George W. Bush was $1.176 trillion. That amount should have gone up in the following six years to reflect growth and inflation, paid for with new tax revenues. Instead it has fallen sharply to $1.012 trillion. The spending bill is better than a stopgap measure, but it is nowhere near sufficient to pay for the necessary investments in education and infrastructure that the country needs. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Underground London", "Date": "2014-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCultured TravelerThe British capital\u2019s evolving skyline is as impressive as it is unusual. Consider the Shard, the 1,016-foot \u201cvertical city\u201d that topped out as Western Europe\u2019s tallest building when it was completed in 2012, and 20 Fenchurch Street (a.k.a the Walkie-Talkie), which made headlines last summer when the glare from its cartoonishly flaring facade warped the panels of a Jaguar parked outside.Of course, Londoners have long possessed a downward-cast gaze. Take the Tube \u2014 the world\u2019s first underground rail system, introduced just over 150 years ago. Its stations provided shelter when the city was blitzed during World War II; they\u2019ve also displayed commissions by artists from Man Ray to Tracey Emin. Now, the Old London Underground Company is hoping to reopen 26 ghost stations as attractions. Think of elevator-shafts-turned-climbing-walls and 24/7 karaoke clubs where there were once secret war rooms. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more valuable in the world than looking into your old cupboards and finding a toy,\u201d the company\u2019s founder, Ajit Chambers, said.In the fantasy novel \u201cNeverwhere,\u201d Neil Gaiman depicts an underworld invisible to \u201cLondon Above,\u201d where the tony neighborhood of Knightsbridge becomes an ominous Night\u2019s Bridge. In reality, with the confluence of wealth in the area and the city\u2019s notoriously restrictive planning laws (generally, those looking to expand their homes cannot build up or out \u2014 only down), it is prime territory for digging out multilevel \u201cbillionaire basements\u201d to house, say, a tennis court and a personal car museum.Following suit, a sleek, 85-room Bulgari Hotel opened here a year and a half ago with six subterranean floors for the restaurant, ballroom, cinema, spa and glittering glass-mosaic swimming pool, the jewel in an inverted crown. There\u2019s even a plan to convert an underground parking lot in Bloomsbury into a budget hotel with 172 windowless guest rooms. Pending a green light, it\u2019s one of many new schemes to repurpose parts of London often overlooked. Here are some of those projects, along with places you can visit now.Underground ArtThe Establishment has been going underground, too. In 2012, Tate Modern unveiled the Tanks, a live art space occupying the former power station\u2019s three subterranean oil chambers (while currently shut for the building of a 10-level extension above ground, they\u2019ll reopen by 2016). And for its biggest exhibitions the Victoria and Albert Museum \u2014 which has long staged its cutting-edge shows in three rooms, housed in two 19th-century courts and separated by a corridor \u2014 has tapped the local firm Amanda Levete Architects to design an open-plan gallery about 60 feet below its new courtyard, all scheduled to open in 2017.Under a parking lot nearby, archaeologists have discovered London\u2019s second-oldest and best preserved Shakespearean playhouse: the 16th-century Curtain Theater, or the \u201cwooden O\u201d that premiered \u201cHenry V\u201d and \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d \u201cDigging down in London is like going back in time,\u201d said architect John Drew, of Pringle Brandon Perkins+Will. With input from the Museum of London Archaeology, his firm is designing the Stage, Shoreditch \u2014 a large-scale regeneration plan including a 13,000-square-foot exhibition and performance space set to open around the excavation site within five years. Remnants of the theater will be displayed in-situ, 10 feet below ground.Restaurants Without a ViewMore and more establishments have been inspired by their own underground histories. Last September, the Royal Academy of Arts opened its 19th-century Keeper\u2019s House \u2014 never before accessible to the public \u2014 with a seasonal British restaurant designed by Sir David Chipperfield and Rolfe Kentish in the formerly unused basement. Previously the kitchen and scullery, it was, before that, the servants\u2019 quarters, a beer store and a 17th-century crypt with a wine cellar, now a vaulted ladies\u2019 room. In the dining area, with its cream-leather furnishings and 18th-century casts, the walls are lined with a billiard-table baize that stops short of the exposed-beam and brick-hearth soffits.\u00a0In Soho, the just-opened Coal Vaults is situated within a 19th-century subterranean coal storage facility. Here you\u2019ll find low-lit, exposed-brick dining vaults and a copper-topped bar, plus small plates (deviled popcorn; venison sliders with shallot rings) and cocktail pairings.Nearby is Brasserie Z\u00e9del, which at first glance seems to be merely a small cafe from the owners of the Wolseley. Its street-level facade belies the 11,220-square-foot restaurant-bar-cabaret complex humming in the depths of the former Regent Palace Hotel, Europe\u2019s largest upon opening in 1915. Down a grand, winding stairwell adorned with retro carpeting and vintage French posters, the brasserie \u2014 with its all-day, en fran\u00e7ais menu \u2014 is an Art Deco homage to its precursor via Jazz Age Paris. Gilded and marble-clad, it\u2019s also part of a local restoration project overseen by the Crown Estate.\u201cWe actively avoid the sites that most restaurateurs would describe as prime,\u201d said Huw Gott, co-founder of Hawksmoor, a group of clubby British steakhouses mostly set below ground. Its latest location \u2014 a level-two spot on Air Street, near Piccadilly Circus \u2014 is an anomaly, but the windows have been blurred and darkened with stained glass. \u201cThe aim is for customers to come in and forget the outside world,\u201d Mr. Gott explained. Previously a \u201cdodgy strip club,\u201d the Spitalfields cellar bar \u2014 which serves cheeseburgers with ox cheek (\u00a39.50, or $15) in turquoise-tile dining alcoves \u2014 was a natural fit. \u201cWe like off-pitch,\u201d he said.Apparently, so does the team behind the Attendant \u2014 a coffee shop in a Victorian \u201cgentlemen\u2019s loo\u201d that had been lying unattended below Foley Street in Fitzrovia for half a century.

{"Headline": "Weak Yen Takes a Toll on Hyundai Sales Forecast", "Date": "2014-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL \u2014 The man who led South Korea\u2019s auto industry on a tear through the last decade said Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors were expecting their lowest annual sales growth since 2003 as the weak yen fired up their Japanese rivals.In his annual New Year speech to staff on Thursday, Chung Mong-koo, the 75-year-old chairman of Hyundai Motor, said sales at Hyundai and at Kia, its smaller affiliate, were likely to grow just 4 percent in 2014. Global competition is about to get tougher in an industry facing changing technology and an uncertain future, he warned.The Korean duo exports about two-thirds of its cars from South Korea, a much higher proportion than its Japanese rivals do, making Hyundai and Kia more vulnerable to currency fluctuations. A weaker yen gives Japanese carmakers like Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and Nissan Motor the leeway to offer customers better deals in major export markets like the United States. \u201cCompetition among companies is intensifying, as the global economy has entered an era of low growth,\u201d Mr. Chung said in his traditional New Year address to some 1,000 employees at Hyundai\u2019s headquarters in Seoul. \u201cTechnological convergence leads to change in the industry, and adds to uncertainty.\u201dOn Thursday, the won hit its highest level in more than five years against both the dollar and the yen, prompting talk in Seoul of possible government intervention in currency markets to help exporters. Shares in Hyundai and Kia, ranked fifth in the world by combined global sales, ended down 5.1 percent and 6.1 percent, respectively.The yen\u2019s fall has been stoked by Japan\u2019s attempts to support its export industries and pull its economy out of a two-decade slump. A senior official in South Korea this week expressed concern that South Korean exporters could be hurt as a result: Auto exports typically account for close to 9 percent of South Korea\u2019s total.Toyota is on course for record profit in the financial year that ends in March 2014, largely helped by the weaker yen. The currency trend also helped Mazda Motor and Fuji Heavy Industries, the maker of the Subaru, become two of the top three performers in the Nikkei stock average in 2013.The year ahead promises to be trying for Mr. Chung, more than 10 years into the job leading the company that was founded by his father. Hyundai has shaken up its management in the United States amid a fall in market share there, while a new free trade deal with the European Union means its German rivals are encroaching on its once-impregnable domestic stronghold.Hyundai and Kia are forecasting combined global sales of 7.86 million vehicles this year, up from 7.56 million in 2013. To achieve that, Mr. Chung is counting on growth from revamped versions of key models like the Genesis and Sonata sedans, as well as on increased production capacity in China.The forecast increase for 2014 would be in line with the global auto market\u2019s projected sales growth of 4 percent, but would also be the lowest since the 2.3 percent recorded in 2003. It is also bleak by comparison with the breakneck growth at the company that was one of the auto industry\u2019s biggest success stories during the global economic downturn at the end of the last decade.At the peak of their growth in 2010, annual sales at Hyundai and Kia climbed 24 percent as the weaker Korean won allowed them to offer stylish, feature-loaded new cars at affordable prices.\u201cThe yen\u2019s weakness is not welcoming news to Hyundai investors,\u201d said Song Sun-jae, an analyst at Hana Daetoo Securities. \u201cThis may adversely affect its market share and sales.\u201d However, he said he still expected Hyundai and Kia to sell eight million vehicles this year, exceeding its target, and to slightly outperform the global market. \u201cHyundai and Kia have offered conservative sales targets and beat them in recent years,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect this year would be no different.\u201dIn regulatory filings, Hyundai said it was aiming for sales of 4.9 million vehicles this year, while Kia\u2019s goal was to reach 2.96 million.The pair\u2019s 2013 sales did beat the original Hyundai-Kia target of 7.41 million vehicles as growth in China and Brazil offset a lackluster showing at home. In South Korea, automakers like Volkswagen of Germany have been lifted by the free trade pact between South Korea and the European Union. But at 6 percent, the 2013 increase was below the previous year\u2019s 8 percent rise, leaving Hyundai-Kia already in their third straight year of declining growth.Hyundai and Kia have increased overseas production over the years. They made 49 percent of their cars in Korea, according to industry data for 2012, the last year for which figures have been released. Of those, however, they still exported 67 percent.By comparison, Honda makes about 20 percent of its cars in Japan, and of those it exports about 20 percent.In recent years, Mr. Chung\u2019s focus has been more on managing quality and brand-building than on new plants. But the export comparisons have left company watchers wondering whether Hyundai and Kia might announce plans to build new plants in the United States or other markets this year. Analysts say capacity constraints, along with aging models and rising competition, may have led Hyundai to miss its 2013 sales target for the United States. A number of automakers, including Hyundai, plan to announce their United States sales figures on Friday.The task of bolstering Hyundai in the United States in a year of crucial new model introductions now falls to David Zuchowski, the sales head who recently replaced John Krafcik as the company\u2019s chief executive for the United States. Kia also plans to start production at its third plant in China early this year, while Hyundai has added capacity of 150,000 vehicles at its third factory in Beijing.Advertisement"}

Entering the space between two impassive actors dressed as security guards, one saw 10 women dressed as store cashiers: powder-blue shirts, royal-blue aprons.

{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s Charm Offensive", "Date": "2014-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialMr. Rouhani, who took office in August, is eager to fulfill his promises of improving Iran\u2019s relations with the world and reviving an economy devastated by international sanctions and his predecessor\u2019s mismanagement. He quickly reached an interim deal with the major powers that curbs significant aspects of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. For now, it is essential that broad sanctions, including restrictions on Iran\u2019s access to the international financial system, remain in place until a comprehensive nuclear agreement is reached. The United States insists that they will remain in place, though it may not be easy to prevent an erosion of the penalties. Investors are eager to jump back into the Iranian market, as are many governments.Over the long term, Iran\u2019s full reintegration into the international system will depend on more than just adherence to the interim nuclear deal and completion of a final agreement. It must also be seen as contributing to stability in other ways, including ending the hostility toward Israel. Mr. Rouhani said he sought \u201cconstructive engagement\u201d with Iran\u2019s neighbors. But that goal is belied by Iran\u2019s support for the Syrian government, a government that has bombed civilians and obstructed humanitarian aid. Iran, which uses Syria as a buffer between it and Israel, has encouraged Hezbollah to fight on his behalf.Iran\u2019s support of Mr. Assad is all the more unsettling because Mr. Rouhani was rubbing shoulders with the world\u2019s elite just as a stormy peace conference on Syria was playing out elsewhere in Switzerland. Instead of just bemoaning the civil war as a \u201cmajor catastrophe\u201d and dismissing all the anti-Assad forces as \u201cterrorists,\u201d he could have given credibility to his \u201cconstructive engagement\u201d policy by temporarily suspending arms to Syria while peace talks are underway and negotiating a face-saving way for Mr. Assad to leave power.The United States has tried to keep the nuclear and Syria issues separate, and there is logic to that. If the nuclear deal were the vehicle to resolve every dispute the West has with Iran, it would likely fail. But the Syrian civil war is a major catastrophe, and Iran has considerable leverage to help bring it to an end. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela May Meet New Reality, and New Price, at the Pump", "Date": "2014-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Venezuela has the world\u2019s cheapest gasoline, about 6 cents a gallon, a price so low that drivers often fill their tanks for less than a dollar and tip the gas station attendant more than the cost of the fuel pumped into their cars.But the illusion of inexhaustible wealth that every citizen can effortlessly tap into at the nearest gas station may finally crash into hard reality. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has called for what was once unthinkable: It is time, he has said, to raise the price at the pump.\u201cI am in total agreement that they should raise it,\u201d said Luis Gelvis, 45, a warehouse worker, as he had stopped to fill his aging Chevrolet S.U.V. for 48 cents, less than half the price of a cup of coffee.But when the gas station attendant pointed out that if the price rose, filling up might cost a couple of dollars, the smile quickly disappeared from Mr. Gelvis\u2019s face.\u201cNo way! That\u2019s too much,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they raise it that much there will be strikes. We\u2019ll have people blocking roads.\u201dMr. Maduro has not said when or how much he will raise the price, which has been frozen for 15 years, but the urgency in this beleaguered economy is clear. By some estimates, the government is giving away $30 billion worth of gasoline, diesel and other fuels each year, a huge loss at a time when it is running a large deficit, forcing it to print money. The state oil company is borrowing millions of dollars from the central bank to keep running, the country endures chronic shortages of basic goods, and last year inflation hit 56 percent, one of the highest rates in the world.Even Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who led Venezuela for 14 years and was critical of the fuel subsidies, never ventured to raise gas prices. Part of the taboo here is a common association between a gasoline price increase in 1989 and days of rioting in which hundreds of people died.The balancing act is a common one for developing nations, particularly those rich in natural resources. In Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and other parts of Asia, protests have erupted in recent years when governments have cut fuel subsidies. In Indonesia, a 30 percent increase in fuel prices in 2008 led to bloody rioting. In oil-rich Nigeria, protesters paralyzed the nation in 2012 over a rollback in fuel subsidies. In Bolivia, protesters laid siege to the capital in 2010, forcing President Evo Morales, a close ally of Mr. Maduro, to quickly abandon a cut in gasoline subsidies.Venezuelan officials have said the increase here will probably be gradual, with the goal of eventually charging enough to cover the costs of producing the gasoline.\u201cWhat is fair is to say that we have to charge for the hydrocarbons that we sell in the domestic market because we are paying for people to fill their tanks,\u201d Mr. Maduro said this month. He denied that the government needed the extra income to balance its books this year and called for a national dialogue on the issue. But he has insisted that an increase will happen.\u201cWill it go?\u201d he said late last month. \u201cIt will go.\u201dRafael Ram\u00edrez, the powerful president of the state oil company, who is also the energy minister and vice president in charge of the economy, said last month that the break-even cost of high-octane gasoline, which is what most people buy, would be the equivalent of $1.62 a gallon, far higher than what is charged now.Venezuelans use about 323,000 barrels of gasoline a day, Mr. Ram\u00edrez said last year. And despite having enormous oil reserves, Venezuela has imported tens of thousands of barrels of gasoline a day from the United States over the last two years, according to the Energy Information Administration in Washington, because of problems at refineries. So in effect, the Venezuelan government has been paying market prices \u2014 which averaged about $2.70 a gallon last year \u2014 to import gasoline that it gives away almost for free.He said the lost income from fuel subsidies was more than what the government spent on education and health care combined.Mr. Monaldi said many poor Venezuelans understood that the gasoline price was unsustainable and that they received relatively little benefit from it. And yet they generally oppose raising the price, even if the government pledges to spend the money raised on social programs, because they do not trust politicians to deliver on promises.That distrust goes to the heart of many Venezuelans\u2019 attitudes toward cheap gasoline \u2014 in a country where roads are bad, crime is out of control, and schools and hospitals are often in poor shape, the low prices are citizens\u2019 most immediate link to the country\u2019s oil riches.\u201cThey think this is the only way in which they will directly receive part of the oil wealth,\u201d Mr. Monaldi said.Rub\u00e9n Garc\u00eda, 63, a dentist filling his tank at a gas station, said he was in favor of raising the gasoline price, with a caveat. \u201cIt depends what the government is going to do with the new income,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re just going to line their pockets, it would be better to leave it like it is.\u201dMr. Maduro has floated the possibility of earmarking the revenue from domestic gasoline sales for social programs like housing or education.Many oil-producing countries sell their citizens cheap gasoline, but Venezuela is an outlier even in such company. A 2012 survey commissioned by the German government found that Venezuelan fuel prices were the world\u2019s cheapest, far below those of other major oil exporters like Saudi Arabia, where gasoline costs the equivalent of about 60 cents a gallon, and Nigeria, where it costs $2.35.The cheap gasoline means that old gas guzzlers clog the streets of Caracas and other large cities, since Venezuelans have little incentive to change.\u201cThe problem is that Venezuelans feel that they have the right to free gasoline,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Isabel Pe\u00f1a, the director of the Urban Studies Institute at the Central University of Venezuela. The end of cheap gasoline, she said, could be \u201cthe start of making people understand the reality of the situation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Texas Company, Alone in U.S., Cashes In on Nuclear Waste", "Date": "2014-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt Waste Control Specialists in Andrews, Tex., space inside goes for $10,000 a cubic foot in some cases. As aging nuclear reactors retire, their most radioactive steel, concrete and other components must be shipped somewhere for burial.ANDREWS, Tex. \u2014 Standing at the lip of what might be America\u2019s most valuable hole in the ground, Rodney A. Baltzer cataloged the features that he said would isolate the radioactive waste to be buried here for thousands of years.First, Mr. Baltzer said, there is a base layer of nearly waterproof clay, then a layer of concrete reinforced with steel and then three layers of plastic. When the waste, loaded into concrete containers, fills the pit, he said, it will be topped by a 40-foot-thick covering cap that includes more concrete, then more clay and finally a \u201cbio-intrusion cap\u201d to keep out burrowing prairie dogs.All of which helps to make the hole, and others to be built adjacent to it over the next few years, a \u201cmoney pit\u201d in a very different sense of the term.For 95 reactors in 29 states, Mr. Baltzer\u2019s company is the only place that will take some categories of low-level waste. \u201cWe definitely haven\u2019t won a lottery,\u201d insisted Mr. Baltzer, the president of WCS. But, he acknowledged, \u201cthere\u2019s obviously a large payback for what we\u2019ve got invested.\u201d The company in fact looks likely to collect a substantial part of the disposal fees paid for nuclear waste nationally, which the industry puts overall at $30 billion. Mr. Baltzer says that number is high, and that the total is probably more modest \u2014 say $15 billion.WCS began disposing of nuclear waste in April 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s come at a very opportune time,\u201d said Lisa M. Edwards, the senior program manager for low-level waste at the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit utility consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif.Last year alone, utilities announced that they would retire five reactors. Low prices for electricity that have persisted since 2008 make more retirements likely, industry specialists said.Many organizations have tried for years under the compact system to establish low-level waste disposal sites, but the Texas site is the first and only one to open.Mr. Baltzer said 10 attempts had been made, with a total expenditure of $1 billion. \u201cThere\u2019s an incredibly high barrier to entry,\u201d he said.His company succeeded in part by making a virtue of the region\u2019s salient characteristic, drought. Intrusion by water, which would spread the waste, will be minimal, he said.It also has strong local business support. Wesley R. Burnett, Andrews\u2019s director of economic development, said the struggle to open the burial site began around 1992, when he was with the local Chamber of Commerce and oil, the mainstay of the local economy, fell to $8 a barrel. Today the region is so thick with fracking crews, coaxing new oil from old wells, that jobs are easy to find and hotel rooms are scarce, but that will not last forever, Mr. Burnett said.Other local sentiment is not so positive. Rose Gardner, who was born in nearby Eunice, N.M., and runs Desert Rose, a flower and gift shop there, said it was impossible to keep burying radioactive materials and not expect trouble.Environmentalists are divided over WCS.\u201cI was impressed with their low-level waste cell,\u201d said Scott A. Kovac, operations and research director of Nuclear Watch New Mexico, which has criticized the Energy Department\u2019s operations at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. WCS was \u201ca generation above anything at Los Alamos,\u201d Mr. Kovac said. (WCS takes wastes from Los Alamos and other government plants, as well as hazardous nonradioactive wastes.)But Tom Smith, an energy and environment specialist at Public Citizen in Austin, Tex., said he was concerned that maps previously showed an aquifer under the site. The maps were more recently redrawn after testing to show the aquifer ending northeast of the site, but the testing, said Mr. Smith, was done at the Texas Tech University System, where the chancellor, Kent Hance, was once a lobbyist for WCS.Texas set up a compact with Vermont and Maine, but Maine closed its only reactor and later dropped out. The owner of Vermont Yankee, a 41-year-old reactor that is scheduled to close soon, will probably ship thousands of tons to Texas.In any other industry, a $30 billion market would have attracted competitors, said Ralph Andersen, a radiation specialist at the Nuclear Energy Institute, the reactor industry\u2019s trade association. Each reactor will generate waste that could cost $300 million and \u201cmultiply the millions of dollars involved, and you create a marketplace,\u201d Mr. Andersen said. He expressed hope that other options would emerge.But so far WCS is the lone winner. As a result, the company charges waste generators from within its compact \u2014 that is, Texas and Vermont \u2014 a base price of $1,000 a cubic foot, plus surcharges depending on radioactivity. Out-of-compact waste generators pay far more, to compensate Texas, which hosts the site, and Vermont, which helped pay for it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Vote in Senate Starts Talks on Extending Unemployment Benefits", "Date": "2014-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate\u2019s unexpected vote on Tuesday to advance legislation extending expired unemployment benefits touched off delicate negotiations to secure final passage in the chamber, even as Republicans and Democrats warily eyed the political motives behind the efforts.The three-month extension of benefits passed with no room to spare, on a vote of 60 to 37, and some of the six Republicans who voted yes made clear that they wanted the $6.4 billion cost paid for through cuts elsewhere in the budget. Still, even getting the Senate on to the bill was a victory for President Obama and Democratic leaders, who have tried for weeks to steer away from health care and budget wrangling and onto pocketbook issues, which they say they will use to try to frame the 2014 elections. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, hailed the vote as a shift in \u201cthe tectonic plates of our politics.\u201dRepublicans opposed to the extension will begin offering alternatives on Wednesday. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, one of the Republicans\u2019 potential presidential hopefuls, will speak about poverty and unveil proposals that he says will help the chronically poor without consigning them to a lifetime of government assistance. On Thursday, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 2012, will also speak about a conservative approach to poverty.A deal that widens Republican support for the unemployment extension would give Democrats weeks to pressure balking House Republican leaders, highlighting fractures in a party offering differing policy answers to poverty and income inequality. Democrats were not terribly optimistic that an accord could be reached, though they said that fiscally conscious Republicans also feeling heat from struggling constituents had been receptive to genuine negotiations.\u201cWe\u2019ll only know that after long discussions without preordained outcomes, and sometimes you only know when you call the vote,\u201d said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat and co-author of the unemployment bill, with Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada. The senators represent the two states with the highest unemployment rates. \u201cThis is still a tough, tough struggle,\u201d Mr. Reed added.Tuesday\u2019s vote merely got the Senate to consider the unemployment bill formally. The six Republicans who voted yes included moderates like Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, but also conservatives from states with unemployment rates above the national average, like Senators Rob Portman of Ohio and Dan Coats of Indiana.Leading voices in the Republican Party have questioned extending emergency unemployment benefits that were first passed in 2008, the height of the recession. Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican and possible presidential candidate in 2016, has warned that the benefits are a narcotic for the unemployed, lulled by handouts away from seeking work. Groups like the political action committee Club for Growth and the Heritage Foundation\u2019s political arm, Heritage Action, also warned Republicans against the extension.Yet most Republicans put aside the \u201csafety net as hammock\u201d arguments, and enough of them were willing on Tuesday to begin the formal process of extending benefits.\u201cThere was enough concern,\u201d Mr. Coats said, \u201cand maybe some legitimate need to do some extension of unemployment benefits, that it shouldn\u2019t have been just shut down.\u201d Mr. Obama, accompanied by unemployed Americans as he spoke in the East Room of the White House, tried to keep the pressure on congressional Republicans. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get this across the finish line without obstruction or delay,\u201d he said.But Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio made clear that in addition to demanding that an extension of expired benefits be paid for, he would also tie it to Republican priorities like building the Keystone XL oil pipeline, expanding exemptions from the Affordable Care Act and opening energy exploration on federal land.\u201cOne month ago, I personally told the White House that another extension of temporary emergency unemployment benefits should not only be paid for but include something to help put people back to work,\u201d Mr. Boehner said after the Senate vote. \u201cTo date, the president has offered no such plan. If he does, I\u2019ll be happy to discuss it. But right now the House is going to remain focused on growing the economy and giving America\u2019s unemployed the independence that only comes from finding a good job.\u201dThe White House has labored since 2011 under the belief that bipartisan support in the Democratic-controlled Senate would steamroll the Republican House. That has not worked on an immigration overhaul, a broad transportation bill or a measure outlawing workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. But it has worked on narrower bills like the reauthorization and expansion of the Violence Against Women Act. Republican leaders accused Democrats of manufacturing a political issue, hoping that the unemployment bill fails at Republican hands. Mr. Schumer said he feared that Republicans allowed the bill to go forward only to steer Democrats into a \u201ccul-de-sac\u201d or a \u201cMexican standoff\u201d in which each side would offer its own measures to pay for the benefits but neither would compromise.But leaders in both parties expressed openness to a negotiated settlement, and Democrats gave little indication that they would press for a quick vote. \u201cNow the serious negotiations have to start,\u201d said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire.Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said he would wait for Republicans to approach him with proposals to pay for the extension, and Democrats said they were on strong enough political ground to pick which cuts were \u201creasonable.\u201dSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, offered a glimpse of the stalemate that could develop. He suggested that the bill be paid for by a one-year reprieve from the mandate in the Affordable Care Act that uninsured people buy health insurance or face a tax penalty, as well as the reversal of a controversial measure in the budget that slows the growth of veterans\u2019 benefits. Mr. Reid waved that off as a \u201cnonstarter.\u201dLess partisan suggestions were also floated. Ms. Collins proposed that after a year, benefits should be linked to enrollment in job-training programs, a suggestion that she said Mr. Obama seemed to consider.But the issue of extending unemployment benefits, and a separate push to raise the minimum wage, could easily turn into campaign themes. Senator Mark S. Kirk, Republican of Illinois, said Democrats wanted \u201cto have Republicans vote no, so they can bash them in the next election.\u201dAnd Democrats did not exactly deny that. Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said, \u201cIf the Republicans refuse to pass unemployment insurance and cling to their opposition to increasing the minimum wage, these will be bookend issues for 2014.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Bond Market, Lower Expectations Became the Reality", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBONDS lived down to expectations last year. The threat of rising interest rates, which had lurked in the ether for five years, finally materialized, pushing prices lower. That sent total returns \u2014 the combination of yield and price changes \u2014 into negative territory, as low yields provided little cushion. The Barclays U.S. Aggregate bond index, the benchmark for high-quality taxable bonds, lost 2 percent, registering only the third negative calendar-year performance since 1976, where the index\u2019s data starts.It\u2019s the end of the bond-investing free lunch. Anyone who came of investing age since the early 1980s \u2014 when rates peaked \u2014 could own bonds for their risk-damping ballast when stocks tanked, but could also earn a nice total return as yields fell and prices rose. The math is now reversed. With rates still low and expected to rise as the Federal Reserve pulls back its stimulus, there\u2019s not much room for rates to fall and prices to rise. He added, \u201cOwning bonds helps us lose less in bad markets.\u201dMoreover, talk of carnage in a bond bear market appears a bit exaggerated. At its worst, this year\u2019s sell-off pushed the Barclays U.S. Aggregate down about 5 percent before it rebounded. And the 2 percent loss for the entire year would count as just a single bad day for stocks. Rising interest rates have a greater impact on the price of bonds with long maturities, and to be smacked with double-digit losses in high-quality bonds when rates spike, you would have to be holding issues that mature in 10 years or more. Morningstar says that less than 15 percent of bond fund assets are held in such portfolios. While a climb in rates pushes bond prices down, it also sends more yield into investor pockets. Over time, that higher income can offset price declines. The fixed-income team at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, looked at how bonds fared from 1954 to 1981, which it considers the last bond bear market. Intermediate-term government issues had five negative calendar years in total return during that stretch, but the annualized return over that period was a positive 4.5 percent.\u201cGiven the risk of junk, I\u2019d just rather own stocks, since that\u2019s what they resemble in down markets,\u201d said John Rekenthaler, vice president for research at Morningstar. In some respects, it\u2019s not an ideal moment for junk bonds: While the 6 percent yields of today are much more than what Treasuries or high-grade corporates pay, they nonetheless represent a steep drop from the double-digit yields of a few years ago. Mr. Kaufman says the fund is now content to accept the lower yields of 5 percent or so from short-term junk bonds. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting paid enough to stretch out longer,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "French Far-Right Leader Aims for E.U. Parliament", "Date": "2014-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The leader of France\u2019s far-right party laid out an ambitious plan to win seats this spring in the European Parliament, hoping to join other extremist parties in provoking a \u201cpolitical crisis\u201d there.Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s National Front, who has tried to soften the party\u2019s image as a bastion of xenophobes, spoke Thursday to international reporters at her party\u2019s headquarters on the outskirts of Paris and gave a calculated preview of her party\u2019s goals this year.Casting herself and her party as untainted outsiders, Ms. Le Pen also vowed to enter local French elections. She deplored the current \u201cbipolarization of political life\u201d in France, a reference to the main left- and right-leaning parties, and predicted that the spring would be \u201ca turning point in French electoral history\u201d because national polls show that 20 percent of respondents favor her party.Despite the National Front\u2019s success in 2012, it is unclear whether it will be able to recruit enough attractive candidates for this year\u2019s municipal elections to meet its ambitions. It has never been a grass-roots movement, instead being powered by the personality of its leadership.However, almost any gain in local seats could be interpreted as a success for Ms. Le Pen. The National Front now has just two members in the National Assembly and fewer than 200 municipal council members out of tens of thousands across France. It has no mayoralties in any sizable city.Ms. Le Pen admitted that it was unlikely that her party would win in any city of more than 100,000, other than perhaps Perpignan, and even there the National Front\u2019s victory is by no means assured. But the party will compete in five times as many municipal races as it did in 2008, the last time they were held, she said, which means it will have candidates in about 500 of the 3,000 larger municipalities across the country.On Thursday she again called for France to retreat from its current position in the European Union, re-establish the franc as its currency, and drastically slow immigration and cut social benefits for legal and illegal immigrants.Ms. Le Pen\u2019s focus remains on immigration, which she held up as \u201cthe problem of the 21st century,\u201d saying that immigrants cost France as much as $70 billion a year. She did not explain how that number was calculated.She was particularly critical of the policy of extending subsidies to immigrants that are intended to encourage larger French families. Giving them to immigrants, she said, defeats the purpose of the subsidies.France is thought to have more than five million legal immigrants, many from other European Union countries whose citizens are free to cross borders to work here. It also has large numbers of legal migrants from former French colonies in Africa, as well as an estimated 400,000 illegal immigrants.Ms. Le Pen\u2019s hostility to Europe is rooted in her belief that the European Union has neutered the sovereignty of member states and muzzled the French people\u2019s say in policy decisions. \u201cThe reality is that the French people and European peoples are no longer sovereign,\u201d she said. She called for a Europe of \u201cfree nations.\u201dOf Europe she said, \u201cI am just waiting for one thing, which is that it break into pieces.\u201dShe allowed that there could be cooperation among European countries, but that there should be no rules that trump national laws. When it comes to the marketplace, she would call for protectionism, requiring a \u201cnational preference\u201d for French companies for public contracts and French citizens for jobs.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Buyback", "Date": "2014-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLivesOn a rainy Saturday afternoon, my husband and I finally gave up our guns. How we came to possess a small arsenal speaks to a past, though, not a predilection. We\u2019re neither hunters nor collectors; we sign petitions demanding stricter controls and call our congressmen to do likewise. But throughout the years of my husband\u2019s career as a diplomat, spent mostly in chaotic corners of Africa and Latin America, we acquired guns: mementos of the often-turbulent history that we witnessed. Strange as it was to have the weapons among our possessions, we could no more part with them than, say, burn an old photo album.That is, until the mass shootings in this country in the past couple of years. It became increasingly impossible to think of the guns simply as memorabilia. Which was why we were at a buyback at a community center in a tumbledown part of Pittsburgh. No questions asked, the advertisement said. Plus a $100 gift card.People brought their weapons stuffed into plastic bags, reusable cloth totes, sports duffels. One man pulled his handgun out of a purple velvet Crown Royal bag with a gold drawstring; another had his rifle swaddled in a fringed curtain. People were patient and polite, many sporting Steelers gear, as the line snaked around the room. A man with a long red beard and a metal cross attached to his lapel with a safety pin offered my husband a knife as he struggled to tear open the brown paper covering our cache.The policeman eyed us quizzically when we dumped our weapons on the table. Here were bolt-action rifles \u2014 one with a pop-up bayonet \u2014 from our time in Mozambique, remnants of a 16-year civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, ravaged the countryside and destroyed the nation\u2019s economy. A peace process that demobilized the soldiers and collected their guns culminated in 1994 with the country\u2019s first democratic election. People turned out to vote by the millions, many dressed in their Sunday finery, and waited in lines for hours under a grueling African sun for the opportunity, finally, to determine their own destiny.Here, too, was the semiautomatic shotgun with the gleaming wood stock, bequeathed to us by the former police chief of Monrovia, Liberia. We were living in Liberia in the summer of 1990, when rebels, led by the warlord Charles Taylor, bore down on the capital to overthrow President Samuel Doe. The six-month-old civil war had taken a grisly tribal turn. Army soldiers who happened to be from the ethnic groups that supported the rebellion were found on the outskirts of the capital decapitated. It seemed that the president had ordered a purge of the armed forces.The chief of police came to our house one afternoon, wanting to talk. The events of recent days had shaken him. \u201cI\u2019m a professional, and I\u2019m a Christian, and I just can\u2019t live with what\u2019s happening,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re locking up soldiers from those tribes in the stockades, then dragging them out to be executed. That\u2019s what they did two nights ago. They got five of those boys out of the stockades, dragged them across the road and butchered them.\u201cHow can I do my job? I can\u2019t protect the public. If I start investigating, I\u2019m told to leave it alone. I could resign so that I could live with my conscience, but then I\u2019d have to tell the president why I was resigning. How long then would I have to live? And if I don\u2019t resign, I\u2019m a dead man when the rebels take over. How could I justify my actions, as chief of police, to them?\u201dA few nights later, the chief left on one of the last commercial flights out of Liberia. Before departing, he dropped off his shotgun at our house. He called his deputy from London to tell him where to find his letter of resignation.Doe was ultimately captured, tortured and killed by rebels. Charles Taylor prevailed after several more years of fighting and ruled Liberia until 2003; in 2012, he was sentenced to 50 years in prison by a special war-crimes court in The Hague. The police chief never reclaimed his shotgun.The buyback\u2019s supervising officer checked the weapons for ammunition and motioned us to another table to collect our gift card. Outside, two organizers huddled under umbrellas. \u201cThanks so much for doing this.\u201d one said. And with that, we walked away from a chunk of our history.

{"Headline": "Upbeat Again, but Not Overconfident", "Date": "2014-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDetroit Auto ShowDETROIT \u2014 Twenty-five years ago, the Detroit Lions\u2019 biblical trials of football futility coincided with a familiar economic slump \u2014 the kind that often seemed to save its worst for Detroit. Auto sales in 1989 were plummeting after an extended boom, helping to push the country toward recession. But the Lions hit upon a catchy comeback slogan: Restore the Roar. Defying logic and history, the team indeed turned things around, winning their division in 1991 and their first-ever playoff game under the three-decade ownership of William Clay Ford. A new slogan \u2014 Restored \u2014 was bestowed upon the Lions, which took on special bathos with their inevitable collapse the next season. At this year\u2019s North American International Auto Show, Restored might well blaze from banners in Cobo Center, a chest-puffing pep talk for Detroit\u2019s automakers, rebounding from recession or bankruptcy quicker than most anyone dared to dream, luring new fans and drafting stars for their lineups. But in this city, the question always flutters in the air: Are General Motors, Ford and Chrysler truly, enduringly restored? Or will an ingrained losing behavior \u2014 hubris, mismanagement, more nimble competitors \u2014 drag the hometown team back to the cellar, the bust that has historically followed every boom? The answer is an emphatic \u201cno,\u201d said Mark Reuss, G.M.\u2019s head of global product development.\u201cThings are fundamentally different,\u201d Mr. Reuss said, flanked by one of his babies that colorfully (specifically, yellow) amplified his point: the Chevrolet Corvette Z06, the roughly 625-horsepower offshoot of the standard Stingray, with the latter named 2014 North American Car of the Year at the show. The Chevy Silverado was honored as Truck/Utility of the year, giving G.M. a sweep of prestigious awards chosen by a panel of auto journalists. And even as the industry roared back to post 15.6 million sales in 2013, the leaner, meaner G.M. could break even financially with industry sales as low as 10.5 or 11 million, Mr. Reuss said. \u201cOur footprint is very responsible now,\u201d Mr. Reuss said. We\u2019re running factories at about 105 percent capacity on two shifts, we\u2019re also selling about 50 percent cars, 50 percent trucks. If we have a downturn again, we\u2019re in a very different place.\u201d While Detroit has steadily diversified its product portfolio, a traditional truck, the 2015 Ford F-150, dominated this show the way that Ford has dominated pickup sales for 37 straight years. And the F-150\u2019s calling card, a weight-slashing aluminum body that may represent a revolution in affordable vehicles, led the show\u2019s big trend: the breathtaking transfer of technology, in materials, alternative fuels, safety and digital gadgets, to mainstream models. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class, which will most likely start around $36,000, is replete with features from the $100,000 S-Class flagship, including air suspension, pedestrian-spotting collision prevention system and semiautonomous driving functions. The Chrysler 200, a thoroughly reimagined version of a formerly forgettable car, offers a 9-speed automatic transmission in a car that starts at $22,695. That\u2019s more gears than you\u2019ll find in a $250,000 Bentley. The Audi Allroad Shooting Brake plug-in hybrid spotlights technology that will quickly make its way to production: A new form of Audi\u2019s quattro all-wheel drive uses an electric motor to power the rear wheels and a gas engine to drive the front wheels. Car fans trekking to Motown to see it all for themselves can attend the show through Jan 26, where they will see showroom models and forward-looking concepts, including these: Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Fund Expenses, Tenths of a Point Mean a Lot", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOW much a fund costs to run may seem inconsequential, especially now. With the backdrop of a \u201cgo big or go home\u201d stock market that frightens many small investors but can enrich those who take a chance, how could several tenths of a percentage point in operating expenses, one way or the other, really matter?Those tenths of a point are important, especially when a fund\u2019s return shrinks, financial advisers say. And these costs are one of the few components of portfolio performance that investors can consistently and reliably do something about.\u201cExpenses always matter,\u201d said Christine Benz, director of personal finance for Morningstar. \u201cFund buyers have no control over interest rates or the economy or how markets perform, but they do exert some control over investment-related fees.\u201dThe average total expense ratio, which encompasses management fees and operating expenses but not brokerage commissions and other trading costs, is 1.33 percent of assets a year for domestic stock funds and 0.97 percent for domestic bond funds, according to Morningstar.The importance of exerting control over costs becomes clearer when they are compared to figures that mean more to investors than the mere ratio of expenses to assets. When considered as a percentage of fund returns, these expenses can seem alarmingly high, especially when they reduce income needed for retirement. He acknowledged that some actively managed funds consistently outperformed the market. But he assumed, based on findings in numerous studies, that actively managed funds collectively would approximate market returns, minus costs. \u201cWhether one is investing a lump-sum amount or a series of periodic amounts, the arithmetic of investment expenses is compelling,\u201d he concluded. \u201cAlthough a long-term investor may be able to find one or more high-cost managers who can beat an appropriate benchmark by an amount sufficient to more than offset the added costs,\u201d he added, managers with such acumen are extremely rare.A reasonable inference to draw from studies like this and Mr. Sharpe\u2019s is that investors are better off in dirt-cheap index funds than actively managed ones. But investment advisers often contend that active managers can earn their keep in comparatively under-researched niches, such as smaller companies or emerging markets.The Gerstein Fisher finding that the cheapest funds underperformed the next-to-cheapest group also suggests that the link between costs and returns isn\u2019t so simple. Asked to take a stab at explaining that finding, Ms. Benz noted that funds with more assets tend to have lower expenses because fixed costs are more widely dispersed, but that having more money to manage can dull performance because it is harder to move in and out of securities without moving their prices.In considering a fund, as with any product or service, it is essential to evaluate not just what it costs but also what it provides in return, advisers say. Just as stocks and bonds can be false bargains, so can funds themselves, particularly when a portfolio is a de facto index tracker priced like something that is actively managed.In his view, that is more likely to be the case with managers whose particular investment strategy is out of the mainstream, as in certain types of hedge funds.There are cost considerations even when buying ultracheap exchange-traded funds, Mr. Levin added. As low as their expense ratios are, E.T.F.\u2019s can become costly for investors who buy shares repeatedly \u2014 for example, when using dollar-cost averaging (investing a fixed dollar amount periodically to reduce the average cost per share).Those investors would be better off buying E.T.F.\u2019s that are offered commission-free by discount brokers like Charles Schwab or Fidelity, he said, while someone putting a lump sum to work should try a portfolio run by a large operator like BlackRock, which sells E.T.F.\u2019s under the iShares brand.As for mutual funds, Mr. Levin recommends Vanguard for its index trackers and T. Rowe Price for the reasonable costs of its actively managed portfolios.Other fund families that she favors in part for their low expenses are Dodge & Cox, Harbor Funds, Oakmark, Royce and Ariel Investments.Mr. DeGroot is not particularly drawn to low-cost funds, but he is inclined to shun funds with annual expenses that rise above certain levels for certain types of portfolios, such as 1.5 percentage points for ones that specialize in smaller companies or foreign stocks. \u201cBut even there,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will make exceptions for newer funds with very small asset bases that with some growth will be able to bring their expense ratio down to reasonable levels.\u201dMs. Benz acknowledged that cost was just one of many components of fund performance, but she emphasized that it was an especially good one for investors to focus on.\u201cLow expenses tend to be the best predictive factor when trying to figure out whether a fund will outperform,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s true that a cheap fund is not necessarily a good fund, but if the goal is to stack the odds in your favor, a cheap fund is the way to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The banner year ended with the stock market climbing to record highs in the face of signs that the economy was strengthening.\u201cThe market is basically looking for additional confirmation of economic strength and may be marking time as it catches its breath from a pretty strong run at year-end,\u201d said Jim Russell, a regional investment director at U.S. Bank.The S.&P. 500 fell 4.60 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,826.77. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 44.89, or 0.3 percent, to 16,425.10. The Nasdaq composite index fell 18.23, or 0.4 percent, to 4,113.68. The weak start to 2014 is not a good omen for stock investors. In 2005, the last time the S.&P. 500 dropped on the first three trading days of the year, it climbed just 3 percent for the whole year.Despite the slow start, many analysts say it is too early to call a change in the market\u2019s upward trend.Reports on Monday on American service companies contained hopeful signs, as they grew at a steady, but slightly slower, pace in December. The most closely watched economic report of the week will be the Labor Department\u2019s jobs survey for December, which is scheduled for release on Friday.

Goodman, who demystified financial complexities in best-selling books and on a long-running public television program under the name of one of history\u2019s most famous economists, Adam Smith, died on Friday in Miami. He was 83.The cause was complications of leukemia, his son, Mark, said. Mr. Goodman helped start Institutional Investor magazine in the 1960s. He was executive editor of Esquire in the 1970s. He wrote novels, nonfiction books and a popular children\u2019s book. But he was probably best known as the amiable but intellectually rigorous host of \u201cAdam Smith\u2019s Money World,\u201d seen on PBS from 1984 to 1997. Mr. Goodman did not choose the pseudonym Adam Smith, after the 18th-century philosopher who shaped the discipline of economics with his concept of an \u201cinvisible hand\u201d that governed markets. Rather, it was given to him as a young journalist for New York magazine in the 1960s, to hide his identity from sensitive Wall Street sources. He hated the name at first and tried to change it, but he could not find out who had bestowed it, although many sources said it was Clay Felker, New York magazine\u2019s founding editor. His first book as Adam Smith, \u201cThe Money Game,\u201d published in the spring of 1968, became an immediate best seller and remained one for the rest of the year. In it, he posited that the machinations of money were high drama, understandable to the lay reader and, perhaps most important to the book\u2019s success, humorous. The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post both lauded it as a masterly exposition of mass psychology. Mr. Goodman followed up with more books about economics, including \u201cSupermoney\u201d (1972) and \u201cPaper Money\u201d (1981). In \u201cPaper Money,\u201d he made a joke about economists\u2019 jargon that became famous in and out of the field: Stuck without tools on a desert island, an economist theorizes, \u201cAssume a can opener.\u201dIn 1985, as \u201cAdam Smith\u2019s Money World\u201d was beginning its run, Mr. Goodman told United Press International that the show was about money, not economics. \u201cEverybody\u2019s interested in money,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney, food and sex, not necessarily in that order.\u201d He continued, \u201cAs my Texas friends say, \u2018Money ain\u2019t everything, but everything won\u2019t go out with you unless you\u2019ve got it.\u2019\u00a0\u201dGeorge Jerome Waldo Goodman was born in Clayton, Mo., on Aug. 10, 1930. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard, then studied political economy at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. He served in the Army as an intelligence analyst in the mid-1950s, then wrote about various topics for Barron\u2019s, Time, Fortune and other magazines. His passion in the 1950s was writing novels. His first was \u201cThe Bubble Makers\u201d (1955), a story of conflict between a Harvard student and his wealthy grandfather. He had written it instead of a thesis at Oxford. Three subsequent novels were well received, with critics particularly complimentary about their dialogue. Mr. Goodman\u2019s fourth novel, \u201cThe Wheeler Dealers\u201d (1959), about the pyrotechnics between a Texas oil baron and a female broker, was made into a movie in 1963 starring James Garner and Lee Remick. Mr. Goodman wrote the screenplay. But he soon began focusing on economic matters, an interest he had demonstrated with his satirical treatment of upper-class characters in his novels. \u201cI was curious to know why some people make money and others don\u2019t,\u201d he told Lear\u2019s magazine in 1989. He began managing what he told U.P.I. was \u201ca small, aggressive mutual fund,\u201d started a regular financial feature in New York magazine and helped found The Institutional Investor. As his economics books succeeded, he turned to television, where he employed graphics, interviews and even cartoons to clarify financial issues. \u201cAdam Smith\u2019s Money World\u201d was broadcast in 40 countries. Mr. Goodman\u2019s wife, the former Sallie Brophy, died in 2007. In addition to his son, he is survived by his daughter, Susannah Goodman; his partner, Lynda Richards; and three grandchildren.Mr. Goodman said his most widely read work may have been \u201cBascombe, the Fastest Hound Alive,\u201d a children\u2019s book he published in 1958.

{"Headline": "Movement on the Right", "Date": "2014-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you just listened to Republican politicians, you\u2019d have almost no sense that conservative thinking has changed much since Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney over a year ago. But if you hang around the conservative policy wonks, and read certain conservative magazines, the picture is quite different. This conservatism is oriented, first, around social problems, not government. For many years, conservatives spoke as if runaway government was the only major threat facing the country. Defining themselves against government, Republican politicians had no governing agenda for people facing concrete needs. But the emerging conservatives begin their analysis by looking at concrete problems: how to help the unemployed move to where they can find jobs; how to help gifted students from poor families reach their potential. If you start by looking at these specific matters, then even conservatives conclude that, in properly limited ways, government can be a useful tool. Government is not the only solution, but it is also not the only problem.Second, this conservatism is populist about ends but not means. Over the past decade, many Republican politicians have spread the message that the country\u2019s problems would be easily solved if only the nefarious elites would get out of the way and allow the common people to take over. Members of this conservatism are more likely to conclude that, in fact, problems are complex and there are no easy answers, but there is room for policy expertise, and perhaps philosophical rigor, even if it comes from Washington. Third, this conservatism supports effective government, not technocratic government. Like all proper conservatism, it begins with a sense of epistemological modesty, a sense that the world is too complicated to be centrally planned. Therefore, it opposes the style of government embodied in Obamacare, where officials in the center define insurance products and then compel people to buy them.Fourth, this conservatism is skeptical in temper, especially about itself. Recently, conservatives have been filled with fervor and conviction, and regarded compromise as selling out. Some recent conservatives have ideologized the Constitution, turning it into a rigid system that answers every political question for us. But the founders constructed a constitutional order that left room for different policy approaches; that was humble before the evolving needs of the future; and that required compromise and coalition building. The founders did not believe in concentrating power in the hands of any group of highly fallible individuals. Today\u2019s emerging conservatives embrace that constitutional mind-set, embodied both by Madison and Hamilton. Moreover, the National Affairs authors understand that most policy programs, like most businesses, fail. Conservative programs like urban enterprise zones failed to produce measurable results. Liberal programs like Head Start scarcely produce identifiable long-term gains. Therefore, it is best to approach government in a mood of skeptical reformism: Engage in a constant process of gradual concrete reform even as you are aware that most of your efforts will not pan out. The Republican style of recent years has produced a vacuum where concrete proposals should be. The emerging conservatives won\u2019t have to argue with or defeat the more populist factions on the right; they can just fill the vacuum. Republican politicians, when they are asked to come up with specific programs, will find there is no other game in town. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Myth of Industrial Rebound", "Date": "2014-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWITH metronomic regularity, gauzy accounts extol the return of manufacturing jobs to the United States.One day, it\u2019s Master Lock bringing combination lock fabrication back to Milwaukee from China. Another, it\u2019s Element Electronics commencing assembly of television sets \u2014 a function long gone from the United States \u2014 in a factory near Detroit.But we need to get real about the so-called renaissance, which has in reality been a trickle of jobs, often dependent on huge public subsidies. Most important, in order to compete with China and other low-wage countries, these new jobs offer less in health care, pension and benefits than industrial workers historically received.This disturbing trend is particularly pronounced in the automobile industry. When Volkswagen opened a plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., in 2011, the company was hailed for bringing around 2,000 fresh auto jobs to America. Little attention was paid to the fact that the beginning wage for assembly line workers was $14.50 per hour, about half of what traditional, unionized workers employed by General Motors or Ford received.With benefits added in, those workers cost Volkswagen $27 per hour. Consider, though, that in Germany, the average autoworker earns $67 per hour. In effect, even factoring in future pay increases for the Chattanooga employees, Volkswagen has moved production from a high-wage country (Germany) to a low-wage country (the United States).All told, wages for blue-collar automotive industry workers have dropped by 10 percent, after adjusting for inflation, since the recession ended in June 2009. By comparison, wages across manufacturing dropped by 2.4 percent during the same period, while earnings for Americans in equivalent private-sector jobs fell by \u201conly\u201d 0.5 percent. (To be fair, including benefits, compensation for manufacturing workers remains above that of service employees.)These dispiriting wage trends are a central reason for the slow economic recovery; without sustained income growth, consumers can\u2019t spend.Low wages are not the only price that America pays for its manufacturing \u201crenaissance.\u201d Hefty subsidies from federal, state and local government agencies often are required. Tennessee provided an estimated $577 million for Volkswagen \u2014 $288,500 per position! To get 1,000 Airbus jobs, Alabama assembled a benefits package of $158 million.Now Boeing has just used the threat of moving to a nonunion, low-wage state to win both a record subsidy package \u2014 $8.7 billion from Washington State \u2014 and labor concessions.Over objections from their local leadership, union workers approved a new contract that would freeze pensions in favor of less generous 401(k) plans, reduce health care benefits and provide for raises totaling just 4 percent over the eight-year term. (Boeing\u2019s stock price rose by over 80 percent last year.)FOR all the hoopla, the United States has gained just 568,000 manufacturing positions since January 2010 \u2014 a small fraction of the nearly six million lost between 2000 and 2009. That\u2019s a slower rate of recovery than for nonmanufacturing employment. \u201cWe find very little real evidence of a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing activity,\u201d a recent Morgan Stanley report stated, echoing similar findings from Goldman Sachs.If anything, the challenges to American manufacturing have grown, as less developed countries have become more adept. In Mexico, where each autoworker earned $7.80 per hour in 2012, auto industry officials say productivity is as high as in the United States, where total compensation costs were $45.34 per hour. No surprise then that in 2013, Mexican automobile production was 50 percent higher than seven years earlier, while output in the United States was at the same 2006 levels.For the United States to remain competitive against countries like Mexico, productivity must continue to rise. But unlike past gains in productivity, these improvements in efficiency are not being passed along to workers.And these necessary productivity gains often take the place of hiring more workers; the United States remains the world leader in agriculture while employing less than 2 percent of Americans.Advanced manufacturing \u2014 a sector that many advocate as a path for the United States to remain relevant at making things \u2014 also involves a high degree of efficiency, meaning not as many hires and particularly, not as many of those old-fashioned, middle-class, assemble-a-thousand-pieces jobs.Moreover, the lead that the United States has in some advanced manufacturing areas \u2014 notably aerospace \u2014 is being compromised by growing capabilities of workers elsewhere. Bombardier is now assembling Learjets in Mexico, and later this year Cessna will start delivering Citation XLS+ business jets that were put together in China.Similarly, while America\u2019s energy boom will provide an incentive for manufacturers to locate here, don\u2019t count on cheap natural gas to fuel an employment boom. According to a 2009 study, only one-tenth of American manufacturing involved significant energy costs.While we shouldn\u2019t expect manufacturing to save our economy, we needn\u2019t despair. Among other things, we need to get over the notion that service jobs are invariably inferior. The United States remains a world leader in service industries like education and medicine. Not only do these fields generate well-paying jobs, but they also help with our balance of trade: when foreigners come to America to be educated or treated, those services are tallied as exports.Manufacturing has been an emotional American touchstone since George Washington wore a wool suit that had been woven in Hartford, Conn., to his first inauguration to illustrate the importance of making stuff at home. We do need to maintain an industrial presence, but perhaps not for the obvious reasons.For one thing, companies often locate research and development facilities \u2014 stuffed with high-paying jobs \u2014 near their manufacturing facilities. In addition to jobs, R&D yields high-value intellectual property that spills over into still more innovation and employment. And not surprisingly, every manufacturing position requires an additional 4.6 service and supplier positions to support it.The challenge for the United States is particularly acute because manufacturing now accounts for just 12 percent of our economy, down from a peak of 28 percent in 1953 and on a par with France and Britain as the least industrialized of major economies.While keeping that share from dipping further should be a priority, we should be careful to avoid raising false hopes (like Mr. Obama\u2019s unrealistic second-term goal of creating a million manufacturing jobs) and pursuing ill-conceived policies (such as special subsidies for manufacturing).The president\u2019s proposals \u2014 unveiled over the last several years \u2014 include the two most important elements of a sensible manufacturing strategy: more training focused on the skills needed by employers and increased spending on research and development.The United States work force is simultaneously overqualified (15 percent of taxi drivers are college graduates) and underqualified (we rank in the bottom half of many comparisons of developed countries).When Volkswagen arrived in Chattanooga, it found that not enough eager applicants had the requisite technical skills, so it established a German-style training system (including three-year apprenticeships) at the factory.As for research and development, the fiscal tightening by the federal government has prevented more investment in this critical area, the exact opposite of what is required. At the same time, while subsidies to draw jobs have become a necessary evil, we should be rigorous about analyzing the value of these costs. And we must stop short of excessive meddling in the private sector, and particularly the notion of picking winners. (Think Solyndra or Fisker.)Mr. Obama skirted this problem by proposing to create 45 \u201cmanufacturing innovation institutes,\u201d which bring together companies, universities and government experts in a kind of laboratory setting to help develop advanced manufacturing strategies.While these institutes are not going to turn the tide, they might help at the margin. But like the president\u2019s other proposals, they have been largely ignored by Congress. (The White House managed to establish a pilot center in Youngstown, Ohio, and another is coming in Charlotte, N.C.)Manufacturing would benefit from the same reforms that would help the broader economy: restructuring of our loophole-ridden corporate tax code, new policies to bring in skilled immigrants, added spending on infrastructure and, yes, more trade agreements to encourage foreign direct investment and help get closer to Mr. Obama\u2019s seemingly unattainable goal of doubling our exports.Those who see a brighter manufacturing picture for the United States argue that wages are rising more rapidly elsewhere, not just in China and Brazil but also in Japan, Germany and France. But just like the \u201cfeel good\u201d stories, celebrating this fact ignores the reality that the flip side of wages\u2019 rising faster elsewhere means they are rising more slowly here.And that is the essence of our challenge: In a flattened world, there will always be another China.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bigger and Lighter, the Mercedes C-Class Will Flex Its Muscles", "Date": "2014-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDetroit Auto ShowThe 2015 Mercedes-Benz C-Class.DETROIT \u2014 With the aluminum diet all the rage in automaking capitals, Mercedes has dished up a lighter, yet more potent C-Class sedan to cement its status as the company\u2019s best-selling model around the world.Getting a jump on the official kickoff of the North American International Auto Show, Mercedes unveiled the redesigned 2015 C-Class Sunday evening at Detroit\u2019s Westin Book Cadillac Hotel. With press days Monday and Tuesday, the media might find automakers spraying champagne around Cobo Center, with sales nearly restored to prerecession levels and the Detroit automakers not just alive but thriving.For Mercedes, which sneaked past BMW to win the 2013 luxury-sales crown in America for the first time since 1999, the timing couldn\u2019t be better. Mercedes has sold 2.4 million units of the C-Class globally since 2007, including more than 88,000 in the United States last year. Mercedes says it expects the new version \u2013 along with strong-selling entries like the compact CLA \u2013 to help push American sales beyond the 312,528 cars it moved last year. The coming-to-America theme continues with the new C-Class being built in Alabama, not imported from Europe.Steve Cannon, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz USA, said that the C-Class and CLA were integral to the company\u2019s strategy, which looks to bring first-time buyers to the brand.\u201cGet them young, wow them and then hold on to them for life,\u201d Mr. Cannon said.Shown only in photographs until now, the in-the-flesh C-Class packs in design cues familiar from newer Benzes, from the jutting grille and swept-back headlamps of the S-Class to the finely scalloped sides of the CLA and CLS. The new C-Class goes on sale in September.Following the \u201clightweighting\u201d path trod by such disparate models as the Cadillac CTS sedan, Range Rover Sport and Mazda 3, the C-Class manages to grow larger yet slimmer: Mercedes says the C-Class \u2014 despite growing 3 inches in wheelbase and 3.7 inches in overall length \u2014 is about 220 pounds lighter than before. Aluminum accounts for roughly half the body structure, up from 10 percent previously, helping to deliver what Mercedes claims will be a 20-percent jump in fuel economy.The C-Class also seems to advance the company\u2019s eyebrow-raising personality switch from grey-flannel conservative to swaggering power-tripper. Surrounded on all sides by sportier rivals like the BMW 3 Series, Infiniti G (now the Q50) and Cadillac ATS, the C-Class has long appeared content to play the role of a low-key luxury cruiser.But with 329 horsepower and a bountiful 359 pound-feet of torque, a new 3-liter, direct-injected turbo V6 should send the C400 version to the head of the power class \u2013 just sneaking past the 328-horse Infiniti Q50.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a sportier car than before,\u201d said Rob Moran, a Mercedes spokesman.Modesty, and mileage, are retained with the C300\u2019s 2-liter turbo 4-cylinder, with 235 horsepower and 273 pound-feet. Both engines are coupled to 7-speed automatic transmissions.With the smaller, $30,825 CLA ensconced as Mercedes\u2019 true entry-level model in the United States, the C-Class will seek customers with more bulges in their wallets, as a larger, more luxurious alternative. Pricing isn\u2019t set, but the 2014 C250 Sport starts at $36,725.And as Mercedes helps point the industry toward the autonomous car of the future, the C-Class receives a fast trickle-down from the flagship S-Class and midsize E-Class: Optional Intelligent Drive features include adaptive cruise control, active collision avoidance and prevention, lane keeping \u2013 including semiautonomous steering \u2013 and a self-parking feature. An optional, driver-selectable air suspension is a first for the compact luxury-sedan class.The interior gets notable upgrades in design, luxury and features, from the latest Comand infotainment system to rear seatbelt air bags and the optional, automated cabin perfuming system from the flagship S-class.Mercedes has increased sales in part by expanding its 4Matic all-wheel-drive offerings, with company executives saying many prospective customers in wintry climes won\u2019t even consider a rear-drive car, despite huge advances in traction- and stability-control systems; when the C-Class goes on sale it will be offered exclusively in 4Matic trim. Rear-drive versions will follow in 2015. The sedan will spawn a speed-racer AMG version around year\u2019s end, followed by a plug-in hybrid and quite likely, a coupe and convertible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Latvia Adopts Euro, Future Growth Is Slowing", "Date": "2014-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Dace Utinane, a doctor at a private health center, frowned during a stroll this week through Riga, the capital of Latvia, as she contemplated her country\u2019s move to become the newest member of Europe\u2019s currency union.\u201cI don\u2019t like it \u2014 the euro is not my money,\u201d said Dr. Utinane, arching an eyebrow. \u201cThis has been dictated by people from above. But we\u2019re too small to do something about it and protest against it.\u201dIn the halls of power, European leaders are taking a starkly different view. On Wednesday, as Latvia became the 18th country to join the euro, they promoted it as a sign that the currency union \u2014 even with wrenching growing pains that included threats of a breakup \u2014 is on a long-term path to achieving its founders\u2019 vision of continued expansion.\u201cDespite the negative headline of the crisis, the basic promise of peace, prosperity and freedom to travel and work still have their appeal,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London. \u201cSo the process of euro enlargement has not come to an end.\u201dHow quickly it will grow is another question. While most of the European Union\u2019s 28 member countries are obliged eventually to ditch their national money for Europe\u2019s single currency, skepticism among European citizens about the euro union is still alive in many corners.Lithuania is on track to be next in adopting the currency, in 2015. Like Latvia, its neighbor and fellow former Soviet republic, it is eager to link itself to the West, an imperative that has grown starker as Russia seeks to keep a grasp on Ukraine despite recent pro-Western protests there.After 2015, however, euro zone enlargement is set to slow. In Eastern Europe, several countries have not even taken the first step required for euro membership by entering the exchange rate mechanism, a sort of waiting room. The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland have all pushed back their target dates for euro zone membership until near the end of the decade in the face of low public support.Smaller nations, including Romania and Croatia, which joined the European Union last year, have said they are unlikely to adopt the euro until around 2020, partly because their economies cannot quickly meet the criteria. Those include achieving a deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product and keeping debt to 60 percent of the annual gross domestic product.Denmark may be one of the next to join. Although the idea was defeated in a national referendum in 2000, a new public vote will be held during parliamentary elections in December 2015. Public support, which improved slightly after euro bills and coins started circulating, plunged again during the euro crisis. Sweden has also not taken the steps required to join, and has shown no signs of doing so.While European Union member states are required to adopt the euro, citizens can still shoot down membership if a government decides to hold a referendum. In Latvia, the government chose not to hold one, given the negative sentiment revealed in public opinion surveys, and to push the issue through instead.Around half of Latvians opposed joining the euro, although support rose toward the end of the year. The reluctance was palpable on New Year\u2019s Eve in Riga, where the fireworks and celebrations that illuminated other countries at the moment of euro membership were starkly absent. The only sign that a new currency was coming was in stores, which had begun to post prices in euros alongside lats, the old money.Part of the reluctance among euro-skeptics, economists say, is the fear of losing a degree of sovereignty and of being liable for supporting other countries should any new crisis break out. Few have forgotten how Estonia, which joined the euro in 2011, was soon called upon to help bail out Cyprus when a banking crisis hit.The euro\u2019s economic troubles have also damaged the currency bloc\u2019s image and highlighted structural flaws in its foundation that have still not been fully addressed.In Britain, which has no intention of adopting the euro, Prime Minister David Cameron has distanced his government even more from the European Union recently, and has repeatedly pointed to the crisis and the haphazard response of euro zone leaders as proof that the currency bloc is a flawed and cumbersome project. He promised a national vote on exiting the European Union should he win the next election.Some resistance may start to melt once the euro zone starts showing tangible signs of recovery after a five-year malaise. Growth is already starting to rebound in some crisis-hit economies. Ireland recently exited an international bailout and Spain now no longer needs euro zone support for its banks.One of the lessons learned from the crisis is that countries need to get their economic houses in order before joining, to avoid the type of disasters that happened in countries like Greece and Spain, said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.Latvia achieved that, largely by adopting a wrenching austerity program that shrank its economy at one point by 20 percent from its peak. Since then, the economy has rebounded, growing 4.5 percent through the third quarter of 2013, while unemployment fell to 11.3 percent \u2014 still high, though down from 20 percent in 2010.And despite negative opinion in the polls, a number of citizens see wider economic benefits of Latvia\u2019s joining the euro club. Unlike Britain, which has a powerful economy, smaller countries can see a lift from euro membership as businesses profit from executing transactions in a single currency. In particular, Latvian businesses expect borrowing costs to fall and investment to go up.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely positive,\u201d said Normunds Bremers, the director of Wenden, a furniture production company based in Jaunpiebalga. \u201cIt will be easier for the exporting business, and easier for those companies that focus on the market of the European Union.\u201cPeople are quite often against the euro, but they don\u2019t understand the reasoning that it can, in fact, benefit them.\u201dStill, economists say the euro must address further significant challenges if it is to succeed. \u201cIn order for the euro to flourish in the long term, it must assume a much more federal character, constructing some kind of a federal budget with transfers, which involves a greater pooling of sovereignty,\u201d said Simon Tilford, deputy director at the Center for European Reform in London.While it has recently taken a step in that direction by establishing a banking union, how much further it will go is still the subject of heated debate. One of Mr. Cameron\u2019s biggest objections is that too much power is being tilted toward Brussels, a concern shared by Eastern European countries slated to join the euro club.\u201cIt\u2019s a little like in the United States, where there is an ongoing fight between Democrats and Republicans about the role and scope of the federal government,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard said. \u201cIn Europe it\u2019s the same thing. There will be a big fight about the role and scope of the euro area vis-\u00e0-vis national member states.\u201dThe European Union \u201cis a marvelous long-term project when you think about what went on in Europe before that, and it is a natural continuation of European integration,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, we need to recognize that Europe is never going to be the United States of Europe \u2014 it will never be a fully federal state.\u201dAs a result, Mr. Tilford predicted, while the euro union will grow, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it will encompass the whole of Continental Europe.\u201d\u201cThere will be a euro in 50 years\u2019 time, but the membership of that is impossible to predict,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing linear about this.\u201dGederts Gelzis contributed reporting from Riga, Latvia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Who Got 2013 Right See 2014 as Much the Same", "Date": "2014-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseAfter a banner year for stocks and a rocky one for bonds, market forecasters are remarkably consistent in their forecasts for 2014: more of the same.Most forecasters are warning stock investors not to expect another year of 30 percent gains, as there was in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in 2013. (The average forecast is for a 6 percent rise in the S.&P. 500, according to Bloomberg.) But the two analysts I selected for this column \u2014 Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs and Bill Miller of Legg Mason, both of whom were remarkably accurate about 2013 \u2014 said another year of strong double-digit gains would not shock them. \u201cWe could easily see gains of more than 20 percent\u201d in stocks, Mr. Miller told me. \u201cAnd the market wouldn\u2019t be overpriced at that level.\u201dIn the many years I\u2019ve been surveying experts for their predictions for the coming year, I cannot recall another time when optimism about the stock market, the economy and corporate profits was so widespread.As is pessimism about the bond market.The stock market\u2019s relentless rise this year seems to have tamed all but a few perma-bears. When the Federal Reserve said in September that the economy was too weak for the central bank to taper its purchases of securities, stocks went up. And when the Fed said in December that it would begin to taper \u2014 stocks still went up.The only thing that seemed to stop stocks\u2019 inexorable rise was Congress\u2019s self-destructive gridlock, and even that didn\u2019t last long.Still, such unanimity may be the most worrisome portent for 2014. As Karl Case, emeritus professor of economics at Wellesley College and a co-founder of the S.&P./Case-Shiller index of housing prices, put it, \u201cWhen everyone expects something to happen, that\u2019s when it doesn\u2019t.\u201d But neither he nor anyone else I consulted this year was willing to break ranks with the consensus.\u201cIt gives me pause,\u201d Ms. Cohen, senior investment strategist for Goldman Sachs and president of the Global Markets Institute, said, referring to the bullish herd mentality that has gripped Wall Street. \u201cBut there\u2019s no reason to be a contrarian just for the sake of being contrarian. I look at the fundamentals. Even after such a strong year in 2013, I think it will continue.\u201dMs. Cohen was almost exactly right a year ago, when she predicted the S.&P. 500 would end 2013 at 1,787. (It closed at 1,848.) At the time, her forecast seemed wildly bullish, especially since stocks were at near record levels, and had registered gains four years running. \u201cThere was a significant mispricing of assets a year ago,\u201d she said, referring to both stock prices (too low) and bonds (inflated).That\u2019s not as obvious now that stocks have gained. \u201cThere\u2019s something artificial about current asset prices, which have been largely driven by liquidity,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve begun a transition to valuations that are driven by fundamentals.\u201d And those, she said, are strong. She cited an expanding United States economy, higher job creation, gains in labor productivity, lower energy prices and subdued inflation. \u201cThis will provide staying power,\u201d she said.Goldman Sachs\u2019s baseline forecast for the S.&P. 500 at the end of 2014 is 1,900, or a modest 3 percent gain. But that assumes no expansion in the market\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio. In similar periods with low inflation, market multiples have ranged from 18 to 20 times projected earnings, Ms. Cohen said, compared to the market\u2019s current valuation of about 15 times earnings. If that multiple expands to 19, the S.&P. 500 would rise to about 2,200, according to the Goldman Sachs model. That would produce a 19 percent rise in the S.&P. 500.Mr. Miller cited many of the same economic fundamentals as Ms. Cohen. At the same time, he saw little danger on the horizon. \u201cRecession? An oil price spike? Sudden tightening by the Fed? I don\u2019t see any of that. The path of least resistance is for the market to go higher.\u201dAnd he, too, wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the market\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio expand, driving up prices. \u201cHistorically, in the late stages of a bull market, stocks reach very high multiples, in the range of 20 to 22,\u201d he said. While he doesn\u2019t set a numerical target for the S.&P. 500, he said he expected returns at least \u201cin the low to midteens,\u201d and gains of more than 20 percent were possible. \u201cThere\u2019s really no catalyst for a down market,\u201d he said.Mr. Miller\u2019s fund scored in 2013 by investing in Netflix, Best Buy, Delta Air Lines, E-Trade Financial and Genworth, which he considered wildly undervalued. \u201cYou won\u2019t find many of those in today\u2019s market,\u201d he said, although he\u2019s keeping an eye on J. C. Penney as a potential turnaround story. \u201cWith even a little good news it will jump 50 percent,\u201d he said.This year, he likes the housing sector, financials, technology and airlines. Apple remains one of his fund\u2019s biggest holdings, and he still likes both Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, which should benefit from industry consolidation after the American-US Airways merger. \u201cI think United could double in three years,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s a dramatic industry turnaround in progress.\u201dA Bank of America index of the total returns on United States government bonds fell 3.2 percent for the year, the first annual decline since 2009. And while Mr. Gross\u2019s Pimco Total Return Fund did a little better, it still dropped nearly 2 percent \u2014 its first annual loss since 1999. It also lost its title as the world\u2019s largest mutual fund.Many sectors, like high-yield and municipal bonds, fared much worse.Investors shouldn\u2019t expect anything much better in 2014, Mr. Gross said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as obvious now as it was a year ago,\u201d he told me. \u201cAll bonds are still artificially priced, and that means artificially high. So the question becomes, \u2018Does that change anytime soon?\u2019\u00a0\u201d He noted that the Fed had been very cautious and has pledged to keep rates low for the foreseeable future. So after May\u2019s sudden disruption, the rise in interest rates has been gradual. \u201cI think the trend will continue in 2014,\u201d Mr. Gross said.Still, he said: \u201cUltimately, if you\u2019ve got artificial prices, at some point, those prices begin to head down like we saw in May. That was a wake-up call to mom-and-pop investors that bonds can go down. I think sitting on cash is O.K. It\u2019s hideous in concept. My money market fund yields 0.01 percent. You can do a little better in a short-term Treasury fund or exchange-traded fund. But we\u2019re down to slim pickings, as we say.\u201dOne reason for recent strength in the economy \u2014 and resulting pressure on interest rates \u2014 is the continuing rebound in real estate, which rose a better-than-expected annualized rate of 13.6 percent through October, according to the latest S.&P./Case-Shiller 20-city home price index. That came as no surprise to Professor Case, who told me last year that it was a terrific time to buy real estate and accurately called the bottom of the real estate slump in this column the year before.\u201cThe fundamentals are there to support a pretty good run-up,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cBut the pace of gains is slowing down. People are getting more cautious. Apart from a few pockets, you\u2019re not going to see annualized double-digit gains in housing prices. That\u2019s completely irrational.\u201d Interest rates remain a wild card. \u201cEveryone thinks they\u2019re going higher, but who\u2019s to say?\u201d he said. He noted that current 30-year fixed rates of about 4.5 percent were low by historical standards. \u201cSo over all, I\u2019m cautiously optimistic, but there are a lot of minefields,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indian Central Bank Raises Key Rate", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI \u2014 The Reserve Bank of India unexpectedly raised its benchmark interest rate on Tuesday by 0.25 percentage point, but it said that if consumer price inflation eased as projected, it did not foresee further raises.The policy decision was driven by an expectation that consumer price index inflation would remain high, an indication that the central bank is looking to adopt a recent proposal to base its policy rate decisions on a consumer inflation target. The bank raised its benchmark rate to 8 percent.Most economists in a Reuters poll conducted last week had expected no change. However, expectations for a rate increase had increased after a central bank panel proposed to make consumer inflation the main inflation benchmark.Indian bonds, stocks and the rupee fell after the rate increase but soon recovered most losses. The benchmark 10-year bond yield, which rose as much as 0.09 percentage point after the increase, retreated entirely to continue trading down 0.05 percentage point for the day at 8.72 percent.\u201cFor now, this should mark the peak of the rate hike cycle,\u201d said Radhika Rao, an economist at DBS Bank in Singapore.The consumer price index eased to a three-month low of 9.87 percent in December but remains well above the central bank\u2019s benchmark rate.Last week, a central bank panel proposed revamping its monetary policy structure by setting a consumer inflation target of 4 percent, plus or minus 2 percent, over the long term, with a goal of trimming the index to 8 percent by January 2015 and 6 percent by January 2016.An increase in the benchmark policy rate \u201cwill set the economy securely on the recommended disinflationary path,\u201d the central bank said in a brief policy statement. \u201cIf the disinflationary process evolves according to this baseline projection, further policy tightening in the near term is not anticipated at this juncture.\u201dThe wholesale price index, long the central bank\u2019s main price barometer, slowed to 6.16 percent in December.\u201cIt seems like R.B.I. has implicitly accepted the recommendations implying continued focus on C.P.I. going ahead,\u201d said Upasna Bhardwaj, an economist at ING Vysya Bank, referring to the central bank panel on revamping monetary policy.The bank\u2019s governor, Raghuram Rajan, faces the daunting challenge of reviving an economy growing at a decade low of about 5 percent while battling persistently rising prices fueled considerably by supply-side shortages beyond the control of monetary policy.The central bank said consumer price index inflation was likely to stay above 9 percent during the final quarter of the fiscal year that ends in March and range between 7.5 percent and 8.5 percent for the quarter that ends in March 2015.It also said Indian economic growth was likely to fall short of its earlier projection of 5 percent this fiscal year, improving to 5 to 6 percent in the year that starts in April.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Government Stimulus Lifts Japan", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsHAS Japan turned the economic corner?Nearly a quarter-century after the Japanese stock market bubble burst at the end of 1989, the stock market leapt by more than 50 percent in 2013, as the era of deflation appeared to be finally ending. Final figures are not in, but it appears the economy grew faster in 2013 than in any year since 1996.As the accompanying charts show, however, much of the stimulus for the economy has come from the government, rather than the private sector, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who took office just over a year ago, moved aggressively to apply fiscal stimulus and the central bank, the Bank of Japan, began a program of large purchases of Japanese government bonds.The government\u2019s policies, known as \u201cAbenomics,\u201d are also supposed to include what the prime minister called a \u201cthird arrow\u201d of economic reforms, but they have progressed much more slowly than the first two arrows of fiscal and monetary stimulus. In addition, it is unclear how much of the recent economic growth came from an acceleration of consumer spending in anticipation of an increase in the consumption tax scheduled for April.As can be seen in the accompanying charts, the Nikkei 225 stock index gained 57 percent in 2013. That was a faster annual gain than during any single \u201cbubble\u201d year of the 1980s, and was the largest increase since 1972.Still, the index remains 58 percent below its level at the end of 1989, when the bubble burst.After adjusting for the 18 percent drop in the value of the yen, the Nikkei was still up nearly 30 percent for the year, about the same as the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in the United States. The yen had not declined as rapidly as it did in 2013 in any year since 1979. Even with that fall, however, the yen is valued higher than it was at the end of 2007, when the United States recession began. But the recent decline has provoked protests from American auto manufacturers, who say it is giving Japanese manufacturers an unfair advantage. In 2013, the Japanese stock market rose at the fastest rate since 1972 as deflation appeared to end.For years, some foreign economists, among them Ben Bernanke, who is completing his term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, have been calling on Japan to stimulate inflation by, in effect, printing money. Buying government bonds is a way to accomplish that, and there are signs that deflation is ending. The core Consumer Price Index \u2014 excluding food and energy \u2014 climbed 0.6 percent through November, and is expected to show an annual gain for the first time since 1997. Moreover, Mr. Abe has been pushing Japanese companies to increase wages.The nominal gross domestic product, before adjusting for inflation or deflation, grew 1.9 percent from the fourth quarter of 2012 through the third quarter of 2013. In most other countries, such a figure would be viewed as disappointing, at best. But in Japan, there has not been an annual increase that large since 1996. Even with it, however, the Japanese economy is 7 percent smaller than it was at the peak in 2007. Much of that growth, however, reflects government spending. Public fixed investment in such things as schools and highways was up 16.1 percent over the last three quarters. That is greater than any annual increase since the government began reporting the figure in 1990. But private fixed investment rose just 2 percent over the same period.In its effort to end deflation, and push inflation as high as 2 percent, the Bank of Japan has been buying government bonds faster than the government can issue them. In 2013, the central bank\u2019s assets were up 42 percent, more than in the previous five years combined.The International Monetary Fund has praised the first year of Abenomics. In a speech in Tokyo at the end of October, Anoop Singh, the director of the fund\u2019s Asia and Pacific department, said the new policies provided \u201ca unique opportunity for Japan to end decades-long deflation and sluggish growth, and reverse the rise of public debt.\u201d But, he cautioned, \u201cIn the near term, the challenge will be to achieve a successful transition to the next phase of Abenomics, which should be characterized by self-sustained, private-demand-led growth, and by a steady increase in inflation.\u201dIt is hard to imagine the I.M.F. calling for \u201ca steady increase in inflation\u201d in any other major country. But no other country has suffered from deflation as much as Japan has over the last 15 years. Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Low Turnout in Bangladesh Elections Amid Boycott and Violence", "Date": "2014-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Amid a deepening conflict between Bangladesh\u2019s two main political parties, the scene here in the capital as polls opened for the general elections on Sunday was ominous, with black-clad special forces units and soldiers in combat gear patrolling nearly empty boulevards.Though final results had not been released by early Monday, official counts from Dhaka suggested that the turnout here averaged about 22 percent \u2014 a steep decline from the last general elections, when more than 87 percent voted.At least 19 people were reported to have been killed in political violence, and 440 polling places were closed early because of security concerns. Bangladeshi television stations broadcast images of rural polling places charred by arson attacks, and of bodies wrapped in red blankets.As the largely uncontested elections drew closer, the opposition began a campaign to suppress turnout, hoping it would pressure the government to scrap the results and prepare for new elections under conditions that the B.N.P. would accept. Opposition leaders exulted as the polls closed on Sunday.\u201cI think this so-called election has been clearly and firmly rejected by the people,\u201d Shamsher Mobin Chowdhury, the B.N.P.\u2019s vice chairman, said in a telephone interview.But it is far from clear that the Awami League is ready to compromise with its rival.Bangladesh\u2019s leader, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has signaled her willingness to call early elections ahead of schedule, acknowledging that the new government would have a weak mandate. But in interviews, Awami League leaders laid out a formidable list of preconditions for the B.N.P., including renouncing violence; ending its alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami, the country\u2019s largest Islamic political party; and dropping its demand for a caretaker government.\u201cYou have to understand, a party like the Awami League cannot surrender to another political party on the basis of their demands,\u201d said Tofail Ahmed, one of the Awami League\u2019s leaders. \u201cWe will try our best to have negotiations with the opposition, so that in the future there is a participatory, credible election where all parties will participate. Both sides will have to sacrifice. I cannot give you a date. I cannot give you a time.\u201dThe lack of competition produced a bizarre election, especially given Bangladesh\u2019s tradition of boisterous democracy. Pro-government candidates ran unopposed in more than half of Parliament\u2019s 300 seats; in those districts, local elections were not held, leaving 48 million registered voters without any opportunity to vote.The teams of American and European observers who have been a regular presence in Bangladesh declined to monitor the process this year, saying the elections were flawed, leaving only delegations from India and Bhutan.Starting in the morning, there was a sense of foreboding. Television stations led with the news of the fatal beating of an assistant poll supervisor in the northern district of Thakurgaon. Later in the day, the police in that district opened fire on opposition activists who were trying to prevent voters from reaching polling places, killing two of them. A fourth man was killed in a clash between activists, said Faisal Mahmud, the district\u2019s assistant police superintendent.The news made people jumpy. Ataur Rahman, a street vendor from Thakurgaon, said he had spent the morning calling his relatives and begging them not to vote, for their own safety.Mohammad Ibrahim, a lawyer and B.N.P. activist, said he had spent a month going door to door in his apartment building trying to persuade residents to boycott the polls. The news coverage of the attacks on polling stations had greatly helped his efforts, he said.\u201cWe are not threatening anyone, but definitely they are scared, because they are watching television all the time,\u201d Mr. Ibrahim said. He added that the violence was \u201cmore or less on the shoulders of B.N.P.\u201d because it had called on supporters to oppose the elections. \u201cIn one sense, this is wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the other sense, this is right, because no one is listening to our voice. This is the only way to resist the elections.\u201d\u201cThis is not a situation where you can blame one side,\u201d said Mahfuza Jasmine, 40, a journalist, who added that worried relatives had dissuaded her from working on Sunday. \u201cOur whole politics have come to this situation, because our politicians are driven by their own egos.\u201dFor weeks, political analysts and foreign observers have held out hope that once the elections were over, the two parties would see no option other than to compromise. But the tolerance of each side for the other has been diminishing for years, and it is unclear whether it is possible to break the deadlock, even under intense pressure, said Zafar Sobhan, the editor of The Dhaka Tribune.\u201cIn the past, there was some kind of compact between the Awami League and the B.N.P. \u2014 they didn\u2019t like each other, but they could coexist,\u201d Mr. Sobhan said, adding that this appeared to have changed.\u201cI don\u2019t really see that there is much scope for them to find common ground,\u201d he said. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any ground common enough.\u201dJulfikar Ali Manik contributed reporting from Dhaka.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reflections by America\u2019s Buddha of Banking", "Date": "2014-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWashington MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, seemed so calm during the worst hours of the 2008 financial crisis that Timothy F. Geithner, then the Treasury secretary, once described him as a central banking Buddha.Mr. Bernanke said on Thursday that he was just concentrating on averting a disaster.\u201cIt\u2019s like a car wreck \u2014 you\u2019re mostly involved in trying to avoid going off the bridge,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said. \u201cAnd then later on you say, \u2018Oh my God!\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Bernanke is scheduled to preside over one more meeting of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, in late January, and then step down at the end of the month. He will be succeeded by Janet L. Yellen, currently the Fed\u2019s vice chairwoman.Mr. Bernanke, 60, also an expert on the Great Depression, was working on a popular history \u2014 a book similar to the one Mr. Ahamed later wrote \u2014 before he agreed to join the Fed in 2002. Instead he found himself trying to prevent a second depression.\u201cWe did the right thing \u2014 I hope,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said.He also talked about the Fed\u2019s continuing and less successful efforts to revive the economy and reduce persistent unemployment. Mr. Bernanke said he remained convinced that the American economy eventually would completely recover its losses, but, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll know the answer for a while.\u201dKenneth Rogoff, a Harvard University economist, offered a similar judgment.\u201cWe exist in this world of tremendous uncertainty where we won\u2019t know if monetary policy got it right,\u201d Professor Rogoff said. He noted that one of the most important papers in shaping current understanding of the Great Depression was written by Mr. Bernanke \u2014 half a century after it ended.Mr. Bernanke said little that was new on Thursday, a reflection of his legacy as one of the most open and publicly reflective of Fed chairmen. He has sought to increase the Fed\u2019s transparency since he became its chairman in 2006, and he has answered similar questions in many forums in recent years, including at the first regular news conferences in Fed history.Once more he said that the Fed could not have prevented the failure of Lehman Brothers, the event that set off the worst period of the crisis. Once more he said that his response to the crisis had been guided by the conviction that the government needed to prevent the failure of financial institutions. Once more he defended this policy as primarily aimed at protecting Main Street.He reiterated his hope that in time \u201cpeople will appreciate and understand what we did was necessary and in the interest of the broader public.\u201d He added: \u201cIt was a Main Street set of actions aimed at helping the average American.\u201dMr. Bernanke also defended the Fed\u2019s attempts to revive the economy, including the monthly bond purchases, part of a policy known as quantitative easing, that it has started to taper. Some economists see little evidence that those purchases are working, but Mr. Bernanke said that those critics are ignoring the obvious impact of lower interest rates. \u201cThe problem with Q.E.,\u201d he said, with more than a hint of a smile, \u201cis that it works in practice, but it doesn\u2019t work in theory.\u201dThe Fed decided in December to reduce the volume of its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to $75 billion from $85 billion, and suggested it would scale back the program step by step over the coming year. Mr. Bernanke said that decision reflected the conclusion of Fed officials that the program had served its purpose, rather than any concern about the costs.He was dismissive of critics who saw the bond purchases as inflationary.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a concern and those who\u2019ve been saying for the last five years that we\u2019re just on the brink of hyperinflation I would point them to this morning\u2019s C.P.I. number,\u201d he said, referring to a government report Thursday morning showing that consumer prices rose a mere 1.5 percent in 2013. It was the second straight year that data showed that prices rose by less than 2 percent.Mr. Bernanke said the Fed needed to pay attention to the risk that bond purchases would destabilize markets. \u201cOf the various costs assigned to Q.E., it\u2019s the only one I find personally credible,\u201d he said. He added that Fed officials saw no evidence that those risks had become realities, but, \u201cIt\u2019s always bad luck to make any forecast.\u201dDonald L. Kohn, a former Fed vice chairman now at the Brookings Institution, the private independent research organization, said that as the Fed began to unwind its stimulus campaign, and eventually to raise interest rates, it could face increased pressure from Congress impeding its ability to control risks like inflation and financial stability, and endangering its autonomy.Christina D. Romer, former head of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, countered that she saw no reason to think that critics who want lower interest rates would be more forceful than those who have been pushing for less stimulus.Ms. Romer, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, said central banks jeopardized their autonomy when they failed to do their jobs. Independence is not a virtue in its own right, she said. \u201cThe right reason for central bank independence is that we want monetary policy made by experts.\u201dMr. Bernanke, addressing the same issue in his remarks, also took the view that central banks can best protect autonomy by using it wisely. \u201cThe day that we allow those short-run political pressures to make us do something that is not the right thing for the economy,\u201d he said, \u201cthen our independence is effectively gone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Building a Harley Faster", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyWhile working the line at Harley-Davidson\u2019s factory in York, Pa., Mark Dettinger noticed a small problem. The plastic piece that held electrical parts to the front of a motorcycle, a piece about the size of a hardcover book, wasn\u2019t fitting correctly. Every time a new bike came down the line, it took a few extra shoves to push it into place. In fact, it took an extra 1.2 seconds. But Dettinger, who had spent some 20 years at the York plant, knew that every second counted. With 400 motorcycles built each shift, on two shifts a day, an extra 1.2 seconds per bike added up to 2,200 lost bikes annually. Millions could be lost in revenue. Maybe it wasn\u2019t such a small problem.Before the great recession, Harley-Davidson didn\u2019t have to worry about counting the seconds. There was little competition for their core customers \u2014 \u201cfat white guys,\u201d as one Harley employee called them. Harley charged a huge premium for its bikes, and its customers waited as long as 18 months to receive them. (\u201cEasy Rider\u201d isn\u2019t about a Kawasaki.) Inefficiency was part of the charm. Jim Waltermyer, the union representative at the York plant, said workers could assemble motorcycles at their own pace, music blaring, while sitting on chairs \u2014 if they even showed up at all. \u201cWe had 30 percent absenteeism every Monday and Friday,\u201d Ed Magee, the York plant manager, told me. This all worked fine until, all of a sudden, it didn\u2019t anymore. By 2009, during the worst of the recession, the company was close to collapse. Its stock price had fallen from nearly $75, at its peak, to $8. The inefficiency wasn\u2019t charming anymore.Harley\u2019s York factory represents an alternative to the common narrative of American manufacturing. In recent decades, countless sleepy Northern manufacturers suddenly awoke to global competition. They often responded by breaking their unions, by moving to a Southern right-to-work state or out of the country altogether, and by employing robots on the assembly line. This strategy has been repeated so many times that even as overall manufacturing output has grown by nearly 25 percent, manufacturing jobs have fallen by 30 percent since 2000.Union representation on factory floors has fallen even faster. There are two standard explanations for this phenomenon: Many business leaders and economists have argued the companies had no choice but to stop paying high union wages and benefits; others, especially on the left, argue that this is shortsighted, saying that unions, with their emphasis on skill and tenure, can make companies \u2014 and the country over all \u2014 richer.Harley-Davidson seemed like a great place to test this theory. Keith Wandell, the chief executive, told me that even during the company\u2019s worst days, management never considered busting its union. Frankly, it couldn\u2019t. The company has an \u201cAmerican blue-collar, working man\u201d brand, Magee said, and to get rid of its union or to make its motorcycles in Mexico would have been catastrophic. The company knew it had to keep employing members of the International Association of Machinists and United Steelworkers, who were paid far more than nonunion workers in the South and several multiples of the going rate in Mexico. The company could only compete by redesigning the production system so that each worker created more value than they cost.Harley tore down the existing plant and built a new one. Unlike most factories I\u2019ve seen lately, the new plant in York has people everywhere. There are no robots on the main assembly line (they have various peripheral jobs); instead, hundreds of workers, operating in teams of five or six, manually build each motorcycle. This seemed like an expensive way of doing business, but Magee said that experienced, skilled workers, unlike robots, can constantly adjust to new information. The York plant makes four basic styles of motorcycle, but each has an array of customizable options. There are around 1,200 different configurations, and a new bike starts its way through the production line every 80 seconds. Virtually each one is unique, and workers have no idea what\u2019s coming 80 seconds later. Surprisingly, robots can\u2019t adjust on the fly like that.Human beings can also solve thorny problems that lead to major inefficiencies, like that plastic piece that took an extra 1.2 seconds to install. Dettinger and a small team quickly came up with a fix \u2014 a tiny plastic latch needed to be set at a different angle \u2014 and saved Harley millions. (On the day I visited, he solved two other problems.) In fact, his entire job is to continuously monitor his small section of the production line and search for better ways to make motorcycles. There are 150 problem-solvers like him in the factory.Harley\u2019s very existence was in question in 2009. Today it is a manufacturing role model, and that has a lot to do with its workers. The average tenure of a line worker at the York plant is 18 years, and these workers are extremely devoted to the company. (\u201cHow many factory workers have the company logo tattooed on their arm?\u201d Dettinger asked me.) Magee said there was no question that the workers were earning their relatively higher wages. Costs have fallen by $100 million at the plant and quality has improved even more significantly. Customer demand is extremely high, especially now that people can get a bike within a couple weeks of ordering rather than waiting a year and a half. Harley\u2019s stock price is back near the peak it reached at the top of the bubble in 2006. Craig Kennison at the research firm Baird told me that \u201cit\u2019s certainly the best turnaround I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Recently, the York plant won the Oscars of manufacturing: an IndustryWeek Best Plants award.This sort of success wasn\u2019t without a cost. The machinist union agreed to let Harley lay off 1,000 plant workers and implement a multiyear pay freeze. But every machinist I spoke with said that he understood that the alternative would be no jobs at all in York. I also wondered, as I watched Dettinger run off to solve yet another problem on the line, if Harley would have been able to turn it around without experienced union workers. It reminded me of the notion of \u201cbeneficial constraints,\u201d in which government policy, notably in Germany, creates powerful work councils, which force manufacturers to pay and treat workers well. This has, arguably, turned much of Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector into the equivalent of the York plant. German companies have no choice but to focus on making high-quality precision goods that merit the higher costs that can cover a more expensive work force. Motor-vehicle workers in Germany make around $60 an hour, well above hourly U.S. auto wages. It did strike me that while only 10 percent of American manufacturing workers are in unions, more than 30 percent of the IndustryWeek Best Plants finalists have been unionized.Harley\u2019s lesson is complex, but also clear. Organizing a nonunion plant does not guarantee manufacturing success, but for certain companies \u2014 with strong brand associations, customizable product lines and world-class equipment and processes \u2014 union workers can be not a cost but an asset. And that\u2019s good news for much of the manufacturing industry. The United States, after all, is in the midst of the long shift from commodity competition, in the form of low-cost generic goods, to, well, just that kind of work.Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR\u2019s \u201cPlanet Money,\u201d a podcast and blog.Advertisement"}

Blige. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to ask, \u2018What\u2019s been accomplished?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Schmidt, who is a friend of Mr. Berggruen, said of the institute. \u201cBut is he the sponsor of conversations?\u201d He added, \u201cAll he can do is get the ideas teed up.\u201d Still, the convergence of so much wealth and brainpower in one place generates its own momentum.A quick stroll through its main site, the Congress Center, yielded a series of \u201cOverheard in Davos\u201d moments. \u201cIt has no natural resources to export,\u201d someone said about India. \u201cI underestimated Mexico,\u201d another said. Within a matter of hours on Friday, Bono took the same seat where the Saudi finance minister had chatted with Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund.Back at the party at the Swiss chalet, as Daft Punk\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d played, Mr. Berggruen talked about his fascination with which governments work and which don\u2019t, about his interest in East and West. He said that he hated the \u201chomeless billionaire\u201d moniker, and that anyway it would soon no longer apply. He had recently bought houses in New York and Los Angeles, which are under renovation. \u201cI haven\u2019t moved in yet,\u201d he said. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Big Business Joins Obama Effort to Aid Long-Term Unemployed", "Date": "2014-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Obama hosted a group of corporate chief executives at the White House on Friday to highlight those efforts and the use of presidential persuasion to help the jobless find work.White House officials said that about 300 businesses, including 21 of the nation\u2019s 50 largest companies and 47 of the top 200, had agreed to new hiring policies that ensure applicants who have not worked in a long time are not unfairly screened out.\u201cFolks who\u2019ve been unemployed the longest often have the toughest time getting back to work,\u201d Mr. Obama said at the event. \u201cIt\u2019s a cruel catch-22 \u2014 the longer you\u2019re unemployed, the more unemployable you may seem. Now this is an illusion, but it\u2019s one that, unfortunately, we know statistically is happening out there.\u201d\u201cJust because you\u2019ve been out of work for a while does not mean that you are not a hard worker,\u201d Mr. Obama added. \u201cJust means you had bad luck or you were in the wrong industry or you lived in a region of the country that\u2019s catching up a little slower than others in the recovery.\u201dTo illustrate his point, Mr. Obama was introduced by a formerly jobless veteran who eventually found work with the help of a training program. Erick Varela, a former Army combat infantryman in Iraq, returned to California in 2008 and had trouble finding a job that matched his qualifications. He ended up unemployed and homeless until he enrolled in a program started by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company that enabled him to become an apprentice electrician.\u201cThe work PG&E provided to me restored purpose to my life and gave me a sense of direction once again,\u201d Mr. Varela said. Among the companies whose chief executives appeared with Mr. Obama, according to the White House, were Motorola, eBay, Deloitte, BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, Boeing, Bank of America, Marriott International, McDonald\u2019s and Walgreens.The challenge for the long-term unemployed has become especially acute as the economy struggles to recover from one of the deepest recessions in modern times. While unemployment among those out of work for a short time has returned to historical norms, officials said, it remains particularly high among those who have been seeking jobs for longer periods. Nearly four million Americans are categorized as long-term unemployed.White House officials offered no estimate of how many workers might be helped by Mr. Obama\u2019s initiative. And, of course, every job that goes to someone who has been out of work for a long time cannot go to someone out of work for a shorter period, so there would be no net gain in employment. But officials said it was important to keep workers from growing so frustrated by a fruitless job search that they gave up altogether.In one recent study, scholars from the University of Toronto, Yale University and the University of Chicago sent out 12,000 invented r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Of those reporting that they had been out of work for a month, 7 percent were offered interviews; of those who were said to be out of work for eight months, just 4 percent were called for interviews.Gene B. Sperling, the president\u2019s economics adviser, showed some of the studies to Mr. Obama last year. The White House drafted a set of \u201cbest practices\u201d to change employers\u2019 screening processes and solicited individual companies to join the effort. Mr. Sperling sent an email directly to Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of News Corp. \u201cMany C.E.O.\u2019s had just not thought about the issue,\u201d Mr. Sperling said.Mr. Obama signed an executive memo on Friday instructing the federal government to abide by the same practices. And he announced that the Labor Department would direct $150 million to partnerships that help workers develop needed skills.Mr. Sperling said the event may spur other businesses to follow suit. \u201cOur hope,\u201d he said, \u201cis that this is not the destination or culmination of this, but this will have a larger and more significant impact.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emerging Market Currencies Slide", "Date": "2014-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEmerging market currencies slumped on Wednesday even after Turkey and South Africa aggressively raised interest rates to stop capital flight, as investors braced for an expected decision by the United States Federal Reserve to cut back on stimulus.Markets from Istanbul to Sao Paulo remained under stress, with the Turkish lira staging a short-lived rally that set the tone for other emerging market currencies. Turkey\u2019s stronger-than-expected monetary tightening put pressure on the most fragile developing countries to follow suit in hopes of preventing jittery investors from running for the exits.\u201cEmerging markets in general will have to offer significantly higher funding costs in order to stabilize the dramatic change we are now seeing in net portfolio flows in the asset class,\u201d a Citi foreign exchange strategist, Ishitaa Sharma, said in a note.The South African rand sank over 2 percent to 11.24 per dollar even after the country\u2019s central bank raised interest rates for the first time in almost six years, bringing its benchmark rate to 5.5 percent from 5.0 percent.In Turkey, where the central bank raised all of its interest rates in a dramatic fashion, the lira initially rallied more than 3 percent but eventually gave up gains and traded about 1 percent weaker as investors began to wonder what else policymakers could do to quell the turmoil.\u201cThe Turkish rate move was more aggressive than many people had expected. That was the good part of the story,\u201d said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of currency research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.\u201cBut the market had to force this activity. There is still a fear in the market that the central bank does not have a reaction function.\u201dTurkey\u2019s central bank move follows a massive lira sell-off caused by the prospect of a reduction in U.S. stimulus that has sucked investor cash out of the most vulnerable emerging economies. Investors deem real interest rates in these markets too low to compensate for growing economic and political risks.Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek addressed one of those concerns on Wednesday, saying that economic growth will not be severely damaged by the rate hikes and that it is too early to adjust the government\u2019s forecast of 4 percent growth this year.The rate increase follows similar moves across the developing world, with India unexpectedly raising rates this week and Brazil and Indonesia already in policy-tightening mode.But Malaysia\u2019s central bank left rates unchanged on Wednesday, taking the ringgit to the day\u2019s lows. And with the U.S. Federal Reserve expected to announce plans later on Wednesday to shave another $10 billion off its monthly bond buying, emerging markets remained fragile.Latin American currencies posted large losses, with the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso declining nearly 1 percent ahead of the Fed announcement.Emerging market stocks were also volatile. The main emerging index rose 0.1 percent off 4-1/2 month lows, but the Latin American portion of the index slid more than 1 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Respected Russian University Feels Kremlin\u2019s Scrutiny", "Date": "2014-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational EducationMOSCOW \u2014 The Kremlin appears to be in a forgiving mood.Russia recently pardoned the former oil baron turned activist Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky and other prominent critics of President Vladimir V. Putin in a move widely seen as an attempt to mollify international criticism on the eve of the Winter Olympics in Sochi. But at least one university remains tied up in a criminal inquiry connected to Mr. Khodorkovsky \u2014 and there are few signs of its abating.Several professors at the Higher School of Economics here are under investigation for their alleged roles in what is known as the \u201ccase of experts.\u201d The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, the equivalent of the F.B.I., has accused them of illegally receiving funds to lobby on behalf of Mr. Khodorkovsky, who was convicted and imprisoned on charges of fraud and other crimes in proceedings that were widely labeled as political.The case has placed the university at the center of what some Russians see as an effort by Mr. Putin to quiet academics who speak out against government policies.Tamara G. Morshchakova, who is head of the school\u2019s department of judicial power and justice administration and is one of the scholars under fire, said, \u201cThe attack on us was ordered by authorities in order to threaten and mute us.\u201dThe so-called case of experts centers on a report produced in 2011 by the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights, a government-appointed panel of legal scholars, business leaders, workers with nongovernmental organizations, and others.The report, whose authors included Ms. Morshchakova, found problems with the 2010 trial of Mr. Khodorkovsky and his business partner Platon Lebedev when they were found guilty of embezzlement and money laundering. (Mr. Khodorkovsky had previously been convicted of fraud.)Not long after the report was released, Russian investigators started questioning whether those who worked on the report had indirectly received money from Mr. Khodorkovsky.In 2012, the Investigative Committee raided the Higher School of Economics\u2019 Center for Legal and Economic Studies, which the agency accused of helping to launder money on behalf of Mr. Khodorkovsky. More recently, Ms. Morshchakova and other faculty members connected to the report or the center were taken in for questioning.Other targets of the investigation include Mikhail A. Fedotov, a prominent law professor and director of the department on copyright and intellectual-property rights, while the Center for Legal and Economic Studies has been practically shut down by the inquiry.Ms. Morshchakova and the other professors, who are still working as the investigation continues, deny any wrongdoing. None of them has been charged with any crime. Ms. Morshchakova said she and her colleagues had received grants from foreign governments, but never money from people or entities connected to Mr. Khodorkovsky or to Yukos, the oil company he used to own.The investigation has also taken aim at academics outside the school.Sergei M. Guriev, a former rector of the New Economic School, in Moscow, fled to Paris in May last year after investigators visited his office. The departure of a prominent university leader sent a wave of concern through the Russian academic world \u2014 and the Higher School of Economics.\u201cOnce Guriev escaped from Russia, several of my postgraduate students wondered whether they should leave the country, too,\u201d because of the negative environment for academics, said Isak Froumin, academic supervisor of the school\u2019s Institute of Education.Established in 1992 by Russian economists to help the former Soviet Union make the transition to a market economy, the highly respected school was granted \u201cnational research university\u201d status in 2009. So far, it has said little about the investigation. \u201cThe priority is to preserve and save the school\u2019s faculties,\u201d said Yevgeny G. Yasin, the institution\u2019s academic supervisor.Sergei A. Markov, a former adviser to the Kremlin and a professor of political science at Moscow State University, said Russia was not unfairly scrutinizing academics.\u201cThere is no crackdown,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Kremlin is just sending a signal to professors sympathizing with opposition that they should not be working in government institutions and at the same time serving interests of Putin\u2019s radical opposition.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe case of experts showed that you cannot be in Putin\u2019s team, take government resources, and at the same time work in Khodorkovsky\u2019s interests.\u201dAs the investigation continues, the atmosphere on the campus remains tense.According to Mr. Froumin, classroom discussions about sensitive topics, like human rights, gay rights, and religion, are very difficult.During a recent lecture, Mr. Froumin was discussing gender and minority issues at universities when one of his students raised his hand and asked: \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid to talk on this subject?\u201d The student was concerned about a recent law that bans the distribution to minors of what it called gay propaganda, and whether it could be broadly interpreted to include a discussion in a lecture hall.In general, Mr. Froumin said the university remained \u201can oasis of freedom,\u201d compared with other parts of Russian society. But the recent investigation has taken a toll.\u201cIn the conditions of increasing legal obscurantism,\u201d he said, \u201cprofessors fear that they might be misinterpreted.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Republicans to Call for Legal Status for Some Immigrants", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House Republican leadership\u2019s broad framework for overhauling the nation\u2019s immigration laws will call this week for a path to legal status \u2014 but not citizenship \u2014 for many of the 11 million adult immigrants who are in the country illegally, according to aides who have seen the party\u2019s statement of principles. For immigrants brought to the United States illegally as young children, the Republicans would offer a path to citizenship. But even before the document is unveiled later, some of the party\u2019s leading strategists and conservative voices are urging that the immigration push be abandoned, or delayed until next year, to avoid an internal party rupture before the midterm elections.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the few things that could actually disrupt what looks like a strong Republican year,\u201d said William Kristol, editor of the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard, calling an immigration push \u201ca recipe for disaster.\u201dAt the same time, Republicans have seen their support from Latinos plummet precisely because of their stance on immigration, and the \u201cstatement of principles,\u201d barely more than a page, is intended to try to reverse that trajectory.The statement of principles criticizes the American higher education system for educating some of the world\u2019s best and brightest students only to lose them to their home countries because they cannot obtain green cards; insists that Republicans demand that current immigration laws be enforced before illegal immigrants are granted legal status; and mentions that some kind of triggers must be included in an immigration overhaul to ensure that borders are secured first, said Republican officials who have seen the principles.The status of the immigration overhaul in the Senate and House.With concern already brewing among conservatives who call any form of legal status \u201camnesty,\u201d the document has the feel more of an attempt to test the waters than a blueprint for action. House Republican leaders will circulate it at a three-day retreat for their members that begins Wednesday on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Several pro-immigration organizations that have been briefed on the guidelines say they are not intended to serve as a conservative starting point for future negotiations, but as a gauge of how far to the left House Republicans are willing to move.Even ardent proponents of an immigration-law overhaul are, at best, cautiously optimistic. In June, a broad immigration overhaul \u2014 with a 13-year path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants now in the country illegally, and stricter border security provisions that would have to be in place before the immigrants could gain legal status \u2014 passed the Senate with bipartisan support. But that legislation has largely stalled in the Republican-controlled House, where Mr. Boehner has rejected any negotiations with the Senate over its comprehensive bill.\u201cThis is obviously a long, hard road,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat, who helped negotiate the Senate bill, \u201cbut I think since August, the number on the other side vehemently opposed has stayed the same, the number who think it should go forward has grown, and numbers in the wide middle are less opposed than they used to be. But that doesn\u2019t guarantee an outcome one way or another.\u201dRepublican Party leaders, backed strongly by business groups, have said an overhaul is critical if they are to repair their political position with Latino and other immigrant voters.But immigration is less of an issue during midterm elections, when immigrants are not as likely to vote and House members in safe districts are insulated somewhat from the wrath of more moderate swing voters. Often the biggest threats to Republicans are primary challenges from more conservative candidates who say that changing the immigration status of someone who is in the country illegally amounts to amnesty for a lawbreaker.Representative John Carter, Republican of Texas and one of the Gang of Eight House members who tried to forge a bipartisan overhaul, was quoted by the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call as saying that an election year is not the time to press forward. \u201cImmigration is a very, very contentious issue,\u201d he said.Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, has allowed his staff to discuss with House conservatives ways to derail the push. On Monday, he said they were making headway.\u201cRepublicans in the House have a choice whether to go along with certain powerful forces and the president or stand with conviction against a larger flow of immigration that threatens the financial future of middle-class Americans,\u201d he said.Mr. Kristol, who said he had spoken with a number of Republican candidates, said \u201ca rebellion is beginning\u201d among Republicans who feel blindsided by the resurgence of the immigration issue.On the Democratic side, a major question is whether those pushing for a broad immigration overhaul would accept any Republican proposal that falls short of full citizenship for immigrants who are now here illegally. President Obama has said he wants any new immigration legislation to include a path to citizenship for both children and adults.But citizenship, said Randel K. Johnson, a senior vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, is not \u201creally critical to getting a deal done.\u201d\u201cI think most people would think citizenship is important because then people feel they are part of the American dream,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. But, he added, \u201cif these people can come out of the shadows, work and travel, that\u2019s what they want, that\u2019s what recent polls have shown, and that will move the economy along.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bubble Is Back", "Date": "2014-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 IN November, housing starts were up 23 percent, and there was cheering all around. But the crowd would quiet down if it realized that another housing bubble had begun to grow.Almost everyone understands that the 2007-8 financial crisis was precipitated by the collapse of a huge housing bubble. The Obama administration\u2019s remedy of choice was the Dodd-Frank Act. It is the most restrictive financial regulation since the Great Depression \u2014 but it won\u2019t prevent another housing bubble.Housing bubbles are measured by comparing current prices to a reliable index of housing prices. Fortunately, we have one. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping track of the costs of renting a residence since at least 1983; its index shows a steady rise of about 3 percent a year over this 30-year period. This is as it should be; other things being equal, rentals should track the inflation rate. Home prices should do the same. If prices rise much above the rental rate, families theoretically would begin to rent, not buy. Housing bubbles, then, become visible \u2014 and can legitimately be called bubbles \u2014 when housing prices diverge significantly from rents. In 1997, housing prices began to diverge substantially from rental costs. Between 1997 and 2002, the average compound rate of growth in housing prices was 6 percent, exceeding the average compound growth rate in rentals of 3.34 percent. This, incidentally, contradicts the widely held idea that the last housing bubble was caused by the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy. Between 1997 and 2000, the Fed raised interest rates, and they stayed relatively high until almost 2002 with no apparent effect on the bubble, which continued to maintain an average compound growth rate of 6 percent until 2007, when it collapsed.Today, after the financial crisis, the recession and the slow recovery, the bubble is beginning to grow again. Between 2011 and the third quarter of 2013, housing prices grew by 5.83 percent, again exceeding the increase in rental costs, which was 2 percent. Many commentators will attribute this phenomenon to the Fed\u2019s low interest rates. Maybe so; maybe not. Recall that the Fed\u2019s monetary policy was blamed for the earlier bubble\u2019s growth between 1997 and 2002, even though the Fed raised interest rates during most of that period.Both this bubble and the last one were caused by the government\u2019s housing policies, which made it possible for many people to purchase homes with very little or no money down. In 1992, Congress adopted what were called \u201caffordable housing\u201d goals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are huge government-backed firms that buy mortgages from banks and other lenders. Then, as now, they were the dominant players in the residential mortgage markets. The goals required Fannie and Freddie to buy an increasing quota of mortgages made to borrowers who were at or below the median income where they lived. Through the 1990s and into the 2000s, the Department of Housing and Urban Development raised the quotas seven times, so that in the 2000s more than 50 percent of all the mortgages Fannie and Freddie acquired had to be made to home buyers who were at or below the median income. To make mortgages affordable for low-income borrowers, Fannie and Freddie reduced the down payments on mortgages they would acquire. By 1994, Fannie was accepting down payments of 3 percent and, by 2000, mortgages with zero-down payments. Although these lenient standards were intended to help low-income and minority borrowers, they couldn\u2019t be confined to those buyers. Even buyers who could afford down payments of 10 to 20 percent were attracted to mortgages with 3 percent or zero down. By 2006, the National Association of Realtors reported that 45 percent of first-time buyers put down no money. The leverage in that case is infinite.This drove up housing prices. Buying a home became preferable to renting. A low or nonexistent down payment meant that families could borrow more and still remain within the monthly payment they could afford, especially if it was accompanied \u2014 as it often was \u2014 by an interest-only loan or a 30-year loan that amortized slowly. In effect, then, borrowing was constrained only by appraisals, which were ratcheted upward by the exclusive use of comparables in setting housing values.If we expect to prevent the next crisis, we have to prevent the next bubble, and we will never do that without eliminating leverage where it counts: among home buyers.

{"Headline": "Economy Is Expanding, but Obama\u2019s Legacy May Be Slipping Away", "Date": "2014-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive years into the Obama presidency, the American economy is finally showing some momentum. The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that the economy grew by 3.2 percent in the final quarter of 2013, echoing the even stronger 4.1 percent pace of expansion in the summer months and providing the White House with a rare bit of good news despite dismal public approval ratings. But even if 2014 turns out to be what the president called a \u201cbreakout year\u201d in his State of the Union address Tuesday, the country will still have a lot of catching up to do before the gains recorded under Mr. Obama match those of his two predecessors in the White House. Much of the shortfall through the first year of President Obama\u2019s second term dates back to the deep hole he inherited from George W. Bush as the economy plunged into the Great Recession at the end of 2007. Still, despite giving President Obama credit for helping steer the country out of the recession, economists say he still faces an uphill battle to burnish his economic legacy before he leaves office in early 2017.\u201cEven if you have another two or three years of pretty good growth, how much are the averages really going to move up?\u201d asked Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS. \u201cCompared to the Clinton years, and frankly, most of the Bush years, it will be tough to match.\u201dFor example, after including the latest figures for growth on Thursday, the economy has expanded at annual rate of 1.8 percent under President Obama, half the pace of growth in the first five years of the Clinton administration,and below the 2.5 percent annual growth rate for President Bush between December 2000 and December 2005 in the same years. The rise in disposable per capita income has also been weaker, inching up just 0.6 percent annually in the last five years, compared with almost 2 percent from 1993 to 2008. Unemployment has come down sharply recently, but at 6.7 percent, it is still roughly two percentage points higher than at this time in the Clinton and Bush presidencies. \u201cThe economy is behaving differently now than it did in those two periods under Clinton and Bush,\u201d Mr. Berger said. \u201cWithout a meaningful increase in employment, it makes it difficult to power strong growth in the future.\u201d Mr. Berger\u2019s outlook is more pessimistic than that of some of his peers on Wall Street; many other economists now believe 2014 \u2014 if not necessarily a breakout year \u2014 is still very likely to be the strongest since Mr. Obama took office in January 2009. \u201cThe U.S. economy is at an inflection point,\u201d said Ellen B. Zentner, senior United States economist at Morgan Stanley. \u201cThe recovery is just now beginning to look like what a normal recovery looks like. We\u2019ve been in no man\u2019s land.\u201d \u201cIf I were going to keep scorecards, I\u2019d start now,\u201d Ms. Zentner added. The encouraging report on growth, along with measured optimism about 2014, helped lift Wall Street on Thursday, despite continuing worries about weakness in emerging markets and the slow but steady withdrawal of some of the Federal Reserve\u2019s giant monetary stimulus.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 19.99 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 1,794.19. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 109.82 points, or 0.7 percent, to 15,848.61. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 71.69 points, or 1.8 percent, to 4,123.13. In the bond market, interest rates were little changed. The yield on the Treasury\u2019s 10-year note edged up to 2.69 percent, from 2.68 percent late Wednesday, while its price slipped 5/32, to 100 15/32.The stock market has been one major winner under President Obama, with the S.&P. 500 having more than doubled since it bottomed out in early 2009, shortly after he took office.But while Wall Street was rebounding, President Obama has faced major headwinds in a series of fiscal crises in Washington, not just the debt ceiling battle last year but also a face-off over the same issue in the summer of 2011 that unnerved Wall Street and prompted a downgrade in the country\u2019s credit rating. The fiscal cliff showdown over expiring tax cuts in late 2012 did not help matters, either.While Democrats and Republicans each blame the other side for those fights, the chief economist at the consulting firm IHS, Nariman Behravesh, said that President Obama should have done more earlier in his first term to forge a broader fiscal blueprint. \u201cHe could have tried harder to work out a compromise, and some uncertainty would have been off the table,\u201d Mr. Behravesh said. Now, after years of this kind of wrangling, Mr. Behravesh said there were signs that companies and consumers were simply paying less attention to the dysfunction in Washington. \u201cA lot of people are feeling jaded,\u201d Mr. Behravesh noted. Even during the government shutdown in October, he said, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a huge impact beyond the beltway and business pretty much ignored it.\u201d That came as a surprise to many economists, not to mention Washington\u2019s pundits, as did the broader turnaround in the third and fourth quarters of 2013. It was the strongest second-half performance in a decade \u2014 and far better than experts were predicting not long ago. The single biggest positive factor in the fourth-quarter expansion of gross domestic product was a healthy rise in consumer spending, despite the mixed results of some retailers during the holiday season. Personal consumption expenditures rose by 3.3 percent, up from 2 percent in the previous quarter, with strong demand for durable goods like washing machines and televisions as well as nondurables like food and clothing. In the service sector, spending on dining and hotels jumped after barely increasing in the previous two quarters. Exports also surged while imports increased only slightly, making trade the second biggest contributor to growth after consumer spending.As was the case in the third quarter, inventory additions by businesses also lifted growth, adding 0.4 of a percentage point. Some of those stockpiles will most likely be drawn down in the first quarter of 2014, slowing the expansion a bit in the current quarter, economists said.Over all, government expenditures plunged 12.6 percent in the fourth quarter because of the partial federal shutdown and a broader fiscal squeeze, lowering total growth by nearly a full percentage point. The Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Commerce Department unit that tracks G.D.P., said the full effect of the government closure \u201ccannot be quantified,\u201d but estimated that the hours lost as government employees stayed home shaved off 0.3 of a percentage point. Housing was also a source of weakness, cutting overall growth by 0.3 percentage point. Some of that drop was weather-related, as construction activity halted, but it also represented a slowing of housing gains as mortgage interest rates rose and the sector\u2019s postrecession rebound cooled.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty solid report with a big burst in consumption at the end of the year, a big narrowing in the trade deficit and some weakness in housing,\u201d said Julia Coronado, chief economist for North America at BNP Paribas. The fourth-quarter number was the Commerce Department\u2019s first estimate of the economy\u2019s performance in the period. Government statisticians will revise the growth number two more times in late February and late March as more data comes in. Also on Thursday, the Labor Department said weekly applications for unemployment benefits rose 19,000 last week to 348,000, the highest in about a month. But the broader trend in applications remains low. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, increased just 750 to 333,000. The increase follows three weeks of declines.And the National Association of Realtors said Thursday that pending home sales fell to their lowest point in December since October 2011, but economists were wary of declaring a fundamental shift because unusually cold weather played an uncertain role in the pullback.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Oil Production Keeps Rising Beyond the Forecasts", "Date": "2014-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsOIL production in the United States rose by a record 992,000 barrels a day in 2013, the International Energy Agency estimated this week.\u201cWe keep raising our forecasts, and we keep underestimating production,\u201d said Lejla Alic, a Paris-based analyst with the agency. The increase left United States production at 7.5 million barrels a day, with both November and December production estimated to have been over eight million barrels a day.American consumption of oil also rose last year, by 390,000 barrels a day, or 2.1 percent, to 18.9 million barrels a day. The agency increased its estimate of American oil use in the final quarter of the year, although it lowered its estimate of the increase in some other countries, including China. Over all, world consumption rose 1.4 percent, making 2013 the first year since 1999 that the use of oil in the United States rose more rapidly than in the rest of the world.The agency said that demand was strong in the petrochemical industry in the United States, which has benefited from the fact that rising supply has left American crude oil prices lower than those in many other countries. The agency estimated that demand for gasoline in the United States rose as a result of increasing consumer confidence and more sales of sport utility vehicles.Despite the 2013 increases, oil use in most developed countries remains well below the levels of 2007, the last pre-recession year. The United States is estimated to have used 8.5 percent less oil in 2013 than it did in 2007, while demand is down by about 25 percent in Italy and Spain, European countries that were hard hit by the euro area\u2019s problems. Germany stands out, with 2013 usage equal to that of 2007.In the developing world, oil use has been rising steadily. Demand in China and Brazil is up more than 30 percent since 2007, and India\u2019s consumption is 17 percent higher.The agency estimates that in 2014, the 34 mostly rich countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development will consume less than half the oil used in the world. That would be a first: As recently as 2004, their share was over 60 percent, and in 2013, it was estimated to be 50.5 percent.Over the same period, the United States\u2019 share of the market fell to 21 percent from 25 percent, while China\u2019s share rose to 11 percent from less than 8 percent. But the American share was estimated to have risen slightly in 2013, the first annual increase since 1999. The increase in United States production in 2013 exceeded the increase of 836,000 barrels a day in 2012. The largest increase before that, of 751,000 barrels, was in 1951, according to the United States Energy Information Administration. In percentage terms, the 15.3 percent increase in 2013 was the largest since an 18.9 percent gain in 1940.American oil production fell steadily from the early 1990s through 2008, but has since risen for five consecutive years, largely because of increased production of shale oil. Not since the late 1960s, when production in Texas was peaking and Alaska oil was beginning to come on stream, has there been such a string of annual increases. As a result, United States oil production climbed to the highest level since 1989, although it remains well below the record production of 9.6 million barrels a day, set in 1970.The agency forecast that American production would continue to rise in 2014, adding 782,000 barrels, to 8.3 million barrels a day.If that forecast proves to be accurate, United States oil production will have increased 46 percent over the three years from 2011 to 2014. There has not been a three-year increase that large since the years 1921-24, exactly nine decades earlier.Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Opposition Dissent Tempers Greek Attempts at Optimism", "Date": "2014-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Greek and European Union leaders gathered last week in the Athens opera house to sing each other\u2019s praises for saving Greece and Europe from financial disaster, pointing to faint signs of economic recovery after six years of recession in the country that ignited the Continent\u2019s tumultuous debt crisis in 2009.The ceremony culminated what was supposed to be a celebration of Greece\u2019s role as the European Union\u2019s new president, a rotating position that lasts six months and confers little real power but which usually stirs national pride and helps tamp down domestic political rivalries.Absent from the celebratory chorus, however, was the protagonist of a Greek political drama that, unlike the country\u2019s painful economic situation, shows no sign of calming.The no-show was Alexis Tsipras, the leader of what polls show is Greece\u2019s most popular political party. He is also a relentless critic of economic policies that have been blamed for Greece\u2019s 27 percent unemployment rate, policies that are also raising hopes that the country will in 2014 record its first year of economic growth since 2007.Mr. Tsipras, who heads Syriza, a fractious grouping of left-wing forces, said he wanted no part in a \u201cpre-election fiesta\u201d put on by Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, who heads a fragile and deeply unpopular coalition government. Nor, added Mr. Tsipras, could he cheer economic policies that are largely dictated by Germany and have made budget cuts and other austerity measures the main prescription for Europe\u2019s economic ills.There are signs that Greece\u2019s churning politics could blow its rosier economic forecasts off course. The credit rating agency Fitch, in a report on Greece issued last month, identified political instability as a \u201csignificant\u201d risk.\u201cReform fatigue,\u201d Fitch noted, \u201cis taking its toll of the coalition\u2019s popularity and defections have reduced its majority in Parliament to just four M.P.'s.\u201d (This has since slipped to three.)A new election, added Fitch, \u201ccould produce an anti-austerity, anti-E.U. administration, albeit one that stopped short of Greek exit from the euro.\u201dThe European Union, Mr. Tsipras said in an interview at his party\u2019s headquarters in Athens, \u201chas become a Germanic Union\u201d and put Greece and other struggling nations \u201con a very bad road\u201d by demanding grinding austerity in return for bailout funds.\u201cWhat has happened in Greece in the last few years is a stain on European civilization,\u201d said Mr. Tsipras, who looks set to become Greece\u2019s next prime minister, or at least its kingmaker in Parliament, if his party\u2019s popularity holds.Anger at Germany, whose chancellor, Angela Merkel, has resisted any write-off of Greek debts, is widespread across much of Southern Europe but is particularly acute in Athens. Unidentified gunmen in late December opened fire with an assault rifle on the residence of the German ambassador. Nobody was hurt.On the day Mr. Tsipras skipped a ceremony attended by Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, and by other dignitaries from Brussels, Mr. Samaras\u2019s party, New Democracy, denounced Syriza as having \u201cwell-known links to terrorism.\u201dThe accusation followed the \u201cescape\u201d of Christodoulos Xiros, a terrorist serving six life sentences for his role in multiple killings and bombings by the leftist guerrilla group November 17, which has been dismantled. He disappeared last Monday during a prison furlough, stirring dismay in Washington and speculation in the Greek news media of a resurgence of political violence.New Democracy presented no evidence of any links to terrorism by Syriza, which dismissed the claim as part of a government campaign to stir public fear against the left at a time when the main threat of political violence comes from Golden Dawn, an extreme rightist party with 18 seats in Parliament. Half of these lawmakers face criminal charges for joining and organizing what prosecutors say is a criminal organization. Golden Dawn nonetheless remains Greece\u2019s third most popular party.\u201cOur main enemy, our main opponent, is the fear that the government and media try to create about Syriza and a leftist government in Greece,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said. \u201cWe are fighting for a very big change, a radical political change. In front of every change there are a lot of people who are afraid for the future.\u201dEuropean and Greek leaders stressed the importance of sticking with the current course, focusing on glimmers of economic hope, particularly a possible return to growth and a sharp narrowing of a once gaping budget deficit. Greece has moved ahead of schedule into a so-called primary budget surplus, a calculation that excludes interest payments.Greece predicts that its economy will grow 0.6 percent in 2014. But others, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, say that even this is too optimistic and forecast another year of contraction.\u201cGreece, after huge sacrifices, is able to say that it is leaving behind the crisis,\u201d Mr. Samaras said at a joint news conference with Mr. Barroso last week in Athens. \u201cGreece is now standing on its own feet.\u201dIts politics, however, are decidedly unsteady, and support for the European Union, according to an opinion poll released this month by Gallup, has never been lower. The approval rating among Greeks of the Union\u2019s leadership, according to the survey, has fallen to 19 percent at the start of this year from 60 percent in 2009.Mr. Samaras is hoping to hang on in office until at least 2016, when the next national elections are due to be held. \u201cAs a person, I always see the glass half full,\u201d he told journalists on Friday.But with his main coalition partner, the Pasok party, slumping in opinion polls, falling far behind even Golden Dawn; with left-wing forces poised to do well in May elections for the European Parliament; and with early national elections look increasingly likely, his term in office could easily be cut short, political analysts say.Mr. Tsipras, his possible successor, has backed away from past rhetoric about abandoning the euro and said he does not want Greece to drop out of the 18-country zone that uses the currency. But he does want a fundamental reworking of the terms of Greece\u2019s bailout funds, worth 240 billion euros, or about $328 billion.\u201cOur intention is to change the framework, not smash the euro,\u201d he said, suggesting that Europe should hold a conference on debt akin to that held in London in 1953 that agreed to write off a big chunk of the debts incurred by Germany before and after World War II.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of Greece\u2019s bailout fund in U.S. dollars. It is $328 billion, not million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Pursuing a Modest Agenda in State of Union", "Date": "2014-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 His ambitions in check and his eye on the calendar, President Obama intends to use his State of the Union address to put a difficult year behind him and reassert command before the capital is consumed with election-year politics.After five years in office, Mr. Obama has, by his own account, come to feel acutely the limits on his power and the shrinking horizons before him \u2014 all of which make his nationally televised speech to Congress on Tuesday a critical opportunity to drive an agenda that may yet shape his legacy.But perhaps more so than in any of his previous congressional addresses, Mr. Obama realizes that he has little chance of major legislative victories this year, with the possible exception of an overhaul of immigration law that Republicans are also making a priority. As a result, aides said, he will present a blueprint for \u201ca year of action\u201d on issues like income inequality and the environment that bypasses Congress and exercises his authority to the maximum extent.\u201cThis presidency is not going to be defined from here forward by big legislative initiatives,\u201d said Jeff Shesol, a speechwriter for President Bill Clinton who was consulted by this White House. \u201cGiven that, he\u2019s got to convey a sense of focus and forward momentum. He\u2019s got a lot of time left in this presidency, and I think people will want to get the sense that he knows how to operate in this environment and that there is a strategy.\u201dAfter failing to push through gun control legislation and other priorities he raised in last year\u2019s State of the Union address, Mr. Obama must take a different approach this year, aides and analysts said. \u201cPushing for a series of new initiatives when last year\u2019s initiatives still need to get done is a challenge,\u201d said Neera Tanden, president of the left-leaning Center for American Progress. \u201cAt the same time, he probably shouldn\u2019t be limited to what the House of Representatives could pass, because that would be an incredibly limited vision.\u201dMr. Obama will still use the speech to push for an immigration overhaul, with aides guardedly optimistic that he may reach a compromise with Republicans. He will also call for a higher minimum wage, more infrastructure spending and an expansion of prekindergarten education, issues on which the parties are less likely to agree.White House officials said Mr. Obama would use the speech to announce executive actions he can take without congressional approval to expand economic opportunity for middle-class workers in areas like retirement security and job training. The officials expressed hope that these actions would prod Congress to take further steps.In an email to supporters on Saturday, the president\u2019s senior adviser, Dan Pfeiffer, characterized Mr. Obama\u2019s coming message as \u201copportunity, action and optimism\u201d and promised \u201ca set of real, concrete, practical proposals\u201d to strengthen the economy and expand opportunity.But Mr. Pfeiffer acknowledged the limits. \u201cThe president will seek out as many opportunities as possible to work with Congress in a bipartisan way,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut when American jobs and livelihoods depend on getting something done, he will not wait for Congress.\u201dTo counter Mr. Obama\u2019s increased focus on economic disparities, Republicans are trying to turn the issue around on him, arguing that his own policies on jobs, deficit spending, regulations and health care have exacerbated income inequality.\u201cThe president has a lot of explaining to do,\u201d Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri said on Saturday in a Republican radio and Internet address. \u201cIf all he has to offer is more of the same, or if he refuses to acknowledge that his own policies have failed to work, the president is simply doing what many failed leaders have done before him: trying to set one group of Americans against another group of Americans.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s sense of possibility has contracted. A year after an intoxicating re-election victory, when he had a 57 percent approval rating, his support has fallen to 42 percent. Within months, lawmakers will be absorbed by their own campaigns in the midterm elections, and after that, Washington will begin to turn its focus to the contest to succeed Mr. Obama.Mr. Obama said that while he might not accomplish his goals during his tenure, he hoped to plant seeds. \u201cThe things you start may not come to full fruition on your timetable,\u201d he told Mr. Remnick. \u201cBut you can move things forward. And sometimes the things that start small may turn out to be fairly significant.\u201dThe seemingly diminished expectations expressed in those comments surprised many in Washington, where presidents rarely acknowledge limits. Concerned about the impression Mr. Obama had left, aides warned against overanalyzing his words and said he was reinvigorated after the setbacks of 2013.\u201cHe\u2019s very focused and very excited about all the ways we can move the ball forward if Congress isn\u2019t willing to go along, accepting of the reality that no Congress of the other party tends to green-light the agenda of the president of the opposite party,\u201d Mr. Pfeiffer said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s energized by the creative thinking going into the ways to move forward.\u201dMr. Obama is hardly the first president to recognize the disparity between the perception and the reality of his power. In his last year in office, George W. Bush was asked by an aide what had surprised him about being president. \u201cHow little authority I have,\u201d he answered.But that does not mean a president is without options if Congress is against him. Mr. Obama recently turned to John D. Podesta, Mr. Clinton\u2019s former chief of staff, to test the boundaries of executive authority, using what Mr. Pfeiffer calls the power of his pen and phone.\u201cI\u2019m sure in his speech he won\u2019t bemoan any lack of presidential authority,\u201d said John P. McConnell, a former speechwriter for Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. \u201cIt\u2019ll be the exact opposite.\u201dBefore the holidays, Mr. Obama\u2019s staff asked Mr. Shesol and other veterans of the Clinton and Bush administrations for ideas on governing without support from Congress. On the day he left for vacation in Hawaii last month, Mr. Obama had a long conversation with aides about the State of the Union address, then met with them again after returning.While not minimizing last year\u2019s troubles \u2014 the botched health care law rollout, the fitful handling of Syria, the failure to pass gun control laws \u2014 aides to Mr. Obama argued that they had cleared away the underbrush with the improvement of the federal health care website and with recent bipartisan spending deals.\u201cYou can say: \u2018There\u2019s a little hope, we had a tough year, and there\u2019s an election ahead. We can either yell at each other all year and not accomplish anything, or we can surpass the expectations people have and actually get something done,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Jon Favreau, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s chief speechwriter until last year.Even if Mr. Obama does not persuade lawmakers, he has a chance to frame the national conversation, an effort he will continue with a two-day trip to Maryland, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Tennessee. While interest in the State of the Union address has fallen \u2014 the television ratings last year were the second lowest in 20 years \u2014 it is still an opportunity to reach more than 30 million Americans unfiltered.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Undermine the Iran Deal", "Date": "2014-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 THERE are only two ways to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon: negotiations or military action.Amazingly, after 34 years of mostly diplomatic silence between Iran and the United States, we are in the midst of negotiations with the potential to eliminate the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran.Instead of cautiously welcoming this development and letting these talks play out over the next six months, however, some members of Congress are circulating proposals that seek to impose additional sanctions in the middle of the negotiations. This step, we fear, risks scuttling the process and could have damaging ramifications for the United States as well as our regional allies and partners, especially Israel.The increasingly stringent economic sanctions that have been imposed on Iran over the last three decades have worked. Iran\u2019s new president, Hassan Rouhani, came to office last year promising an improved economy, and he seems to have quickly realized that the only way to deliver on this promise is by achieving relief from the sanctions. And so, with the approval of its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran has finally come to the table \u2014 reluctantly and grudgingly.If the sanctions have worked, so the argument goes, won\u2019t additional sanctions work even better? If we just increase the pressure, won\u2019t we get a more favorable outcome? That logic would make sense only if Iran were a politics-free zone where a consensus existed in support of negotiations to end the country\u2019s nuclear program.But all evidence \u2014 from public statements as well as available intelligence \u2014 suggests that there is no such consensus. In fact, there are hard-line elements within the Iranian government and military who don\u2019t like the idea of negotiations, are not terribly worried about new sanctions (oligarchs always get what they need anyway), and feel that the nuclear program is a matter of national pride and, perhaps, national survival.For us to impose additional sanctions under these circumstances (or threaten to impose additional sanctions) could be an \u201cI told you so\u201d moment for these hard-liners, providing the very excuse they\u2019re looking for to kill the negotiations and, with them, what is probably the best chance we have of resolving this incredibly dangerous situation without resorting to military action.From our vantage point as senators serving on the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, the risk analysis is quite straightforward. The potential upside of legislating further sanctions is the hope that increased pressure might elicit more concessions or push Iran to conclude a more favorable deal. But this is unlikely. The potential downside is more likely and more dangerous: Iran\u2019s decision makers could conclude that the United States government was not negotiating in good faith \u2014 a view that Iranian hard-liners already espouse. This could prompt Iran to walk away from the negotiations or counter with a new set of unrealistic demands while redoubling its efforts to produce nuclear weapons.Instead of slowing Iran\u2019s nuclear program, such legislation could actually accelerate its quest for atomic weapons, leaving a stark choice: Either accept the possibility of a nuclear-armed Iran, or use military force to stop it.Worse still, it could alienate our international partners. The sanctions have been effective largely because of the active participation of many countries, including China and Russia. When the United States alone doesn\u2019t buy Iranian oil, it has little effect on Iran\u2019s economy, but when the European Union stops, and other major oil customers of Iran such as China, Japan, South Korea, India and Turkey significantly reduce their purchases (which they have), Iran is in trouble (which it is).The countries that have joined America in ratcheting up the economic pressure on Iran all support the interim agreement that went into effect on Jan. 20. Legislation to impose additional sanctions by the United States could be interpreted by our partners as undermining the negotiations. This could have the adverse effect of lessening the international community\u2019s economic pressure on Iran, spooking our partners and diminishing their commitment to the cause.Finally, under the terms of the interim agreement, the Iranians have six months to prove they are serious about this process. If they fail this test, the United States will surely act immediately to impose additional sanctions, and our international partners, understanding that we have given a negotiated approach a chance to succeed, are likely to join us.We don\u2019t know whether Iran can be persuaded to peacefully give up its nuclear weapons ambitions \u2014 but it is very much in our interest to give this diplomatic process every chance to succeed.Carl M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Angus S. King Jr., an independent senator from Maine, is a member of the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Philippines and Rebels Agree on Peace Accord to End Insurgency", "Date": "2014-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANILA \u2014 The Philippine government and the country\u2019s largest Muslim insurgency group negotiated the final details of a peace accord on Saturday that many hope will end more than 40 years of violence that has killed tens of thousands of people and helped nurture Islamic extremism in Southeast Asia.The agreement will create an autonomous Muslim-dominated region in the restive south of the predominantly Christian country, handing much of the responsibility for security there to local authorities as well as a large share of revenues from the region\u2019s wealth of natural resources. The militants have agreed to disarm, with many expected to join Philippine security forces.Although many challenges to sustained peace remain \u2014 notably that some militant groups have refused to join the agreement \u2014 the deal with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front is considered a signature achievement for President Benigno S. Aquino III. Mr. Aquino has vowed to end the conflicts on the island of Mindanao that have bedeviled the Philippines for more than a century and that would eventually hinder the nation\u2019s ability to expand its economy and catch up with more prosperous neighbors. \u201cThe agreement represents the culmination of decades of excruciating diplomatic efforts aimed at ending the conflict in Mindanao,\u201d said Richard Javad Heydarian, a political science lecturer at Ateneo de Manila University. \u201cThis provides an unprecedented opportunity to end one of the world\u2019s longest-running intrastate conflicts.\u201dThe groups left out of the agreement are the most violent in the southern Philippines, including the Qaeda-linked Abu Sayyaf, which has carried out kidnappings, bombings and beheadings for more than a decade and says it wants to set up a strict Islamic state.The peace deal is expected to be signed within the next several weeks, but analysts consider that just a formality. They say the true test of the pact will be in its implementation; a peace deal with another militant group in 1996 failed in part because of widespread corruption in the area it was supposed to control. The negotiations were brokered by Malaysia, where the deal was reached, and countries including the United States and those in the European Union are expected to help in the implementation, providing aid and advice on good governance. Those countries want to sap the strength of Islamic insurgencies in the region.On Saturday, Secretary of State John Kerry offered congratulations for \u201cconcluding negotiations toward an historic, comprehensive peace agreement. This agreement offers the promise of peace, security, and economic prosperity now and for future generations in Mindanao.\u201dThe conflict between Muslim insurgent groups on Mindanao and the Christian-dominated government in the north of the country has simmered since the late 1800s. Every government since Philippine independence in 1946 has struggled to resolve the violence, through peace talks and sometimes military action.In recent decades, the conflict has claimed an estimated 120,000 lives and displaced more than two million people. It has also kept the southern Philippines mired in poverty even as the country has undergone an economic renaissance of sorts, becoming one of the fastest growing economies in East Asia, with a growth rate that surpassed China\u2019s in some quarters last year.\u201cIn a world looking for peaceful solutions to all troubles, we are grateful that we have found ours,\u201d Teresita Quintos Deles, a presidential adviser on the peace talks, said Saturday. The Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front have been working on the details of the peace deal since October 2012, when they reached a framework agreement for ending the conflict. Earlier interim agreements dealt with sharing power and resources. Under those deals, the national government will retain authority over national defense, foreign policy and monetary issues, while the newly formed autonomous region, to be called Bangsamoro, is expected to have broad local powers.The two parties also agreed that 75 percent of the tax revenue from metallic minerals mined in the region would stay in Mindanao. In addition, half of the taxes collected from fossil fuels developed in the region would remain with local authorities.Saturday\u2019s agreement dealt with the delicate issue of disarmament. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front agreed to incorporate some of its 11,000 fighters into Philippine government forces and gradually disarm the others with the oversight of a third party yet to be named. After the deal is formally signed, it must be passed by the Philippine congress and approved through plebiscite in the newly formed autonomous areas, but analysts consider passage extremely likely.The success of the agreement may hinge in good part on the ability of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which will now be in charge of internal security in the autonomous area, to curb the violence of other militant groups. To do so, the peace deal envisions Muslim authorities working closely with Philippine security forces. Government negotiators have said that bringing greater prosperity to Mindanao and empowering the largest peaceful Muslim groups in the area will help decrease violence and lawlessness. The United States has about 500 Special Forces troops based in Mindanao to help the Philippine military fight the most violent groups.One analyst expressed skepticism about the chances for a lasting peace.\u201cThe Aquino administration is in a hurry to finish this and claim credit for peace, but this isn\u2019t peace,\u201d said Bobit Avila, a columnist for The Philippine Star newspaper. \u201cIt will not bring peace unless all the armed groups in Mindanao will join in.\u201d\u201cI can visit Muslim countries around the world without fear, but I can\u2019t go to Mindanao or I will be kidnapped,\u201d Mr. Avila said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this agreement will change that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unemployment in Europe Stays High Amid Signs of Recovery", "Date": "2014-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Europe\u2019s labor market remained stagnant in November, but analysts saw reason for hope elsewhere in the economy, including a surge in retail sales.The unemployment rate in the euro zone stood at 12.1 percent, a stubbornly high level that has held since April, Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistics agency, reported on Wednesday.As the sovereign debt crisis seized the region and economic malaise set in, the jobless rose from just under 10 percent in early 2011 to the current record level. The November rate was in line with economists\u2019 expectations.For the full European Union, made up of 28 member states, the jobless rate was unchanged at 10.9 percent. Eurostat estimated that 26.6 million people across Europe were unemployed and seeking work, 19,000 more than in October.More than five years after the implosion of Lehman Brothers in 2008 triggered a global financial collapse, Europe\u2019s economy remains on fragile footing. Lending to businesses is contracting, and investment is weak.There were indications, though, that the labor market might be lagging the broader economy.Taken together, the data show that \u201cthe euro zone economy is growing modestly,\u201d said Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg Bank in London. \u201cThe labor market is stabilizing, and retail sales are rebounding nicely.\u201d That, he said, suggests that \u201cthe decline in domestic demand is over.\u201dOther hopeful signs have emerged in Europe lately.Because bond yields move inversely with prices, lower yields signal that investors are demanding more of the debt. Even hapless Greece has benefited, with yields on its debt falling below 8 percent, the lowest level in more than three years.Still, the outlook for economic growth for the region remains anemic.Richard Barwell, an economist in London with Royal Bank of Scotland, estimated before the jobless data were released that the euro zone\u2019s gross domestic product grew by just 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013. That would be equivalent to a 0.8 percent annualized rate.Mr. Barwell forecasts that the euro zone will manage quarterly growth of about 0.3 percent in the first quarter of the new year.Among the lowest unemployment rates in Europe were Austria\u2019s 4.8 percent and Germany\u2019s 5.2 percent. Greece showed the highest rate, 27.4 percent, though it is several months behind in its reporting.The November unemployment rate in the United States was 7 percent, although it is measured slightly differently.There were 17 euro zone members in the period when the latest jobs data were tabulated. Eurostat will begin including information for the newest member, Latvia, which joined at the start of the year, in the January data.Markets reacted calmly to the latest data, with the Euro Stoxx 50 index of euro zone blue-chip companies little changed.The latest reports arrived on the eve of a policy meeting of the European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council.

{"Headline": "Obama Once Disdained Clinton\u2019s Small Steps and Now Takes His Own", "Date": "2014-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite House MemoNASHVILLE \u2014 In the summer of his first year in power, President Obama made clear that he envisioned a lofty mission. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sent here to do school uniforms,\u201d he told aides one day in the Oval Office. The implication was clear: He did not want to govern like Bill Clinton.But more than four years later, Mr. Obama has a new appreciation for Mr. Clinton\u2019s style of leadership. Much as the last Democratic president adjusted his approach after running into roadblocks in Congress, so is the current president advancing relatively small or incremental ideas in hopes of circumventing opposition and making change one step at a time.Afterward, he flew to Nashville, where he visited McGavock High School to talk about efforts to provide students with more real-world education and skills. On Friday, he plans to host a meeting at the White House with corporate executives to encourage them to hire long-term unemployed workers.\u201cThis approach is about achieving goals, such as helping to drive economic growth and create mobility, through the use of a range of discrete approaches that tap the many forces across society \u2014 public, private, nonprofit and others \u2014 necessary to achieve progress in today\u2019s world,\u201d said Donald A. Baer, one of the advocates of that method as a White House official under Mr. Clinton.It may be of little surprise that Mr. Obama has embraced a more Clintonian approach given the advisers now at his side. One of the central architects of this year\u2019s State of the Union agenda was Gene Sperling, the president\u2019s national economics adviser, who held the same post under Mr. Clinton and was a prolific generator of ideas for both men.But even some Clinton veterans are skeptical that Mr. Obama\u2019s strategy will add up to much. \u201cAt the end of the day, the question is whether President Obama\u2019s agenda responds adequately to his own diagnosis of the problem,\u201d said William A. Galston, another Clinton adviser. \u201cIt is not clear that any of his proposals, or all of them taken together, would do much to change the basic equation for working families.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve seen Washington do some big things over the last several years, from TARP to Obamacare, and they\u2019re hugely negative politically,\u201d said former Representative Vin Weber, a Republican from Minnesota. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s understandable that small ball is again the preferred game.\u201dBut Democrats are no longer in charge of Congress as they were then, and while\u00a0Mr. Obama said he has not given up on sweeping legislation, particularly on immigration, Republican opposition has left him little choice but to pivot. \u201cIn divided government, you need to rely more on the substantial power of the presidency to make progress,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, his senior adviser.Mr. Obama is aided not just by Mr. Sperling but a coterie of Clintonites. On Air Force One helping to sell Mr. Obama\u2019s plans\u00a0on Wednesday was Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, who was budget director for Mr. Clinton. Organizing the message\u00a0is Jennifer Palmieri, the White House communications director who was a deputy press secretary to Mr. Clinton.Steve Ricchetti, Sylvia Mathews Burwell and, as of last month, John D. Podesta are other Clinton veterans who have joined Mr. Obama\u2019s staff.The White House\u00a0also brought in former members of Mr. Clinton\u2019s team, including Michael Waldman, Jeff Shesol and Sarah Rosen Wartell, in December to discuss the State of the Unionaddress.Al From, the founder of the Democratic Leadership Council, was also invited, and said Mr. Clinton should get credit for pushing his party to the center on trade, welfare and deficits.\u00a0\u201cThose ideas changed the Democratic Party, the country and saved the Democrats and progressive politics from going the way of the Whigs,\u201d he said. \u201cHardly small-bore.\u201dRepublicans argued that the proposals unveiled by Mr. Obama did not share some of the ideological virtues of Mr. Clinton\u2019s. \u201cThey were similar in that they were small ball,\u201d said John Feehery, a G.O.P. strategist and former top House aide during the Clinton years. \u201cBut I think Clinton\u2019s resonated better because his proposals were purely economic. They were values laden in a way that helped position Clinton as a centrist.\u201dAdvertisement"}

With a gauge of new orders hitting a three-and-a-half-year high and inventories declining, manufacturing activity seemed set to accelerate early in the year.A Labor Department report showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 2,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 339,000. It was the second straight week of declines.Though jobless claims continue to be plagued by seasonal volatility, economists said last week\u2019s decline was in line with other indicators showing an acceleration in job growth.A Commerce Department report showed that construction spending increased 1 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $934.4 billion, its highest level since March 2009. This was the eighth straight month that such spending increased, reflecting solid gains in private construction outlays.Residential construction rose 1.9 percent in November, and commercial construction climbed 2.7 percent.

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Puzzle: Economy Rarely Better, Approval Rarely Worse", "Date": "2014-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama will pronounce on the state of the union for the fifth time on Tuesday, and never during his time in office has the state of the economy been better \u2014 yet rarely has he gotten such low marks from the public for his handling of it.Not only have economic indicators shown progress toward pre-recession health, but many forecasters are predicting what one called \u201ca breakout year\u201d for growth. A new study from a Federal Reserve economist even put a more benign spin on a negative trend, the shrinking labor force, by attributing the decline not to discouraged unemployed workers who have quit looking for jobs, but to the first baby-boomer retirements.Demand for labor is up and the unemployment rate is below 7 percent for the first time since November 2008. Consumers, buoyed by rising home prices and stock values, are spending more; so are businesses. Exports are growing as Europe regains health. The fiscal drag from state and federal spending cuts has abated. And contrary to Republicans\u2019 claims, many forecasters do not see the health care law as \u201ca job-killer.\u201d Economically speaking, said Scott A. Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West, \u201cthe state of the union is the best we have seen in years.\u201dMr. Obama and his speechwriter could not phrase it better, or simpler. Yet taking credit is complicated, given the clear evidence in national polls that most Americans are not in a mood to give him any. Mr. Obama\u2019s ratings for his handling of the economy, never high since his first months in office, slipped throughout 2013 in national polls. As he began this year, nearly six in 10 Americans disapproved, nearly matching his lowest marks in 2011, a year of repeated and damaging fiscal fights with the new Republican House majority. Advisers said the decline was a reflection of Mr. Obama\u2019s diminished standing more broadly after months of public attention to issues that have dominated news coverage: the administration\u2019s bungled introduction of the website for the insurance marketplaces created by his signature Affordable Care Act, and the controversy over intelligence gathering by the National Security Agency.\u201cFor the average person sitting at home watching news on TV and the Internet, they have seen their president spend the last six months or so dealing with N.S.A., a government shutdown and a malfunctioning website,\u201d said Mr. Obama\u2019s chief strategist, Dan Pfeiffer. Another problem, Democrats say, is that despite the overall economic comeback, many Americans have not seen much improvement for themselves or their family members. \u201cThere is an underlying reality that most Americans feel they are not benefiting from the recovery and still feel hard pressed in terms of their ability to keep up with the cost of living, save for their future or find a better job,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a pollster and strategist who advises Democratic senators. There is, he added, \u201ca strong feeling in the country that the economic deck is badly stacked in favor of those at the top, at the expense of average person. People don\u2019t necessarily blame President Obama for that, but their frustration certainly affects their feelings about his handling of the economy.\u201dOne of the president\u2019s biggest challenges this year is to change that. Voters\u2019 perception of Mr. Obama\u2019s stewardship will form the backdrop for congressional elections in November that could cost Democrats their Senate majority and leave Mr. Obama with a Republican-controlled Congress for the remainder of his term.Though presidents are not on the ballot, midterm elections are traditionally a referendum on their performance, often to the detriment of their party. And while Republicans\u2019 own poll ratings are more dismal than either Mr. Obama\u2019s or his party\u2019s, Democrats are running scared.Despite Republicans\u2019 generally worse image problems, the same nonpartisan polls show that on the question of which party is better able to deal with the economy, Republicans have recouped the public favor that they lost in the Bush years. The frustration for Democrats is that many economists and business forecasters fault Republicans in Congress for retarding the recovery since 2010 by forcing Democrats to accept deep spending cuts, by opposing spending for job-creating infrastructure projects that Mr. Obama has proposed and, especially, by threatening a default with the party\u2019s resistance to increasing the nation\u2019s statutory borrowing limit.\u201cI regard the spending cuts of the last several years as just mad,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cIt delayed what would otherwise have been a quicker recovery.\u201d The shift away from austerity, as reflected in Republicans\u2019 agreement last month to a budget deal that undid some of the across-the-board spending reductions known as sequestration, \u201cis going to be hugely helpful,\u201d he said.Other forecasters were also encouraged by that bipartisan budget deal. In recent analyses for business clients, a number of forecasters concluded that Republican leaders had reasserted control over Tea Party members since the federal government shutdown last fall, which was politically disastrous for the party.But a test looms next month, when Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew has said that Congress must raise the debt limit again. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get another political crisis this year, the way is clear for the small-business sector to recover properly,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said. \u201cIf that happens, everything changes. The small businesses have spent the last five years not spending any money. Their equipment is old, it\u2019s aging and it needs to be replaced.\u201d He said such capital spending would in turn \u201cgenerate high-paying, quality jobs \u2014 not the sort of low-paying service-sector jobs we\u2019ve been seeing \u2014 and that feeds back into stronger consumer spending, sustainable spending.\u201dAs Mr. Obama is certain to point out in his address, lest he be seen as clueless, the economic news is not uniformly good. Real wage growth has been stagnant or declining for many Americans, exacerbating a decades-long trend of worsening income inequality between the rich and everyone else, and threatening future growth. The number of long-term unemployed is also greater than in past economic downturns.Even so, Mr. Anderson of Bank of the West said: \u201cFor the first time in this economic expansion, the economy appears to be firing on all cylinders. We are forecasting the strongest year for U.S. G.D.P. growth since 2005. It has the potential to be a breakout year. The key is the U.S. consumer, who finally appears more willing and able to spend.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Appears Set to Force Times Reporter to Leave", "Date": "2014-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Despite objections raised by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in meetings with its top leaders, China appears set to force a correspondent for The New York Times to leave the country this week. It is also continuing to block a number of other journalists working for The Times and for Bloomberg News from taking up assignments in Beijing.The correspondent, Austin Ramzy, 39, has been based in China for more than six years. He was granted a monthlong visa to remain in China at the end of December, but the government has indicated that he will be required to leave when that visa expires on Thursday.At a regular news briefing on Monday, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Qin Gang, said the government was processing Mr. Ramzy\u2019s application for accreditation \u201caccording to laws and regulations,\u201d but would not complete its work before his temporary visa expired. The Times filed a visa application for Mr. Ramzy last June.Mr. Qin added that Mr. Ramzy had violated Chinese regulations last year by continuing to travel to and from the country using the journalist visa he was issued before he left his previous employer, Time magazine.But Chinese officials never canceled Mr. Ramzy\u2019s previous visa and never raised the issue with The Times until The Times asked in December about progress on approval of a new visa as the previous one was nearing expiration.Mr. Qin said the authorities gave Mr. Ramzy a temporary visa in December \u201cin a humanitarian spirit.\u201d\u201cThere is completely no such thing as Austin Ramzy being expelled or forced to leave China, as reported by some media,\u201d Mr. Qin said.Asked about the indefinite delays in issuing residency visas for Mr. Buckley and Mr. Pan, he replied, \u201cThe issuance of visas and residency permits is a matter that only China as a sovereign nation can determine.\u201dDanielle Rhoades Ha, a Times spokeswoman, said Monday: \u201cWe have been in regular contact with the Foreign Ministry since last summer about having Austin Ramzy transfer his accreditation from Time magazine to The New York Times. We have been seeking to adhere carefully to Chinese regulations on the transfer. We hope the authorities will work to resolve the matter without Austin being forced to relocate. It has been more than a year since another of our correspondents, Chris Buckley, was forced to leave Beijing while seeking to transfer his accreditation, and we are still working with the authorities to reunite him with his family.\u201dOn his visit to China last month, Mr. Biden publicly and privately pressed senior Chinese leaders to resolve the impasse.At the time of Mr. Biden\u2019s visit, more than 30 journalists working for The Times or for Bloomberg in mainland China faced expulsion because the authorities had stopped processing their applications to renew their official credentials and residency visas for the new calendar year. Soon after Mr. Biden\u2019s intervention, Beijing began processing the applications again, with Chinese diplomats insisting that the delay had been routine.Even so, the government has not acted on applications for Bloomberg journalists who are not yet working in China and are meant to replace at least five employees who have left the company\u2019s Beijing bureau. A representative of Bloomberg News declined to comment.Nor has China given any sign that it will issue a journalist visa for Mr. Buckley or Mr. Pan, whose application was submitted nearly two years ago.Mr. Pan was a bureau chief in Beijing and Moscow for The Washington Post before joining The Times. Mr. Buckley had lived in Beijing for 15 years, and his reporting career in China has included work for The Times as a researcher and for The International Herald Tribune and Reuters as a correspondent.The Chinese government can process new resident journalist visa applications expeditiously, and it has approved many applications from other foreign news organizations while those from The Times and Bloomberg News have languished.Peter Ford, president of the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of China, expressed concern the government was using visas to influence coverage. \u201cThe lack of an official explanation invariably feeds suspicions that the government is punishing The New York Times for the content of its coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cThis falls short of international standards and is deplorable.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the timing of The Times\u2019 report on the wealth accumulated by Wen Jiabao\u2019s relatives.

{"Headline": "Patients\u2019 Costs Skyrocket; Specialists\u2019 Incomes Soar", "Date": "2014-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPaying Till It HurtsCONWAY, Ark. \u2014 Kim Little had not thought much about the tiny white spot on the side of her cheek until a physician\u2019s assistant at her dermatologist\u2019s office warned that it might be cancerous. He took a biopsy, returning 15 minutes later to confirm the diagnosis and schedule her for an outpatient procedure at the Arkansas Skin Cancer Center in Little Rock, 30 miles away.That was the prelude to a daylong medical odyssey several weeks later, through different private offices on the manicured campus at the Baptist Health Medical Center that involved a dermatologist, an anesthesiologist and an ophthalmologist who practices plastic surgery. It generated bills of more than $25,000.\u201cI felt like I was a hostage,\u201d said Ms. Little, a professor of history at the University of Central Arkansas, who had been told beforehand that she would need just a couple of stitches. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any clue how much they were going to bill. I had no idea it would be so much.\u201dMs. Little\u2019s seemingly minor medical problem \u2014 she had the least dangerous form of skin cancer \u2014 racked up big bills because it involved three doctors from specialties that are among the highest compensated in medicine, and it was done on the grounds of a hospital. Many specialists have become particularly adept at the business of medicine by becoming more entrepreneurial, protecting their turf through aggressive lobbying by their medical societies, and most of all, increasing revenues by offering new procedures \u2014 or doing more of lucrative ones.It does not matter if the procedure is big or small, learned in a decade of training or a weeklong course. In fact, minor procedures typically offer the best return on investment: A cardiac surgeon can perform only a couple of bypass operations a day, but other specialists can perform a dozen procedures in that time span.That math explains why the incomes of dermatologists, gastroenterologists and oncologists rose 50 percent or more between 1995 and 2012, even when adjusted for inflation, while those for primary care physicians rose only 10 percent and lag far behind, since insurers pay far less for traditional doctoring tasks like listening for a heart murmur or prescribing the right antibiotic.In addition, salary figures often understate physician earning power since they often do not include revenue from business activities: fees for blood or pathology tests at a lab that the doctor owns or \u201cfacility\u201d charges at an ambulatory surgery center where the physician is an investor, for example.Specialists earn an average of two and often four times as much as primary care physicians in the United States, a differential that far surpasses that in all other developed countries, according to Miriam Laugesen, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health. That earnings gap has deleterious effects: Only an estimated 25 percent of new physicians end up in primary care, at the very time that health policy experts say front-line doctors are badly needed, according to Dr. Christine Sinsky, an Iowa internist who studies physician satisfaction. In fact, many pediatricians and general doctors in private practice say they are struggling to survive.Studies show that more specialists mean more tests and more expensive care. \u201cIt may be better to wait and see, but waiting doesn\u2019t make you money,\u201d said Jean Mitchell, a professor of health economics at Georgetown University. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Let me do a little snip of tissue\u2019 and then they get professional, lab and facility fees. Each patient is like an ATM machine.\u201dUse of the surgery has skyrocketed in the United States \u2014 over 400 percent in a little over a decade \u2014 to the point that last summer Medicare put it at the top of its \u201cpotentially misvalued\u201d list of overused or overpriced procedures. Even the American Academy of Dermatology agrees that the surgery is sometimes used inappropriately. Dr. Brett Coldiron, president-elect of the academy, defended skin doctors as \u201cvery cost-efficient\u201d specialists who deal in thousands of diagnoses and called Mohs \u201ca wonderful tool.\u201d He said that his specialty was being unfairly targeted by insurers because of general frustration with medical prices. \u201cHealth care reform is a subsidized buffet and if it\u2019s too expensive, you go to the kitchen and shoot one of the cooks,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they\u2019re shooting dermatologists.\u201dThe specialists point to an epidemic, noting there are two million to four million skin cancers diagnosed in the United States each year, with a huge increase in basal cell carcinomas, the type Ms. Little had, which usually do not metastasize. (A small fraction of the cancers are melanomas, a far more serious condition.) But, said Dr. Cary Gross, a cancer epidemiologist at Yale University Medical School, \u201cThe real question is: Is there a true epidemic or is there an epidemic of biopsies and treatments that are not needed? I think the answer is both.\u201dPatient Given No ChoiceA fair-skinned redhead who teaches history at the University of Central Arkansas, Ms. Little had gone to a private dermatology practice in Heber Springs, Ark., to check some moles on her arms when the physician\u2019s assistant on duty noticed a whitish bump \u2014 like a \u201ctiny fragment of thread\u201d \u2014 on her face, she said. Her family practitioner had told her it was just a clogged pore.After the 30-minute removal, the dermatologist told her that she would have to go across the street to the Arkansas Center for Oculoplastic Surgery, another private doctors\u2019 office on the hospital\u2019s campus, to have the wound closed by a plastic surgeon with \u201ca couple of stitches.\u201dWhen Ms. Little protested that she did not want a plastic surgeon and did not care about having a tiny scar, the doctor told her she had no choice, she said. The vast majority of Mohs procedures are sewed up by the dermatologist or just bandaged and left to heal. Yet when Ms. Little arrived at the second practice, nurses took her clothes, put in an IV, and introduced her to an anesthesiologist who would sedate her in an operating room.Sitting in her cozy office recently, Ms. Little, who has a faint scar under her eye on her right cheek, still fumes at the thought. \u201cIt was no bigger than many cuts that heal on their own, and it definitely could have been repaired by one doctor, but at that point what was I going to do?\u201d she recalled. \u201cI have an IV in my arm and a hole in my face that Dr. Breau refused to stitch. And the anesthesiologist is standing there with his mask on.\u201dHer bills included $1,833 for the Mohs surgery, $14,407 for the plastic surgeon, $1,000 for the anesthesiologist, and $8,774 for the hospital charges.Mohs surgery is preferable when the removal of a skin cancer is complicated or in a sensitive area, because it typically excises less tissue and leaves less of a scar than other treatments and allows dermatologists to see the borders of a growth and be confident that it is removed entirely. The surgery is generally not used for melanomas, which require more extensive cutting.In an email, Dr. Breau declined to discuss Ms. Little\u2019s case, but noted, \u201cWhen I make decisions concerning patient care, I have only the patient\u2019s best interests in mind.\u201d He said that he and one partner own the Arkansas Skin Cancer and Dermatology Center and receive no payments from the hospital or the doctors to whom they refer patients. In most cases, he said, he takes care of the wound left by Mohs surgery himself. The plastic surgeon did not respond to requests for comment.It is often impossible in any one case to determine whether a course of treatment was necessary or cost-effective. Even among doctors there are differences of opinion about optimal treatments. That is partly because the guidelines for when to perform many procedures are often ill-defined or based on the specialists\u2019 experience rather than carefully controlled research.\u201cThough Mohs surgery is disseminating rapidly, there are very few comparative studies and the evidence is still evolving about when it\u2019s beneficial,\u201d said Dr. Gross, the Yale epidemiologist. \u201cWhen people are trained to perform a procedure, and believe in it, and equip their offices to do it, they will do it. That\u2019s just human nature.\u201dPhysicians often complain that government and commercial insurance reimbursements for seeing patients are decreasing while their office expenses are going up to deal with mountains of paperwork and demands from insurers. Congress currently is considering a bill that would freeze doctors\u2019 Medicare fees for the next decade. Still, many doctors have found alternative income streams that do not show up on surveys.Dr. Mitchell of Georgetown University estimates, for example, that many urologists make 50 percent of their income from dealing with patients and the rest from investing in the machines that deliver radiation for prostate cancer or to treat kidney stones. In 2012, urologists had an average income of $416,322, according to Medical Group Management Association data, which often does not include the investment income.Oncologists benefit from the ability to mark up (and profit from) each dose of chemotherapy they administer in private offices, a practice increased dramatically in the late 1990s. The median compensation for oncologists nearly doubled from 1995 to 2004, to $350,000, according to the M.G.M.A. One study last year attributed 65 percent of the revenue in a typical oncology practice to such payments.In a country where top hospital executives typically make more than a million dollars a year, American physicians may feel entitled to high fees, especially because they face costs that their European counterparts do not: Medical school is expensive and new doctors graduate with an average of about $150,000 in debt. Likewise, some specialists face malpractice premiums of over $100,000 a year.Though medical societies tend to point to the long haul of medical training and the unpredictable hours to justify generous salaries, health economists point out there is often little correlation between compensation and that investment of time. Obstetricians, for example, arguably have the most rigorous schedules but are relatively modest earners. A number of high-income specialties \u2014 radiology, ophthalmology, anesthesiology and dermatology \u2014 are often called the \u201clifestyle specialties,\u201d because training is more compatible with a home life than some other disciplines and there are fewer emergencies in these fields. Eighty percent of dermatologists see patients 40 hours or fewer each week, according to a 2013 Medscape report, less than the average doctor.Profitable DermatologyIn America\u2019s for-profit, fee-for-service medical system, dermatology has proved especially profitable because it offers doctors diverse revenue streams \u2014 from cosmetic treatments that are fully paid by the patient to medical treatments that are covered by insurance.Cosmetic dermatology is a big moneymaker in high-income markets like New York and Miami. Botox injections take 15 minutes and cost a minimum of $500; doctors pay about $100 for the amount of medicine needed for a typical session, according to dermatologists. Still, cosmetic work makes up less than 10 percent of all skin procedures, studies show, and their volume tends to fluctuate with the economy.For medical treatment, many dermatologists have been able to compensate for cutbacks in insurance payments by offering new services and by increasing their patient volume through hiring \u201cphysician extenders\u201d \u2014 nurse practitioners and physicians\u2019 assistants \u2014 to do basic tasks like biopsies and chemical peels. Whether the physician or the nurse wields the scalpel, the charge is generally the same.The dermatology office where Ms. Little\u2019s initial biopsy was performed is one of six satellite offices operated by the Arkansas Skin Cancer and Dermatology Center. They are often staffed by physician assistants, who refer patients to the dermatologists in Little Rock for Mohs surgery. The dermatologists also do their own pathology, meaning that they can sometimes bill extra for that service. (That also means there is no independent confirmation of a cancer diagnosis.)With such practices, even minor dermatology procedures can lead to big bills. When Ashley Lanning, 28, of Oregon was seen by a nurse practitioner for a mole removal, the tab came to $915.46 \u2014 \u201cway more than I\u2019d anticipated,\u201d she said. The growth was scraped off with a scalpel and no stitches were required. In New York last year, Kyle Snow Schwartz, 26, went to a dermatologist at New York University Medical Center to have a wart removed from his foot. The visit took five minutes, including a chat about his plans to teach English in Vietnam and a squirt of liquid nitrogen on the growth. The invoice from the billing office: $500.Both patients have insurance with high deductibles, so they faced large out-of-pocket payments.In contrast, in Germany where private doctors\u2019 allowable charges are set by the government, dermatologists are paid $30 for a whole body skin check, $40 for a standard biopsy and $20 for a pathology exam, said Dr. Matthias Augustin, who studies the practice of dermatology at the University Medical Center of Hamburg-Eppendorf. There is far less use of Mohs surgery in Germany than in the United States, he said. Most patients with a possible skin cancer get a biopsy and come back a few days later for full removal if it is positive.Dr. Coldiron acknowledged that Mohs was not appropriate for \u201cevery little bitty thing.\u201d Indeed, to stem the use of Mohs surgery where cheaper procedures would suffice, the American Academy of Dermatology in 2012 issued \u201cappropriateness\u201d guidelines about what kinds of cancers should be treated with the technique \u2014 such as those on the eyelids or nose, or those that were large or deep.The Medical LobbyMedicare\u2019s valuation of physicians\u2019 services is based on a complex algorithm that is intended to take into account the time and skill required to perform a medical task, with an adjustment made for a specialty\u2019s malpractice rates. Many insurers follow Medicare\u2019s lead, often paying anywhere from 80 percent to 200 percent of the Medicare fee. But \u201ctime and skill\u201d are easier to quantify for procedures than continuing patient management. And, experts say, Medicare has not reduced payments for many procedures that now take far less time than when they were invented, because of improvements in efficiency or technology.But renegotiating payments involves a highly contentious process that plays out behind closed doors at the American Medical Association\u2019s Relative Value Scale Update Committee, which consists of doctors representing 26 medical disciplines who advise Medicare. In dermatology trade journals, Dr. Coldiron, who has served on the committee, describes it like this: \u201cEverybody sits around a table and tries to strip money away from another specialty.\u201d It\u2019s like \u201c26 sharks in a tank with nothing to eat but each other.\u201dPrimary care doctors \u2014 who make up only 12 percent of physicians in practice \u2014 say they have little clout, with at most five representatives on the panel. \u201cThat committee keeps the perverse incentives in place,\u201d said Brian Crownover, a family physician from Boise, Idaho.Indeed, less than two years ago, Dr. Coldiron predicted that reimbursement for Mohs surgery could drop 20 percent. But that did not happen. When Medicare placed Mohs on its list of potentially misvalued procedures last summer, it was deluged with protests from dermatologists, and the A.M.A. Update Committee declared Mohs surgery worthwhile.This year, Medicare reimbursement will drop only about 2 percent to about $1,000 for a typical procedure. (In recent years, the American Academy of Dermatology Association \u2014 the dermatology academy\u2019s political action committee \u2014 has also fought proposed Medicare requirements that dermatologists provide preoperative pictures of lesions they had treated with Mohs surgery, and it has pushed states to classify Botox injections as well as skin procedures using lasers as \u201cthe practice of medicine,\u201d to prevent spas from offering such services.)Critics say the robust revenues from doing procedures has led to overuse \u2014 colonoscopies by gastroenterologists, steroid injections by pain specialists and M.R.I. scans by orthopedists, to name a few. Dr. Thomas Balestreri, a recently retired anesthesiologist from Washington State, said in an interview that to increase revenue, some fellow specialists used an ultrasound to guide placement of a nerve block when it was not really needed.But in some cases dollars from procedures keep practices afloat, because insurers pay so little for time with patients. Dr. Stephen Asher, a neurologist in Boise, Idaho, said his 50 to 60 hours a week seeing patients accounts for only about 10 percent of his income. To cover office expenses he relies on revenue from performing a few procedures \u2014 Botox injections for eye movement disorders and muscle conduction studies \u2014 as well as from an M.R.I. scanner that he co-owns with a group of orthopedists and neurologists.Outrage at ChargesMs. Little left Baptist Health Medical Center with a tiny skin flap and more than two dozen stitches. For five days she said she was \u201chung over\u201d from the IV sedation that she had not wanted \u2014 a problem because she drives 60 miles on rural Arkansas roads to her university each day.She spent months arguing down her bills, which were finally reduced: About $1,400 for the Mohs surgeon, $765 for the anesthesiologist, $1,375 for the ophthalmological plastic surgeon, plus $1,050 in operating-room charges from the hospital.For her follow-up, she refused to return to Baptist Health and went instead to the University of Arkansas Medical Center, where a dermatologist told her she likely had not needed such an extensive procedure. But that was hard to judge, since the records forwarded from Baptist did not include the photo that was taken of the initial lesion.And she was outraged as she wrote checks for the nearly $3,000 she owed to the doctors under the terms of her insurance. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Take out your purse, we\u2019re robbing you,\u2019 \u201d she said.PAYING TILL IT HURTS: Articles in this series are examining the\nhigh costs of common medical encounters\nand how they contribute to health\ncare spending in the United States.Paying Till It HurtsArticles in this series are examining the high costs of common medical encounters and how they contribute to health care spending in the United States.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Opportunity Coalition", "Date": "2014-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Obama can spend the remainder of his term planting a few more high-tech hubs, working on reforming the patent law and doing the other modest things he mentioned in his State of the Union address. And if he did that, he might do some marginal good, and he would manage the stately decline of his presidency during its final few years.Or, alternately, he can realize that he is now at a moment of liberation. For the past five years he has been inhibited by the need to please donors, to cater to various Congressional constituencies and to play by Washington rules.But the legislating phase of his presidency is now pretty much over. Over the next few years he will be free to think beyond legislation, beyond fund-raising, beyond the necessities of the day-to-day partisanship. He will have the platform and power of the presidency, but, especially after the midterms, fewer short-term political obligations.This means he will have the opportunity to build what he himself could have used over the past few years: An Opportunity Coalition. He\u2019ll have the chance to organize bipartisan groups of mayors, business leaders, legislators, activists and donors into permanent alliances and institutions that will formulate, lobby for, fund and promote opportunity and social mobility agendas for decades to come. There are already signs that President Obama is stepping back to take the long view. In his interviews with David Remnick of The New Yorker, he observed that the president is \u201cessentially a relay swimmer in a river full of rapids.\u201d You are trying to do your leg and pass things along to the next swimmer. As president, he\u2019s been made aware of how little a president can accomplish unless there is organized support from the outside. Obama now has the chance to build that support for future presidents, on the issues that concern him most. He might start, for example, by scrambling the current political categories. We now have one liberal tradition that believes in using government to enhance equality. We have another conservative tradition that believes in limiting government to enhance freedom. These two traditions have fought to a standstill and prevented Obama from passing much domestic legislation of late.But there is a third ancient tradition that weaves through American history, geared directly at enhancing opportunity and social mobility. This is the Whig tradition, which begins with people like Henry Clay, Daniel Webster and Abraham Lincoln. This tradition believes in using the power of government to give marginalized Americans the tools to compete in a capitalist economy. The Whigs fought against the divisive populist Jacksonians. They argued that it is better to help people move between classes than to pit classes against each other. They also transcended our current political divisions.The Whigs were interventionist in economics while they were traditionalist and family-oriented in their moral and social attitudes. They believed America should step boldly into the industrial age, even as they championed cultural order. The Whigs championed large infrastructure projects and significant public investments, even as they believed in sacred property rights. They believed in expanding immigration along with assimilation and cohesion.President Obama could travel the country modernizing the Whig impulse, questioning current divisions and eroding the rigid battle lines. More concretely, he could create a group of Simpson-Bowles-type commissions \u2014 with legislators, mayors, governors and others brought together to offer concrete proposals on mobility issues from the beginning to the end of the life span:Is there a way to improve family patterns so disadvantaged young children grow up in more ordered environments? Is there a way to improve Head Start and intelligently expand early childhood education? Is there a way to structure neighborhoods so that teenagers are more likely to thrive? Is there a way to get young men wage subsidies so they are worth marrying? Is there a way to train or provide jobs for unemployed middle-aged workers?These commissions could issue their reports in the spring of 2016, to make life maximally difficult for the next presidential candidates.President Obama could also credential a different style of public sector leader. If you are trying to pass legislation, you staff your administration with political operatives. But if you are trying to change the discussion and mobilize the country, you hire and promote social entrepreneurs, people from Ashoka, Teach for America, Opportunity International, the International Justice Mission and the Clinton Global Initiative. Once hired in this White House, these people will be filling senior government jobs for decades to come. President Obama began his career as an organizer. His mobility agenda floundered because the governing majority he needed to push it forward does not exist. He has the chance to remedy that, to organize, to convene, to build, and to make life a lot easier for the next swimmer in the race. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rebels in Syria Claim Control of Resources", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Islamist rebels and extremist groups have seized control of most of Syria\u2019s oil and gas resources, a rare generator of cash in the country\u2019s war-battered economy, and are now using the proceeds to underwrite their fights against one another as well as President Bashar al-Assad, American officials say.Although there is no clear evidence of direct tactical coordination between the group and Mr. Assad, American officials say that his government has facilitated the group\u2019s rise not only by purchasing its oil but by exempting some of its headquarters from the airstrikes that have tormented other rebel groups.The Nusra Front and other groups are providing fuel to the government, too, in exchange for electricity and relief from airstrikes, according to opposition activists in Syria\u2019s oil regions.The scramble for Syria\u2019s oil is described by analysts as a war within the broader civil war, one that is turning what was once an essential source of income for Syria into a driving force in a conflict that is tearing the country apart. \u201cSyria is an oil country and has resources, but in the past they were all stolen by the regime,\u201d said Abu Nizar, an antigovernment activist in Deir al-Zour. \u201cNow they are being stolen by those who are profiting from the revolution.\u201dHe described the situation in his oil-rich province as \u201coverwhelming chaos.\u201dThe Western-backed rebel groups do not appear to be involved in the oil trade, in large part because they have not taken over any oil fields. Syria was once an important supplier of oil to Europe, and attracted international oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell and Suncor to develop its fields. Declining even before the anti-Assad uprising began, the oil industry has taken a beating since, with production down to no more than 80,000 barrels a day at the end of 2013 from about 400,000 barrels a day in 2011. Violence has damaged pipelines and other infrastructure, aggravating energy shortages and leaving the country heavily dependent on imports from its allies. As the war has progressed, rebel groups have seized control of the oil and gas fields scattered across the country\u2019s north and east, while Kurdish militias have taken over areas near the border with Iraqi Kurdistan.Filling the void left by the government\u2019s withdrawal is a Wild West-like patchwork of local efforts to try to wring any possible profit from the remnants of the oil industry. In some areas, locals have used primitive methods to extract usable products from crude they drain from pipelines or storage tanks, often causing environmental and health problems in their communities.Elaborate trade networks have also evolved, with oil being smuggled across borders in plastic jugs and transported by trucks and on donkeys into Iraq and Turkey.\u201cThe government practically doesn\u2019t control anything anymore,\u201d said Dragan Vuckovic, president of Mediterranean International, an oil service company that operates across the Middle East and North Africa. \u201cThe oil is controlled by crooks and extremists. They sell it for a bargain wherever they can find a buyer.\u201dOil has proved to be a boon for the extremists of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, who have seized control of most of the oil-rich northern province of Raqqa. The group typically sells crude to middlemen who resell it to the government but sometimes sells it directly to the government, said Omar Abu Laila, a spokesman for the rebels\u2019 Supreme Military Council.\u201cSelling the oil brings in more cash, so why not sell it to the regime, which offers higher prices?\u201d he asked.An American official said the United States had received multiple credible reports that the Syrian government had purchased crude from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria that was delivered in tanker trucks from areas the group controls to behind Syrian government lines. The official also said Mr. Assad\u2019s government had refrained from bombing the group\u2019s headquarters in Raqqa and elsewhere, although their locations are well known and clearly marked with black flags and banners.A second American official said that while Mr. Assad\u2019s government is growing ever more desperate for oil, the group is becoming increasingly independent of wealthy donors in the Persian Gulf and other funding sources. As the group has gained control of more territory, it has been able to sustain its operations through a combination of oil revenues, border tolls, extortion and granary sales, the official said. While other American officials discounted the possibility of tactical military cooperation between the group and Mr. Assad\u2019s government, they said that Syrian intelligence had almost certainly infiltrated opposition groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and the Nusra Front, to track their activities.\u201cThe Syrian regime is as Machiavellian as they come, and there is little it won\u2019t do to hold on to power,\u201d said an American counterterrorism official. \u201cIf the regime could strike a tactical accord with an enemy faction to achieve its larger strategic goals, it probably would.\u201dDenied access to Syria\u2019s oil regions, Mr. Assad\u2019s government has become increasingly dependent on its foreign allies and imports most of its fuel from Iran and Iraq, while Hezbollah smuggles diesel and gasoline over the border from Lebanon, according to regional oil experts. The opposition also accuses Syria\u2019s Kurds of providing the government with oil.While rebel oil revenues are small by world market standards, they can help groups exercise local power as well as finance their operations. \u201cEven sold at discounted prices, this oil could be generating significant revenue for rebels to arm themselves,\u201d said Badr H. Jafar, chairman of Crescent Petroleum, a regional oil and gas company based in the United Arab Emirates.The politics of the local oil trade can be complex, insiders say. When the Nusra Front and other rebel groups took over a natural gas facility in the northern province of Hasaka, they sought to cut the supply to a government facility, said Amer Abdy, a local activist.But local tribal leaders objected, saying that would simply invite government airstrikes to destroy the plant. So they brokered a deal to keep a limited amount of gas flowing so the area would not be bombed, Mr. Abdy said.When the government first withdrew from the oil fields of Deir al-Zour Province in the country\u2019s east, said Abu Nizar, an activist there, rebel brigades and local tribes took control of wells and sold or tried to refine whatever oil they could extract to buy arms. Recently, however, most of the area\u2019s rebel brigades have left the administration of the wells to an Islamic legal commission set up to run local affairs, he said.One facility the group controls is a natural gas plant that feeds a major power station near Homs that is still controlled by the government.\u201cWe can\u2019t cut off the gas because it would lead to a power cut in a large part of Syria,\u201d Abu Nizar said, adding that he hoped the new commission would effectively manage the area\u2019s resources.\u201cLet\u2019s be honest. Some of the wells were used to arm the rebels and to fund aid operations,\u201d he said, \u201cbut unfortunately the majority were robbed and exploited by thieves.\u201d Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut, Eric Schmitt from Washington, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.

{"Headline": "Torn Between Higher Taxes and Border Hassles", "Date": "2014-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneThe shopping trip required Ms. Alcantar, 71, to travel by bus first and then on foot. Despite any potential savings, she said, gaining entry into Texas could be enough of a deterrent for her to spend her money in Mexico, where she would be forced to make do with less.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d she said, shielding her weathered face from the wind as she crossed back into Mexico. \u201cAnd the lines \u2014 the lines are exhausting. They should let us older people pass first. The problem isn\u2019t going back; the problem is getting here.\u201dAs part of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s economic reforms in Mexico, the federal value-added tax in regions within about 12.5 miles of the border was raised this year to 16 percent from 11 percent, matching the rest of the country. As a result, economists and local government officials in Texas are eyeing millions in additional dollars being spent by Mexican residents who are willing to cross the Rio Grande to save on items from toilet paper to electronics. But until United States Customs and Border Protection puts additional resources in place to improve cross-border traffic, leaders and business owners say, what should be a boon could be little more than a bump.\u201cI think it all depends on what goes on at the bridges and how long it takes to process people,\u201d said Les Norton, a store owner and president of the Laredo Downtown Merchants Association. \u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating when you\u2019re dealing with these bureaucrats who look at Laredo and think every person coming from Mexico is either a terrorist or smuggling drugs.\u201dWait times at the border can be several hours, and pedestrians and drivers often see closed lanes despite growing traffic. Travelers can also be delayed by lengthy inquiries from inspectors. Complaints about understaffing and wait times at border crossings have been common since the creation in 2002 of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees C.B.P. and the United States Border Patrol. But the potential new revenue has spotlighted just how underserved the borders are, regional leaders say. \u201cFor this being a great country that it is, we shouldn\u2019t be welcoming people the way we are right now,\u201d Carlos Villarreal, city manager of Laredo, said. Only portable toilets are available at the border, he said, \u201cand when it gets really hot, can you imagine old ladies and kids not having a place to go to the bathroom? This is not the way it should be.\u201d\u201cThe utilization of public-private partnerships is an important component of C.B.P.\u2019s strategy to optimize resources,\u201d Thomas S. Winkowski, the department\u2019s acting commissioner, said in December. \u201cTogether with our private sector partners, we can better facilitate trade and travel to continue to grow our local and national economies.\u201dThe initial phase of the program will finance only overtime, but Mr. Villarreal said that the help should come predominantly from the federal government and that contributing money for border crossings was not necessarily something the city would make a regular practice.\u201cWe\u2019re not that rich to the point where we can say our resources are unlimited,\u201d he said. \u201cI am taking a wait-and-see attitude. Normally we work very well with C.B.P.\u201d About 700 miles upriver in El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, economists expect the American side to gain about $55 million a year in retail sales as a result of the changes in Mexico. But some advocates there say the tax increase will hurt the region in the long term.United States Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, Democrat of El Paso, said the region could suffer if stakeholders did not look at the binational community as one economy.\u201cMoving sales and spending from one side of the border to another really does nothing to help the whole system,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cAnd over time it could really threaten the competitiveness of the El Paso-Ju\u00e1rez and the U.S.-Mexico border region.\u201d He said he met recently with Carlos Angulo Parra, a Mexican congressman and National Action Party member who represents Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. Mr. Angulo has filed a lawsuit to stop the tax increase and threatened a labor strike in September.\u201cI hope that there is some way \u2014 even after it has gone into effect \u2014 to pull back from this,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cPerhaps it will take some evidence that this had been harmful not just to the northern Mexican economy but the Mexican economy as a whole.\u201dChristopher Wilson, an associate at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars\u2019 Mexico Institute who specializes in the North American Free Trade Agreement and the border economy, said there would be a definite impact, though to what extent was not clear.\u201cRight now it\u2019s actually in the news,\u201d he said of the higher tax. \u201cIn the border region, everyone is talking about it, and these are not policy people. So that visibility is one reason I suspect there will be a fairly quick impact, if there is much of one.\u201dUnlike Mr. O\u2019Rourke, Mr. Wilson thinks the impact to El Paso and the rest of the northern border will be long-lasting, but that is the only certainty.\u201cI think to a certain degree it will actually change shopping patterns, but I don\u2019t know what that degree is,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty possible that it will be pretty small. We have problems at the border. \u201cThe border is not as fluid as it once was for legal and positive things, for regular people who do things like cross the border to go shopping or visit family or go to work.\u201dMr. Wilson also emphasized that Mexico had a strong argument for making the change, despite the backlash.\u201cThe structure where there are multiple tax rates in different parts of the country has been used for tax fraud,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies essentially transfer some of their sales to the border region as a way to not pay their taxes, and so that\u2019s an issue that needed to be dealt with.\u201d\u201cWhether or not the cost outweighs the benefit, I\u2019m not going to say,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s a tough question.\u201djaguilar@texastribune.org Advertisement"}

Key indexes around the world continued to fall and emerging markets lost more ground in the face of fears of capital flight.Wall Street showed a few signs of stabilizing after its worst week since June 2012, while markets slumped across Europe and especially in the Asia-Pacific region.\u201cWe\u2019re clearly favoring the developed world over emerging markets at the moment,\u201d Philippe Gijsels, the head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets, said. Investors had become cautious because of signs that some countries, including India, South Africa and Turkey, were having trouble.On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 41.23 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 15,837.88. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index declined 8.73 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,781.56. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 44.56 points, or 1.1 percent, to 4,083.61.

On Tuesday, the selling seemed to abate, as both indexes were marginally higher in early trading. Investors, fretting about slowing growth in China and the prospect that the Federal Reserve will continue to scale back its support of the United States economy, bailed out of emerging market currencies.Investors in Japan were reacting to the additional concerns about a stronger yen, which they fear may eat into earnings of Japanese exporters by making goods more expensive for customers overseas and less competitive globally.\u201cOur baseline remains that China can avoid a hard landing, but the risk will remain for the foreseeable future,\u201d analysts at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said.

This week, Turkey\u2019s central bank said its monetary policy committee would hold an emergency meeting \u201cto take the necessary policy measures for price stability.\u201d All this has coincided with the prospect that the Federal Reserve will further scale back its economic stimulus program that has helped keep interest rates low worldwide. The prospect of waning stimulus has fanned fears that emerging markets around the world will now see much reduced inflows of cash as a result.In December, the Fed decided to cut back its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed for the first time, to $75 billion from $85 billion. It is widely expected to reduce the bond purchases by another $10 billion at a two-day policy meeting that ends on Wednesday.In the American bond market, interest rates edged slightly higher. The yield on the Treasury\u2019s 10-year note rose to 2.75 percent, from 2.72 late Friday, while its price fell 9/32, to 100.Advertisement"}

After Ms. Sleep decided to retire, they began looking for a new house, and, after viewing a model home in a new development, decided to move to Leesburg, Va., about 40 miles from the city. In having their new home built, they saw an opportunity \u2014 not to downsize, but to create a far larger home catering to their every need. In April 2012, they selected a model costing about $850,000 from a luxury builder and chose a number of standard options for an additional $650,000. Ms. Sleep, who was in the process of selling the software firm she founded nearly two decades earlier, added a wall of windows to the basement and furnished it with a pool table, a media room, a wet bar, a home office and a suite for their youngest daughter to use when she was home from college.They added a second master bedroom suite, on the ground level, for use when they are older and stairs become tougher to climb. They upgraded floors, carpeting and molding, added a sunroom and a large deck and supersized the garage door to fit Ms. Sleep\u2019s Cadillac Escalade. The home\u2019s lighting and temperature, as well as media on any of 14 televisions and the sound system, can be controlled remotely. This six-bedroom house, which has six full and three half bathrooms, measures about 9,000 square feet, including the basement. The Sleeps expect to spend an additional $250,000 to landscape its three-acre lot. \u201cWe went through some hard times with the software company,\u201d said Ms. Sleep, 57. \u201cWe feel blessed that we live here now. We pinch ourselves all the time.\u201dYet despite the bursting of the housing bubble, the ensuing recession and the slow recovery, buyers have not abandoned luxury homes. It turns out that they just took a break. In July 2013, sales of homes costing more than $1 million were up 46.6 percent from the previous July.Tim Gehman, design director at Toll Brothers, says the homes that sell best today are those with the biggest kitchens and most expansive master suites \u2014 much as they were before the recession. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of how large and impressive those two features are and how much buyers can afford,\u201d Mr. Gehman said.During the recession, Toll Brothers\u2019 customers spent less on options and upgrades, said Fred Cooper, the company\u2019s senior vice president for finance, international development and investor relations. Now the company is seeing an uptick. In 2013, Toll buyers spent 20.7 percent above a home\u2019s base price on options, slightly more than they did at the previous peak in 2007 and up 2 percent from 2012.The company offers a broad range of options that add or expand rooms and can even change a home\u2019s footprint. Media rooms, sunrooms and in-law suites can be added to standard models. Some customers are even opting for a so-called dirty kitchen, a separate galley off the main kitchen that is used to prep food. It keeps the dirty work of cooking hidden so it doesn\u2019t sully the increasingly large kitchens that have morphed into granite-slathered family gathering spots. For Ms. Sleep, a mudroom was crucial. She and her husband compete in triathlons, and they wanted a place to keep their gear and provide space for their children and grandchildren to stow coats, boots and more. The room includes a washer and dryer under a granite countertop with cabinets above, along with a half bath and a utility sink. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome,\u201d she said.At the same time, the lower end of the market is stalling. Mortgage applications for homes of less than $150,000 fell 0.6 percent in that period. \u201cFirst-time buyers are having trouble coming up with the down payment and qualifying for mortgages,\u201d Mr. Hunter said. \u201cThey are coming out of college with huge amounts of student loan debt, which makes it more difficult to handle significant monthly payments, to save a down payment and to qualify for a loan based on their debt ratios.\u201dWhen Dr. Jonathan Cohen, a physician in Orange County, Calif., began looking for a home with his wife and young son, they were outbid on one after another. Frustrated, he visited a new Toll Brothers development in Yorba Linda, among the country\u2019s wealthiest communities, where he later bought a five-bedroom, 4,600-square-foot home with a double-height foyer. Dr. Cohen, 35, and his wife, Esther, also a physician, saved for two years to buy it. Aware of how fickle the Southern California market can be, they tried to add options that would raise the home\u2019s value. They upgraded the hardwood floors and added solid wood doors and the most expensive exterior the company offered, a manufactured stone. In total, they spent about $80,000 upgrading the home, which ended up costing about $1.2 million. It\u2019s within a reasonable commute to work and in a great school district, Dr. Cohen said.\u201cBefore doing this, we were very concerned that the market could drop again,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am getting a brand-new home with a 10-year guarantee if anything breaks, built to my specs.

{"Headline": "Japanese Begin to Question Protections Given to Homegrown Rice", "Date": "2014-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAGA, Japan \u2014 For decades, Japan has defended its 778 percent tariffs on rice with a kind of religious zeal. Rice is a sacred crop, the government has argued, not open to trade negotiations. Its farmers are not just defenders of a proud agrarian heritage, but form the nation\u2019s spiritual center as well.Hardly, says Hiromitsu Konsho, a young organic rice farmer in this rice-growing region of Niigata. Many Japanese farmers have all but given up on their tiny plots, he says. They earn most of their income elsewhere, farming only part time and paying little attention to improving their crops.Yet, kept on life support by subsidies, production controls and tariffs, these farmers grow mediocre rice year after year, he says. Now an increasing amount of this rice has nowhere to go, as Japanese favor bread over their traditional staple. The government will soon raise subsidies that encourage farmers to divert their rice to animal feed.More enterprising farms face difficulty in expanding their plots or experimenting with more sustainable cultivation, steps that would let them better compete in a free market.Mr. Konsho points to his Echigo Farm, a rare upstart in rural Japan, whose organically grown rice sells at high-end retailers as far away as Tokyo and Singapore. It faced difficulties at first, but now its rice has become a hit, fetching 5,500 yen per kilogram, or about $24 a pound \u2014 almost 10 times the market price.\u201cIt\u2019s high time to revive Japanese rice farming,\u201d Mr. Konsho said.Echigo Farm almost did not get off the ground 10 years ago, when Mr. Konsho first came to Niigata from a Tokyo office job with the idea of starting an organic rice farm. Bureaucrats tried to block his land leases. Local farmers threw rocks into his rice paddies and flung salt at him, an insult reserved here for evil spirits.\u201cThe idyllic rice farms most city people think of are things of the past,\u201d Mr. Konsho said. \u201cRice farming is collapsing, and not because of free trade.\u201dThe recent debate over how much Japan should open up its agricultural sector to join a proposed free trade group led by the United States, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, is opening up new rifts in Japan, rifts that defy traditional urban-rural divides. Increasingly, urban Japanese \u2014 and even some farmers \u2014 are questioning exactly what those tariffs protect.Japan has signed only a few limited free trade agreements, thanks to its tough stance on agricultural tariffs. Consumers pay more than twice the global average price for rice, and four times more for wheat.Still, Japan won\u2019t give an inch on farming tariffs, Akira Amari, Japan\u2019s trade minister, declared at the latest talks for the Trans-Pacific Partnership last month, holding up talks at the 11th hour. The T.P.P., which involves the United States, Japan and 10 other Pacific Rim nations, would create the world\u2019s biggest free trade zone.Tens of thousands risk losing their livelihoods if farming tariffs are brought down, critics said at a recent national rally against the T.P.P. in Tokyo.\u201cHow is the government going to protect all the small-time farmers scattered across the country?\u201d said Kazumori Yamazaki, a rice farmer from Ishikawa in central Japan.Shigeaki Okamoto, 52, who runs a successful fruit and vegetable farm in Aichi, in central Japan, says Japanese farmers can compete without tariffs. Unlike rice, Japan-grown vegetables face global competition, with most import levies between 0 percent and 3 percent. Still, four-fifths of the vegetables the Japanese consume are homegrown. Vegetable growers on average earn far more than rice farmers.Indeed, Japan\u2019s stiff protections on rice no longer have much to do with protecting farmers, Mr. Okamoto says. They instead protect a sprawling network of farm co-ops that has leeched off farmers and stymied their efforts to innovate, he says.That network, as Mr. Okamoto likes to say, is bureaucracy run amok. About 216,000 people work in agricultural cooperatives in Japan, under the umbrella of the Japan Agricultural Group, or J.A. There is one co-op employee for every two full-time rice farmers. The central government\u2019s \u00a52.3 trillion farming budget for the current year is seven times the budget to oversee the nonagricultural 99 percent of the Japanese economy.Much of that money makes its way to these co-ops, charged with administering production controls on rice, as well as its sales and distribution. Under that system, farmers receive subsidies in exchange for limiting the amount of rice they grow, which keeps rice prices high and small, part-time rice farmers in business. The average Japanese rice farmer spends only about 30 days a year on agricultural work, and over half of all farmers till less than a hectare each of land, about 2.5 acres, according to the latest census data.The tiny farms find it impossible to achieve economies of scale. But that suits the J.A. just fine, because the organization gets commission income from collecting and selling their crop \u2014 something larger, dedicated farms could do on their own. The J.A. also makes money selling small farmers the machinery, fertilizer and pesticides necessary for growing rice part time.In addition, the J.A. acts as financier to Japanese farmers, handling deposits, loans and insurance in a side business that has made it one of Japan\u2019s largest financial organizations.Japan could make a full switch to direct-income subsidies, like the United States and European Union have done, which would at least protect farmers against international competition without the need for tariffs. But that would mean the J.A. would lose its commissions and its political clout.The rise of entrepreneurial farmers like Mr. Konsho or Mr. Okamoto would have the same impact because they do not rely on the J.A. for sales or equipment.Mr. Okamoto refused to work with the J.A. in expanding his farm, focusing on produce like strawberries, which he is able to sell independently. \u201cJapan\u2019s agricultural policy hasn\u2019t made farmers strong \u2014 it\u2019s made them weak to the point of collapse,\u201d he said.But the biggest problems lie in rice cultivation, Mr. Okamoto says. Most Japanese rice farmers have no incentive to raise the quality of rice they grow, because J.A. buys their harvest regardless of quality. Years of neglect have made Japanese rice not just more costly, but also lower in quality \u2014 and more dependent on fertilizer and pesticides \u2014 than much of the rice grown in the United States, Southeast Asia or China, industry insiders say.Regulations that discourage new entrants have made the sector unattractive to younger Japanese. Three-quarters of Japanese farmers are over 60 years old. One thing that could help entrepreneurial farmers, Mr. Okamoto says, could be the \u201cspecial economic zones\u201d that are part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s plans to revive the economy. Under those plans, several areas across Japan could experiment with easing regulations, helping farmers to tap outside financing to invest and to expand their fields. Mr. Abe has also said that the government will do away with production controls of rice in 2018.Experts remain skeptical, however, that there will be real change. Production controls live on even under Mr. Abe\u2019s new plans, albeit as subsidies to farmers who switch to other crops or produce rice for livestock. Politicians cannot afford to ignore the J.A. The organization is able to deliver votes in rural areas, especially among legions of part-time rice farmers \u2014 not to mention dole out much-coveted jobs for farmers\u2019 children.\u201cBut Japan will never free up its rice market in the real sense,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are too many vested interests.\u201dToyokazu Wakatsuki, 47, a farmer whose family has farmed rice for generations in Aga, was initially among local farmers skeptical of Echigo Farm. But now he helps Mr. Konsho run it.\u201cWe\u2019ve been growing rice for the J.A., not for the consumer,\u201d Mr. Wakatsuki said. \u201cFarmers need to start taking the initiative.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The trip, earlier this month, also included a visit to Dubai, where Mr. Kenny and the head of state there, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, sat side by side on velvet and gold thronelike chairs.Mr. Kenny next went to Riyadh, where he said he was \u201cvery much interested in finding out if the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency could resume purchasing Irish bonds as before.\u201dOnce again, foreign investors are piling into the government bonds of Ireland, Spain and Portugal \u2014 countries that got into such debt trouble that they required bailouts. Now these countries are able to sell their bonds at lower interest rates than they have seen in years, renewing hope that Europe has turned a corner.And yet, there are still few signs of relief from the deeper-rooted economic woes that have trapped much of the euro zone in a slump for more than five years \u2014 and that continue to be a drag on the global economy. Despite the suddenly easier terms under which Ireland and other recovering euro zone countries can borrow, the fact remains: These countries are still mired in stagnation.If investors, in their renewed appetite for euro bonds, are betting on Europe\u2019s recovery, it is hardly a no-risk gamble.\u201cThings are going better, but they are by no means good,\u201d said Jacob Kirkegaard, who tracks Europe at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.The ratio of Ireland\u2019s debt to its economic output has nearly doubled \u2014 to an estimated 124 percent last year, up from 64.4 percent in 2009. And although it technically emerged from its international rescue program in December, Ireland will still be paying off the 67.5 billion euros, or about $91 billion, in bailout money for years to come.Claus Vistesen, the head of research at Variant Perception, a London-based economic research group, sees the ratio of debt to economic output as a continuing threat to a euro zone recovery.\u201cPeople think growth is coming back,\u201d Mr. Vistesen said, \u201cbut at the end of the day, debt is still going up.\u201dA spokesman for the Irish finance ministry said the country\u2019s debt levels were expected to begin edging down this year. The ratings agency Moody\u2019s agreed, citing Ireland\u2019s improving finances and falling interest rates when it upgraded Irish debt from junk to investment grade last week.For the euro zone at large, though, a step back often follows each step forward. France and Italy, the bloc\u2019s second- and third-largest economies, are increasingly seen as the latest sick men of the Continent. Even Germany, the bloc\u2019s powerhouse, grew only feebly last year, by 0.4 percent.While unemployment, at a lofty 12.1 percent, appears to have stopped increasing, it is not showing signs of marked improvement, with countries like Spain and Greece still mired in Great Depression-era joblessness. Compared with Europe, the United States, despite a lingering unemployment rate of 6.7 percent, seems to be on a roll, growing at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the third quarter.Economic demand in Europe remains so tepid that inflation rates have fallen to a level that is impeding recovery and threatening to lapse into outright deflation \u2014 a chilling prospect that makes debts more expensive, puts pressure on wages and further discourages consumer spending.\u201cEurope is hardly roaring back to life,\u201d said Nicholas Spiro, the managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London. \u201cTalk about a recovery \u2014 the European Central Bank is still mulling measures to ward off the threat of deflation,\u201d he added. \u201cThat speaks volumes of the weakness of the euro zone economy, and yet investors are piling into euro zone debt.\u201dFeargal Purcell, the press secretary for the Irish prime minister, said that since Mr. Kenny took office in 2011 he had focused on \u201crebuilding our reputation,\u201d which has included trips to the United States, China, Japan and, most recently, the swing through the Middle East.\u201cWe\u2019ve exited the bailout, we chose to do so without a precautionary credit line and I think the recent bond sale is an endorsement of that action,\u201d he added. \u201cSixteen hundred jobs a week were being lost before we took office; we\u2019re now in a position where 1,200 jobs a week are being created, and our consumer confidence numbers have been steadily growing.\u201dAt the same time, he acknowledged, \u201cwe still have work to do on the unemployment front, and conversations in Europe with respect to debt sustainability.\u201dPortugal plans its own exit from its bailout program by the middle of the year. And in Spain, where banks required a \u20ac41 billion international bailout in 2012, the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, told business leaders in the United States this month that \u201crecovery is taking hold, and the country\u2019s appeal as an investment target is being rekindled.\u201dMore restrained have been nonpoliticians like Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank.

{"Headline": "Moldova\u2019s European Aspirations", "Date": "2014-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetters In 2014, Moldova will finalize an association agreement with the European Union, following an initial agreement reached in Vilnius, Lithuania, in November. Closer political and economic ties with the European Union will provide great benefits to the country\u2019s economy and society. Moldova\u2019s economy grew by more than 5.5 percent in 2013, and will continue to expand in 2014 as a result of a free-trade agreement reached with the European Union in November. Of course, there are still many shortcomings in Moldova, including poverty, economic distress and territorial conflicts. However painful, these problems are part of the transition to democracy and a modern economy.There are Europhobic people in Moldova who are under the influence of Russia\u2019s various interest groups or proxies. Some of them are behind the campaign of propaganda that has been launched against countries like Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova that seek greater ties with Europe. These skeptics do not represent the dreams and aspirations of Moldovans.Mr. Lorchenkov also distorts the historical record when he asserts that Moldovans have not had to fight for political freedom. Moldova is today one of the most pluralist and democratic states of the former Soviet bloc. The so-called \u201cTwitter revolution\u201d was born in Moldova in 2009, when tens of thousands of students forced a Communist government to conduct a vote recount, which eventually resulted in the installation of the new Alliance for European Integration, a party coalition that continues to govern the country until now.The vast majority of Moldovan citizens want their country to become part of the European Union, which is the natural locus for its citizens, irrespective to their nationality, language, faith or race.Igor Munteanu, WashingtonThe writer is the ambassador of Moldova to the United States.Mr. Lorchenkov writes of how the citizens of Kiev smashed a statue of Lenin and asks: \u201cWhy would Ukrainians take out their rage on a statue of the person they have to thank for Ukraine\u2019s appearing on the political map in the first place \u2014 in 1922, as a member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics? It was as if the Americans were to topple a statue of Washington.\u201dIs Lenin really Ukraine\u2019s Washington? Lenin\u2019s Bolsheviks crushed and seized a nascent Ukraine that declared its independence in 1918. Should Ukrainians really be grateful to Lenin? Lenin begat Stalin. Stalin starved millions of Ukrainians in the 1930s. And why is Mr. Lorchenkov belittling the aspirations of Ukrainians (and Moldovans) to join Europe?Paul Hursky, San Diego \u00a0Waiting on Pakistan to apologizeVanni Cappelli, Poughkeepsie, N.Y. The sooner the Pakistani government and politicians disillusion themselves of the belief that Abdul Quader Mollah, a Bangladeshi citizen and leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, was tried and executed in Dhaka because of his \u201cloyalty to Pakistan,\u201d the faster the wounds from the past will heal. Mr. Mollah was tried for being instrumental in committing rape and massacring unarmed civilian families in their homes with support from the Pakistani Army during night curfews in Dhaka in 1971. He faced numerous other charges of war crimes, but his love and loyalty to Pakistan were not among them. Instead of passing a resolution in their National Assembly to simply condemn the trial, Pakistan would be far ahead in the game if the resolution had included even a hint of regret or apology to Bangladesh, as Ms. Anam has challenged it to do.Mahmood Islam, Charleston, W. Va.Ms. Anam correctly refers to Pakistan\u2019s historically indisputable record of savage war crimes during Bangladesh\u2019s struggle for independence in 1971. She is also spot-on about Pakistan\u2019s denialist stance regarding its culpability in the war. The protest resolution passed in the Pakistani National Assembly, following the execution of a proven war criminal like Mr. Mollah, is reprehensible political revisionism that only reinforces the views of many Bangladeshis that Pakistan\u2019s political elite remains unrepentant for its myriad atrocities in 1971.But I disagree with Ms. Anam\u2019s casual assertion that \u201cMr. Mollah\u2019s execution on Dec. 12 had widespread public support.\u201d I\u2019m a strident opponent of the death penalty, even in a case like Mr. Mollah\u2019s. I\u2019d like to believe that the public clamor in Bangladesh for his execution had no sway over the man\u2019s conviction and hanging. Justice isn\u2019t about conveniently conforming with public opinion. As for the Pakistani apology to Bangladesh that the writer calls for, I think it would be merely symbolic.Sajjad Husain, Dhaka, BangladeshAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Upstate, Opposition to a Casino Is a Surprise", "Date": "2014-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet what was once thought to be a fait accompli \u2014 that the casino designated for the capital region would wind up in Saratoga \u2014 is no longer a sure thing, and much of that is because of a coordinated resistance from many residents and business owners.They acknowledge that the city\u2019s fortunes have long been intertwined with gambling. Even now, with its world-class thoroughbred track closed for the season, a smaller harness track attracts visitors the year round, thanks to its so-called racino, filled with slots-like video lottery terminals.But they say that the city does not need or want a full-fledged casino.\u201cWhy mess with a good thing?\u201d said Colin Klepetar, a middle school teacher who has helped organize against it. \u201cThis is already a world-class town.\u201dThe opposition stands in stark contrast to the support in areas like the Catskills and the state\u2019s Southern Tier counties along the northern border of Pennsylvania, where business and political leaders have long pushed for casinos to revitalize stagnant economies and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has banked on gambling as a solution to upstate economic woes. And even in Saratoga, city and county officials have endorsed the idea.\u201cThis community voted no by 57 percent and the county voted no by 54 percent,\u201d said Sara Boivin, an art historian who is a member of Saratogians Against Vegas-Style Expansion, or SAVE, which has been lobbying local politicians and protesting against potential casino developers. \u201cWe just want that message to be taken by officials.\u201dThe group, which formed soon after the referendum, has canvassed neighborhoods, packed meetings with opponents and gathered more than 1,000 signatures on petitions urging leaders to reject a new casino. Similar opposition has also been seen in several communities in neighboring Massachusetts. Nonetheless, the uprising in Saratoga has caught some local officials off guard.New York already has five Indian-run casinos, all of them upstate, and nine racinos at racetracks, including the successful one here \u2014 the Saratoga Casino and Raceway \u2014 which developers would like to see converted to a larger, full-scale operation.Developers are finalizing plans in the Catskills, the Hudson Valley and the Southern Tier, where competitions for casinos have pitted neighboring towns or counties against one another. Other cities in the capital region recently approved pro-casino resolutions, including Rensselaer, the downtrodden city across the Hudson River from Albany.The grass-roots anti-casino efforts recently caused casino supporters to begin a public relations push of their own. They say, in part, that if Saratoga does not allow a casino to be built here, it will be built nearby instead, damaging the town and the racing industry that the town supports.\u201cNow that the referendum has passed, the question of whether we are for or against casino-style gambling is moot,\u201d said Joanne Dittes Yepsen, a former county supervisor who took office as Saratoga\u2019s mayor this month. \u201cThere is a new question that needs to be answered: Will Saratoga Springs be hurt more if the casino is placed in a nearby municipality or within the city itself?\u201dNo such vote is planned in Saratoga, a city of 27,000, but opponents think the Nov. 5 results should speak for themselves.SAVE, the anti-casino group, says it fears that a bigger casino would drive up crime rates, drive down property values and generally ruin the city\u2019s small-town, big-money vibe. That appeal is evident: Saratoga has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the state; a thriving downtown, stocked with boutiques and buskers, public art and $25 entrees; and residential areas dotted with colonnaded homes and lawns decorated with statuary. The city\u2019s north side is home to Skidmore College, another beloved local institution. To the east is Yaddo, the secluded artists\u2019 colony, and the city\u2019s western edge is home to an emerging arts scene.The raceway is on the city\u2019s southern flank, not far from the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, the summer host of the New York City Ballet. Organizers there and at other arts organizations fear the competition for entertainment dollars from a new casino, which would most likely have hundreds of slot machines, dozens of table games, and entertainment and convention facilities.\u201cWe don\u2019t want a Las Vegas-style casino in Saratoga either,\u201d Mr. Featherstonhaugh said. \u201cWe want a Saratoga-style casino.\u201dRaceway executives made that point at a community forum in December that drew more than 1,000 people, including a Christmas-y mix of supporters (wearing green stickers reading \u201cSave Racing/Save Jobs\u201d) and opponents (wearing red \u201cCasi-NO!\u201d T-shirts).The forum included business owners who pressed the raceway officials on whether the new casino would discount drinks and hotel rooms, stay open 24 hours or otherwise draw business away from their establishments. Officials repeatedly said they wanted to be good neighbors, but also said their plans were still evolving. \u201cThere are too many unknowns right now,\u201d said Rita Cox, a spokeswoman for the track.Mark Baker, president of the convention center, said he was concerned about a new casino \u201ctaking people\u2019s feet off the streets of downtown Saratoga,\u201d which was slowly rebuilt after hitting the skids in the 1950s and \u201860s. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked decades to come back to this hallmark moment that the city\u2019s in right now,\u201d he said.The city\u2019s popularity dates to the mid-1800s, when mineral baths drew weary urbanites north in search of peace, quiet and a good soak. A former boxer and future politician, John Morrissey, in 1863 sponsored four days of racing on a small oval near downtown, and more gambling soon followed, including the Canfield Casino, which now houses a city museum.Over the decades, a parade of famous and infamous figures made their way to Saratoga to gamble or gambol, including the likes of Lillian Russell and Meyer Lansky. The city began a renaissance in the early 1970s, implementing a series of small improvements \u2014 repainted storefronts, newly planted trees \u2014 and broader changes that encouraged a vibrant downtown. Now the city hosts some of the world\u2019s richest horse racing fans for nearly two months every summer, a deluge of people and tourist dollars.What will happen next remains to be seen. At her inauguration on Jan. 1 at \u2014 appropriately enough \u2014 the Canfield Casino, Mayor Yepsen echoed the sentiment that Saratoga should not become Las Vegas. But the process continues: At his State of the State address last week, Governor Cuomo laid out the process of casino selection, with bids due in June and construction likely to begin before the end of the year.At the same time, there are pockets of hard times in Saratoga, and the debate goes on there, too. On a recent morning, two unemployed men drank beer in the remains of a factory near downtown. And while they admitted the casino might mean jobs, one of the men, Kevin Germaine, 55, who said he lived in a nearby park, did not like the idea. \u201cWe already got one,\u201d he said.An article on Jan. 13 about local opposition to a casino in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., misidentified the sponsor of horse races held in the city in 1863. The races were sponsored by John Morrissey \u2014 not by John Hunter and William R. Travers. (Mr. Travers and Mr. Hunter were involved in races in 1864.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Price for Super Bowl Volunteers", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVolunteerism has become as much a part of the Super Bowl as the Roman numeral identification of games, allowing those who cannot attend the games to be a part of the festivities by welcoming those who can.When the Super Bowl was last played in a cold-weather city, with the Giants edging the New England Patriots, 21-17, in Indianapolis to close the 2011 season, members of both teams were left with a warm and fuzzy feeling. They received blue-and-white scarves that were knitted by members of the community and that featured a logo patch sewn on by inmates at a local prison.Alfred Kelly, the chief executive of the New York-New Jersey Super Bowl Host Committee, estimated that 9,000 residents of the metropolitan area would serve as volunteers in the days leading to Sunday\u2019s N.F.L. title game at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. That is far fewer than the 20,000 who were initially contemplated, leaving the committee to scramble to cover 80 locations, some with multiple posts. And the feel-good interaction between volunteers and chilled visitors is somewhat overshadowed by current and potential litigation.The N.F.L. opted to hire temporary paid workers for positions in which volunteers had typically been used. The decision was an apparent response to a class-action suit brought by the firm Outten & Golden, which is based in Manhattan, against Major League Baseball, which did not pay volunteers at the All-Star FanFest at Javits Center in July.\u201cWe are aware of the ongoing litigation against Major League Baseball,\u201d said Brian McCarthy, an N.F.L. spokesman. \u201cDue in part to the size and complexity of the Super Bowl, we determined that it was advisable to use paid staff in certain roles this year. We have hired 1,500 temporary paid staffers who will perform specific functions at N.F.L. events.\u201d With about $10 billion in annual revenue, the N.F.L. certainly has the wherewithal to pay workers. In fact, the N.F.L. is paying several thousand security workers to patrol Super Bowl Boulevard in Midtown Manhattan and has hired many vendors to provide other services. But in bidding to host the games, cities and teams put together a package of enticements, from hotel rooms to convention centers, and they often promise volunteers as a way to provide logistical support and local enthusiasm.That help will be used at Super Bowl Boulevard, a 13-block stretch of Broadway from Herald Square to Times Square that has been turned into an outdoor festival. Paid workers will also be present at the media center and at various game-day events. It is unclear whether such staffing will become part of the cost of doing business for what is, by far, the most prosperous American sports league. \u201cWe will address future Super Bowls after this one,\u201d McCarthy said. The Super Bowl will be held next year in Glendale, Ariz., and then the San Francisco area and Houston in succeeding seasons.Justin M. Swartz, a lawyer with Outten & Golden, said the N.F.L. might be vulnerable, despite the signing of waivers by volunteers in which they agreed not to be paid. \u201cThe fact that the N.F.L. is paying some of its workers is laudable, but it also raises the question of why it is not paying all of its workers,\u201d Swartz said. \u201cThe extra steps the N.F.L. is taking to protect itself make me even more suspicious.\u201d He said his firm was investigating the league\u2019s use of volunteers at recent Super Bowls.According to Kelly, litigation against Major League Baseball led the host committee to reduce the number of volunteers it sought. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that after the All-Star Game and Major League Baseball being sued, the N.F.L. decided for this Super Bowl to go in a different direction,\u201d he said.He said about 11,000 people answered the N.F.L.\u2019s call to \u201cjoin the world\u2019s biggest huddle\u201d and donate their time, a tradition that goes back to the first Super Bowl, after the 1966 season. The number dropped this year when not all of them signed up for shifts, which typically last four hours, and a few failed security background checks.Despite that, Kelly said, the response ensured there would be enough friendly faces and helping hands at major sites like airports, hotels and various transportation hubs. Volunteers were out in full force Tuesday despite the bitter cold, from the media day in Newark to landmarks in New York City. They are not, however, used at the game.Numerous volunteers said the host committee contacted them recently via email to ask whether they would devote additional hours. \u201cPeople must be dropping out,\u201d Francisco said. \u201cIt must be the cold weather.\u201dFrancisco, who will be placed at Newark Airport, will have the benefit of an indoor location. He said of his role: \u201cWhere is the bathroom? Where can I get a cab? That\u2019s me.\u201dFrank Deford, in a commentary for NPR on July 31, described sports volunteers as suckers. \u201cFrom the players to the networks to the hotels, everybody involved with it makes a killing,\u201d he said of the Super Bowl. \u201cWhy would anybody volunteer to work for free for the Super Bowl? Would you volunteer to work free for Netflix or Disney World?\u201dStill, many people like Francisco and Bob Hogan, 67, of Ringwood, N.J., said they volunteered not because of money but to show community spirit. \u201cIt is a pride thing that we should show we can do this,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cI want this to succeed.\u201dSEAHAWKS\nvs. BRONCOS:\nMetLife Stadium\n6:30 p.m. Sunday\nTV: FoxAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ethiopian Migrants Expelled by Saudis Remain in Limbo Back Home", "Date": "2014-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLeguama JournalLEGUAMA, Ethiopia \u2014 Mohammed Jemal left Ethiopia two years ago. He wanted to be independent, to support his family \u2014 and to escape the mockery of having squandered a big chance for a better life.\u201cI went to college and dropped out. I somehow failed,\u201d he said. If he had gone back home and started a simple life with a poorly paid job, he said, \u201cpeople would have called my family names.\u201dSo, like many Ethiopians, Mr. Mohammed left his small, rural hometown in central Ethiopia to seek his fortune in Saudi Arabia. He entered the country illegally, he said, having walked most of the way through Djibouti and Yemen. Once he got there, he said, he worked as a guard and receptionist.Despite the many challenges, the money was worth it, he recalled thinking, until he was tossed out of the country in a mass deportation in which nearly a million people who had entered the country illegally from Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere in Asia were pushed out of Saudi Arabia last year, according to the International Labor Organization.For decades, rich Arab countries in the Middle East have been a major destination for migrant workers from developing nations. Deportations have happened before, but the scale of the recent expulsions from Saudi Arabia is virtually unheard-of, the labor organization said.About 150,000 Ethiopians have been forced out of the country. Their expulsion puts the Ethiopian government under strain because the remittances they sent greatly contributed to the country, which has one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies but is still very poor.Now, as Mr. Mohammed rode a bus past the mountains of his native country, old worries returned to his mind. On the bus with him were about 50 other Ethiopians who had also recently been deported from Saudi Arabia, most of them silent as they crossed the Ethiopian highlands into an uncertain future.When Mr. Mohammed got off the rickety blue bus and took his luggage down from the roof, a group of friends and family gathered around, hugging him. Many of them had also returned from Saudi Arabia. In fact, one resident said, almost all the youths of Leguama, a town of 5,000, had left because of poverty and had now come back.Mr. Mohammed\u2019s father, Jemal Endris, waited in front of his house, kissed his son on the cheeks and said softly, \u201cAlhamdulillah,\u201d Arabic for \u201cPraise be to God.\u201d Ethiopia is a largely Christian country, but Leguama, which is about 100 miles north of the nearest big city, is Muslim, as is the rest of the area.The family\u2019s sparsely furnished mud house was no bigger than 322 square feet. The family had built it with the money Mr. Mohammed had sent from Saudi Arabia. Some mattresses lay in the living room. A bulb gave off a dim light at night. There was a bed in the next room. In the front, the father had created a small sewing room. The river behind the house served for washing and doing laundry.\u201cObviously, all this is a big problem,\u201d said the father, a farmer like most people here, where there are not many other options. \u201cThe remittances were the pillar of our living.\u201dWithout jobs, factories and better infrastructure, he said, people will continue to leave. His second son, Endris, had already thought about it but remained torn about the decision.Many things in Leguama were built with money from the sons and daughters in Saudi Arabia: houses, shops, four mosques, a school. The community has collected money for an ambulance, but it does not know if the project will still be realized.Mr. Mohammed\u2019s mother, Zemzem Oumer, is not as worried about the future as his father.\u201cEven if you have money, you always worry,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what\u2019s going to happen.\u201dShe said she had been to Saudi Arabia before Mr. Mohammed traveled there. She went as a pilgrim to Mecca, stayed illegally, worked as a maid and returned only when her husband told her that he could not raise the children by himself any longer.She lived through some of the horror stories many Ethiopians tell. Sometimes she did not get food, and sometimes she was locked away. Mr. Mohammed said he had been insulted. Other migrants said they had been beaten and often not paid. Reports of rapes of young Ethiopian women set off protests against the mass deportation in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\u2019s capital, in early November. Three Ethiopians died in clashes with the police.The Ethiopian government has stated that diplomatic and trade relations with Saudi Arabia will remain unchanged. It is one of the biggest foreign investors in Ethiopia apart from China, Turkey and India. According to the Ethiopian government, Saudi businesspeople have $369 million involved in Ethiopia.Nevertheless, Saudi Arabia\u2019s image will be damaged, said Mulugeta Gebrehiwot, director of the Institute for Peace and Security Studies in Addis Ababa, the capital.\u201cThey could show some sort of solidarity, some sort of sympathy to what has happened to these migrant workers,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people were not living for free in Saudi Arabia. They were just working. They were actually doing the dirty jobs for the Saudis.\u201dMr. Mulugeta hopes that his countrymen will stop trying to leave Ethiopia for supposedly better horizons. After paying for higher costs of living in Saudi Arabia, some migrants do not earn much more than they would in Ethiopia, he said. The transit is dangerous and costly, too. And life away from family and friends is hard.Still, the desire to leave remains high for many. Mr. Mohammed said he had earned $780 a month in Saudi Arabia. The annual per capita income in Ethiopia is about $390, according to the World Bank.Saudi Arabia also expelled 400,000 Yemenis, as well as people from India, Sudan, Somalia and Egypt. They worked in construction and as maids, shepherds and cleaners. Their mass deportation was part of a nationalization program of the Saudi labor sector. Azfar Khan, a senior migration specialist for the Arab states at the International Labor Organization, said the program was a product of the Saudi government\u2019s fear of an Arab Spring. Nine million people, a third of Saudi Arabia\u2019s population, are foreign workers.The Ethiopian government has allocated $2.6 million to help migrants reintegrate. The fund supports those who have some savings left and want to start a small business. But the government expected only about 30,000 returnees. Their number increased fivefold.\u201cWe believe there won\u2019t be any social disaster,\u201d said Dina Mufti, a spokesman for the Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \u201cbecause this is a vibrant economy which is growing.\u201dMany of the returnees are frustrated. Urban unemployment in Ethiopia, a country of almost 90 million, is at 17.5 percent.Mr. Mohammed said he wanted to go back to college. He does not see a future in Leguama. It was his mother\u2019s savings from Saudi Arabia that had allowed him to study physical education; the savings were used up when she became sick with kidney and gastric problems and needed treatment. He blamed himself and left to earn money.\u201cIf there is a safe way to go back to Saudi Arabia in the legal system, this is an option,\u201d he said.The Leguama Journal article on Wednesday, about the uncertain future of tens of thousands of Ethiopians who had migrated to Saudi Arabia but were deported as part of a Saudi nationalization program, misstated the year in which nearly a million people who had entered Saudi Arabia illegally were expelled, according to the International Labor Organization. It was 2013, not this year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Italy, a Possible Path Out of Political Instability", "Date": "2014-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyThe weekend pact between Matteo Renzi and Silvio Berlusconi offers new hope to Italy. The constitutional reform deal between the leader of Italy\u2019s largest party and the leader of the opposition addresses one of the country\u2019s biggest problems: its ungovernability. Now Mr. Renzi, who runs the center-left Democratic Party, needs to put his energy behind key economic reforms, especially jobs and public spending.Italy has been plagued for years with unstable governments. In part this is because the voting system gives a lot of power to small parties and can lead to conflicting majorities in the two houses of Parliament, which have equal power.The Renzi-Berlusconi deal aims to reinforce the power of larger parties by changing the voting system. It also would demote the upper house so governments would need to secure a majority in the lower one only. Meanwhile, the two leaders have agreed to cut the power of Italy\u2019s regions \u2014 a move which should save money and lead to more streamlined decision-making.Mind you, it is not yet clear that the pact will achieve all this. That is partly because the details have not been published. But it is also because plans to strengthen the larger parties have been diluted with the aim of getting some of the smaller parties to support the reform.The key figure here is Angelino Alfano, who broke away from Mr. Berlusconi late last year. His splinter group supports the coalition government led by Enrico Letta, who is a member of the Democratic Party but who is increasingly subservient to Mr. Renzi since the latter became leader in December.In a sop to Mr. Alfano, the proposed new voting system would not wipe out all small parties. The consequence, of course, is that small parties might still be able to hold to ransom governments that depend on their support. This is mitigated but not completely avoided by a provision that encourages small parties to form coalitions with big ones.The result of this compromise is that Mr. Alfano will probably continue to support the Letta government for another year. But if he does not, that may actually be good for Italy. Assuming Mr. Renzi can still ram the new electoral system through Parliament with Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s support, a new election could then be held. The youthful and energetic Mr. Renzi would then be well placed to become prime minister. The other parts of the constitutional deal \u2014 reforming the upper house and the regions \u2014 could not be passed before the election, but could come after.The most likely scenario, though, is that Mr. Letta will continue in office. The question then is whether Mr. Renzi will work constructively with him to reform the economy, which is barely stabilizing after a devastating multiyear recession, and which suffers from 41 percent unemployment among young people.Mr. Renzi has unleashed a constant stream of criticism against the Letta government since he became leader, even though the two men are from the same party. He has effectively been whipping Mr. Letta, accusing him of being a lazy donkey who is not putting enough energy into getting Italy moving.Such tactics may be good for Mr. Renzi\u2019s short-term popularity. But acting as a super-critical back-seat driver is not the right way to govern the country in the long term.While it is true that Mr. Letta has not achieved much in his nine months in power, this is partly because for most of that time he relied on Mr. Berlusconi, who was endlessly sniping from the sidelines. If Mr. Renzi follows the same approach, Mr. Letta will be so undermined that he will not achieve much in the next year either.What the two men now need to do is sit down with Mr. Alfano and see whether they can agree on a detailed program of government. This should probably include a reshuffling to bring in new blood.The top priority is jobs. Both Mr. Renzi and Mr. Letta agree on this. Mr. Renzi has called for a \u201cjobs act.\u201d This would cut the \u201ctax wedge\u201d on employment, make it easier for companies to fire workers, close some of the holes in the safety net for the jobless and give a stronger incentive for the unemployed to take jobs or training if offered them.The ideas are all on the right lines. The problem is that Mr. Renzi has not spelled out the details, especially on how easy it will be to fire staff members. Nor has he said where the money will come from to fund a cut in the tax wedge and improve the safety net.The obvious answer is spending cuts. The government has, to be fair, set a target of 32 billion euros, or about $43 billion, of annual savings by 2016 and has started analyzing where the axe should fall. What is now needed is detailed agreement between Mr. Renzi, Mr. Letta and Mr. Alfano on actually wielding it.If Mr. Renzi can follow up his constitutional reform deal with Mr. Berlusconi with a jobs-and-spending program with Mr. Letta, Italy\u2019s prospects will start looking up for the first time in many years. Mr. Renzi should then put away his whip and give Mr. Letta his full backing.But if Mr. Renzi cannot get the deal he wants with Mr. Letta, he should say openly that he does not have confidence in the government. Mr. Letta should then resign, either allowing Mr. Renzi to take over without elections or paving the way for new polls. Assuming the weekend deal with Mr. Berlusconi over electoral reforms sticks, that is not a scenario to fear.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Plenty of Reasons to Be Cautious About 2014", "Date": "2014-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropeLONDON \u2014 Last year was the least tumultuous for the euro zone since 2009, when Greece revealed a vast hole in its books. The consensus is that 2014 will be just as calm \u2014 a view held by some who were predicting the demise of the currency bloc little more than a year ago.The political will to keep the show on the road has held firm, the European Central Bank\u2019s pledge to underpin the euro continues to stave off bond market pressure, and there is the prospect of economies growing at least a little. Spain, Italy and Portugal are all emerging from recession and Greece should follow suit this year.Yet there are plenty of reasons to be cautious.High unemployment, austerity fatigue and still-anemic growth offer the perfect backdrop for fringe parties to prosper at elections to the European Parliament in May. Some pundits predict a group of anti-euro parties \u2014 including the National Front in France, the U.K. Independence Party in Britain, Syriza in Greece and the Dutch Freedom Party \u2014 could capture 20 percent or more of the seats.That could pressure the European Union\u2019s main party groups to tack to the right and challenge the region\u2019s ability to integrate further, given new powers the Parliament will have to rule on the majority of E.U. legislation.\u201cIt could pull mainstream parties into more euro-skeptic positions and complicate both the appointment of a new European Commission and the task of passing banking union-related legislation,\u201d said Alastair Newton, senior political analyst at Nomura Securities.That the European Union has fallen short of its initial plans for a banking union to prevent future financial crises is plain. For several years at least, the buck for a failing bank will ultimately stop with national governments, leaving unbroken the \u201cdoom loop\u201d ensnaring weak banks and indebted sovereigns.The E.C.B. will publish results of health tests of Europe\u2019s biggest banks prior to taking over their supervision in November. The scope for a major shock is limited, given the extent to which banks have already recapitalized. Still, lending is likely to remain constrained until the tests are complete \u2014 hampering economic recovery \u2014 and the structure of banking union as it now exists could allow a future crisis to blow up.The main reason to be cheerful about the euro zone is the markets\u2019 unwillingness to test the E.C.B.\u2019s safety net. Any hole in that would change the terms of the game at a stroke.The German Constitutional Court will rule soon on the E.C.B.\u2019s bond-buying program, its as-yet-unused mechanism to protect the euro zone. The history of the court has not been to reject outright any crisis-fighting measures, though it has bestowed greater levels of scrutiny upon the German Parliament.But if the court did take the nuclear option, the bond market could declare open season on the currency bloc\u2019s weaker members once more, pushing the euro zone back into crisis.The E.C.B. has consistently said it is buying time for euro zone countries to put their houses in order by curbing debts and enacting economic reforms needed to thrive in the 21st century. The main flashpoints are Italy, which has stagnated for a decade and has a coalition government which may lack the cohesion to respond, and France, which is teetering on the edge of a new recession.\u201cFrance remains the only major European economy which is beset by serious health problems and has not yet done much about it,\u201d Berenberg Bank said in its annual review of the euro zone.The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, used his New Year address to offer companies lower labor taxes if they hired more workers. But with his popularity levels at record lows, a radical leap is unlikely.Austerity fatigue is most potent in Greece, the country that sparked the debt crisis. Its coalition government refuses to countenance more budget cuts. The government will need some form of debt relief to put its finances on a sustainable path at a time when its parliamentary majority is down to just three seats and Syriza, an opposition party that opposes the terms of Greece\u2019s bailout, is ascendant in the polls.If deflation took hold in the euro zone \u2014 a big if \u2014 that would pose the direst threat of all, raising the prospect of a Japanese-style lost decade and making national debts even harder to pay off.A plunge in euro zone inflation to an annual rate of just 0.7 percent prompted the E.C.B. to cut interest rates in November, but many central bank policy makers are viscerally opposed to the sort of money printing that finally breathed life into Japan\u2019s economy.\u201cWe must take care that we don\u2019t have inflation stuck permanently below 1 percent and thereby slip into the danger zone,\u201d the E.C.B. president, Mario Draghi, said last week.Even without deflation, any slippage in debt-cutting and structural reforms by euro zone members may require further action from the central bank.The history of the euro zone crisis shows that while policy makers lose their sense of urgency when the pressure diminishes, they rush to bolster their defenses when the heat comes on \u2014 and have consistently done so just in time.\u201c2014 stands to be more challenging and dangerous for euro zone financial markets than the surprisingly calm 2013,\u201d said Russell Jones, economist at Llewellyn Consulting in London. But he added: \u201cPredictions of the euro area\u2019s imminent demise have proved systematically wide of the mark.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Inequality Problem", "Date": "2014-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySuddenly the whole world is talking about income inequality. But, as this debate goes on, it is beginning to look as though the thing is being misconceived. The income inequality debate is confusing matters more than clarifying them, and it is leading us off in unhelpful directions. At the top end, there is the growing wealth of the top 5 percent of workers. This is linked to things like perverse compensation schemes on Wall Street, assortative mating (highly educated people are more likely to marry each other and pass down their advantages to their children) and the superstar effect (in an Internet economy, a few superstars in each industry can reap global gains while the average performers cannot).At the bottom end, there is a growing class of people stuck on the margins, generation after generation. This is caused by high dropout rates, the disappearance of low-skill jobs, breakdown in family structures and so on. If you have a primitive zero-sum mentality then you assume growing affluence for the rich must somehow be causing the immobility of the poor, but, in reality, the two sets of problems are different, and it does no good to lump them together and call them \u201cinequality.\u201dThat\u2019s because raises in the minimum wage are not targeted at the right people. Only 11 percent of the workers affected by such an increase come from poor households. Nearly two-thirds of such workers are the second or third earners living in households at twice the poverty line or above. The primary problem for the poor is not that they are getting paid too little for the hours they work. It is that they are not working full time or at all. Raising the minimum wage is popular politics; it is not effective policy.There is a very strong correlation between single motherhood and low social mobility. There is a very strong correlation between high school dropout rates and low mobility. There is a strong correlation between the fraying of social fabric and low economic mobility. There is a strong correlation between de-industrialization and low social mobility. It is also true that many men, especially young men, are engaging in behaviors that damage their long-term earning prospects; much more than comparable women. Low income is the outcome of these interrelated problems, but it is not the problem. To say it is the problem is to confuse cause and effect. To say it is the problem is to give yourself a pass from exploring the complex and morally fraught social and cultural roots of the problem. It is to give yourself permission to ignore the parts that are uncomfortable to talk about but that are really the inescapable core of the thing. Democrats often see low wages as both a human capital problem and a problem caused by unequal economic power. Republicans are more likely to see them just as a human capital problem. If we\u2019re going to pass bipartisan legislation, we\u2019re going to have to start with the human capital piece, where there is some agreement, not the class conflict piece, where there is none. Some on the left have always tried to introduce a more class-conscious style of politics. These efforts never pan out. America has always done better, liberals have always done better, when we are all focused on opportunity and mobility, not inequality, on individual and family aspiration, not class-consciousness. If we\u2019re going to mobilize a policy revolution, we should focus on the real concrete issues: bad schools, no jobs for young men, broken families, neighborhoods without mediating institutions. We should not be focusing on a secondary issue and a statistical byproduct. Advertisement"}

The first floor of the main house is configured as a great room, housing a double-height living area with a fireplace and mountain views, a dining area, and an eat-in kitchen. The kitchen counters are stainless steel, and top-of-the-line appliances include a Lacanche gas range.The second floor of the main house has two bedrooms and one bath; the third floor has the master bedroom, with a bay window affording valley views, and a children\u2019s playroom that could be converted to a bedroom.

{"Headline": "Jeffrey Wright\u2019s Gold Mine", "Date": "2014-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is a relationship that could bring us all the things we desire,\u201d Jeffrey Wright said. He was sitting with Samuel Jibila under an awning rigged from rusty metal sheets in front of Jibila\u2019s decrepit house in Sierra Leone. Jibila is the traditional ruler \u2014 the paramount chief \u2014 of Penguia, a little domain of jungly hills and dusty villages 250 miles from the capital. Wright is an actor who lives in Brooklyn. He has won a Tony, an Emmy and a Golden Globe and most recently appeared as Beetee in \u201cThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire.\u201d And for the last decade, he has been traveling to this isolated area near the Guinea border to run his small gold-exploration company, Taia Lion Resources. He wanted to maintain Jibila\u2019s faith in his company, in his plans, but Jibila, who was surrounded by lesser chiefs in glossy robes, wasn\u2019t feeling faithful.Since 2003, Wright has brought in geologists to sample Penguia\u2019s soil and streams. He leases the exploration rights here from the national government. The gold deposits at the site he and Jibila were discussing may be worth billions of dollars. He says that mining will be a boon to everyone; that the operation will put many hundreds of people to work, not counting the small shops and other businesses that will bloom; that company employees will have a real chance to rise; that paved roads will replace cratered tracks. Transformation will come to a territory so undeveloped that when the rare vehicle needs to cross a river not far from Jibila\u2019s home, the driver pulls onto a raft and ferrymen tug the vessel across with a rope.Wright has called himself a \u201cson of the soil,\u201d a child of the continent. He also calls himself a \u201cradical capitalist\u201d and casts himself as a kind of savior. Between 2 percent and 3 percent of Taia\u2019s operating expenses go to the community. In addition, Wright has done something rare and perhaps unique among Western mining outfits in the third world: Penguia will have a minor ownership stake in the company.But despite this vision and these promises, no metamorphosis has come to Penguia. Taia has accomplished no serious excavation, no construction of a pitside facility to process raw gold into bullion bars for export. The company has spent about $12 million on securing claims, sampling sites and just keeping itself afloat in Sierra Leone. Two years ago, Taia paid to grade a stretch of Penguia\u2019s dirt roads, but it is already rutted and overgrown. Company operations are at a standstill. Overall revenue has been zero. Wright is backed by a range of investors \u2014 from friends to a mining sector analyst to Tiffany & Company, which has put in several million dollars \u2014 and he has poured in more than a million of his own. But he hasn\u2019t been able to raise enough to actually get the gold out of the ground.Last April, while Wright \u2014 whose softly padded, malleable features help him inhabit an array of roles \u2014 met with Jibila and Penguia\u2019s dignitaries on the paramount chief\u2019s porch, a scattering of young men and women from the chiefdom worked less than two miles away amid hand-dug pits and tunnels, engulfed by dense forest. The men piled rock and gravel into buckets; the women hauled the pails away on their heads. On the banks of a creek, the women pounded the stones with bigger rocks and then washed the shards on scraps of animal skin or carpet, searching for flecks of gold to sell in a distant town to Sierra Leonean or Lebanese middlemen who deal in pinch-size bits.These laborers toiled for themselves; they had no link to Taia, though they were working on the parcel that Taia leases from the government. Their painstaking method is known as artisanal, as opposed to large-scale, mining. It goes on regardless of the paperwork the company signed in the capital, Freetown. Wright allows this low-level chaos for now, until major mining gets underway. It garners the diggers and washers a better living than most Sierra Leoneans make, which is less than $1.25 a day, but it can\u2019t provide anything like the economic revolution that Wright has predicted if he can mine there.What Wright longed for was a partner to finance the final phases of exploration and then sink $200 million into unearthing and refining the gold. He explained to Jibila that he believed he had found just such a company, that a delegation from one of the world\u2019s biggest gold-mining outfits \u2014 which asked not to be named because negotiations were in progress \u2014 was due to visit in two days.The delegation was coming not only to walk the site and assess the deposits for themselves but also, with Sierra Leone still recovering from horrific civil war, to gauge the risk of local unrest. Wright desperately wanted Jibila to honor the bond he felt he\u2019d built with Penguia and show the visitors a warm welcome. He and Jibila and everyone who lives in Penguia were \u201cfamily,\u201d Wright said. Jibila gazed back at him dimly. The actor wore a blue checked shirt and khakis. Penguia\u2019s secondary chiefs sported gold or crimson fezzes with brilliant tassels. Jibila, though, wore dingy gray slacks, a shirt of burlap cloth, a white fez stained yellow around the rim. He seemed to have picked his ragged ensemble to make a point, one that he underscored with his eyelids, which sagged shut in feigned sleep as Wright went on about Penguia being his \u201csecond home.\u201dJibila leaned forward suddenly from his slouch. He declared that he and his destitute people had grown tired of Wright\u2019s speeches. \u201cWhen you have a fine lady who is hungry, and you say you love her, that is not going to be working with this lady,\u201d Jibila said. \u201cFornication is good, but not on an uncomfortable bed! You are understanding the parable?\u201dHis voice lurching louder, Jibila warned that he could override the national government, that he could tear up Wright\u2019s lease \u2014 it meant nothing out here. \u201cThe president of Sierra Leone is subject to me!\u201d He said he could sign his own contract with a company that would move faster than Taia. (And indeed, that morning Wright\u2019s Land Cruiser had come grill to grill with the four-wheel drive of a Filipino group on its way to check out the parcel.) Having delivered this warning, Jibila demanded a written agreement so Penguia\u2019s artisanal miners, some of them former soldiers from the civil war (and many of them stoked on Double Punch, an 86-proof liquor sold and sucked down by the baggie), could dig with official sanction. A deal like this, giving a swarm of ex-combatants legal access to the site, wouldn\u2019t help ease the concerns of Wright\u2019s visitors.Wright recounted other incidents. \u201cOne of the local drivers didn\u2019t leave the Jiffy John as tidy as the guy who came behind him \u2014 a white South African guy \u2014 would have liked. And the South African took his head and stuffed it in the toilet. All this was happening on the set of a movie about Muhammad Ali, one of the greatest civil rights icons in the world. Having things like this be part of the recreating of his story \u2014 the disrespect and in some cases the abuse of these young Africans \u2014 ran counter to everything we were supposed to be celebrating.\u201d The overt racism, Wright said, was a function of the filmmakers\u2019 belief that South Africans had to be hired to run things in Mozambique. He felt sickened to be part of what he called Hollywood\u2019s \u201cWestern devaluing of Africans.\u201d Most of his fellow actors, he said, didn\u2019t seem troubled by what was happening.During the filming, he struck up a friendship with a security officer, Fred Marafono, a barrel-chested Fijian and retired sergeant major from the British SAS. Marafono, it turned out, had recently fought as a mercenary in Sierra Leone\u2019s civil war and lived in Freetown. Wright already knew Sierra Leone\u2019s story \u2014 how diamonds fueled the country\u2019s civil war, which began in 1991. He knew how rebel soldiers made a practice of hacking off the limbs of civilians as a means of intimidation; and how, in the mid-1990s, the president of Sierra Leone hired a mercenary company led by a former South African Defense Force lieutenant colonel to beat back the rebels in return for diamond concessions.The mercenaries, Marafono prominent among them, were largely hailed as heroes, but international objections to their presence led to their leaving Sierra Leone, which quickly descended into terror, with more mutilation and other atrocities committed by all sides. Marafono and two fellow soldiers managed to stay on and kept fighting, firing down from their helicopter gunship on rebel bands and playing a central role in bringing the war to an end. By the time Marafono and Wright met, 17,000 United Nations troops were on the ground, at that point the organization\u2019s biggest peacekeeping contingent in history, and elections were being planned for 2002.Wright, who majored in political science at Amherst in the mid-'80s and was electrified by the anti-apartheid cause on American campuses, had yearned ever since for a deeper involvement with Africa. \u201cI am a descendant of many peoples, and the majority of them are African \u2014 I wanted to make myself more whole,\u201d he told me.\u201cThere\u2019s an unfortunate stigma that African-Americans feel about our relationship to Africa,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a weakness we need to cure. Like many Americans, we have the perception of the continent as backward.\u201d He thought that America, with its demand for diamonds, was complicit in Sierra Leone\u2019s devastation. The \u201cfetishizing of bling\u201d among young African-Americans was also troubling.When he finished filming \u201cAli,\u201d instead of returning home to New York, Wright flew with Marafono to Freetown. That trip had no clear purpose. Wright saw acting as his calling; he\u2019d given luminous performances as a gay nurse who tends to the homophobic Roy Cohn in Tony Kushner\u2019s play \u201cAngels in America\u201d and in the title role in Julian Schnabel\u2019s 1996 film \u201cBasquiat.\u201d But his experience working on \u201cAli\u201d left him feeling tainted. As the two men toured Freetown, Marafono was greeted as a peacemaker and called \u201cFather of the Nation\u201d on the streets, where many of the buildings were burned-out shells. At a bedraggled camp for the war\u2019s amputees, Wright encountered a girl, no more than a toddler, whose forearm had been chopped off by soldiers. \u201cHow do you process that?\u201d he asked me one night last spring as we drove past a neighborhood on the outskirts of the city, where a spate of maimings had occurred. \u201cI couldn\u2019t. It was very difficult to see that and not say, Is there something I can do here that can be helpful to her, to this place?\u201dIn 2003, Wright made a second trip to Sierra Leone. By then, he had teamed up with Marafono on a venture that handled logistics and unarmed security for nongovernmental organizations and foreign mining groups working there in the aftermath of the war. Marafono wanted Wright\u2019s money; Wright was drawn to Marafono\u2019s heroic stature and his wish to take part in the rebuilding of the nation.The men traveled to a district in the hinterlands, not quite as cut off as Jibila\u2019s, where they learned about the experience that locals had years ago with an American mining company that had a long link to Hollywood. The people said they had received no lasting benefit and seen no development. When the war drove the Americans to flee, the chiefdom reached out, begging for help, for food, because as awful as the violence was, the worst killer of their children was war-inflicted famine. The company provided nothing. \u201cIt reeked to me of the rotten legacy of slavery and colonialism,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI was facing it firsthand.\u201dOn the day they visited, the people of the district were commemorating the first anniversary of the burial of their former paramount chief. A drumbeat rose up. The dead chief was a woman, and now masked members of the Bundu, the spiritually revered women\u2019s society of one of Sierra Leone\u2019s largest tribes, began to dance. In this rural setting, the drumming and the dancing felt essential to the culture, Wright said, and \u201cthe spirits of the ancestors\u201d seemed to be \u201cspeaking to every part of me.\u201d\u201cIt was almost hallucinatory,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was transformational.\u201dAs a child in a neighborhood of Washington, he was scorned as \u201cWhite Boy Jeff\u201d because of his light skin and the fancy private school he attended. That day in Sierra Leone, it was as if he was in communication with African deities. He knew he was going to commit himself to this country, to strive to right some historic wrongs. \u201cIt was like a role that had been written specifically for me.\u201dWe were creeping through Freetown\u2019s traffic, surrounded by hawkers selling mangoes and Sierra Leone\u2019s vibrant selection of thin newspapers. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how anyone in America could believe that you could develop a place like this through foreign aid and charity,\u201d he continued. \u201cName me one country that has developed that way. Think about the development of the American West. Stake a claim, carry forth, prosper.\u201dParaphrasing the 19th-century French novelist George Sand, he added: \u201cCharity degrades those who receive it and hardens those who dispense it.\u201dThe course he chose, he said, \u201cin some ways went against the liberal grain of everything I\u2019d been led to believe\u201d and is defined by \u201cwhat some might perceive to be conservative measures of free enterprise.\u201d But, he argued: \u201cInvesting your money aligns your interests with the people of the community. I have something at stake here, just as they do. It heightens your focus. I don\u2019t want anyone to perceive that what I\u2019m doing here personally is because I\u2019m some enlightened, evolved creature \u2014 I have a self-interest. There\u2019s more of my money here than I\u2019d planned at the start, and I\u2019m desirous of a return. In fact, the success of this model requires that we make a ton of money.\u201dHis switch to such thinking seemed to come as a revelation, one that struck him on that day when he listened to the tribal drums and watched the masked dancers. The people invited him to walk through the former mining site, through the broken remnants of equipment the American company left behind. \u201cThere was gold bleeding out of this hill,\u201d Wright recalled. He wanted somehow to help the villagers, and the nation, benefit from their resources.The term \u201cresource curse\u201d has been used by economists since the 1990s to invoke the way abundant minerals or oil can lead impoverished, misgoverned countries into worse mismanagement, civil war and more entrenched poverty. But as Paul Collier, a British economist and co-director of Oxford University\u2019s Center for the Study of African Economies, made clear to me: \u201cNatural-resource extraction can be a way to help the most desperate countries catch up,\u201d if the revenue is spent on \u201cmore productive assets such as education and infrastructure.\u201dWright tried and failed to win the lease to the hill he climbed that day, but he eventually leased sites elsewhere and gradually built a company that now consists of a handful of Westerners, including an American former investment banker with expertise in the mining arena, and about two dozen Sierra Leoneans, including cooks and custodians at Taia\u2019s camp in Penguia. He taught himself the basics of his new field by meeting with foreign and Sierra Leonean geologists and by reading everything from a classic geology tome published in the 1830s to current industry journals. He holds the leases to several parcels across the country, all as dormant as the one in Penguia. For each, he pays $100 per square kilometer annually to the Ministry of Mines and Mineral Resources. On the Penguia site, this amounts to $21,000. The ministry will also receive a 5 percent royalty on any revenues Taia eventually reaps, and the country\u2019s corporate tax rate runs around 30 percent, minus big breaks during the early stages of mining. In 2004, when Wright secured most of his leases, there wasn\u2019t much competition. Sierra Leone was one of the world\u2019s most failed states. And it is ringed by war-ravaged Liberia and by Guinea, whose government was fast collapsing. To all but the most intrepid, Sierra Leone\u2019s gold didn\u2019t seem worth the gamble.To many, it still doesn\u2019t. Out in Penguia, there is scarcely any police presence, though I did find a solitary officer sitting at a single battered table with a wilting logbook in a lightless, mud-walled station. For an outsider weighing a financial commitment, it is difficult to tell what, if any, legal system prevails. (Practically speaking, you have to pay, personally, for any form of security \u2014 police or military \u2014 that you might want.) In the capital, the signs of government corruption, and therefore the unpredictable cost of doing business, begin upon landing at the airport. As soon as my passport was stamped, a policewoman strode over, said she had a text message for me and, though I laughed at her scam, requested a tip.The country has come a long way since its civil war. In 2012, it held its third peaceful presidential election since the conflict officially ended in 2002. The gross domestic product has grown remarkably, mostly with the revival of an iron mine that was defunct for decades. But the national budget is a tiny $640 million, and as recently as two years ago, more than half of that came from foreign aid. The country\u2019s progress is at once profound and profoundly fragile. To anyone aware of Sierra Leone only from afar, warfare is still its defining characteristic, partly because of \u201cBlood Diamond,\u201d an AK-47-filled adventure movie set during Sierra Leone\u2019s worst mayhem. Wright reviles the film as yet another example of Hollywood\u2019s self-serving presentation of Africa. \u201cSo much of the hurdle facing people here is the way they\u2019ve been branded,\u201d he said about the country and the continent.His words were echoed by Mike Elliott, a mining-industry specialist at Ernst & Young, who said that Sierra Leone\u2019s reputation for diamond-induced anarchy might take a long time to fade. But he also emphasized that its reputation was not the only problem. \u201cThe reality is that while Sierra Leone may be more stable now, it\u2019s not a country of political stability,\u201d he said. When you factor in that the price of gold has tumbled in the past year, that the financial world has generally grown more cautious about investing since the global crisis of 2008 and that African mines, from a vast platinum operation in South Africa to a diamond site in Sierra Leone, erupted in deadly protests and police shootings in 2012 (leaving 34 dead in the South African incident and three in Sierra Leone), then betting heavily on mining at the border of Sierra Leone and Guinea might not look very enticing.Still, Wright felt confident that if he could get the foreign mining company to join with him, and if their partnership could succeed in producing, without strife, perhaps billions in gold over the next decade or so, he could contribute to the rebranding of the country. He hoped other foreign investors would flock to Sierra Leone and emulate Taia\u2019s communal ideals; he emphasized that he was following the capitalist path only \u201cto an extent \u2014 because it\u2019s inclusive capitalism.\u201d Penguia owns a 7 percent share of the company through an entity Wright set up and named the Taia Peace Foundation. Until a local board can be trained, the foundation is governed by Wright and a few other Westerners. On top of the ownership share, there is the 2 percent to 3 percent of operating expenses that will be funneled through the foundation to community projects, a greater percentage than many mining companies devote to what is generally referred to as corporate social responsibility. (In addition, Wright\u2019s celebrity may attract donations to Taia Peace.) All this could well bring improvement to a place where the nearest hospital \u2014 its operating room lit by hookup to a car\u2019s battery \u2014 is a seven-hour drive in the rainy season, and where the closest secondary school is just as distant.After 25 trips to Sierra Leone over the past decade, Wright says his goals as a miner have displaced his drive as an actor. \u201cI\u2019ve turned down a lot of work,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a movie Robert Redford was directing, a play Edward Albee wanted me to do.\u201d While filming \u201cQuantum of Solace,\u201d a James Bond movie, a few years ago, he drafted a prospectus for a possible Taia investor between takes of his scenes. This year\u2019s sizable roles in \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d and HBO\u2019s \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d have brought a pleasure he describes in muted terms \u2014 nothing like the passion he feels for Taia and its mission.Yet in listening to him, it was difficult not to wonder about that mission. I mentioned at one point that what he was envisioning might be seen as a type of trickle-down economics. \u201cAnd some would call it socialism,\u201d Wright said. \u201cBecause of the community share.\u201dI asked whether it would be possible to give more to the community.\u201cThat will probably happen \u2014 there are a lot of metrics to consider,\u201d he said vaguely.Does it keep you up at night, I asked, the thought that you might be engaging in a kinder, gentler form of exploitation?\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t. What does keep me up at night is meeting our payroll.\u201dAnd Taia hadn\u2019t quite been meeting it. A few hours before the meeting with Jibila, Wright called 20 employees together at Taia\u2019s camp, a short drive from the parcel. There were guards, cooks, mechanics. He apologized for falling a month or two behind in paying them lately. \u201cThere have been times when our senior management has taken less salary,\u201d he said. \u201cSo everyone has made sacrifices.\u201dA spindly guard rose to comment quietly: \u201cWe have no opportunity for coats for the rain. We work in the rain.\u201dWright told him that as with the salary delays, so much would be solved if all went well with the visiting company.No one asked what must have been on some minds: You are a famous actor, you cannot buy us ponchos?When the senior team of Westerners, who earn Western wages, takes less salary, does that cause the same hardship as not paying us for two months?Perhaps they were too polite to ask, too fearful, too hopeful. One employee had named his newborn son after Wright, and later, as we drove through the area, we stopped to greet villagers whose children were named after Taia\u2019s top managers.He argued that neither Penguia\u2019s 7 percent share nor the pledged contribution to community projects made for anything like a real partnership, because the community did not govern the foundation. \u201cYou say, \u2018This is your cow!\u2019 But you also say, \u2018I hold the string.\u2019 No!\u201dWright remained quiet throughout, but later told me that he didn\u2019t entirely trust Jibila, whom he suspects of being \u201cinfluenced materially\u201d by other mining groups that have begun snooping around the site.\u201cIn 2017, the president will say goodbye to the presidency,\u201d Jibila railed. \u201cBut I will still be here as chief! You are surprised, but we own the land.\u201dFrom his backpack, Wright brought out a booklet, the national mining code. He read a passage from it. Chief, he was effectively saying, through the government in the capital, Taia has authority over the mineral rights in that parcel. But he put it in terms of principle \u2014 and of branding. \u201cThe message we send,\u201d he explained, \u201cis that Sierra Leone is a nation of laws and that the people will respect those laws.\u201d Any other message would keep investors wary.The chief sent a minion to fetch a document of his own from the dark interior of his house. It consisted of a few printed pages bound with a powder-blue cover. This established a new entity, he said, the Penguia Mining Company, which held the mineral assets of the chiefdom and was free to grant its own leases. \u201cThis,\u201d he announced, raising the document and rattling the pages, \u201cis not from the bush!\u201dJibila\u2019s words were both a battle cry and a wail of defeat. He clung to that pale blue cover as though to his own power \u2014 and to an old order. He clung to it like something Wright was stealing.The moment was wrenching to watch. Yet transition was inevitable, and the best possible outcome was probably that Wright, whose self-interest is coupled with a deep concern for the place and its people, would succeed. Because what this territory beside the Guinea border most likely needs is just the full-bore mining that Wright has planned: a round-the-clock excavating and refining operation that wouldlight up the night, that would blot out the African stars andgouge out splendidly forested hills until Taia replants them, that would toss aside traditional rule and create jobs with the chance for promotion and fiscal infusions for the area and tax and royalty revenue for the nation and an economic link between Penguia and the rest of the world.As the afternoon melted toward dusk, Jibila and Wright did what negotiators throughout history have done when they hit an impasse. They took a walk. When they returned, they\u2019d reached an understanding: access to a section of the parcel for 200 local artisanal miners for six months. Wright wasn\u2019t too pleased; he intended to put off telling his visitors and their company about the deal until the next phase of discussions in the coming weeks. But he figured they\u2019d live with it. There were often encroachments from artisanal diggers in the third world, and he thought the company would appreciate that at least the compromise he\u2019d struck set clear parameters.Two days later, the three-person delegation swooped in, circling in a bright yellow helicopter above the parcel. The chopper landed, and soon a meeting was held at an open-sided hall in a town where the sole proud piece of machinery was a hand-powered water pump. A throng drew close to hear the proceedings. Wright presented Jibila with a bundle of kola nuts, signifying life. \u201cWe\u2019re a small company, but we have big ideas,\u201d he told the convocation of chiefs and of Bundu women led by a witch in a carved wooden helmet with a mane of orange, blue and white yarn. One of the three visitors, pink-faced, tall and bulky in a dress shirt and bluejeans, said solemnly, \u201cOur trip would not be complete without paying homage to you, Mr. Paramount Chief.\u201dJibila was dressed formally this day in a striped cap and a long matching tunic. \u201cJeffrey is an honorary member of my family,\u201d he said loudly. \u201cHe is my brother.\u201d They clasped hands, Wright beaming. Jibila signaled to one side, and Wright received gifts: a goat on a rope, a white chicken, a hefty metal bowl of rice. He stood, grasping the cord and cradling the bowl while the bird, perched atop the rice, twitched its head and squawked under his chin. He didn\u2019t look too comfortable. The gifts seemed like a public statement of friendship and a private whisper of warning, as though the leader wanted Wright to remember that he could still make things awkward.Jibila turned to the three visitors. \u201cUse your helicopters and bring your machines!\u201d he commanded. \u201cI am an important chief, and I want development fast-tracked! Go as hard as possible! We are impatient! Don\u2019t even sleep!\u201dLater the pink-faced man told me that he was satisfied. It appeared that Wright would have his partnership. But weeks went by, then months. In late October, while Wright watched a screening of \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d in Manhattan, his phone vibrated constantly, calls coming in from the Taia staff, huddled in a spot with cell service and anxious to know if at last he had a commitment. He didn\u2019t. The price of gold had taken another dip. With values so unsteady, his would-be partner was hesitant. Wright has begun wooing another set of investors. \u201cThe variables are out of Taia\u2019s control,\u201d he said to me in December. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to maintain buoyancy till the market turns.\u201d But he didn\u2019t have the strength to act buoyant. His voice was sinking. He and Penguia wait.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Growth in Jobs Slows Sharply to 3-Year Low", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust when it seemed as if the economy was finally accelerating, the latest employment figures once again confounded expectations of better days ahead.The government said on Friday that employers added jobs at the slowest pace in three years in December, reversing three months of steadily rising hiring that had persuaded economists and policy-makers at the Federal Reserve that the labor market had finally turned the corner. Wintry weather, however, may have exaggerated the weakness, and the unexpectedly grim data immediately set off a debate among economists as to whether they were an anomaly or an indication of a more significant slowdown in the economy. But even after accounting for factors like cold temperatures and snow that may have inhibited hiring, many experts cautioned that other trends, like average hourly earnings and the labor participation rate, were hardly encouraging.\u201cWhat it does say is that we\u2019re not in takeoff mode in the labor market,\u201d said Julia Coronado, chief United States economist at BNP Paribas. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much weakness in hiring as lack of vitality. We\u2019re treading water.\u201dOn Capitol Hill, the lackluster economic picture in December may strengthen the hand of Democrats who are pushing to extend unemployment benefits to 1.3 million Americans whose coverage expired at the end of the year. Since midsummer, the job market had been trending upward, with employers adding 241,000 workers in November, a robust performance that helped persuade the Fed to begin easing its vast stimulus program. But the latest data called into question whether the central bank\u2019s optimism was premature. Employers added just 74,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said, a far cry from the 200,000 that economists had been looking for, and well below the monthly average increase of 182,500 over the course of 2012 and 2013.The one apparent bright spot in Friday\u2019s report \u2014 a sharp drop in the unemployment rate to 6.7 percent from 7 percent \u2014 was tarnished because it largely resulted from people exiting the work force rather than because they landed jobs. The work force shrank by 347,000 in December, reversing a big gain from November, and returning the proportion of Americans in the labor force to its October level of 62.8 percent, the lowest in 35 years.While some of that decline is because of demographic factors like an aging population and rising retirements, Ms. Coronado said she was particularly troubled by how many prime-age workers were dropping out.Among workers aged 45 to 54, the participation rate dropped 0.4 percentage point to 79.2 percent, the lowest since 1988. For workers 55 and older, the participation rate edged down only 0.1 percentage point. \u201cIt just keeps dropping and dropping,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s depressing, as it\u2019s not just older workers retiring.\u201dAfter initially dropping in the wake of the Labor Department report Friday morning, stocks recovered later in the day as investors shifted their focus away from the labor market to what they hope will be more buoyant results as companies report fourth-quarter earnings in the next few weeks. Some economists, impressed by other recent data showing steadily rising economic output, private surveys showing healthier payroll gains, a growing manufacturing sector, and increased exports, suggested that December\u2019s figures represented a statistical fluke rather than another of the so-called swoons that have been a recurring feature of the fitful recovery that has followed the Great Recession.\u201cMy advice is to ignore this number,\u201d said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS. \u201cA lot of other indicators are showing strength. It was largely noise last month, and the Fed will see it the same way, unless there is other evidence that gives them pause.\u201d Most experts say the Federal Reserve will stick with its plan to gradually taper its stimulus program when policy-makers meet later this month, but future reductions could be delayed if payroll gains remain weak in February and March.Even as optimists like Mr. Behravesh insisted that December\u2019s data was not a sign that the recovery was ebbing, they say it makes sense to remain focused on the labor market. \u201cThis is the weak spot in the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cOutput has recovered and is above the prerecession level. But employment is still about two million below where it was when the recession started.\u201d Although retailing posted decent gains as the holiday shopping season reached its peak in December, the figures suggested that other areas of the economy that had been healthy for most of 2013 reversed course as the year drew to a close, significantly cutting into overall job creation.For example, the construction industry lost 16,000 jobs in December, an about-face from the 2013 average monthly gain of 10,000 jobs. Similarly, health care employment fell by 6,000, compared with monthly gains of 17,000 in 2013 and 27,000 in 2012. The average workweek in the private sector fell to 34.4 hours, a drop of a tenth of an hour and another sign of softness in the economy.Some groups fared better than others, despite the broad weakness in the data. For example, the number of jobs held by women increased 75,000, even as those held by men dropped by 1,000. Men were especially hurt by the construction sector decline, while women benefited more from the growth in retailing. At the same time, the labor participation rate among workers with some college or more rose slightly, but was more than offset by a fall in participation among people with a high school diploma or less.Economists cautioned that month-to-month volatility in the payrolls report was common, and the numbers could be revised upward in the future. The Labor Department revised the number of jobs created in November to 241,000 from 203,000. And there have been other big month-to-month swings in 2013. After a 172,000 gain in June, payrolls advanced by just 89,000 in July, only to jump by 238,000 in August. On Wall Street, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index finished the day up 4.24 points or 0.23 percent, at 1,842.37. The Dow Jones industrial average edged lower 7.71 points or 0.05 percent, closing at 16,437.05. The Nasdaq composite index gained 18.47 points or 0.44 percent, ending the week at 4,174.67. In the market for government bonds, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 29/32 to 99 2/32, sending its yield down to 2.86 percent from 2.96 percent late Thursday.Michael Hanson, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, estimated that even if weather did subtract 75,000 to 100,000 jobs from payroll gains, December hiring was nevertheless somewhat anemic. Nor does the weather explain why average hourly earnings increased by only 0.1 percent in December, about half the average percentage increase for the last 12 months. \u201cYou can\u2019t say it\u2019s the weather, wash your hands and be done with it,\u201d he said. \u201cEven with a generous interpretation, job growth was softer than it has been recently.\u201d Advertisement"}

Rick Scott named a South Florida property appraiser and former Republican legislator to be his running mate and lieutenant governor, filling a position that had been vacant for nearly a year.Carlos Lopez-Cantera, 40, a former member of the State House of Representatives, was elected in 2012 to be the property appraiser in Miami-Dade County. He will take office Feb. 3.Democrats who accused the governor of dragging his feet on naming a successor filed a lawsuit last week, which sought to force him to name a replacement. The governor was said to have approached several potential candidates who declined to take the post.\u201cI am confident that we took the right amount of time to find the right person to serve as Florida\u2019s lieutenant governor,\u201d Mr. Scott said, adding that Mr. Lopez-Cantera will be a \u201cmajor part of our agenda to build an opportunity economy.\u201d The lieutenant governor position is largely ceremonial and has no portfolio.Mr. Lopez-Cantera, a real estate developer by profession, was a member of the State House of Representatives for eight years before term limits forced him out of office. He was majority leader for his last two years.As the county appraiser, he lowered property valuations, which led to a drop in tax bills and municipal revenue.\u201cI\u2019m very excited to be part of this team,\u201d he said at the announcement in Tallahassee. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to getting involved in the action in Tallahassee.\u201d He said he looked forward to working with Mr. Scott to ensure the passage of $500 million in tax cuts.Mr. Scott faces re-election this year.

{"Headline": "Unpopularity of the House Could Turn Senate Races", "Date": "2014-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 To Representative Steve Daines, Republican of Montana, his vote this month against a 1,582-page, $1.1 trillion spending bill was at once a stand for fiscal sanity and a protest against spending cuts to rural communities, a \u201cconstructive no,\u201d as he put it last week.His opponents in the race for Montana\u2019s open Senate seat quickly labeled it a vote against increased funding for the Indian Health Service, Pell Grants for low-income college students, mental health benefits for veterans and traumatic brain injury assistance for those who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as an effort to dry up the clean water supplies of rural Montanans.The attacks on that one vote from Montana Democrats, including a possible challenger in Lt. Gov. John Walsh, highlighted a vulnerability to the Republicans\u2019 quest for control of the Senate: They draw heavily from the unpopular House for candidates.\u201cThey\u2019re just trying to remind you these guys are members of a very unpopular body,\u201d said Jennifer Duffy, the Senate analyst at Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan election newsletter. \u201cIt\u2019s something that worked well for them in 2012.\u201dRepublicans start this election year with the strongest hand they have had since 2010: a Democratic president with weak approval ratings, an economy still struggling to spread the benefits of a slow recovery, the disastrous rollout of President Obama\u2019s health care law, contested races for six Democratically held Senate seats in states carried by Mitt Romney, and the historical pattern that the party controlling the White House loses seats in a second midterm.But to take control of the Senate, Republicans need to net six seats, and they will probably need to do it with candidates currently serving in House seats in Montana, Louisiana, Arkansas, West Virginia and Georgia.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d said Ty Matsdorf, spokesman for the Senate Majority PAC, the main \u201csuper PAC\u201d devoted to keeping the Senate in Democratic hands. \u201cHouse Republicans are advancing and advocating an irresponsible, reckless agenda, and we are going to make sure voters in every one of these states know their record.\u201dIn 2012, Republicans fielded House members or former House members in Senate contests in North Dakota, Montana, Missouri, Florida, Michigan, New Mexico and Arizona. Six of them lost, including Denny Rehberg in Montana, Rick Berg in North Dakota, and Todd Akin in Missouri, three races Republicans had thought were likely pickups. In contrast, five of the six House Democrats seeking a seat in the upper chamber in 2012 won.This time around, Republicans say they simply have better candidates in a much better environment. \u201cI spent 28 years in business prior to getting involved in politics a couple of years ago, and learned some principles: Keep your skin thick and your heart tender,\u201d Mr. Daines said with a shrug.They say this year will be more like 2010, when Representatives Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, Roy Blunt of Missouri and John Boozman of Arkansas cruised to Senate victories.\u201cOne election cycle does not a trend make,\u201d said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cActually, to the contrary, the fact that there are 51 former members of the House currently serving in the Senate suggests that 2012 was an outlier.\u201dTo keep the Senate, Democrats must prove that wrong \u2014 and tar House Republicans seeking to jump to the upper chamber with the sins of a Congress with record low approval ratings.\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing here in Arkansas is, once again you\u2019ve got a fundamentally flawed candidate who is trying to convince Arkansas voters that they should look past his record in the House as a reckless and irresponsible member who has sided with the special interests bankrolling his career,\u201d said Erik Dorey, a spokesman and strategist for Senator Mark Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, in an attack on Representative Tom Cotton, Mr. Pryor\u2019s 2014 opponent. \u201cHe can\u2019t run away from his votes.\u201dThe approach is not going to work, said David Ray, communications director for the Cotton campaign.\u201cThose candidates don\u2019t have any bearing on our race,\u201d he said of the failed 2012 stable. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is distinguish ourselves from Senator Mark Pryor, and he makes that easier for us each and every day.\u201d\u201cCassidy has to be Washington, Landrieu has to be Louisiana, or we lose this race,\u201d said a Democratic strategist involved in the campaign.Democratic strategists say similar lines of attack will be coming against Mr. Daines in Montana, and Representative Shelley Moore Capito in West Virginia, a favorite to take the seat of Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, a Democrat who is retiring. Democrats are also stockpiling ammunition in expectations that either Phil Gingrey, Paul Broun or Jack Kingston \u2014 all House members \u2014 will emerge as the Republican nominee for the seat of Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, a Republican who is retiring.\u201cYou can\u2019t overstate the brand problem with the Republican House,\u201d said Matt Canter, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.Of course, Democrats may stumble themselves. Ms. Landrieu was off message last week when she declined to attack Mr. Cassidy\u2019s House record and instead said he had little record to show for his time in Washington.Republicans have their own bullets. As the Walsh campaign goes after Mr. Daines as a tool of the House Republican Conference, Lieutenant Governor Walsh is dealing with an Army reprimand that recently came to light for pressuring subordinates to join the National Guard Association of the United States, a lobbying organization, while he headed Montana\u2019s National Guard in 2010.Meantime, sitting senators like Ms. Landrieu and Mr. Pryor are burdened with the low approval ratings of the president, a weight that is probably heavier in their Republican states than the unpopular Republican leadership. Mr. Obama\u2019s approval rating in Arkansas stands at 36 percent, according to the latest Gallup poll. In West Virginia, it is 28 percent.Still, Republicans cannot get complacent, rerunning the 2010 playbook and simply attacking Mr. Obama and the health care law as they did in 2012, said Rob Jesmer, who led the Republican senatorial campaign that year. Rather, they will need a positive agenda to explain why they should take the Senate.\u201cCollectively, people got lazy in 2012 and tried to run the same campaign they ran in 2010,\u201d Mr. Jesmer said. \u201cThat was the lesson. We should have won.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the figure remained above the 50-point level that indicates expansion in activity. New business growth was the slowest in six months.A similar survey by China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics, released Friday, also showed a slowdown in service sector growth in December, to a four-month low of 54.6, from the previous month\u2019s 56.Indexes from the government and HSBC last week showed that China\u2019s factory activity slowed in December, suggesting the moderation in the country\u2019s growth in the final quarter of 2013 was broad-based.The weaker purchasing managers\u2019 indexes contributed to a decline in Asian markets on Monday, on concern over whether China\u2019s slowdown would continue into the first quarter.\u201cWhat has been the principal sort of driver of the market since the beginning of the new year has been a disappointment of the Chinese P.M.I. data,\u201d said Guy Stear, Asian credit and equity strategist in Hong Kong for Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, adding that growth in China is a \u201cfocal point\u201d for markets.MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares excluding Japan was down 0.6 percent, reaching a two-week low and adding to a 1.1 percent drop on Friday. China\u2019s CSI 300 index fell 2.3 percent, hitting a five-month low.China\u2019s economy has regained some momentum since midyear after a protracted slowdown. While the economy was expected to lose momentum as the government reined in rampant credit growth and demand for China\u2019s exports remained subdued, activity remained resilient into the fourth quarter.Beijing has said it will accept slower growth as it tries to reshape the economy toward sustainable growth that is based on consumer demand, after three decades of breakneck expansion driven by exports and credit.China\u2019s economic growth is expected to come in at 7.6 percent in 2013, the government has said, just above the official target of 7.5 percent and slightly below the 7.7 percent of 2012. Data for gross domestic product in 2013 are scheduled to be released Jan. 20.\u201cThe implementation of reforms such as lowering the entry barriers for private business in service sectors and expanded V.A.T. reforms should help to revitalize service sectors in the year ahead,\u201d said Qu Hongbin, the chief economist for China at HSBC, referring to changes in the value-added tax system.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkish Government, Shaking Up Police, Now Seeks More Power Over Judiciary", "Date": "2014-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Turkish government reshuffled the police force yet again overnight, the police said on Wednesday, and sought to expand its power over the judiciary in a move that one former justice minister likened to a coup.The investigation, which has linked senior politicians to murky business deals, has resulted in the resignation of three ministers, whose sons are under suspicion, as well as a fourth minister. It centers on accusations that officials took bribes in return for bending zoning rules. Turks have been riveted by lurid details leaked to the news media, like the discovery of $4.5 million in cash stuffed in shoe boxes at the home of the director of a state bank.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government sent draft legislation to Parliament late Tuesday that would enhance its limited control over the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors, which is responsible for judicial functions, including appointments. The proposed law would grant the justice minister greater authority over legal discipline, judicial investigations, and the appointment of judges and prosecutors, powers the minister does not now have.Analysts said the legislation would severely undermine the separation between the executive and judiciary branches, and undercut the judicial independence set out in a constitutional change supported by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government in a referendum in 2010.\u201cWith this legislation, the government is launching an operation of revenge against the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors,\u201d Hikmet Sami Turk, a former justice minister from a leftist opposition party, said in an interview. \u201cThe prime minister has regarded the graft probe as a judicial coup against his government, so now, with this legislation, his government launches a countercoup against the judiciary.\u201dBut Bekir Bozdag, the current justice minister, was quoted by CNN Turk television on Wednesday as saying that the draft legislation was compatible with the Constitution, and that the High Council in its current form had too much power. \u201cEven the Parliament does not have the power and authority that the council has,\u201d Mr. Bozdag said.The government also demoted or reassigned police chiefs in 15 cities and the deputy head of Turkey\u2019s police force, the police said in a statement on Wednesday. The latest removals came after around 350 Turkish police officers in Ankara, the capital, were reassigned on Tuesday in the largest single overhaul of the police force since the corruption inquiry came to light last month. The government had already removed more than a dozen high-ranking police officials.On Wednesday, Zekeriya Oz, the former chief prosecutor of Istanbul, who began the investigation and was eventually dismissed under government pressure, said he had been threatened by two men from the prime minister\u2019s office who had demanded that he write a letter of apology to Mr. Erdogan, The Hurriyet Daily News reported.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s office quickly denied Mr. Oz\u2019s allegation. \u201cIt is out of discussion that our prime minister would have sent some people from senior judiciary, or anybody else, regarding the matter,\u201d the semiofficial Anadolu Agency said late Wednesday, citing unidentified officials from Mr. Erdogan\u2019s office. \u201cThis claim, as in our prime minister\u2019s own words, is outright slander.\u201dEfforts by the government that are apparently aimed at stymieing the inquiry threaten Turkey\u2019s prospects of joining the European Union. The government\u2019s proposal to expand its authority over judges and prosecutors drew criticism from a senior European official.The official, Nils Muiznieks, commissioner for human rights on the Council of Europe, wrote on Twitter, \u201cProposals to curb powers of High Council of Judges and Prosecutors represent serious setback for the independence of the judiciary in Turkey.\u201d The Council of Europe is a governmental group founded in 1949 to promote human rights on the Continent. The crisis also threatens to undermine the country\u2019s economy by, among other things, alarming foreign investors when inflation is already rising and the Turkish lira has fallen. Fitch Ratings warned on Tuesday that the corruption scandal could damage Turkey\u2019s credit rating and economic stability. The finance minister, Mehmet Simsek, said the inquiry could undermine short-term growth.Any economic fallout would be a particular blow to Mr. Erdogan, who has sought to build economic ties with Europe and the Middle East and to fashion Turkey as a regional economic powerhouse attractive to foreign investors.Turkey\u2019s main opposition leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, said on Tuesday that Mr. Erdogan would eventually face judgment for his role in the scandal. He added that the prime minister was pushing the bounds of his authority by seeking to expand the government\u2019s role in appointing judges and prosecutors.\u201cHe can\u2019t have such an authority. He can\u2019t judge. Judges do this,\u201d Mr. Kilicdaroglu told a parliamentary group meeting of his Republican People\u2019s Party, according to The Hurriyet Daily News.

The agency operates under the largest of the state\u2019s bureaucracies, the Department of Economic Security, which oversees dozens of safety-net programs, including cash assistance and health care benefits for the poor.\u201cIt is evident that our child welfare system is broken, impeded by years of structural and operational failures,\u201d said Ms. Brewer, a Republican.The change requires legislative approval, but it is unlikely to face significant opposition, given that it is the type of reorganization that most of her critics had sought. Ms. Brewer did not say how the agency would be funded.The new agency, the Division of Child Safety and Family Services, will handle complaints and investigations of abuse and neglect, which have hit record numbers since the state\u2019s economy crashed in 2009, as well as foster care and adoption.Charles Flanagan, director of the Arizona Department of Juvenile Corrections, will be in charge.

{"Headline": "Industry City, the SoHo of Sunset Park", "Date": "2014-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut perhaps not at Industry City, the century-old industrial complex where the show was held. Beginning several months before the artists Chuck Close and Lola Schnabel posed for photos at the exhibition\u2019s V.I.P. cocktail party, and continuing through the weeks when visitors flocked to the 36th Street train stop to see it, dozens of artists who had studios in Industry City were packing up their oil paints and brushes and leaving. Rents were rising, and many could not afford to stay. \u201cIt was ironic,\u201d said Cara Enteles, a painter who has a studio in the complex. \u201cHere they are hosting this exhibit, and getting all this attention for being friendly to artists, but at the very same time raising rents a huge amount and making it very unaffordable for many of us who had been working there.\u201d As in SoHo, Dumbo and countless other New York neighborhoods, gentrification is coming to Sunset Park. And Industry City, a 30-acre swath along the Brooklyn waterfront, is at the forefront. \u201cWhen you look at a successful industrial renovation that is focused on the innovation economy, artists play a very important role,\u201d said Mr. Kimball, who is the director of innovation economy initiatives at Jamestown and the chief executive at Industry City. \u201cWhat we need to do is blend that with the maker community, with job-generating industries, and this is really our top priority.\u201dJamestown is investing $100 million, initially, to renovate the buildings, which were engulfed by more than 20 million gallons of water during Hurricane Sandy and sustained a reported $50 million in damage. The developer is scrubbing clean the buildings\u2019 facades, shoring up the basements, relocating utilities to the roofs, modernizing the complex\u2019s 144 elevators and replacing, over time, all of its 18,480 windows. Where there were once garbage-lined hallways, there are now well-lit entryways. Murals decorate the lobbies, bathrooms have been installed and a food hall is in the works. Jamestown has begun hosting quarterly tenant mixers as well as large events at its space, Factory Floor, including a temporary furniture show featuring local companies and another for clothing designers. A major focus of Jamestown\u2019s leasing efforts are so-called maker industries, which tend to be more job-intensive. The company is also working with several local nonprofits to match applicants from the surrounding neighborhood with jobs at Industry City. The program is modeled after one that Mr. Kimball put in place at the navy yard. But while Jamestown has been courting companies, artists, who do not typically employ anyone, and who favor work spaces of only a few hundred square feet, say they have had a far different experience. Noah Landfield is a 34-year-old painter who had been at Industry City since shortly after graduating with a Master of Fine Arts from Hunter College in 2009. He was paying $950 a month for an 800-square-foot studio; when his lease expired in November 2012, the landlord told him he would have to move to a new space within the complex. The company showed him alternatives, but they cost as much as double what he was paying, he said. Instead, Mr. Landfield remained at his studio and paid month-to-month for more than a year, until he vacated it at the end of December. \u201cSure, they offered me another space, but it was much smaller and way more expensive,\u201d said Mr. Landfield, who has yet to secure a new studio. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like they were offering me any breaks.\u201dMany of the artists at Industry City ended up there after being chased from other gentrifying neighborhoods, and now they fear that their new refuge is being snatched away.Richard Staub moved to the complex in 2012 after 28 years in Williamsburg. \u201cI feel insecure,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rent in Williamsburg went up 70 percent in two years, and this space was as good as I could get.\u201d He pays $1,144 a month for about 850 square feet; his lease expires next year. Jamestown said it was committed to a diverse roster of tenants. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be monolithic \u2014 we want to see a niche manufacturer next to an artist next to a tech company,\u201d Mr. Kimball said. And some artists, even those who complain of the rising costs, praise their studios and the improvements that have been made. Ms. Enteles, for example, recently renewed her lease for two more years, despite a sizable rent increase. Tom Simon, Ms. Simon\u2019s nephew and the company vice president for product development and marketing, said, \u201cWe have a great, great deal, and the landlord hasn\u2019t failed to remind us of this fact.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The agreement keeps the wholesale market and its 3,000 jobs in the South Bronx until June 2021.

The operators had demanded that the commission relax some of its regulations before they would agree to a lease renewal.But Mr. Slepian said that he decided to drop that demand and that it was not an element of the new agreement.

Maura Clarke and Ita Ford, two Maryknoll nuns, understood that when they went to work among the poor in Central America. The Cold War turned white-hot in El Salvador when they, along with Jean Donovan and Sister Dorothy Kazel, were raped, tortured and murdered by the Salvadoran military on December 2, 1980.Sacrifice demands honor. The four have been memorialized ever since their martyrdom. In the case of Ms. Clarke and Ms. Ford \u2014 daughters of Queens and Brooklyn, respectively \u2014 their names grace a tiny community center started in Bushwick 20 years ago to teach immigrants.Janet Marcic, the center\u2019s director, said small groups like hers, that cannot afford market-rate rents, share a challenge.\u201cA lot of small nonprofit groups are in church space and they\u2019re going to have to find new space,\u201d she said. \u201cThe best thing would be to merge with a larger agency so they can absorb us. We do not have a safety net as a small nonprofit.\u201dStefanie Gutierrez, press secretary for the Diocese of Brooklyn, praised the work being done at the center. She said the diocese is working to find a permanent location for the program, recently offering free space at Most Holy Trinity Parish, which they would have to share with a religious education program.Ms. Marcic did not feel that location was suitable, because she could not secure computers and office equipment in the shared space. She remains hopeful better accommodations can be found to tide them over until they can merge. As she prepares to pack up and close down her education program \u2014 ending the current semester early by a month \u2014 its 150 students and supporters are calling the diocese for answers.The crisis facing the center is not new. Nor is it the fault of any one institution \u2014 Ms. Marcic has been unable to find affordable, secure space at community and youth centers.The 2008 economic downturn resulted in decreased donations and it has become harder to finance the $285,000 yearly budget, as foundations shift priorities or cut back.The organization used to have two locations: Language and citizenship classes were taught inside a former Catholic school in Bushwick while a job center in Bedford-Stuyvesant had women baking cookies sold to parochial schools and sewing clothing samples for designers. The closing of parish schools eliminated demand for the cookies, while the bad economy led fewer designers to their door. Operating at a loss, the group \u2014 which also had to vacate its Bushwick classrooms to make room for a new school \u2014 moved to its current location, even though it would be impossible to resume the job programs.The center is housed in a corner of a building that dates to 1869, when it was the first home of Saint John\u2019s University. Built in a vintage style, it shows its age. To heat the big old building, you might as well burn money, a scarce commodity among the faithful.\u201cGentrification hasn\u2019t made our parish richer,\u201d said the Rev. Emmet Nolan, the pastor. \u201cIt\u2019s just concentrated the poverty in our parish as rents go up and people become poorer.\u201dWhich is why programs like Ms. Marcic\u2019s are vital, though vulnerable. Beginning with language classes and moving on to high school equivalency and citizenship, students find better jobs. They can fend for themselves and find common ground with their children, who are the reason they struggle to get ahead.In a place inspired by sacrifice and memory, Ms. Marcic knows well those twin powers.\u201cWhen the parents learn English, they can help their children,\u201d she explained. \u201cKids are moldable. When they see someone is interested, it stays with them.\u201dHer voice cracked.\u201cMy father only went to seventh grade, but every night he sat down and asked me about my homework. \u2018What\u2019s the Magna Carta?\u2019 He didn\u2019t know, but he made me feel like an honor student.

{"Headline": "Recession\u2019s True Cost Is Still Being Tallied", "Date": "2014-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneOn Sept. 15, 2008, the investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed after a long struggle to avoid bankruptcy, paralyzing the world\u2019s financial networks and tipping the United States economy into an abyss from which it has not yet fully emerged.More than five years later, there is still no answer to perhaps the most critical question raised by the man-made disaster: How much did it all cost?Their analysis \u2014 cautious and tentative, critically dependent on debatable assumptions \u2014 underscores how difficult it is, still, to accurately tally the costs of the most severe economic catastrophe since the Depression of the 1930s into a coherent, conclusive measure of loss.\u201cIt is not difficult to understand why such accounting exercises are rare,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThey require comparing a world in which no financial crisis occurred to what actually happened and what is likely to transpire.\u201dMost strikingly, their examination offers a panoramic view of the variety of ways in which the financial crisis diminished the nation\u2019s standard of living. At a bare minimum the crisis cost nearly $20,000 for each American. Adding in broader impacts on workers\u2019 well-being \u2014 an admittedly speculative exercise \u2014 could raise the price tag to as much as $120,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States. With this kind of money we could pay back the federal debt or pay for a top-notch college education for everyone.The portrait of loss, tentative as it is, suggests that even the most far-reaching measures might be justified to ensure it never happens again. But you wouldn\u2019t know that from the current debate.In December, the American Bankers Association sued to stop a provision of the Volcker Rule, part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, and intended to stop banks from engaging in risky trading on their own account.Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission has taken a legal battering at the hand of business-friendly judges arguing that the agency has not adequately assessed whether the benefits of its rules justify the costs. This has largely stopped the agency\u2019s rule-making.Over all, almost half the rules required by the Dodd-Frank legislation have yet to be written. But the financial industry would love to slow regulation further. \u201cOur goal is to press the pause button on the multitude of regulations and rules, to give the industry time to digest them,\u201d said James Ballentine, executive vice president for congressional relations for the banking association. \u201cThe industry should have an opportunity to determine what is working and what is not.\u201dThe bankers\u2019 points are not necessarily wrong. Regulation does impose costs. Some banking rules and regulations might make loans scarcer or more expensive. Restrictions on banks\u2019 businesses are likely to eat into their profitability.Nonetheless, the legal attack on the new regulation is disingenuous. Increasing the industry\u2019s costs and reducing its profits is an objective of the regulation overhaul, not a bug. The goal is to ensure that banks internalize the costs of their risky business rather than have them borne by the rest of society.Indeed, even if financial regulation imposes broader economic costs, what matters is how they measure up against the benefit of preventing another financial disaster.The position taken by bankers, business-friendly judges and many Republicans in Congress is that every new financial rule must justify its existence based on a narrow monetary tally of costs and benefits. But the approach ignores the far greater benefits promised by the entire regulatory package.To start, the economists at the Dallas Fed modeled how much economic activity would be lost by the time the nation returned to its growth path before the crisis. In their study, they initially assumed that the economy would return to its previous path by 2023, and concluded that the total loss would amount to 40 percent to 90 percent of a year\u2019s worth of economic output. That\u2019s about $6 trillion to $14 trillion in today\u2019s money \u2014 or $19,000 to $45,000 per person.Others have used different methods and come up with similar estimates. Better Markets estimated that the crisis cost $12.8 trillion in lost output. Last year, the Government Accountability Office estimated that the price tag could range from a few trillion dollars to over $10 trillion.But what if the path is not recovered so quickly? So far, the economy has made up little if any of the ground it lost. Perhaps the shock from the crisis slowed the nation\u2019s growth rate for good.Under a more pessimistic assumption, the Dallas Fed economists estimated that the cost could be 65 percent to 165 percent of annual output. The upper limit amounts to about $25 trillion, almost $80,000 per American.But even that might be an underestimate. Using a different method of analysis, the economists also looked at how Americans cut back on purchases of consumer goods. They concluded that the expectations of the lifetime income of working age adults fell by almost $150,000, on average.Most tallies stop there. But that is not because this covers the entire fallout from the crisis. Rather, it is because the rest is even harder to measure.It is impossible to put an accurate dollar sign on these social costs. Still, the economists at the Dallas Fed tried.While all those numbers shouldn\u2019t be taken at face value, the damages potentially add up to a staggering total. Even acknowledging that they are imprecise, speculative proxies of the true costs of our financial mess, they underscore how estimates of loss based solely on lost G.D.P. are far too conservative.The Fed economists refrained from adding up the disparate costs from their analyses \u2014 which could risk double-counting losses. But simply adding the cost from the drop in well-being of the unemployed to the impact on G.D.P. would take the price tag to up to $120,000 a person. And that still leaves out many other measures of loss.Every time you hear about the need to balance the costs of new financial regulations against their benefits, it might do well to think about that.eporter@nytimes.com; \nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Fragile Five\u2019 Is the Latest Club of Emerging Nations in Turmoil", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe long-running boom in emerging markets came to be identified, if not propped up, by wide acceptance of the term BRICs, shorthand for the fast-growing countries Brazil, Russia, India and China. Recent turmoil in these and similar markets has produced a rival expression: the Fragile Five.The new name, as coined by a little-known research analyst at Morgan Stanley last summer, identifies Turkey, Brazil, India, South Africa and Indonesia as economies that have become too dependent on skittish foreign investment to finance their growth ambitions.The term has caught on in large degree because it highlights the strains that occur when countries place too much emphasis on stoking fast rates of economic growth. The new catchphrase also raises pressing questions about not just the BRICs but about emerging markets in general.The Morgan Stanley report came out in August, when there were reports that the Federal Reserve would soon reduce its bond-buying program. The term that report coined became a quick and easy way for investors to give voice to fears of a broader emerging markets rout, propelled by runs on the Turkish lira, Brazilian real and South African rand.These fears were realized this week when Turkey, seen by most investors as the most fragile of the Fragile Five, raised interest rates 4.25 percentage points on Tuesday.The sharper-than-expected increase by the country\u2019s central bank \u2014 which previously took a fairly passive approach to defending its currency \u2014 was intended to persuade foreign investors, as well as corporate and household savers, to hold on to their lira instead of exchanging them for dollars.As with other members of the Fragile Five, Turkey relies heavily on fickle short-term investment from foreigners to finance gaping current account deficits \u2014 the result of which has been a currency that many investors say is overvalued.Investment analysts love to come up with catchy names that simplify their views and, ideally, capture the market spirit of the moment. During the early period of the euro crisis, PIGS, unkindly, came to describe Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain. And when the focus turned to Greece and its future in the euro zone, Grexit became the term of art.Not all of them catch on. In September, Deutsche Bank analysts came up with Biits, which covers the same countries as the Fragile Five, but it graced hardly any analysts\u2019 reports.The countries in the Asian financial crisis of 1997 never got saddled with a nickname. As in that and other emerging market blowups, foreign investors and lenders pulled their money out because of broader concerns about political and economic uncertainty.And while there have been sharp outflows from Turkey and some of the other members of the Fragile Five, broadly speaking, foreign investors have retreated from the asset class as a whole.\u201cI still believe these are the best investment opportunities in the world,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Neill, who acknowledges being irritated at having to defend his thesis every time there is an emerging market wobble.When Mr. O\u2019Neill coined the BRICs phrase, foreign capital inflows into emerging markets were about $190 billion a year, according to data from the Institute of International Finance, the trade group for international banks.His timing could not have been better: The Federal Reserve was moving to a policy of very low interest rates and China\u2019s growth engine was revving up, driving what would become a long-running commodity boom.Yield-starved investors began pouring into Mr. O\u2019Neill\u2019s markets and their economies. Since 2010, annual net inflows into these markets have averaged a little over $1 trillion a year.As a result, Mr. O\u2019Neill became quite the global man about town. He has been celebrated by investors and the BRIC nations themselves, which even formed a BRIC-development bank.All this changed last summer, when the Fed\u2019s announcement that it would eventually reverse its bond-buying program panicked giddy emerging-market investors. Other concerns, like a slowdown of growth in China, political uncertainty in Russia and Turkey and most crucially, vulnerable currencies in Brazil and South Africa, spurred concerns over the possibility of a broader market panic.Turkey, more than any of the others, has been the primary target. Since May, foreign investors have sold, in net terms, $3.9 billion worth of lira-denominated bonds, according to data from the Institute of International Finance, a substantial amount for such a short period.Although Mr. O\u2019Neill, while at Goldman, aggressively marketed his BRICs notion, Mr. Lord and his team at Morgan Stanley have been more circumspect, avoiding for the most part public statements in the news media.In response to questions about his Fragile Five thesis, Mr. Lord, who this year was promoted from vice president to a more senior position, asked that he be quoted playing down his original thesis.\u201cWe have been using the term less and less in our research,\u201d he said, explaining that responses by policy makers in these countries have to some extent addressed the issues he raised.That is not surprising. Banks are always wary of promoting critical investment calls, especially when important, fee-generating nations like Brazil and Turkey are concerned.But more skeptical investors remain less inclined to view currency-stabilizing steps taken by Turkey and other Fragile Five members in such a sanguine light.\u201cPeople made mistakes investing in these markets just because of the headline G.D.P. and demographics,\u201d said Stephen L. Jen, a former economist for the International Monetary Fund who now manages a hedge fund based in London. Important issues like corruption and governance, not to mention excessive lending in urban areas that favored the political and economic elites, have been ignored, he pointed out.\u201cIstanbul does not need 100 malls,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a reason these people are poor.\u201dMr. Jen did make a stab at crafting his own catchphrase and considered adding Russia to transform the Fragile Five into the Sorry Six, before ditching the notion.Better to keep it simple, he said, and steer clear of currencies with four letters: the Mexican peso, the South African rand, the Brazilian real and, of course, the Turkish lira.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In State of the Union Address, Obama Vows to Act Alone on the Economy", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Obama walking onto the House floor before delivering his State of the Union address. During the speech, Mr. Obama pledged to tackle economic disparity with a series of limited initiatives on jobs, wages and retirement that he would take without legislative approval.WASHINGTON \u2014 After five years of fractious political combat, President Obama declared independence from Congress on Tuesday as he vowed to tackle economic disparity with a series of limited initiatives on jobs, wages and retirement that he will enact without legislative approval.Promising \u201ca year of action\u201d as he tries to rejuvenate a presidency mired in low approval ratings and stymied by partisan stalemates, Mr. Obama used his annual State of the Union address to chart a new path forward relying on his own executive authority. But the defiant \u201cwith or without Congress\u201d approach was more assertive than any of the individual policies he advanced.\u201cI\u2019m eager to work with all of you,\u201d a confident Mr. Obama told lawmakers of both parties in the 65-minute nationally televised speech in the House chamber. \u201cBut America does not stand still \u2014 and neither will I. So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201dThe president\u2019s appearance at the Capitol, with all the traditional pomp and anticipation punctuated by partisan standing ovations, came at a critical juncture as Mr. Obama seeks to define his remaining time in office. He touched on foreign policy, asserting that \u201cAmerican diplomacy backed by the threat of force\u201d had forced Syria to give up chemical weapons and that \u201cAmerican diplomacy backed by pressure\u201d had brought Iran to the negotiating table. And he repeated his plan to pull troops out of Afghanistan this year and threatened again to veto sanctions on Iran that disrupt his diplomatic efforts.The most emotional point of the evening came with the introduction of Sgt. First Class Cory Remsburg, an Army Ranger the president had met both before and after he was ravaged by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. As Sergeant Remsburg, blind in one eye and having to learn to walk again, made it to his feet in the first lady\u2019s box, lawmakers of both parties gave him an extended ovation.But Mr. Obama\u2019s message centered on the wide gap between the wealthiest and other Americans as he positioned himself as a champion of those left behind in the modern economy. \u201cThose at the top have never done better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled.\u201cThe cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by, let alone to get ahead,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd too many still aren\u2019t working at all. So our job is to reverse these trends.\u201dTo do so, the president announced an executive order raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for future federal contract workers and the creation of a new Treasury savings bond for workers without access to traditional retirement options. He proposed incentives for trucks running on alternative fuels and higher efficiency standards for those running on gasoline. And he announced a meeting on working families and a review of federal job training programs.Mr. Obama was gambling that a series of ideas that seem small-bore on their own will add up to a larger collective vision of an America with expanded opportunity. But the moderate ambitions were a stark contrast to past years when Mr. Obama proposed sweeping legislation to remake the nation\u2019s health care system, regulate Wall Street, curb climate change and restrict access to high-powered firearms.Republicans responded by blaming Mr. Obama for the country\u2019s economic problems, but the party\u2019s leaders avoided the language of last year\u2019s government shutdown and hoped to present what Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington called \u201ca more hopeful, Republican vision\u201d intended to appeal particularly to women in a midterm election year.In her party\u2019s official response, Ms. Rodgers offered a folksy, personal presentation, describing in moving terms her 6-year-old son, Cole, who was born with Down syndrome, even as she assailed Mr. Obama\u2019s health care program, spending record and regulations. \u201cToo many people are falling further and further behind because, right now, the president\u2019s policies are making people\u2019s lives harder,\u201d she said. \u201cRepublicans have plans to close the gap.\u201dBut in a sign of the continued divisions within the Republican Party, some of its conservative leaders offered separate responses. Senator Mike Lee of Utah delivered a speech on behalf of Tea Party activists, and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky distributed his own remarks on Facebook, YouTube and other social media.Mr. Lee echoed his party message by criticizing Mr. Obama\u2019s policies, declaring that \u201cObamacare, all by itself, is an inequality Godzilla.\u201d But he also noted, \u201cMy own party has been part of the problem, too often joining the Democrats to rig our economy to benefit the well-connected at the expense of the disconnected.\u201dBoth the president and lawmakers brought guests intended to make political points. Among the Republican guests was Willie Robertson, a star of the reality show \u201cDuck Dynasty,\u201d whose father stirred controversy by condemning \u201chomosexual offenders.\u201dOther guests in the first lady\u2019s box with Michelle Obama were Americans who have benefited from the president\u2019s health care program and, in a jab at Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, Gov. Steve Beshear, who has energetically carried out the program in their home state, Kentucky.The response of members at points in the speech may have offered signals of the year to come. When Mr. Obama urged Congress to \u201cfix our broken immigration system,\u201d Speaker John A. Boehner and other Republicans applauded, foreshadowing an effort to find a bipartisan compromise. When Mr. Obama boasted that he had \u201crolled parts of\u201d Iran\u2019s nuclear program back, there was no applause, amid bipartisan skepticism of diplomacy with Tehran.Despite his vow to move ahead without Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama said he was not giving up on Congress altogether and recycled calls for many past legislative priorities, like extending unemployment insurance. \u201cLet\u2019s see where else we can make progress together,\u201d he said.He said \u201cthis needs to be the year\u201d that lawmakers clear the way to closing the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. He called for an across-the-board increase in the minimum wage to $10.10 from $7.25. \u201cSay yes,\u201d he urged. \u201cGive America a raise.\u201d He called for expanding the earned-income tax credit for low-wage workers without children.And he offered a vigorous defense of his embattled health care program. \u201cLet\u2019s not have another 40-something votes to repeal a law that\u2019s already helping Americans,\u201d he said.But after a year in which most of his legislative priorities, like gun control, went nowhere, Mr. Obama has made it clear that he has restrained expectations about his ability to compromise with Republicans in the House. Mr. Obama\u2019s minimum wage plan provided an example of the new approach he plans. Since he failed to push through legislation last year, he decided to issue his order covering federal contractors.Still, the order also illustrated the limits of that approach. An increase in the minimum wage passed by Congress would mean a raise for 17 million Americans. Mr. Obama\u2019s executive order, by contrast, will affect relatively few workers at first because it will apply only to new or renewed contracts. Eventually it might affect several hundred thousand workers at most, according to some estimates.By the numbers, Mr. Obama has so far been restrained in his use of executive power. He has signed just 168 executive orders, and the 147 he issued in his first term were the fewest of any president over a similar period going back at least a century. In their first terms, George W. Bush signed 173 executive orders, Bill Clinton 200 and Ronald Reagan 213.But the numbers matter less than the scope of the ones that are signed. Mr. Obama has unilaterally deferred deportation of younger illegal immigrants, delayed enforcement of his health care law and declined to defend legal challenges against the Defense of Marriage Act, a law barring federal recognition of same-sex marriages.Perhaps the most far-reaching are regulations being developed to limit carbon emissions at the nation\u2019s power plants.Two picture credits on Wednesday with the continuation of an article about President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address were reversed in some editions.

{"Headline": "Federal Contracts Plunge, Squeezing Private Companies", "Date": "2014-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe big business of Washington \u2014 federal contract work \u2014 is losing some steam. After spiraling higher for much of the last decade, the value of federal contracts awarded to companies is falling rapidly.In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the total fell by $58 billion, or roughly 11 percent. It was the steepest decline \u2014 in percentage and nominal terms \u2014 in at least a decade, according to an analysis of federal contract data by The New York Times. The federal government is still awarding hundreds of billions of dollars in contracts. For the 2013 fiscal year, the total was $460 billion. On Wednesday, the House approved a $1.1 trillion spending bill for the current fiscal year, which would include a sizable amount of contracts. But for many businesses \u2014 particularly small ones used to lucrative contract work \u2014 the trend is worrying. Even for major corporations like Boeing, the cost of Washington\u2019s budget battles is coming into sharp focus. Few expect contract work to rise broadly in 2014 and many expect the decline to continue, given the politics of the budget. Small-business owners like Lisa Harris, who runs an environmental consulting firm in Tucson, are feeling the reductions most acutely. As federal contracts have slowed, Ms. Harris said, she has let go half of her 35 workers. The rest have had to take brief furloughs. \u201cI am down to the bare bones,\u201d she said. The latest decline largely reflects cuts in military spending related to Iraq and Afghanistan, and efforts to squeeze the budget with voluntary cuts and the broad reductions known as sequestration. Contract spending had been declining since President Obama took office, but not as sharply. The decline during the Obama administration contrasts with the administration of President George W. Bush, when contracts more than doubled after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.Contracts at the Defense Department fell most last year. The Pentagon awarded about $308 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2013. That was about $54 billion less than in the 2012 fiscal year. Though contracting figures can fluctuate after the government makes awards, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, which oversees contracting, confirmed that no significant changes were expected.Joseph G. Jordan, who will resign as administrator of the office on Friday for a job in the private sector, attributed some of the decline to agencies employing \u201csmarter, strategic buying techniques.\u201d The procurement office is trying to ensure that cost-saving measures, such as bulk purchasing, become part of the normal contracting process, he said.But Daniel I. Gordon, who led the office during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, said reduced government spending could hold back the nation\u2019s fragile economy. He predicted that federal spending would continue to decline in coming years. \u201cThis is the new reality,\u201d said Mr. Gordon, who is associate dean for government procurement law studies at the George Washington University Law School. \u201cIn 2014, you could see another drop of 10 percent.\u201dLike Ms. Harris in Tucson, Heather Cotter said the decline has been trying for her Washington consulting firm, which focuses on public safety. She began working with federal agencies in 2009. Initially, the money was good. \u201cThe first two years were pretty rock \u2019n\u2019 roll,\u201d Ms. Cotter said. Roughly 90 percent of her small firm\u2019s revenue came from federal contracts, she said. Then the work dried up. Last year, she changed her business model and began focusing on web seminars, mostly for local law enforcement. Federal contracts now account for a fifth of her business. Eric DeMarco, chief executive of Kratos Defense and Security Solutions, which produces electronics, and satellite and other security products, saw his company\u2019s contracts fall last year. \u201cOur commercial business went up, thank God,\u201d Mr. DeMarco said.He said the thinning of the budget will ultimately be good for Kratos, which is based in San Diego and derives more than half of its $1 billion in revenue from the government. Agencies, he said, will favor firms that can deliver innovative products for reduced prices.\u201cIt\u2019s giving us a shot that we didn\u2019t have before,\u201d Mr. DeMarco said. \u201cI\u2019m going to figure out how to deliver that widget for $20. There is some good here, as well as pain.\u201dMajor corporations are feeling the pinch, too. Boeing and Raytheon, two of the largest recipients of federal contracts, had declining awards last year. \u201cI caution against drawing too broad of a conclusion from year-over-year data,\u201d said Todd Blecher, of Boeing. \u201cThere\u2019s a regular ebb and flow to government contracting that can cause what otherwise would be notable fluctuations in annual data.\u201d A Raytheon spokesman declined to comment.But Lockheed Martin, the top recipient of federal contracts, won about $43 billion last year, an increase from $35 billion the previous year. While small businesses received about 18 percent of federal contracts in the last two years, total dollars awarded to the companies tumbled to $83 billion from about $90 billion. The total impact on small businesses is difficult to determine because many rely on subcontracts from large companies, which are hard to track. As large companies feel squeezed, they may be less likely to dole out jobs to smaller suppliers, or the work may become too competitive for little companies to survive. Kathryn Waldron, who owns KAU Inc., a general contracting company in Fredericksburg, Va., said dozens of contractors often vie for work that pays relatively little. And some are submitting bids that seem impossibly low. \u201cThere is no point in doing a project if you are not going to make any money,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Traveling While Black", "Date": "2014-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPersonal JourneysAs I walked through the Forbidden City, the majestic imperial palace at the center of Beijing, with a friend and her teenager, I scanned the crowd. In the maze of shrines and courtyards, there was no one quite like us: I am an African-American with long dreadlocks, and my friend, Maria, a Mexican-American, had her half-Dominican son in tow. And yet, we were nearly invisible \u2014 at least to the guards checking the bags of Chinese tourists, possibly for materials that could be used in protests at this landmark, which adjoins Tiananmen Square. We passed through checkpoint after checkpoint unhindered, while Chinese people were stopped and their bags searched. Sure, we got a couple of stares from people. But no one touched our hair, pointed or acted hostile \u2014 which has happened to me as a tourist even in the United States. Once again, my travels had taken me to a place \u2014 not just a physical but a mental place \u2014 where the rules as I knew them had changed. That is partly what drives my wanderlust. And I am part of a sizable fellowship of African-Americans on a mission to see the world. Seventeen percent of African-Americans take one or more international trips a year, and we spend $48 billion on travel in the United States alone, according to the Mandala Research firm. That amount may be smaller than spending by other (not mutually exclusive) niche groups like LGBT travelers ($70 billion). But, according to analysts at MMGY Global, a marketing firm, black travel has rebounded since 2008, which is notable considering that the great recession doubled the gap between black and white wealth. When you look at per capita income, our travel spending is significant. Yet for all of that buying power, major hospitality companies and tour operators often steer clear of targeting African-Americans. After all, it\u2019s complicated. Hoteliers are promoting women-only floors, but that idea would be anathema to black travelers, who are concerned about getting equal and respectful treatment from staff members. Similarly, tour operators pushing gay-friendly getaways would not be wise to advertise trips as \u201cblack-friendly.\u201d We are a niche that it seems shouldn\u2019t exist in a country that aspires to be postracial. As a result, minority travelers are mainly paving our own path, guided by ourselves, our social and professional networks and by bloggers. We are a largely untapped market, exploring the world without being aggressively sold an itinerary on how to do it. That means there are few guidebooks or tour operators to prepare me for the moment of surprise that I experienced in the Forbidden City. And it is one of the reasons that travel right now feels more freeing than ever. For African-Americans, domestic and international exploration used to be filled with significant roadblocks. From the late 19th century until the civil rights era, the lack of parity in pay left African-Americans with little to spend on leisure (a disparity that continues to this day); segregation meant substandard seats and service on public transportation; and finding lodging on the road if you were black, in particular, was a challenge, especially in the South. \u201cThe Negro Traveler\u2019s Green Book\u201d was published from 1936 until 1964 to give black travelers a list of places where it was safe to stay and to stop. Published by a postal worker named Victor H. Green, the book was used by thousands of African-Americans as they crisscrossed the United States by car. Green optimistically wrote in one edition: \u201cThere will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published. That is when we as a race will have equal opportunities and privileges in the United States.\u201d As part of the generation that came after Green\u2019s last edition, I was raised to believe that the world was mine by my Zimbabwean father and my African-American mother, a Baltimore native who headed off to Morocco to serve in the Peace Corps. When I was 5, I traveled with my mother and younger sister to visit my father\u2019s family in what was then apartheid-like Rhodesia. I remember meeting my grandparents and scores of cousins, many of whom did not speak English, and sitting with the family at sunset, eating chewy maize roasted over the fire. It was the first time I felt a specific comforting heart-song, repeated over the years in places like the outdoor terrace cafe of the Louvre in Paris to the top of Mount Tamalpais in Northern California. That feeling can take on particular meaning because it disrupts double-consciousness \u2014 the term coined by W. E. B. DuBois to explain the necessity of African-Americans to constantly regard themselves through others\u2019 eyes. As a black traveler, I seek liberation through exploration and find myself seeming freer, at least in mind and heart, on the road than at home. Many others feel that way, too. \u201cTravel is the music of my soul,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cThe biggest surprise about traveling internationally was to discover that in many parts of the world, it is an asset to be a black woman, unlike in North America, where it is often a liability. Travel to Africa is among the most healing of all. You go there and get part of your soul back.\u201dThere are other, more practical benefits particular to black travelers, like the ability to blend in. Brian Keith Jackson, a novelist who sometimes contributes text and film to the work of the artist Kehinde Wiley, has lived in Beijing, far from his northern Louisiana roots. \u201cIn many places, because most of the Western world has been white and has projected their images as white, black skin means Africa, not America,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m an American, people don\u2019t view me as an American.\u201d Mr. Jackson, who has short-cropped hair, believes that his pecan skin tone, and the perceptions around it, \u201chelped me in my travels, because everyone thinks I\u2019m from there, certainly in Sri Lanka.\u201dBrown skin that\u2019s often perceived as \u201cotherness\u201d in parts of America is not seen that way in much of the world. After traveling to more than 25 countries (and 48 of the states), I call being brown in a region of brown-skinned people \u201cmasking.\u201d I experienced it in southern India, where many people were similar shades of brown as me or darker. I was not mistaken for being a local, but I could circulate less conspicuously than fair-skinned visitors. I took advantage of my skin color (and some common-sense cultural and street smarts, like dressing modestly, showing no valuables and staying alert) to go solo and explore low-income areas of Mumbai that the guards at my luxury hotel had warned me against visiting. My reward: I was invited to lunch at the home of a family, where an older couple and their son and daughter-in-law shared a two-room house. That isn\u2019t to say that the experience of traveling while black is one high note after the other. There are bias attacks on blacks in the United States and abroad. Last year, for example, the United States State Department issued an advisory, still in effect, about Greece warning that \u201cthere has been a rise in unprovoked harassment and violent attacks against persons who, because of their complexion, are perceived to be foreign migrants. U.S. citizens most at risk are those of African, Asian, Hispanic, or Middle Eastern descent.\u201d And there are high-profile but low-danger incidents, as when Oprah Winfrey was denied a look at a $38,000 purse in Switzerland \u2014 \u201ctoo expensive,\u201d the billionaire said a sales assistant told her. (Of course, not many of us, black or white, are in that league.) That may be why travel patterns are still very much shaped by race. According to Mandala, African-Americans are most likely to visit Florida and Georgia. African-Americans and Latinos are more likely than the general American population to seek our historic attractions; three-quarters of African-American leisure travelers say it\u2019s a critical factor in their choices. Group travel is twice as popular among African-Americans than whites, according to Charlie Presley, the founder of the African-American Travel Conference, perhaps pointing to a sense of security in numbers as well as the proliferation of black interest clubs and professional groups. These clubs help drive black tourism, exposing us to new destinations. Ms. Lee, for example, said that when she made a rare trip to Utah (which is less than 2 percent African-American) with the National Black Ski Association (a.k.a. National Brotherhood of Skiers), \u201cI was pleasantly surprised by the Utahans\u2019 friendly reception of our color-full group. The N.B.S. members typically boost local economies to the tune of $3 million during their weeklong summits.\u201d The couple blogs about African-American culture and community throughout the country as well as the pleasures of being outdoors. They\u2019ve since taken scores of friends and family members into the woods, and created a wide circle of explorers via their own trips and their blog.Plenty rely on advice from bloggers like the Rocks, Ms. Lee and Mr. Gross. But often, the circle of explorers on the road grows organically, without any digital intervention, the way it always has. Beandrea July, an artist based in Washington, found that as she traveled in Kauai in 2008, the road opened before her. \u201cI forced my introvert self to go to the farmers\u2019 market around the corner and chat with some people. In so doing I scored an invitation and a ride that night to a barbecue on a fruit farm.\u201d She met another black American on a bus, and the two women traveled throughout the Hawaiian island. \u201cWhile eating dinner one day, this black guy walked by, and we all looked at each other,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout an hour later he was taking us out in his kayaks for a tour. This trip was all about abundance, and asking and receiving.\u201d For those of us blacks who travel \u2014 domestically or internationally, with financial ease or by saving for years \u2014 the world can be our playground, our teacher, our beloved. We just have to remember one thing I was lucky enough to learn as a child, and one that I was reminded of in Beijing that fall day. This world can be our place, too.Farai Chideya is an author, broadcaster, and journalism professor at New York University. She blogs at Farai.com.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kerry Quietly Makes Priority of Climate Pact", "Date": "2014-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As a young naval officer in Vietnam, John Kerry commanded a Swift boat up the dangerous rivers of the Mekong Delta. But when he returned there last month as secretary of state for the first time since 1969, he spoke not of past firefights but of climate change.\u201cDecades ago, on these very waters, I was one of many who witnessed the difficult period in our shared history,\u201d Mr. Kerry told students gathered on the banks of the Cai Nuoc River. He drew a connection from the Mekong Delta\u2019s troubled past to its imperiled future. \u201cThis is one of the two or three most potentially impacted areas in the world with respect to the effects of climate change,\u201d he said.In his first year as secretary of state, Mr. Kerry joined with the Russians to push Syria to turn over its chemical weapons, persuaded the Israelis and Palestinians to resume direct peace talks, and played the closing role in the interim nuclear agreement with Iran. But while the public\u2019s attention has been on his diplomacy in the Middle East, behind the scenes at the State Department Mr. Kerry has initiated a systematic, top-down push to create an agencywide focus on global warming.His goal is to become the lead broker of a global climate treaty in 2015 that will commit the United States and other nations to historic reductions in fossil fuel pollution.\u201cHe\u2019s had a lot of passion, but I don\u2019t think you can conclude he\u2019s had any success,\u201d said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has worked on climate legislation with Mr. Kerry in the past.Yet climate experts point to one significant, recent accomplishment. As a result of midlevel talks Mr. Kerry set up to pave the way for a 2015 deal, the United States and China agreed in September to jointly phase down production of hydrofluorocarbons, greenhouse gases used in refrigerators and air-conditioners.\u201cHe\u2019s pushing to get climate to be the thing that drives the U.S. relationship with China,\u201d said Timothy E. Wirth, a former Democratic senator from Colorado who now works on climate change issues with the United Nations Foundation.For decades, the world has been skeptical of American efforts to push a climate change treaty, given the lack of action in Congress. But Mr. Obama has given Mr. Kerry\u2019s efforts some help. In September, the Environmental Protection Agency began issuing regulations forcing cuts in carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.The rules, which can be enacted without Congress, have effectively frozen construction of new coal-fired plants and could eventually shutter existing ones. Republicans criticize the rules as a \u201cwar on coal,\u201d but abroad they are viewed as a sign that the United States is now serious about acting on global warming.Shortly after Mr. Kerry was sworn in last February, he issued a directive that all meetings between senior American diplomats and top foreign officials include a discussion of climate change. He put top climate policy specialists on his State Department personal staff. And he is pursuing smaller climate deals in forums like the Group of 20, the countries that make up the world\u2019s largest economies.But Mr. Kerry\u2019s ambitious agenda faces enormous obstacles.Not only must he handle difficult negotiations with China \u2014 the world\u2019s largest emitter of greenhouse gases \u2014 for the 2015 treaty, but the pact must be ratified by a Senate that has a long record of rejecting climate change legislation. \u201cIn all candor, I don\u2019t care where he is, nothing is going to happen in the Senate for a long time,\u201d Mr. McCain said.The effort is complicated by the fight over the Keystone XL pipeline, which, if approved by the State Department and Mr. Obama, would bring carbon-heavy tar sands oil from the Canadian province of Alberta to refineries on the Gulf Coast \u2014 and infuriate environmentalists. Approval of the pipeline could blacken Mr. Kerry\u2019s green credentials and hurt his ability to get a broader climate deal.Mr. Kerry is nonetheless forging ahead. \u201cOne of the reasons the president was attracted to Kerry was that we were going to make climate change a legacy issue in the second term,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the White House deputy national security adviser.In the 1980s and 1990s, Mr. Kerry worked closely with Mr. Gore, then a senator from Tennessee, on climate change policy on Capitol Hill. In 1992, Mr. Kerry attended the first United Nations climate change summit meeting, in Rio de Janeiro, where he kindled a connection with Teresa Heinz, who attended with a delegation representing the elder President George Bush.Married three years later, the couple went on to write a 2007 book together, \u201cThis Moment on Earth: Today\u2019s New Environmentalists and Their Vision for the Future.\u201d By that time Mr. Kerry had run for president and lost, and then was one of the founders of a think tank, the American Security Project, that defined climate change as a national security threat.After Mr. Obama was elected president in 2008, Mr. Kerry and his wife began holding salons in their Georgetown home focused on climate policy, with guests like John P. Holdren, the new president\u2019s science adviser. By 2009, Mr. Kerry had joined Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, to push an ambitious climate change bill.At the Copenhagen climate summit meeting in December 2009, Mr. Obama promised the world that the Senate would soon pass that bill \u2014 but a few months later, Mr. Kerry\u2019s legislation fell apart. Since then prospects for global warming legislation on Capitol Hill have been poor.Now, Mr. Kerry hopes to use his position as secretary of state to achieve a legacy on global warming that has long eluded him.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of scar tissue from the U.S. saying it will do stuff\u201d on climate change and not following through, said Mr. Schmidt of the Natural Resources Defense Council. But he said Mr. Kerry\u2019s push abroad and Mr. Obama\u2019s actions at home were changing expectations among other nations.\u201cThey\u2019re still waiting to see what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said, \u201cbut the skepticism is much thinner than it was a few months back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egyptians Vote on New Constitution in Referendum", "Date": "2014-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 Egyptians trundled to the polls on Tuesday for the third referendum in three years to approve a new constitution, this time to validate the military ouster of their first fairly elected president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood.The level of turnout will be the most closely watched measure of success for the plebiscite, widely viewed as the presidential campaign kickoff of Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, the military leader who removed Mr. Morsi.Almost everyone expects those who do vote to support the charter in a landslide, and at several polling places Tuesday many voters expected a nearly unanimous result.\u201cWhat? Everybody is voting yes to the constitution!\u201d one man leaving a polling place exclaimed when he mistakenly thought he had overheard another voter say he had cast his ballot against it.\u201cNo, I meant I voted against the last one,\u201d that voter, Sami Hadid, 73, clarified, referring to the constitution drafted by an Islamist-led assembly and approved in the previous referendum a little more than one year ago.The debate over the charter has been one-sided, to say the least. The Brotherhood, the Islamist group that dominated Egypt\u2019s free elections and now constitutes the main opposition, is boycotting the vote as an attempt to legitimize an illegal coup. The government has declared the Brotherhood a terrorist organization, jailed its leaders, seized its assets and criminalized membership. It has shut down all sympathetic Egyptian media outlets and arrested activists for even trying to hang signs or place stickers opposing the new charter.At least seven members of Strong Egypt, a moderate Islamist party, have been arrested for trying to hang posters against the charter, moving the party to boycott the vote rather than face more arrests. Two more women were arrested Tuesday for trying to put up opposition signs, state media reported.By Tuesday afternoon, a small bomb had gone off near a court building in the Imbaba neighborhood of Giza, across the river from Cairo, damaging a court building but injuring no one. By nightfall, the Ministry of Health said eight people had died in violence connected to the voting. The Muslim Brotherhood said at least four of the dead were civilians, including a child, killed by the police, while the Interior Ministry said those four had been killed by members of the Muslim Brotherhood trying to disrupt the vote. Dozens of other Egyptians alleged to be members of the Brotherhood were arrested during the day.On the other side, state-run and private television networks, controlled by a small elite hostile to the Islamists, sing hymns to the constitution with a single voice. And on Tuesday the streets were crowded with banners saying, \u201cCome down and vote,\u201d \u201cYou will be judged on your vote\u201d and \u201cVote yes to the constitution and no to terrorism.\u201dSome said the silencing of public dissent exceeded even the ritualistic plebiscites that punctuated the 30-year rule of Hosni Mubarak, the former president.\u201cThis time it has surpassed Mubarak at the height of his authoritarianism,\u201d said Hossam Bahgat, founder of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, an independent civil liberties organization.For virtually the first time since a 1989 one-candidate vote granting Mr. Mubarak a fourth term, Mr. Bahgat said he planned to sit out the vote. \u201cLike most Egyptians, I guess that I am indifferent,\u201d he said.About a third of the electorate turned out to vote on the last charter, which passed by a ratio of about two to one nationwide but was rejected by a majority in Cairo. The referendum had followed a noisy debate in which anti-Islamist politicians, judges, diplomats and most of the privately owned media attacked it for opening a door to future religious restrictions on individual liberties.The new charter retains the main clause of the current one, stipulating that the principles of Islamic law are the wellspring of Egyptian jurisprudence. It removes a more controversial clause that had sought to constrain the way judges interpreted those principles, defining them according to the broad outlines of mainstream Sunni Muslim scholarship.Even though the Muslim Brotherhood opposes the charter, the ultraconservative Islamist party Al Nour is still supporting it, accepting its fidelity to Islamic law.Egypt\u2019s three-year experiment with democracy has ousted Hosni Mubarak and deposed Mohamed Morsi, the country\u2019s first elected leader. Explore key moments of their rule and the aftermath.The biggest revisions, though, increase the power and autonomy of the military, the police and the judiciary \u2014 the three branches of the old Egyptian bureaucracy that played the biggest roles in Mr. Morsi\u2019s overthrow.For those who did vote Tuesday, the referendum had the feeling of a martial pageant. Soldiers and police officers surrounded every polling place, and at some of them voters paused to have their pictures taken with officers.\u201cIt is all for the love of our country and the love of Sisi!\u201d crowed Nadia Sayed, 64, sitting with a group of female friends across the street from a polling place in the Nasr City neighborhood of Cairo after voting. \u201cHe will do everything good for our grandchildren,\u201d she said, before the women broke into ululation and the pop song \u201cBless the Hands,\u201d which celebrates the army and the police for removing Mr. Morsi.Even in neighborhoods that had been considered Islamist strongholds \u2014 from the slums of Imbaba to middle-class Nasr City \u2014 it seemed impossible to find a voter who said he or she had voted against the charter, although soldiers and police officers tried to keep a close watch on journalists conducting interviews.Almost everyone brought up the Brotherhood, volunteering that they had voted for the new constitution mainly to oppose the group, which won successive elections but failed to control the Egyptian bureaucracy, revive the economy or calm the streets.\u201cMay God avenge us!\u201d one voter leaving a polling place in Nasr City shouted to journalists. \u201cThey made us suffer for the last three years!\u201dGamal Abdel Tawab, 55, a physician in Imbaba, said he had voted for the new constitution \u201cbecause I love my country, I love my army, and I hate the Muslim Brotherhood.\u201dNext, he said, he looks forward to voting for a new president: General Sisi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "States Cutting Weeks of Aid to the Jobless", "Date": "2014-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIEGELWOOD, N.C. \u2014 After losing her job as a security guard in June, Alnetta McKnight turned to food stamps and unemployment insurance to support herself and her 14-year-old son. But her jobless payments ran out after 20 weeks, and now they are living on close to nothing.\u201cI worked for 26 years; I lost my job through no fault of my own,\u201d Ms. McKnight said, sitting in her darkened living room \u2014 she keeps the lights off to save money \u2014 in this small town about 20 miles from Wilmington, N.C. \u201cThis is what I get?\u201dHad Ms. McKnight been laid off a year earlier, she almost certainly would have qualified for more than a year of unemployment insurance payments, helping keep her family out of penury while she sought another position. But last July, North Carolina sharply cut its unemployment program, reducing the maximum number of weeks of benefits to 20 from 73 and reducing the maximum weekly benefit as well.The rest of the country is now following North Carolina\u2019s lead. A federal program supplying extra weeks of benefits to the long-term unemployed expired at the end of 2013, and congressional Democrats failed in an effort to revive it. About 1.3 million jobless workers received their last payment on Dec. 28. Starting on Jan. 1, the maximum period of unemployment payments dropped to 26 weeks in most states, down from as much as 73 weeks.With that move, the country\u2019s safety net for jobless workers has undergone a sudden transformation, from one aimed at providing modest but sustained protection to workers weathering a tough labor market to one intended to give relatively short-term aid before spurring workers to accept a job, any job.It is still early, but the results in North Carolina suggest that there are both gains and losses from cutting back on support for the jobless. The state\u2019s unemployment rate has plummeted to 7.4 percent from 8.8 percent, the sharpest drop in the country. In part, that is because more jobless workers are connecting with work. But an even greater number of workers have simply given up on finding a job.North Carolina\u2019s move also highlights a sharp political divide that is now playing out on the national stage. In Washington, Democrats are making an election-year charge that Republicans are pulling the safety net from under struggling families at a time when the economy remains weak and is operating far below its potential.\u201cNorth Carolina still has a higher-than-average unemployment rate, so this is important to this state,\u201d President Obama said last week as he unveiled plans for a new manufacturing research center in Raleigh. \u201cFolks aren\u2019t looking for a handout. They\u2019re not looking for special treatment. There are a lot of people who are sending out r\u00e9sum\u00e9s every single day, but the job market is still tough.\u201dRepublicans, in response, say that Democrats have done nothing but make unemployment and poverty more comfortable, while overseeing scant job growth. They argue that what they see as overly generous government support only encourages dependency and that a thinner safety net would actually be more effective, pointing to North Carolina\u2019s falling jobless rate as prime evidence.\u201cEmployers were telling me they had vacant jobs, but people would say, \u2018Hold that job until my unemployment benefits end.' \u201d said Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican who is the prime mover behind the policy. \u201cI heard that time and time again. Now, employers are telling us that people are coming in and filling out applications to accept jobs, not to meet the requirements of unemployment.\u201dNonpartisan economists said it was difficult to definitively show the impact of the change to the unemployment insurance program on the state\u2019s labor market. Employment increased from June through November by more than 22,000 people (reaching a total of over 4.3 million). But for every worker who found a job, more than two dropped out of the labor force entirely, according to the latest survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which recorded a decline of over 50,000 from June through November.It is hard to separate the effects of the unemployment cutbacks from overall changes in the regional and national economy.\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough data to know what is happening for sure,\u201d said Mark Vitner, who studies the regional economy for Wells Fargo.He said it was clear, though, that some of the unemployed were prodded back to work. \u201cIf someone had been receiving unemployment benefits for a long enough time, odds are they exhausted their savings, and they\u2019re probably going to go ahead and take a job they wouldn\u2019t have been taking previously,\u201d he said.But statistics don\u2019t tell the full story. North Carolina still has nearly 350,000 listed as officially unemployed, and many more, including those living in depressed rural areas, have given up even looking for a job. For them, the safety net is gone, and largely out of sight, countless families have slipped deeper into poverty.That includes Ms. McKnight\u2019s. She still applies for jobs every day, and is hoping to be retrained as a certified nurse\u2019s assistant. But in the meantime, she has sold her son\u2019s dirt bike. She has stopped sending money to her mother, who has cancer, or to her daughter in college. A friend sold a set of decorative car rims to help her pay her electric bill. She has started visiting a local food bank for groceries.\u201cTwo interviews so far out of 150 applications,\u201d Ms. McKnight said. \u201cIf unemployment were for a year or a year and a half, that\u2019s enough time to get established and get a job. Now, it\u2019s over before it starts. That\u2019s not enough time to find a job in an economy as bad as it is.\u201dEven conservative proponents of the North Carolina policy said there were downsides along with the upsides: Many jobless workers are accepting jobs for far less pay than they made before, and in many communities, there are simply not enough jobs.\u201cWe anticipated that in more urban areas, and with younger workers, there would be a bigger impact,\u201d Governor McCrory said, pointing to improvements in the state\u2019s major cities. By contrast, he said, rural areas might be hardest hit, and job retraining and economic development initiatives were what those areas needed.For now, that is little consolation for those who have lost a critical lifeline. \u201cOur economies have been deconstructed,\u201d said the Rev. Mac Legerton, the executive director of the Center for Community Action, a nonprofit in nearby Lumberton, one of the poorest communities in the state.\u201cWe\u2019re having to build new economies, which takes a significantly long period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe assistance from extended unemployment benefits really provides one of the very few support systems for people who\u2019ve been impacted by decisions far beyond their control.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Dominance Faces a Challenge in a FIFA Bid", "Date": "2014-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byZURICH \u2014 J\u00e9r\u00f4me Champagne has spent most of his career in soccer behind the scenes, quietly operating in the shadows with little fanfare or credit. But on Monday, Champagne, a Frenchman who once served as FIFA\u2019s deputy general secretary, is set to become front-page news in Switzerland and beyond.At a news conference in London, Champagne plans to announce his candidacy for the presidency of FIFA, soccer\u2019s global governing body. That would be the first open challenge to FIFA\u2019s longtime president, Sepp Blatter. Champagne also will unveil several initiatives that he contends would boldly reshape and democratize soccer\u2019s governing body.\u201cI won\u2019t say that if I am elected, I would not face any hurdles; I would face a lot of hurdles,\u201d Champagne said of the intense spotlight that comes with the job, and sometimes merely the pursuit of it. \u201cBut it is a privilege to run for president,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is not a job. It is a mission.\u201d On Monday, Champagne is set to become the only candidate who has officially announced his intention to run. A former soccer journalist and French diplomat, he joined FIFA after the 1994 World Cup and later became Blatter\u2019s political adviser and right-hand man. He was fired in 2010 after trying to push through changes that upset powerful members of FIFA\u2019s executive committee and has since served as a consultant to soccer organizations in a number of countries. He is proposing an agenda that, he said, would democratize FIFA and redistribute some of the huge sums of money being made in the European leagues and competitions to the world\u2019s poorer federations. Champagne\u2019s proposals include a tax on the wealthiest leagues to set up a fund to help soccer development around the world. \u201cThe role of FIFA in the economy of football is a mix of Robin Hood and the sheriff of Nottingham,\u201d Champagne said. \u201cWhen a competition becomes very successful internationally, it takes a lot of money away from the local leagues.\u201d He said he wanted to see Asia, Africa, and North America better represented in the game, with more seats on FIFA\u2019s executive committee and more places at the World Cup finals. \u201cLook at how football is progressing in North America; it should have four slots at the World Cup,\u201d he said (Concacaf has three or four slots). He added that Africa should have six rather than its current five places. Those places are very likely to come at the expense of European teams, which have long had the most. Europe receives 13 World Cup berths in the 32-team field. That will probably cost Champagne votes, but he is no doubt counting on picking up more by giving the many smaller federations a bigger voice.For Champagne, the biggest problem facing the global game is inequality. Match fixing, racism and the trafficking of young players, he contends, all have roots in the failure of the game to redistribute its money fairly. \u201cDo we want the N.B.A.-ification of football?\u201d he said, adding that in theory, FIBA, basketball\u2019s equivalent of FIFA, \u201cis above the N.B.A. But we all know that isn\u2019t the case. \u201cDo we want an increasingly narrow game, where a tiny number of teams in the Champions League share all the money? FIFA is the only organization that can balance this out.\u201dHis manifesto of redistribution is certain to prove unpopular with Platini and UEFA, which runs the world\u2019s richest soccer competition, the UEFA Champions League, a tournament among top clubs from across Europe. But despite Champagne\u2019s status as a largely unknown candidate outside FIFA, his connections in the game and his proposals to transfer power from the executive committee to the federations could help him win votes. It is FIFA\u2019s 209-member congress, not the executive committee, that decides on the president, on a principle of one member, one vote. It is the same political calculus that Blatter used to win the presidency, and the one that has allowed him to keep it. Champagne\u2019s immediate challenge is to secure the support of five member associations, a nominating requirement to enter the presidential race. He said he was confident that he had them, but his time in FIFA made him understandably wary to name them.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say who the five are; otherwise, they will be pressurized into not backing me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put them in that position.\u201d\u201cThis election is so important,\u201d Champagne said. \u201cIt is about the future of soccer and what the game will look like in 2030.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York, the Silicon City", "Date": "2014-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorFOR all the talk of New York\u2019s \u201ctale of two cities\u201d economic divide, last week Mayor Bill de Blasio took charge of a local economy that has far outperformed the rest of the country since the financial collapse \u2014 and not just in a small corner of Manhattan, but across the city. Driven by the expansion of the technology and information sector, New York City today has more private-sector jobs than during the 2007-8 peak of the finance-driven boom years. New York has, over the last decade, become a tech city to rival San Francisco, Boston and Seattle. And it has done so by moving away from its old reliance on the finance and legal sectors, and the industries like hospitality that rely on them. The challenge for Mr. de Blasio is continuing that trend, and making sure all New Yorkers benefit from it.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, can justifiably boast about New York\u2019s rise to prominence as a \u201cdigital city.\u201d On his watch, the technology and information sector has become the city\u2019s second-most-powerful economic engine, after financial services. New York now has 10 percent of the country\u2019s jobs in the \u201cInternet publishing and web search portal\u201d industry, up from just over 6 percent in 2007. Surprisingly, over the past couple of years, the city\u2019s minority populations have been among the main beneficiaries of this boom. Since 2010, the number of blacks working in computer and mathematical occupations \u2014 the Census Bureau\u2019s term for tech-related jobs \u2014 in the city has risen by 19.7 percent, based on a preliminary analysis of new census data. Over the same stretch, the number of Hispanics in such occupations in New York City has risen by 25.4 percent. By comparison, non-Hispanic whites in computer and mathematical occupations experienced just a 6.4 percent gain since 2010. The rapid growth of minorities in New York tech jobs reflects, in part, the soaring number of tech degrees earned by minorities in recent years. For example, bachelor\u2019s degrees in computer and information sciences granted to Hispanic students have risen by more than 40 percent nationally over the past three years, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics. That supply is then sucked up by the tightness of the city\u2019s technology and information labor markets, which has forced local employers to reach out beyond the usual sources. The boom has also produced benefits across all five boroughs: Private-sector jobs in the outlying boroughs rose by 9 percent from mid-2008 to mid-2013, while private-sector jobs in Manhattan are up only 3 percent over the same stretch. This pattern is the reverse of the financial boom years, when Manhattan generated jobs at a much faster pace than the rest of the city. Moreover, despite worries that the city has not yet spawned a Google or a Microsoft, New York\u2019s strength as a digital city continues to grow. Based on data from the Conference Board, an analysis by the Progressive Policy Institute shows that ads for computer and mathematical jobs in New York rose by 6.8 percent in the first 11 months of 2013 compared with a year earlier, and compared with just 4.0 percent nationwide. Instead, the true weakness in the city\u2019s economy right now lies in the leisure and hospitality industry, which employs almost 400,000 workers in the city. The number of jobs has been rising, but real pay has fallen, perhaps because of continuing weakness in the financial and legal sector, which generates so much demand for hotels and restaurants. These real wage declines undercut gains in the rest of the local economy. What lessons does this have for the new mayor? New York\u2019s gains came, in part, from the aggressive efforts of the Bloomberg administration to stimulate the technology and information sector. These included funding tech incubators; the \u201cMade in NY\u201d marketing campaign to support small tech companies; the rapid extension of broadband access across the city; the city\u2019s broad-reaching Open Data initiative, which makes city data available to the public and software developers; and the selection of Cornell and Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology, to open a huge new campus on Roosevelt Island.To achieve the laudable objectives laid out in his inaugural speech, most notably narrowing the income gap, Mr. de Blasio should continue these policies. The technology and information boom needs to be encouraged: It is creating jobs for all corners of the city and helping to reduce the excessive dependence on finance and real estate. That should make the city\u2019s economy \u2014 and tax revenues \u2014 less volatile in the future. In his inaugural address, Mr. de Blasio correctly pointed to the need for better education for all New York children. That, too, needs to be part of a continued tech-centric agenda: to improve schools and maintain the city\u2019s tech advantage, the new mayor also must ramp up the attention to tech and related fields in the city\u2019s schools. The main path to reducing inequality and broadening the city\u2019s prosperity will be better education and training to help New Yorkers prepare for the jobs of the future, and if Mr. de Blasio successfully addresses that issue, his legacy as a great mayor will be secure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Pressure Mounted for Development in Hoboken", "Date": "2014-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOBOKEN, N.J. \u2014 Last May 8, a severe rainstorm left the streets of this city flooded once again, causing the mayor, Dawn Zimmer, to recall the inundation from Hurricane Sandy.So she dashed off a letter to Gov. Chris Christie, imploring him to help with Hoboken\u2019s \u201congoing flooding emergency,\u201d and attached photos of cars in water up to their hoods. She was due to meet the next day with officials of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, when she hoped to talk about protecting Hoboken from the next catastrophic deluge to come.But according to newly obtained emails sent among the participants, the first topic of discussion on the agenda was \u201creview of concepts for flood control measures at Rockefeller property,\u201d a reference to a billion-dollar office complex proposed at the north end of town. The developer, the Rockefeller Group, which had long been trying to gain approval from local officials, sent two executives, two lobbyists and an engineer to the meeting. Mayor Zimmer, through a spokesman, said on Wednesday that she went to the meeting but refused to discuss the project, feeling it was premature to do so.The next day, the mayor has said, she received a call telling her that Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno would visit Hoboken the following Monday. Ms. Zimmer, a Democrat, has alleged that during that visit, while in the parking lot of a Shop-Rite supermarket, Ms. Guadagno, like the governor a Republican, told her that the Rockefeller project was important to Mr. Christie and that the mayor needed to \u201cmove forward\u201d with it if she wanted Hoboken to receive the flood protection money being distributed in the wake of the hurricane.The Christie administration has denied ever linking the Rockefeller project to hurricane relief, an accusation that is now under federal investigation. But whatever the outcome of the inquiries, the emails and interviews make clear that the development-wary mayor was coming under increasing and repeated pressure from politically connected lawyers working for Rockefeller Group and from the Christie administration.The company had laid out about $100 million to buy up property in a forsaken section of town littered with bus lots and long-dormant factories, property that was zoned for low-slung industrial buildings but blessed with a stunning view of Manhattan. Though the plans have never been made public, in discussions with local officials they described a project that would dwarf anything that Hoboken had ever seen. Following a well-worn playbook, they hired lawyers and lobbyists with connections to the leadership of both parties. State officials, beginning with the administration of Gov. Jon S. Corzine, a Democrat, have come through for the company with money and support. Just last June, the state\u2019s mass transit agency reached a nonbinding agreement with the company for the construction of a light rail station near its property.Rockefeller Group had every reason to expect that local officials would come through, too. For years, Hoboken was known as development-friendly, a financially stressed city happy to move beyond the old image of a dockworkers\u2019 ghetto immortalized by Elia Kazan in \u201cOn the Waterfront.\u201dBut Hoboken took a sharp turn when it elected Ms. Zimmer mayor in 2009. She had entered local politics primarily because she thought Hoboken needed more parks. She joined the City Council during the second term of David Roberts, who as mayor welcomed development and encouraged the construction of the 25-story W Hotel that is still Hoboken\u2019s tallest building.After granting several interviews last week, Ms. Zimmer stopped speaking publicly about the issue, saying federal investigators had asked her not to. On Wednesday, a spokesman for Mr. Christie provided the dates of five meetings Ms. Zimmer had with state officials over the past year in which they discussed how the state could help Hoboken recover from the hurricane. The spokesman, Colin Reed, also noted that the mayor had asked Rockefeller engineers to come up with ideas to protect the city from major storms, and in her January 2013 State of the City speech, she thanked them for doing so.The Christie administration also has questioned the timing of her accusations, which came eight months after the Guadagno meeting, and just days after evidence surfaced that the governor\u2019s aides had created a huge traffic jam in Fort Lee to punish its mayor. That episode, too, is under federal investigation.City\u2019s North EndA wave of residential development and the long decline of manufacturing had already swept away much of Hoboken\u2019s industrial past, including a shipyard and the factories that produced Stahl Soap, Lipton Tea, Maxwell House coffee and Tootsie Rolls. Rockefeller Group, a national developer, began prowling Hoboken for construction sites in 2007. (The company built Rockefeller Center, but has not had a relationship with the Rockefeller family since the late 1980s.)At the northern end of Hoboken, not far from the mouth of the always congested Lincoln Tunnel, Leslie E. Smith Jr., Rockefeller Group\u2019s executive vice president overseeing development in the region, envisioned a vast, $1.1 billion complex that included a 40-story office tower, 300 condominiums and parking for 1,400 cars. Another developer, Larry Bijou, had spent two years and upward of $70 million buying land in the north end, for a residential and retail development of 14-story buildings. By late 2007, with the economy starting to flag, Mr. Bijou agreed to sell most of the property \u2014 roughly 4.9 acres on three adjoining blocks \u2014 to Rockefeller Group, for about $100 million. Mr. Roberts, the mayor, did not dismiss Rockefeller Group\u2019s concept out of hand. There was, after all, the promise of 5,000 jobs and millions of dollars in state and local taxes. But he had questions about putting a large office complex on the north side of Hoboken, instead of closer to the city\u2019s transit hub at the south end. Mr. Roberts said in a recent interview that he needed \u201cmore convincing that it could work, and more discussion about mass transit.\u201d The next mayor, Peter J. Cammarano III, seemed enthusiastic about the project, but he resigned after 31 days in office, after he was caught accepting a $25,000 bribe from an F.B.I. cooperating witness who was posing as a developer. The Rockefeller investment was a risky proposition from the start. There were no indications of what zoning changes the Council would allow in Hoboken, where a 14-story building is considered a high-rise, and many residents wanted to retain the relatively low-scale character of the city. According to people who know him, Mr. Smith presumed that the company, with its resources and connections, could overcome any obstacles and get the project approved within two years.In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Smith said: \u201cThe north end of the city presented an excellent opportunity for commercial development and infrastructure improvements that would benefit all of Hoboken. We feel our project will make a positive contribution to employment opportunities, new amenities and future tax revenues for the city.\u201d In 2007, Rockefeller Group hired Wolff & Samson, a law firm with deep ties to New Jersey\u2019s Republican leaders, to handle environmental issues. The company hired DeCotiis, FitzPatrick & Cole, a firm with Democratic connections, to handle land use issues, and the Hoboken Strategy Group, run by a former vice chairman of the Hudson County Democratic organization, to lobby local officials. Ms. Zimmer became mayor in 2009, promising more transparency in dealing with developers and better planning for the city\u2019s future.\u201cIt was a political sea change in Hoboken,\u201d said Thomas W. Newman, a cabinetmaker and former councilman. \u201cPart of the machine-style politics of the past was making deals with the developers.\u201d Ms. Zimmer kept the developer and their lobbyists at arms\u2019 length, saying she did not want to deal with a single project before she had conducted a planning study for the entire north end. But there was never any money in the city budget for the study.If the Rockefeller Group could not gain much traction with local officials, they were doing better with the Corzine administration. In 2009, the state\u2019s Economic Development Authority approved reimbursing Rockefeller Group up to $750,000 for the removal of contaminated soil and underground storage tanks and monitoring groundwater contamination.Efforts on the state level accelerated after the election of Mr. Christie as governor in late 2009. Mr. Christie, like most governors, has been eager for new developments and uses them to lure companies to New Jersey. He also is close to David Samson, a Wolff & Samson founder whom the governor would name as chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in October 2010, a connection that Ms. Zimmer and her supporters have highlighted. The firm said in a statement that its work for Rockefeller Group was \u201cappropriate in all respects.\u201dThe company suggested that the mayor seek money for a planning study from the Port Authority, which sets aside some of its revenue from tolls and airport fees for local economic development projects. Bill Baroni, a former state senator and Christie appointee at the Port Authority, authorized up to $75,000 for the study. Mr. Baroni, who emails indicated was involved in the Fort Lee lane closings, has resigned from the Port Authority. Slow ProgressThe study dragged on for two years, delayed partly because of the hurricane. Four years after buying the Hoboken parcels, Rockefeller Group still had no certainty that it could build a large-scale project, so it asked Wolff & Samson to expand its work with the Christie administration in early 2012, two executives involved with the project say. When the study, conducted by a planning firm based in Trenton, was finally completed in early 2013, it concluded that out of 19 north end blocks, only the three Rockefeller Group blocks qualified for redevelopment. That recommendation, if ratified by the city, would have given Rockefeller tax breaks for up to 30 years. The group believed that the slow gears of City Hall were finally moving. It demolished buildings in danger of collapse, including the old Tootsie Roll factory, later used by Macy\u2019s to store its Thanksgiving Day parade floats. The company also thought the mayor was warming to it, especially after her State of the City speech.A few months later, the company struck a memorandum of understanding with New Jersey Transit to build a light rail stop near their property. Transportation planners have long said a station would someday be needed there, but for Rockefeller Group, which would pay part of the costs, it made the project more attractive to tenants. A spokesman for the mayor said that Ms. Zimmer was not apprised of the agreement. A transit agency spokesman declined to discuss it.By the mayor\u2019s accounting, the pressure really began last spring. In an April email, Hoboken\u2019s planning lawyer wrote that Mr. Samson and Lori Grifa, a lobbyist from his firm and a former member of Mr. Christie\u2019s cabinet, wanted to meet with him. The planning lawyer wrote that he was \u201cgetting the full court press on this.\u201d Later that month, Hoboken officials discovered that Ms. Grifa was going to be in attendance at the May 9 meeting in Trenton about flooding. \u201cIf this is a meeting between city and state, please explain what role Lori Grifa has in this,\u201d a mayoral aide, Stephen Marks, wrote in an email to one of Ms. Grifa\u2019s colleagues at Wolff & Samson.\u201cWolff & Samson P.C. and Lori Grifa categorically deny Mayor Zimmer\u2019s allegations relating to this firm\u2019s role in the Rockefeller Group\u2019s redevelopment project,\u201d the firm said in a statement. The day before that meeting, May 8, Ms. Zimmer wrote her letter to Mr. Christie: \u201cI have tried to assure Hoboken residents that Hoboken would be treated fairly because you have always treated Hoboken fairly in the past.\u201dThat was also the day that the planning board met to vote on whether to accept the redevelopment study. As it turned out, Rockefeller might have inadvertently hurt its own bottom line. The planner who did the study, Michael Sullivan, told the board that after the demolitions, two of the three Rockefeller blocks would no longer qualify as redevelopment property under New Jersey guidelines. With that, the planning board voted to designate the entire north end a \u201crehabilitation\u201d area, allowing for much smaller tax breaks. Rockefeller Group said the decision made no difference; the zoning change it needed was still possible.Accusations and DenialsThe conversation between Ms. Zimmer and Ms. Guadagno occurred the following Monday. She has said Ms. Zimmer\u2019s version of their talk is \u201cnot only false, but is illogical.\u201d In the fall, the governor\u2019s office called Ms. Zimmer\u2019s office to set up a meeting with two state officials: Marc Ferzan, who oversees New Jersey\u2019s hurricane recovery and rebuilding efforts, and Michele Brown, who oversees economic development. To the mayor\u2019s office, the meeting, which was postponed, was another example of the Christie administration\u2019s tying hurricane aid to the Rockefeller project. Mr. Reed, the governor\u2019s spokesman, said that was a mischaracterization. \u201cIt\u2019s common practice for members of the Christie administration to jointly meet with officials from Sandy-impacted communities across New Jersey,\u201d he said, noting that Ms. Brown\u2019s agency also has a major role in distributing hurricane relief money.Ms. Zimmer has also alleged that, in a separate meeting in December, Mr. Ferzan linked Hoboken\u2019s prospects for receiving aid to her appetite for development. A spokesman for the governor said that Mr. Ferzan denied drawing any such connection.Privately, representatives of Rockefeller Group say they were taken aback by the mayor\u2019s accusations, especially after their cooperation with the city on flood planning. And just a few days before she first discussed her meeting with Ms. Guadagno, on Jan. 18 on MSNBC, Ms. Zimmer met with company representatives in her office. They presented their latest plans, scaled back to 1.5 million square feet of office space, down from 1.8 million, with a possible future apartment building and no buildings taller than the W Hotel.Last week, the mayor invited the public to view plans for protecting Hoboken from floods should it get the necessary funding. City officials said it was merely a set of ideas, not concrete plans.But the Rockefeller Group representatives could not help thinking that the proposal was sending a message. In the drawings, one of the company\u2019s three blocks had become a retention pond.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Day After Surging, the Market Takes a Small Detour", "Date": "2014-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market pulled back a bit on Wednesday as investors waited for the government\u2019s jobs report and the beginning of quarterly corporate earnings data later this week.Traders appeared to put aside a positive report that showed private employers created more jobs in December than economists had expected. The declines extended 2014\u2019s muddled start. Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index were down a little less than 1 percent after five trading days. That contrasts with last year\u2019s performance, when the S.&P. 500 surged almost 30 percent.After bidding up stock prices to record levels last year, investors seem to be ready to see if their bets will pay off. Big publicly traded companies in the United States will start reporting their quarterly results this week, including Chevron and Alcoa on Thursday. Investors will get results next week from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, General Electric and American Express. \u201cEarnings will determine what\u2019s next for the stock market,\u201d said Lawrence R. Creatura, a portfolio manager with Federated Investors.Another item on investors\u2019 agendas is Friday\u2019s jobs report. A private survey released on Wednesday showed businesses in the United States added the most jobs in a year last year, powered by a big gain in construction work. The payroll processor ADP said companies added 238,000 jobs in December, better than the 200,000 that economists had predicted.Also Wednesday, the Fed said consumers increased borrowing by $12.3 billion in November, to a seasonally adjusted $3.09 trillion. That followed an increase in October of $17.9 billion. An $11.9 billion rise in borrowing for auto loans and student loans accounted for the November increase. Borrowing in the category that covers credit cards ticked up only $457.8 million after surging in October. Consumer spending rose 0.5 percent in November, the biggest increase in five months, according to the Commerce Department. That suggests solid economic growth in the final three months of 2013.\u201cThe question is whether this strengthening economy is translating into stronger corporate earnings,\u201d said Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock.The Dow fell 68.20 points, or 0.4 percent, to 16,462.74.

{"Headline": "Text of Christie\u2019s State of the State Address", "Date": "2014-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe following is the text of Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s State of the State address, as prepared for delivery. Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Legislators, friends, fellow New Jerseyans:The last week has certainly tested this Administration. Mistakes were clearly made. And as a result, we let down the people we are entrusted to serve. I know our citizens deserve better. Much better.I am the governor and I am ultimately responsible for all that happens on my watch - both good and bad.Without a doubt we will cooperate with all appropriate inquiries to ensure this breach of trust does not happen again.But I also want to assure the people of New Jersey today that what has occurred does not define us or our state. This Administration and this Legislature will not allow the work that needs to be done to improve the people\u2019s lives in New Jersey to be delayed. I am the leader of this state and its people and I stand here today proud to be both. And always determined to do better.Now I come before you once again to report on the state of our state.And today, the state of the state is good, and getting better.Four years ago, we were in the throes of economic crisis. Today, our unemployment rate is 7.8%, the lowest in 5 years.Four years ago, we were losing jobs. Today, we have gained 70,000 jobs in the last year alone, and a total of 156,000 in the last four years.Four years ago, wealth and jobs were leaving the state. Today, personal income for New Jerseyans is at an all-time high, and we are attracting new companies.And that has brought jobs \u2013 four straight years of private sector job growth. In fact, in November, the drop in our unemployment rate was the largest one month drop ever measured. And in the last year, New Jersey had the second largest drop in its unemployment rate in America.We could have chosen to go down a path of continued tax increases to fund the state\u2019s addiction to spending.But we didn\u2019t. We held the line against any new taxes, and brought spending in the current fiscal year to a level below Fiscal 2008 \u2013 six years ago.We could have let state government grow, even while the private sector shrank. But we didn\u2019t. Today, there are 6,000 fewer state employees than four years ago, but over 155,000 more private sector employees.We improved our business climate, and today, by every measure, business confidence in New Jersey is up. In fact, one national magazine ranked New Jersey among the top 5 states with the most improved business climates in America.It\u2019s no accident how we got to this place today. We chose the way. And in this new year and in the next four years, we need to build on this momentum by creating a new attitude: we need to create an attitude of choice.It is not about choosing everything; it is not about saying yes to everyone; it is about setting our priorities and choosing to invest in New Jersey where it matters and to put in place the reforms and reductions that make it possible.And the best part of our turnaround in these past four years is because we have chosen to work together. These are our achievements.Four balanced budgets. Passed with bipartisan support. Pension reform and tenure reform. Passed with bipartisan support. A cap on property taxes. Passed with bipartisan support.We acted and we acted together.Even though the competition among the states is fierce, no state has shown more bipartisan cooperation over the last four years than New Jersey. Let\u2019s do it again. Let\u2019s resolve that in spite of politics, we will continue to put our people first. We will choose to do our jobs.One of the things that drove people out of New Jersey in the past decade was high property taxes. In 2010, together, we capped them. The 2% cap has worked. In these past two years, property tax growth has been the lowest in two decades.But the job is not finished. Property taxes are still too high. So today, I ask for you to join me in enacting a new property tax relief initiative that tackles the root causes that are driving up property taxes in the first place.First, some context: the 2% cap we\u2019ve already enacted has worked for a reason. We\u2019ve done it by controlling costs. We accompanied it with reform of an interest arbitration award system that needed fixing.As you know, the interest arbitration cap was not permanent \u2013 it is set to expire this April, unless we act. So I ask you today, let us renew the cap on interest arbitration awards and make the cap permanent.Another reason property taxes are so high is that our cities and towns are stuck with a series of costly state rules that increase the cost of local government. As the cost of government grows, taxpayers are paying the price.We have worked with the Senate to try to pass real consolidation and civil service reform. We haven\u2019t gotten it done in the Assembly. We need to have an effort that includes everyone responsible for property taxes \u2013 the Senate, the Assembly, our Administration and local government to provide local government with the authority to run their governments like a business: consolidate, share services, cut duplication and ultimately actually reduce property taxes.Look at what happened last year in Princeton. Princeton Borough and Princeton Township consolidated into a single government. Not two tax departments, two police forces, two offices answering the phone. The savings in one year: $3 million. That\u2019s on a budget of $64 million, a 4.7% savings. And the citizens of Princeton got this: more services, despite a smaller budget, and a reduction in municipal taxes.This is not just my opinion \u2013 the local unit alignment, reorganization and consolidation commission said that civil service seniority rules were at the top of the list of barriers to shared services. Let\u2019s help our towns clear away arcane rules that stand between them and lower property taxes.When it comes to driving costs, let\u2019s not forget the expensive practice of sick leave payouts for government employees. Sick time should be used when you\u2019re sick. If you\u2019re lucky enough to be healthy, that\u2019s your reward. Sick leave has been abused too many times, and the cost is real. Almost a billion dollars in liability facing New Jersey towns - $880 million to be exact. And it will only get higher if the system is not fixed. These reforms are common sense: let\u2019s lift this billion dollar albatross off the necks of New Jersey\u2019s towns. Let\u2019s together enact the zero means zero plan.Our pension system is burdened by some who collect disability retirement because they claim they are \u201ctotally and permanently disabled,\u201d but who are now working full-time. So we\u2019ve established by Executive Order a special unit to prosecute pension fraud. Let\u2019s go even further to solidify our pension system and reduce costs by reforming our disability retirement system to end this fraud and abuse. This will also help us to reduce property taxes.And some towns get around the property tax cap by enacting user fees to fund traditional services that used to be in the budget. Let\u2019s end this practice.I will have more to say about New Jersey\u2019s taxes when I present my budget to you next month. That is for a reason. We have to consider changes to our tax system in the context of our overall budget picture. We will present some of these choices in February.I will tell you one choice we will not make \u2013 because it is one answer that will not help grow our state: raising taxes.If the evidence is clear that increasing taxes hurts our growth, it is equally clear that improving education is a key to helping our growth.We\u2019ve made some great progress in these past four years: a record amount of school aid, long-overdue reform of our system of teacher tenure, an increase in the number of charter schools and an Urban Hope Act that is bringing renaissance schools to some of our most challenged cities.Some results are promising too. Last year, New Jersey\u2019s high school graduation rate increased by a full percentage point, to 87.5%. Student achievement is strong in many of our public schools, and New Jersey\u2019s students are among the country\u2019s greatest achievers. Just a few years ago, a graduate of my own high school, Livingston High School, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.We are making a large investment in public education: New Jersey spends over $25 billion a year, all told. Our per pupil expenditure is the highest in the nation at over $17,000 per year.In some cases - too many - our children are not receiving the education they deserve. While many public schools are strong, too many are still failing. While the vast majority of teachers are performing well, some are underperforming \u2013 and they should be removed from the classroom.The need to be better is particularly acute in New Jersey\u2019s cities. Our urban schools demand our attention, and believe me, they have mine.Where bold action was necessary, we have taken bold action. And we have made a commitment to the kids in our cities that they have a right to the same quality education as kids in our suburbs.In our largest school system, in Newark, we have brought in a new organization and new resources, not only in the form of state aid but in collaboration with parents, teachers, and community leaders on the ground. One result \u2013 we negotiated a historic contract with the teacher\u2019s union and delivered real merit pay alongside increased teacher involvement.Most importantly we want to encourage innovation while listening to the specific needs of our urban communities. It\u2019s the reason why we have empowered our superintendents in Newark and Camden to make choices that work best for their kids, their parents and their schools.In Newark, that superintendent is Cami Anderson.Cami has moved to pay the best teachers, to stop actions that are failing kids, to empower 50 new principals, create cooperation between public schools and charter schools and reorganize the school systems\u2019 structure to focus on putting students, schools and parents first.Early childhood enrollment has increased by more than 1,000 students. Graduation rates have increased by 10%.Newark is leading the conversation in making sure every kid \u2013 those who are behind, those who are ahead, those who have special education needs \u2013 are lifted up.Every kid means every kid.Her efforts haven\u2019t always been met without skepticism, but she is a true partner with Newark. Cami is here with us today \u2013 Cami, thank you for your commitment to our kids.How bad has it been in Camden? Last year, only three students graduated \u201ccollege ready.\u201d Paymon Rouhanifard is bringing that same energy to Camden\u2019s public schools. He has turned around a perennially low-performing charter school to showing some of the largest academic gains in the state. He has launched a new \u201csafe corridors\u201d program with Mayor Dana Redd, which has created safe walking routes to and from school for our children.And, of the 345 students who have dropped out in the last year, we went door-to-door and re-enrolled 50 of them.Paymon, thank you for your efforts and your dedication.Both Cami and Paymon have this Administration\u2019s confidence and support to continue the aggressive reforms needed that work best for the communities of Newark and Camden and put kids first.Cami and Paymon are emblems of my commitment to ensuring the opportunity for an excellent education to every child in New Jersey, regardless of the ZIP code.Despite the improvements we are seeing in Newark and Camden, I believe we need to take bigger and broader steps to adjust our approach to K-12 education to address the new competitive world we live in. Our school calendar is antiquated both educationally and culturally. Life in 2014 demands something more for our students. It is time to lengthen both the school day and school year in New Jersey.If student achievement is lagging at the exact moment when we need improvement more than ever in order to compete in the world economy, we should take these steps - every possible step - to boost student achievement.And one key step is to lengthen the school day and the school year. So, working with Commissioner Cerf, I will present to you shortly a proposal to increase the length of both the school day and the school year in New Jersey. This is a key step to improve student outcomes and boost our competitiveness. We should do it now.Many of our new initiatives recognize a core feature of modern American life: that the quality of education and the quality of life in our communities are inextricably intertwined.That is why this year, we need to be more aggressive, and bolder, in fixing our failing schools - and delivering a choice to those for whom today the only option is a bad option: a failing school.This is a moral obligation. We must give every New Jersey child the chance to graduate from high school, to be ready for college and to prepare for a career. If we fail to meet this obligation, we compromise the life of that child, and we hurt the quality of life in our communities and in New Jersey. So failure is not an option.If education is one key to the quality of life in New Jersey communities, our approach to safe streets and stronger communities is another.Every New Jerseyan should be concerned when violent crimes occur right before our eyes.Last month, a young lawyer went to open the door of his car for his wife after an evening of pre-Christmas shopping. He was set upon by thugs who wanted to carjack his S.U.V. and, in front of his new wife, he was shot in the head and left for dead on the deck of the mall parking garage.Outstanding police work led to four arrests, and the suspects are now charged with murder.All four had prior criminal records. All four are, fortunately, now in jail.How can we tolerate such violence in our midst? The answer is obvious: we cannot.We must take a new approach to fighting crime in New Jersey and prevent tragedies like this from happening. We must do everything we can to swiftly jail those violent criminals who bring additional murder and disruption to innocent victims across our state. We have the tools to do this \u2013 some we\u2019ve begun, some we have not. 2014 must be the year we finish the job.What have we not finished? Almost two years ago, I announced a proposed constitutional amendment to modify the right to bail in New Jersey.The concept is simple: New Jersey courts should have the right to keep dangerous criminals off the streets and in jail until trial.Why is this important? A study by the federal government\u2019s Justice Department found that one-third of defendants released before trial ended up being charged with some type of pretrial misconduct. One-sixth were arrested for a new offense \u2013 and half of those were felonies.The federal government allows a violent criminal who is a danger to the community to be held without bail. New Jersey law does not. This must change. How can we justify exposing our citizens to the risk of violent crime at the hands of those, already in custody, who we know are disposed to commit it? There is no justification for that. Let us mirror federal law. Pass bail reform now.In the past few years, we have made progress in reducing crime in New Jersey. Over the past decade, violent crime is down 16%, both across New Jersey, and in our 15 largest urban centers. And the state\u2019s prison population is down 20% since 1999.But we can do better, and we must. Those 15 urban centers still account for more than half of all the violent crime in New Jersey, despite representing only 18% of the state\u2019s population.For too long, Camden has been one of the most dangerous cities in New Jersey, and in America.The ability to put police on the street was constrained by tight budgets, low morale, and an absentee rate that sometimes reached 30%.Under an agreement that this Administration signed with the City of Camden and Camden County, we have regionalized the police force. A police force of slightly more than 200 that was sharply reduced in response to budget cuts is now being beefed up to 400 county police officers.Last year, the homicide rate was down, and the crime rate was down \u2013 by over 20%.The battle is far from won. But under Mayor Dana Redd, Police Chief Scott Thomson, and Jose Cordero, who helped decrease crime in East Orange by 75%, Camden is using a new approach \u2013 using technology to predict crime, and engaging the community.Camden is moving in the right direction. And I agree with Senator Sweeney that we should have incentives for other communities to adopt the shared service agreements and regional police forces that are making more cops on the street possible. More cops on the streets means safer communities. To make this happen, we will reintroduce shared services and consolidation reform in this session of the Legislature.We must reach out a hand of compassion and common sense to those who commit nonviolent crimes. We must do a better job of reclaiming their lives and putting them back on the road to success and engagement with society. My belief is simple: every human life is precious, and no life is disposable.That is why I proposed last year to change our approach to nonviolent drug offenders, and mandate treatment, not imprisonment. Together, we made this possible.The drug court program has been a success, thanks in part to your support in funding both the court and the treatment.And I thank you for passage this past year of the Overdose Protection Act. We should not be prosecuting those Good Samaritans and health professionals who are trying to help in a life-threatening overdose situation.New Jersey\u2019s approach to reclaiming lives is working. Recidivism has dropped by 11%, one of the steepest drops in America. And New Jersey is rightly recognized by national experts as a leader among states in reducing incidents of recidivism.For me this is personal. In this room today is a man who was a drug addict at 16 years old. His life was at risk, but treatment saved him. He was rehabilitated at Daytop Village. He graduated from high school, went to college, and ultimately got a law degree. I had the privilege of hiring and working with Craig Hanlon at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, and Craig is with us now in this Chamber. If you need proof that reclaiming a life is possible and that every life has precious value, then that proof is standing before you today. Craig, welcome \u2013 and thank you for making new jersey a better place.Because of Craig, I know the passion and strength that comes from the desire to have a better life. And I believe we can do more to help give people a second chance. That is why I am proposing an initiative to expand integrated treatment and employment services for individuals receiving drug treatment services.By providing grant funds in the amount of $500,000 to be managed in partnership with The Nicholson Foundation, we will place individuals in jobs and help improve their retention. We will work directly with treatment providers to integrate employment services with treatment services for drug court participants.Research shows that employment during substance abuse treatment helps ensure continued participation in treatment and sustainable long-term employment. With this partnership we will help empower individuals who want and deserve the opportunity to live a life well lived.A year ago this afternoon, our state was in recovery from a challenge not of our own making.Superstorm Sandy devastated New Jersey in the fall of 2012 \u2013 flooding our homes, turning off our power and destroying our roads. Despite the magnitude and devastation of the storm, Sandy could not break out spirit.This past summer, most businesses at the Shore opened on time. Boardwalks were rebuilt. The crowds came back. And schools that had been damaged were reopened.Today, about nine months after the first phase of CDBG disaster recovery funds started flowing in New Jersey, nearly $900 million \u2013 more than two-thirds of the funds for housing recovery programs are out the door or in the pipeline.From the very beginning, the priority was putting those with the greatest needs and with the most limited financial resources at the front of the line. Of the nearly half of the housing money that has been obligated so far, 72.9% has been awarded to low- and middle-income families.The bottom line is this: we are a long way from the finish line, but we are a long way from where we were one year ago. Challenges remain and I will not rest until every person hurt by Sandy has their life back. That is my mission.I want to thank this Legislature, and all New Jerseyans, for the cooperative, bipartisan and resilient spirit you demonstrated in coming back from Sandy. Let that spirit of Sandy be a powerful lesson to all of us, that when times are most difficult, cooperation and progress are possible. Indeed, they are necessary.Lastly, let me share with you one more, hard truth that makes this new attitude of choice necessary for New Jersey\u2019s future.We have discussed many exciting opportunities for investment in our state. K-12 education. Higher education. Crime prevention. Drug rehabilitation and job training. Health care. Infrastructure investment. Lower taxes. Job growth. All exciting, all of which, done responsibly, could make New Jersey an even greater place. But here is the simple truth. We cannot afford to do it right now.Why?Because of our pension and debt service costs. For the Fiscal Year 2015 Budget, the increase in pension and debt service costs could amount to as much as nearly $1 billion.That\u2019s nearly $1 billion we can\u2019t spend on education. That we can\u2019t invest in infrastructure improvement. That we can\u2019t use to put more cops on the street. That won\u2019t be available to improve access to health care. And for those who would advocate for higher income taxes like the ones I have vetoed before, remember that the amount raised would not even cover the increase in our scheduled pension payment and would undoubtedly make us less competitive in the job market nationwide.These are the consequences of failing to engage in an attitude of choice. If we continue in an era where we believe we can choose everything, we are really choosing nothing. We need to have the conversation now about further changes to our pension system and to adding further to the state\u2019s debt load. But the time to avoid this conversation and these choices is nearly over.If we do not choose to reduce our soaring pension and debt service costs, we will miss the opportunity to improve the lives of every New Jersey citizen, not just a select few.I am ready to engage in those conversations and help, with you, to truly create an attitude of choice. The result will be a better, smarter, stronger New Jersey. The results from our refusal to choose \u2013 a weaker New Jersey with a middle class burdened by even higher taxes. That is an abandonment of our duty.Centuries ago, a philosopher wrote that \u201cchoice, not chance, determines your destiny.\u201d And this remains true for New Jersey today.Our destiny is not set \u2013 it is the product of the choices we make. Our future is not set \u2013 it, too, is the product of the choices we make from this day forward.So let us choose wisely. And let us not fail to act. Let us create an attitude of choice.Let us choose to invest in better schools, and not a status quo in which we leave some children behind and put the rest at risk of being swallowed by a rising tide of mediocrity.Let us choose the path of safer streets, and not leave our families vulnerable to the heartless carjackers and muggers who would destroy our quality of life.Let us celebrate every life by creating an opportunity for every citizen, through an excellent education, a productive job, and a thriving community.In this hour of choice, let us choose a better New Jersey. For that is what we owe our citizens, our children, and ourselves.New Jersey has long been blessed by an abundance of natural resources and human talent. In 2014, we have been blessed by a return to prosperity.Let us all choose to make the most of it \u2013 together.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the great state of New Jersey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sanctions Eased, Iran Gets Feelers From Old Trading Partners", "Date": "2014-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 For critics of the interim nuclear agreement with Iran, Hossein Sheikholeslami might seem to embody their worst fears.Mr. Sheikholeslami has been busy in recent weeks, since the deal was agreed to in principle, shuttling back and forth between the capital and the airport to welcome all the guests: parliamentary missions from old European trading partners like Germany, Italy and Finland, which are eager to renew contacts.Excitement over the interim agreement, which will ease some provisions of the American-led sanctions on Iran but essentially leave all of them in place, has not extended to American companies. They remain extremely wary.Nonetheless, critics of Iran in the United States Congress and elsewhere, who are pushing for even stiffer sanctions, have expressed dismay over the European trade missions. They see them as a signal that Iran is open for business, leading to an end of the Islamic republic\u2019s international isolation, which they say is what brought the Iranians to the negotiating table in the first place.But that is not the way it looks to Iran\u2019s business leaders, who say the deal has generated a great deal of interest but little else. Even when the easing begins, now set for Monday, it will continue to be nearly impossible to transfer money into and out of the country. \u201cMost companies want to scope out the landscape,\u201d said Rouzbeh Pirouz, the chairman of a Tehran-based investment firm, Turquoise Partners. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think many of them will actually sign contracts and start putting money into this place very quickly.\u201dThat has not stopped a parade of people, mainly European politicians and business representatives, from visiting the Islamic republic, which, with 70 million people and a sizable middle class, is the world\u2019s last major isolated market.In the first two weeks of the year, Iran welcomed more delegations from Europe than in all of 2013.\u201cThe Europeans are waiting in line to come here,\u201d said Mr. Sheikholeslami, the international affairs adviser to the head of Iran\u2019s Parliament, Ali Larijani, who has been receiving many of the high-profile visitors. \u201cThey are coming to seek benefits and to get ahead of their international rivals.\u201dItaly\u2019s foreign minister, Emma Bonino, has been here, as has a former British foreign minister, Jack Straw, in his capacity as the head of the Iran-Britain Friendship Committee.The prime ministers of Italy and Poland have also scheduled visits. Trade delegations from Ireland, Italy and France are expected in coming weeks.American companies have shown some interest, of course. In September the head of President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s office, the former director of the Iranian Chamber of Commerce, Mohammad Nahavandian, held a closed-door meeting with leading chief executives in New York. In March, an Iranian investment company is organizing a $15,000-a-ticket seminar in New York on business opportunities in Iran.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.Where Mr. Netanyahu sees risk, Mr. Sheikholeslami \u2014 who in 1979 was one of the students who held 52 American diplomats hostage, touching off the crisis that ruptured the countries\u2019 relations \u2014 sees opportunity. \u201cThe sanction regime imposed on us is falling apart,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Americans wanted to impose their will on the world and isolate Iran, but big companies are seeking the potential of Iran.\u201dCritics of Iran in the United States have also expressed anger at Russia \u2014 which has always rejected the American-led sanctions strategy as arrogant \u2014 over a reported Russian agreement under negotiation with Iran that could provide Iran with billions of dollars\u2019 worth of food and equipment in exchange for oil, which Russia would then sell.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who was visiting Moscow on Thursday, was quoted by the Russian broadcaster Rossiya 24 as saying such a deal was not on his agenda for discussion. And Obama administration officials have suggested that if such a deal was in the works, it would be a sanctions violation.Still, those frustrated with the administration\u2019s policy toward Iran say the reported Russia-Iran deal is a clear example of how the sanctions effort is about to collapse and relieve the pressures on Iran.What is true, said Mr. Pirouz and his business partner, Ramin Rabii, is that the Iranian economy has picked up since Mr. Rouhani came to office. \u201cBut that is not happening solely in expectation of some sanctions being lifted,\u201d Mr. Rabii said. \u201cIt is because of his appointments of competent managers who are undoing some of the damaging economic and monetary policies designed by the previous administration.\u201dUnder Mr. Rouhani, who has been in office for nearly six months, Iran\u2019s economy has made some small strides. Inflation has come down to 35 percent from 42 percent in December, the Statistical Organization of Iran reported. Unemployment continues to be very high, though there are no reliable measures of the rate. The national currency has stabilized, and Iran\u2019s stock exchange has been setting records.\u201cWhat Iran\u2019s government really should do is leave the economy to the private sector,\u201d Mr. Pirouz said. \u201cWhile an improvement over the previous situation, some of Mr. Rouhani\u2019s men are still in favor of a planned economy, so in my view certain problems will persist, even if some sanctions are lifted.\u201dMany multinationals have long eyed what they view as the virgin Iranian market, where many highly educated consumers are thirsty for jobs and Western products. Iran\u2019s infrastructure, including that of its oil industry, needs a complete overhaul.\u201cWe need over $200 billion investment in our oil and gas sector alone,\u201d said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to Mr. Rouhani\u2019s government. Iran needs multibillion-dollar injections in its heavy industries, its transportation sector and airlines, he said. \u201cOn top of that, we need to acquire new management skills and services. Basically, we need everything the other emerging nations needed a decade ago.\u201dA senior United States official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said last week that sanctions would remain firmly in place, and that any company breaking them would be punished. \u201cWe tell everybody with interest in the Iranian market to be very careful not to break any sanctions, as they will face the consequences,\u201d the official said.For the most part, local Iranian producers cannot understand what all the hubbub is about.\u201cMany politicians and well-connected businessmen might be excited,\u201d said Bahram Eshghi, the owner of a bus manufacturing company. In September he said he was basically doing nothing at work because even the Chinese were afraid to do business with Iran. The lifting of some sanctions or a more positive atmosphere has not changed that significantly, he said.\u201cSure, we will be able to buy some spare parts, but I still can\u2019t make an international money transfer,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich big brand will be willing to come to Iran and work under such conditions? None.\u201dMr. Eshghi, a burly man with thick hair turning white, said that only one thing mattered to the multinationals. \u201cThey will come only when the U.S. allows banks to make money transfers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is as simple as that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Winning Expo, Emirate Fumes at Allies It Says Didn\u2019t Back It", "Date": "2014-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDubai JournalDUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 From the start, Dubai took the competition to land the 2020 World Expo rather seriously.Dubai\u2019s unbridled enthusiasm might seem odd, given the World Expo\u2019s declining hold on the public\u2019s attention in recent decades. But the United Arab Emirates love nothing so dearly as a commercial pursuit, and for Dubai, the Expo offered a chance to grab global attention and celebrate its resurgent affluence after a long stretch of boom-and-bust upheaval.So it is perhaps unsurprising that simply winning was not enough. The Emirates wanted answers: Who among their allies had failed to support their vision?Almost immediately after the announcement that Dubai had beaten out three other cities \u2014 Izmir, Turkey; S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; and Yekaterinburg, Russia \u2014 for the 2020 event, word spread through the emirate\u2019s business community that two of its close regional allies had cast their votes for others.\u201cDespite their assurances, those two countries declined to vote for Dubai, which leads to serious questions about their credibility as allies,\u201d the editorial board wrote, calling it a betrayal given the aid and friendship the Emirates have shown to both nations.\u201cIslamabad and Kabul chose to disregard all that binds us and turned their back on us at a critical moment,\u201d the editorial also said. \u201cAnd that is just incomprehensible.\u201dThe Pakistani consul general in Dubai struck back immediately, accusing the newspaper of producing what was \u201capparently an orchestrated attempt to damage and defame the historic fraternal relations between Pakistan and the U.A.E.,\u201d according to his letter to the editor. He continued, \u201cNot only is the language offensive, the article is factually incorrect.\u201dAfghanistan made no such public statements. But reached by phone, the deputy minister of commerce and industry conceded that his country had opted to vote for Turkey.\u201cDubai is quite important for us, especially as a transit hub,\u201d said Mozammil Shinwari, the deputy minister. \u201cBut this decision came mainly from the cultural and historical connections between Afghanistan and Turkey, as well as their contribution to the development of Afghanistan.\u201dBut the Emirati pride is a stubborn one. And while Dubai or the rest of the Emirates are unlikely to do something drastic like cut back aid or investment in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the lack of support was taken as a notably unamusing threat to Dubai\u2019s business prospects.In some respects, winning the 2020 World Expo offered a way for Dubai to emerge from its dark days with a new vigor. In decades past, the event captured the world\u2019s imagination, introducing the telephone, the diesel engine and even the Eiffel Tower.The event\u2019s trailblazing days are long gone, but it can still carry social and economic importance. Emirati officials saw it as a way to supercharge infrastructure and development projects that the government says it believes will strengthen tourism and businesses. While it will require an estimated $7 billion in financing, the event is expected to generate about $23 billion and bring 25 million attendees, according to official figures.So Dubai campaigned hard to secure the necessary votes to win the event, and it had banked on support from Pakistan and Afghanistan to make it happen.\u201cWe expected those two countries to be the first to offer their backing, considering the close-knit relationship that binds our people,\u201d the editorial said.The United Arab Emirates have taken an interest in helping to develop their war-torn ally, Afghanistan. The wealthiest Afghans park their money in Dubai, an estimated $4 billion spread among the 500 richest businessmen, according to the Afghan Embassy to the Emirates. There are numerous daily flights between Kabul, the Afghan capital, and Dubai. And since 2003, the Emirates have stationed soldiers in Afghanistan to assist in the delivery of aid and, occasionally, fight off Taliban ambushes.But when it comes down to playing favorites, the reality is that most Afghan officials and businessmen feel closer to Turkey. And as a regional power, Turkey remains the dominant player. Its economy is roughly twice the size of the United Arab Emirates\u2019, and in the last decade, trade between Turkey and Afghanistan increased 36-fold, to $264 million as of 2010.Turkey\u2019s aid and military presence also outstrip the contributions of the Emirates.\u201cTurkey\u2019s investment here is quite huge,\u201d said Mr. Shinwari, the Afghan deputy minister.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Job Aid Zones Face a New Test in Coal Country", "Date": "2014-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAZARD, Ky. \u2014 Joseph Nantz still looks back fondly at his job as a heavy machinery operator at the mountaintop coal mine here, helping to blast and cart away layers of rock to reveal seams of coal and then restore the rubble for a handsome $24 an hour.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get some industry other than coal in here,\u201d said Mr. Nantz, who lost his job along with 750 other miners in summer 2012. \u201cThere\u2019s only so many people left. The halfway smart ones are leaving.\u201d\u201cWe will help them succeed,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cNot with a handout, but as partners with them, every step of the way. And we\u2019re going to make sure it works.\u201dBut Mr. Obama\u2019s promise zones, which are part of the larger agenda to fight inequality and poverty that he plans to unveil Tuesday night during his State of the Union speech, are just the latest version of an old idea: the politically popular enterprise zone.As Mr. Obama prepares to deliver his annual speech to Congress, he can point to a steadily improving economy. But many Americans say they have seen little benefit from the recovery and complain that the economic deck is stacked against them.But experts are broadly skeptical that any federal initiative would be enough to combat either the immediate economic upheaval caused by the loss of coal jobs or the long-term economic torpor that is a product of remoteness, poor infrastructure and an undereducated work force.\u201cThe evidence is mixed, and pessimistic,\u201d said Bob Turner, associate professor at Skidmore College, who has studied such enterprise zones in depth. \u201cThere\u2019s a real gap between the amount of private and public disinvestment in these areas and the scope of the public intervention.\u201dDespite their modest track record, enterprise zones continue to attract supporters from across the political spectrum. In Kentucky, Mr. Obama\u2019s program has the backing of the Democratic governor, Steve Beshear, and even the assent of one of the country\u2019s most conservative senators, the Republican Rand Paul.But local workers and officials \u2014 even while welcoming any help that towns like Hazard could get \u2014 voiced skepticism that there was much the government could do to fundamentally turn around the economy.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a magic bullet here,\u201d said Jeff Whitehead, the executive director of the Eastern Kentucky Concentrated Employment Program. \u201cMy agency is involved with trying to retrain 8,000 coal miners who have lost their jobs. Unfortunately, one of the more successful things we\u2019re doing is helping them find jobs outside the area.\u201dIn a typical enterprise zone, the government puts a thumb on the scale, aiming to attract businesses to a given region with preferential tax rates, anti-crime programs and other incentives. At the same time, it often helps build up the work force with education programs.The appeal has always been bipartisan. Jack Kemp, the former George H. W. Bush cabinet official, was an early proponent of enterprise zones. President Bill Clinton enacted a countrywide program in the mid-1990s. Today, Mr. Obama has named five promise zones and intends to name 15 more. Mr. Paul of Kentucky and other free-market-oriented politicians have supported creating new enterprise zones with radically lower tax rates to help communities suffering after the recession.\u201cThis adds up to a significant stimulus,\u201d Mr. Paul said in an interview in Maysville, a rural town north of the new promise zone area. \u201cIt could have a big effect for people who are really hurting,\u201d he said. Mr. Paul added that he thought Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal was too \u201ctimid\u201d to help the most depressed communities, though he did not oppose it in principle.But past enterprise zones have a modest track record. Many seem to have no effect. Others seem to simply subsidize business investment that would have already taken place, or to move business from one county to another without helping the economy over all.Jerry Rickett is the president of the Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation, a partner with Mr. Clinton\u2019s effort as well as Mr. Obama\u2019s. He said that the enterprise zone designation from Washington had proved a powerful tool for attracting business when it came with significant new financing. Mr. Obama, however, has yet to win additional money from Congress.\u201cIt worked very, very well,\u201d Mr. Rickett said of Mr. Clinton\u2019s policy. \u201cBut we desperately need to attract businesses to generate revenue here, and tax credits are a powerful tool for that.\u201dEven if Mr. Clinton\u2019s proposal did have a positive effect, it did not prove enough to turn the Kentucky Highlands around. The area remains largely dependent on federal benefit programs and on a declining coal industry. Since the mines started shedding workers, crime has risen and poverty intensified.Still, proponents said this time could be different. A White House official said the administration had carefully studied earlier enterprise zones, to ensure their efficacy. \u201cThese are communities that can reach a tipping point,\u201d said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, the director of the White House\u2019s Domestic Policy Council. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating a policy that\u2019s greater than the sum of its parts.\u201dIn Kentucky, the proposals include worker retraining, business investment and antidrug policies. \u201cThe idea is to build a diversified economy based on the talents of the local people as they are now,\u201d said Alison Davis, director of the Community and Economic Development Initiative of Kentucky at the University of Kentucky. She said that drawing in big businesses with tax breaks might be part of the solution, but so would helping local workers start new businesses.\u201cIn the past, it\u2019s been a lot of \u2018Shoot anything that flies!\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said. \u201cBut in Appalachia, particularly in these counties \u2014 it would be a special, unique company that would find its needs met in eastern Kentucky.\u201dBut the obstacles remain huge, local business experts said. There is no interstate highway that might bring in manufacturers or trucking companies. In some areas, there is no broadband Internet.

{"Headline": "Governors Criticize Gridlock in Congress ", "Date": "2014-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The nation\u2019s governors criticized Congress on Wednesday for the political gridlock that they said had stymied passage of almost every federal initiative most needed by the states, and reiterated their calls for help from Washington.\u201cDespite the recent budget agreement, partisan gridlock continues to prevent long-term policy solutions,\u201d Ms. Fallin said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing our part as governors to create jobs and address the challenges facing our states and this country. But we also believe that now it\u2019s time for our federal partners to do theirs and to take action.\u201dLast January, the governors association came to Washington to lay out a blueprint of what states needed from lawmakers. This year\u2019s list of requests, Ms. Fallin said, is almost identical.\u201cWe stand here today with essentially the same to-do list sitting before our Congress,\u201d she said.Ms. Fallin and the vice chairman of the association, Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado, a Democrat, delivered the address at the National Press Club a day after meeting with President Obama.The president and his staff asked a lot of questions, Mr. Hickenlooper said, and promised to act on behalf of any governors who felt the federal government was stifling their states\u2019 efforts.In particular, the governors called on Congress and the White House to fix what they said were flaws in the No Child Left Behind Act, to reauthorize the Water Resources Development Act, to restore the 15 percent of cash set aside for states under the Workforce Investment Act, to ensure that each state\u2019s National Guard has enough money to operate effectively, and to give states more flexibility to experiment with new solutions to nagging problems.The rollout of the Affordable Care Act, which has dominated political discussion in Washington in recent months, received barely a mention, an indication of the disagreement among governors on the contentious subject.\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time,\u201d Ms. Fallin said. \u201cChange is hard.\u201dThe governors were also keen to point to state efforts to train workers, improve access to education, lower health care costs and address the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure, contrasting that to the lack of action in Congress.\u201cStates are leading, and we encourage our federal partners to work more closely with us and to take note of and use the policy ideas coming from their state partners,\u201d Ms. Fallin said. \u201cAbove all, please do not get in our way.\u201dAs the shrinking federal budget, including the automatic cuts known as sequestration, has choked off some of the money that ordinarily flows to statehouses, governors have had to reduce services and scramble to keep programs operating.\u201cIt is left to the states to chart their own path and pursue their own policies where partisan gridlock has left Washington unable to address the nation\u2019s serious problems,\u201d Ms. Fallin said.In the future, the governors said, Congress should pay closer attention to the implications of budget cuts and make certain that what appear to be savings at the federal level do not merely push those costs to the states.\u201cIn my state of Oklahoma, and in states across the country, the most liberal Democrats and the most conservative Republicans can agree that moving from one crisis to another, without any long-term plan or vision, is a recipe for trouble,\u201d Ms. Fallin said. \u201cWashington\u2019s short-term thinking and continued inaction are hurting state economies, repressing job growth and, ultimately, hurting American families in every state.\u201dThe bottom line is that states cannot operate without federal assistance, Mr. Hickenlooper said.\u201cMore than 26 percent of most state budgets come from the federal government,\u201d he said. \u201cThe politics of fiscal responsibility can no longer be centered around crisis and deadlines. We applaud the recent budget agreement reached by Congress. Now we need to build on that success.\u201dThe alternative, he said, is more gridlock.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to return a year from now with the same to-do list,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Undeserving Rich", "Date": "2014-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut it is, of course. Partly this reflects Upton Sinclair\u2019s famous dictum: It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it. But it also, I think, reflects distaste for the implications of the numbers, which seem almost like an open invitation to class warfare \u2014 or, if you prefer, a demonstration that class warfare is already underway, with the plutocrats on offense.The result has been a determined campaign of statistical obfuscation. At its cruder end this campaign comes close to outright falsification; at its more sophisticated end it involves using fancy footwork to propagate what I think of as the myth of the deserving rich.If this sounds wrong to you, it should: that\u2019s a nominal number, not corrected for inflation. You can find the inflation-corrected number in the same Census Bureau table; it shows incomes for the bottom fifth actually falling. Oh, and for the record, at the time of writing this elementary error had not been corrected on The Journal\u2019s website.O.K., that\u2019s what crude obfuscation looks like. What about the fancier version?The story goes like this: America\u2019s affluent are affluent because they made the right lifestyle choices. They got themselves good educations, they got and stayed married, and so on. Basically, affluence is a reward for adhering to the Victorian virtues.What\u2019s wrong with this story? Even on its own terms, it postulates opportunities that don\u2019t exist. For example, how are children of the poor, or even the working class, supposed to get a good education in an era of declining support for and sharply rising tuition at public universities? Even social indicators like family stability are, to an important extent, economic phenomena: nothing takes a toll on family values like lack of employment opportunities.But the main thing about this myth is that it misidentifies the winners from growing inequality. White-collar professionals, even if married to each other, are only doing O.K. The big winners are a much smaller group. The Occupy movement popularized the concept of the \u201c1 percent,\u201d which is a good shorthand for the rising elite, but if anything includes too many people: most of the gains of the top 1 percent have in fact gone to an even tinier elite, the top 0.1 percent.Again, I know that these realities make some people, not all of them hired guns for the plutocracy, uncomfortable, and they\u2019d prefer to paint a different picture. But even if the facts have a well-known populist bias, they\u2019re still the facts \u2014 and they must be faced.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bridging the Compassion Gap", "Date": "2014-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat\u2019s going on with John Boehner, the speaker of the House?There are several theories about Boehner\u2019s unexpected turn.One explanation sees Boehner and centrist Republicans generally backing away from some of their more controversial stands in preparation for the 2014 election. Steve Rosenthal, the political director of the AFL-CIO from 1995 to 2002 and now president of the Organizing Group, a Democratic political consulting firm, noted in an email exchange: \u201cThe ground is shifting on a whole range of issues, and the Republicans know that their hard-liners are way out of step with America. Some of these issues \u2013 extending unemployment benefits, increasing the minimum wage \u2013 are values issues as much as economic ones. That is, they tell voters whose side a candidate is on.\u201dIn close contests, the long-term unemployed, along with their families and their friends, have the power to determine the outcome in those 2014 elections in which a percentage point gained or lost can be decisive. On Dec. 28 Congress allowed unemployment benefits to expire for an estimated 1.3 million out of work men and women. A vote against restoring the benefits would create \u201ca political vulnerability,\u201d said John Feehery, a public relations executive who was once a top aide to Dennis Hastert, the former House speaker. \u201cA lot of those folks on unemployment are swing voters. They dislike Obama but will vote their economic interests if they have to.\u201dAlan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory, agreed: \u201cI have to assume that if they are willing to consider extending unemployment benefits, it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to hand Democrats a potentially damaging issue in the midterm elections. They certainly know that this has the support of a large majority of voters including a lot of Republican voters. And Democrats are going to try to use this issue along with raising the minimum wage to try to offset the political fallout from the rollout of Obamacare.\u201dWhy would an improving economy encourage John Boehner to be more receptive to extended unemployment benefits and liberalized immigration policies \u2013 and courageous enough to stiff-arm his party\u2019s right wing?To answer that question requires a look at how favorable and unfavorable trends in the economy influence the political views of the electorate. \u201cThe Great Depression spawned five consecutive Democratic administrations, the first unprecedentedly activist in expanding social welfare and government intervention in the economy. Communism in the U.S. was also probably at its peak in popularity.\u201dIt is, however, one of the ironies of political economy that support for the liberal agenda declines just when the needs of the needy are strongest. Conversely, when the economy begins to expand and the spending cuts sought by conservatives would be least painful, support for conservative belt-tightening drops.Skitka and Tetlock conducted a survey assessing how liberals and conservatives would allocate three resources; azidothymidine (AZT) for AIDS patients; organs for would-be transplant recipients; and low-income housing for the poor \u2013 under conditions of plenty (\u201cno scarcity\u201d), low scarcity and high scarcity.When participants in the experiments were told that resources were very scarce, liberals became less generous and began to make the same judgments as conservatives. Both left and right \u201cdenied assistance to people they deemed personally responsible for their plight.\u201d In other words, scarcity and a lack of resources made participants more conservative in their outlook.But when participants were told there was \u201cno scarcity,\u201d liberals awarded benefits to everyone, and only conservatives made a distinction between giving to the \u201cdeserving\u201d and withholding from the \u201cundeserving.\u201d President Obama knows he has Boehner and the Republican House on the defensive.\u201cJust a few days after Christmas, more than one million of our fellow Americans lost a vital economic lifeline \u2013 the temporary insurance that helps folks make ends meet while they look for a job,\u201d Obama declared in his weekly radio address on Jan. 4.Hitting every note in the compassion playbook, the president said:\u201cRepublicans in Congress went home for the holidays and let that lifeline expire. And for many of their constituents who are unemployed through no fault of their own, that decision will leave them with no income at all. We make this promise to one another because it makes a difference to a mother who needs help feeding her kids while she\u2019s looking for work; to a father who needs help paying the rent while learning the skills to get a new and better job. And denying families that security is just plain cruel. We\u2019re a better country than that. We don\u2019t abandon our fellow Americans when times get tough \u2013 we keep the faith with them until they start that new job.\u201dOn Tuesday the Senate voted, with the support of six Republicans, to reject a filibuster and take up legislation that would extend long-term unemployment benefits for three months. A major sticking point remains: whether the legislation will be paid for by new revenues or by separate spending cuts as demanded by many Republicans. John Boehner can read tea leaves as well as anyone, and he knows that in order to protect his members who are running in battleground districts, he cannot afford to let the compassion gap get too wide. The Tea Party is the loser in this calculus and the long-term unemployed are likely to be the winners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Muted Beginning to Sales of Apple\u2019s iPhone Through China Mobile ", "Date": "2014-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple is counting on a long-awaited agreement with China Mobile, the world\u2019s largest cellular operator, to make major headway in China. But before Apple declares any major degree of success, the technology giant may need to overcome some significant hurdles.A hint of the challenges was apparent on Friday, when customers were finally able to buy iPhones from China Mobile. At a store in Beijing, only about a dozen customers showed up to buy iPhones, despite the appearance of Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive. It was a far cry from the long lines that usually accompany a big introduction in the United StatesApple and Mr. Cook have made improved sales in China a high priority \u2014 and that has meant getting on China Mobile, which has more than 750 million customers. Mr. Cook\u2019s presence in China this week signaled the importance that Apple has attached to the market.Sales will not necessarily come easy. As the country\u2019s economy boomed, some other Western brands in China gained a loyal following. From Gillette razors to Walmart stores, American products and companies were generally seen as superior to domestic alternatives, even though many of the products, like iPhones, were assembled in China.But recently, foreign brands have been subjected to intense scrutiny by the Chinese news media, especially the state-run CCTV, prompting consumers to reconsider domestic alternatives. In one recent example, Walmart recalled donkey meat that it was selling at several outlets in China after it was found to have been tainted with fox meat.When iPhones were introduced in China five years ago by the country\u2019s second-largest mobile operator, China Unicom, they found a ready market among trend-conscious consumers. Since then, despite adding the country\u2019s third-biggest carrier, China Telecom, to its lineup, Apple has lost ground to the market leader in smartphones, Samsung Electronics, and lower-end domestic rivals. Apple\u2019s market share in China has fallen into the single digits.\u201cApple used to be the must-have, aspirational brand for all wealthy and middle-class Chinese consumers,\u201d said Shaun Rein, managing director of the China Market Research Group and the author of \u201cThe End of Cheap China.\u201d \u201cBut over the last year, there has been a real deterioration of the Apple brand.\u201dSome American tech giants continue to thrive in China. Microsoft remains the overwhelmingly dominant provider of PC operating systems. Others, like Facebook and Twitter, have been blocked from entering China, and still others have faded.Google was once a leading search engine in China, but then lost ground to a local rival, Baidu, and scaled back its presence in the country rather than submit to censorship demands. Motorola was once a power in mobile phones in China, but it was supplanted by companies like Nokia of Finland \u2014 which, in turn, yielded leadership to Apple and Samsung. More recently, Cisco Systems, the maker of telecommunications network equipment, said sales in China had been hurt by disclosures of surveillance by the National Security Agency.Apple still has fans, including Xia Bingyi, a 26-year-old customer from the eastern Chinese city of Jinan. She was one of 10 people who won a trip to Beijing to buy an iPhone on the opening day of China Mobile\u2019s offering. Ms. Xia already owned an iPhone 4 she bought two years ago, but said she did not hesitate to sign up for a new iPhone 5S once China Mobile began offering it.\u201cThis is like manna from heaven!\u201d she said.Among consumers who have to pay their own way, however, price has been a big barrier to bringing the iPhone to a broader audience in China. The list price of 5,288 renminbi (about $870) an iPhone in China is more than many people\u2019s monthly salary, especially outside the major cities.China Mobile has been less aggressive on pricing and subsidies than some analysts had expected. To get the iPhone 5S free of charge, subscribers must commit to a two-year contract at 588 renminbi a month.China Unicom and China Telecom, which together have about 450 million customers, have cut the price of their competing iPhone packages only modestly since China Mobile announced its Apple agreement in December.\u201cThere won\u2019t be a subsidy war among the three operators because they have already learned that they need to control this,\u201d said Jun Zhang, an analyst at Wedge Partners, an equity research firm.On Sina Weibo, a microblogging service, some users complained about the pricing of the iPhone 5S by China Mobile, saying they could get smuggled versions from Hong Kong for less money.\u201cThe model is the same,\u201d one contributor wrote on Weibo. \u201cI want the cheaper one.\u201dBefore the deal with Apple, China Mobile said 45 million people were using iPhones on its network, most of them acquired from Hong Kong or via other unofficial channels. This accounts for more than 60 percent of the iPhones in use in China, according to Craig Yu, research director at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, a research firm.China Mobile, which has 3,000 stores, has one big advantage over its two rivals \u2014 the fast network it is building, using so-called 4G technology. China Unicom and China Telecom are still relying on the slower, previous generation technology.But this could bring muddled results for Apple, because analysts say some China Mobile iPhone sales will come from customers already using iPhones and just switching carriers. As a result, estimates of iPhone sales by China Mobile, which have ranged from fewer than 10 million annually to more than 30 million, might not budge its market share as much as the unit sales might suggest.An Apple spokeswoman, Carolyn Wu, declined to comment on the first-day sales figures.Previously, China Mobile had reported more than one million preorders for the phone via its website since the deal was announced in December.Mr. Zhang at Wedge Partners said such online registrations generally resulted in firm orders in only about a third of the cases, meaning Apple could expect to sell about 400,000 iPhones.Over all, including the effect of customers switching from rival networks, Mr. Zhang said he expected Apple to sell about one million more phones a month in China as a result of the deal, on top of the roughly three million it has been selling.In a market of more than one billion mobile phone customers, those are somewhat modest figures. That may help explain why even Mr. Cook seemed to be looking as much to the future as to the present as he traveled to Beijing for the China Mobile introduction.\u201cToday is just the beginning of China Mobile and Apple coming together to deliver the best experience in the world,\u201d Mr. Cook said at an appearance on Friday.Analysts say Apple could probably broaden its potential market in China by making phones with features that appeal more to Chinese consumers, like bigger screens. Handsets like the Samsung Note 3, which has a 5.7-inch screen, compared with the 4-inch screen of the Apple 5S and 5C, have been selling well in China.\u201cWe never talk about future things,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cWe have great things we are working on but we want to keep them secret. That way you will be so much happier when you see it.\u201dShanshan Wang and Zhiyi Yang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Africans Continue to Protest in Israel", "Date": "2014-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 After years of living on the margins of Israeli society, thousands of African asylum seekers flooded the streets of central Tel Aviv for a second day on Monday to protest their treatment by the Israeli authorities and to demand recognition as refugees. Throngs marched to the United States Embassy on the Tel Aviv seafront, and delegations fanned out to the British, Canadian, French and Italian Embassies as well as the offices of the United Nations refugee agency, among others, to appeal for international attention and help. On Sunday, tens of thousands demonstrated in Rabin Square in Tel Aviv, many chanting, \u201cFreedom.\u201d The migrants also began a three-day strike, leaving many restaurants and hotels without dishwashers and cleaners. Although the concentrations of African migrants in the run-down neighborhoods of south Tel Aviv have caused friction with the local population, some celebrity chefs and cafe owners have come out in support of their striking workers, serving customers meals on paper plates.\u00a0Activists leading the asylum campaign said in a statement, \u201cWe believe this strike will demonstrate our importance to the Israeli economy and create a pressure that will cause them to change their policies.\u201d The representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Israel issued a rare, critical statement on Sunday, saying that Israel\u2019s laws and policies did not fit the spirit of a 1951 refugee convention. About 60,000 migrants have surreptitiously crossed into Israel over the once-porous border with Egypt since 2005, most of them Sudanese or Eritreans who cannot be sent back to their home countries because of the risks. Israel affords them protection from deportation in line with international conventions. But Israeli officials regard them as \u201cinfiltrators\u201d and insist that most of the Africans came as economic migrants looking for work. Only a few hundred applications for refugee status have been processed, and even fewer have been approved, leaving many of the migrants in a kind of limbo where they risk incarceration and cannot legally work.Israel recently constructed a steel fence along its border with Egypt, halting the influx, but the government maintains a tough policy designed to encourage those who are here to leave. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that 2,600 migrants left Israel last year. \u201cI would like to emphasize that these are not refugees, but people who are breaking the law and whom we will deal with to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe will continue to deport the illegal migrants from our cities.\u201dGideon Saar, the interior minister, said on television on Monday, \u201cWe have no intention of compromising.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Fed Policy Maker, Changing His Mind, Urges More Stimulus", "Date": "2014-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Narayana R. Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, was once a leading opponent of the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to stimulate the economy. Today, he has emerged as the only senior official arguing publicly that the Fed should do even more.The Fed\u2019s leadership, including Janet L. Yellen, soon to be the chairwoman but then the No. 2, decided in December that the economy was strong enough to start scaling back a long-running stimulus campaign. The Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday, is widely expected to announce another $10 billion cut in monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.But Mr. Kocherlakota (pronounced COACH-er-la-ko-tah) spent recent months crisscrossing the Midwestern region served by the Minneapolis Fed, telling audiences in Minnesota and Montana and Michigan that persistent unemployment has created \u201ca time of testing\u201d for the Fed comparable to the rise of inflation in the late 1970s and early 1980s. So far, he says, the Fed is falling short.\u201cAs this goes on, there\u2019s a temptation to think of this problem as being beyond what we as monetary policy makers can address,\u201d Mr. Kocherlakota said in an interview in mid-January in his office overlooking the Mississippi River. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t let the persistence of the problem lead us to the conclusion that we shouldn\u2019t do more.\u201dMr. Kocherlakota\u2019s outspoken advocacy for stronger action is particularly striking because he spent his first three years at the Minneapolis Fed, after his appointment in 2009, loudly arguing that the Fed should do less. It also represents a sharp break from the Minneapolis Fed\u2019s longstanding association with economists who contend that monetary policy lacks the power to reduce unemployment.Now, for the first time since Mr. Kocherlakota publicly changed his mind in September 2012, he begins a one-year term as a voting member of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, bringing new attention to his views.Mr. Kocherlakota, a former chairman of the economics department at the University of Minnesota, does not oppose reductions in the Fed\u2019s bond purchases, but he wants to compensate by strengthening its plans to suppress short-term interest rates. That is a view he ruefully acknowledges has not gained much traction with his colleagues.Mr. Kocherlakota\u2019s shift has surprised and dismayed some people at the Minneapolis Fed and economists who supported his appointment because they expected him to be a principled opponent of the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign.Edward C. Prescott, who won the Nobel in economic science in 2004 and is on the Minneapolis Fed\u2019s research staff, said Mr. Kocherlakota was misjudging the Fed\u2019s abilities. \u201cIt is an established scientific fact that monetary policy has had virtually no effect on output and employment in the U.S. since the formation of the Fed,\u201d Professor Prescott, also on the faculty of Arizona State University, wrote in an email. Bond buying, he wrote, \u201cis as effective in bringing prosperity as rain dancing is in bringing rain.\u201dMr. Kocherlakota, 50, is the youngest member of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee. Like many prominent macroeconomists, he is a quick wit who likes to argue, and he has remained confident in his views even as those views have changed.A football fan, he also likes to read British novels, which he sometimes refers to in speeches. He said he was reading \u201cBrideshead Revisited\u201d for the fourth or fifth time because, \u201cOne way to relax is to read things you\u2019ve read before.\u201dMr. Kocherlakota was born in Baltimore and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba. His name is Indian, reflecting his father\u2019s ancestry. He enrolled at Princeton at age 15, where he developed an interest in economics because it married mathematics and public policy. He earned a doctorate from the University of Chicago at age 23, and began a successful academic career with a diverse set of research interests. The financial crisis rekindled his interest in public policy and, in 2009, he joined the Minneapolis Fed as an established critic of the government\u2019s efforts to revive the economy.As a prominent professor at the University of Minnesota, Mr. Kocherlakota signed an open letter in September 2008 expressing \u201cgreat concern\u201d about the government\u2019s efforts to save financial firms from collapse, and another in January 2009 opposing the Obama administration\u2019s fiscal stimulus plan.In August 2011, after joining the Fed, he publicly criticized the central bank\u2019s decision to expand its monetary stimulus campaign in an unusual video statement posted on the website of the Minneapolis Fed, which warned in part that the effort was likely to unleash inflation.Mr. Kocherlakota now says that his views had already had begun to change. He had given a speech on Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula in the summer of 2010 asserting that the Fed largely lacked the power to reduce unemployment because the problem was not a lack of job openings, but a lack of workers qualified to fill those openings.\u201cMonetary stimulus has provided conditions so that manufacturing plants want to hire new workers,\u201d Mr. Kocherlakota said back then. \u201cBut the Fed does not have a means to transform construction workers into manufacturing workers.\u201dOver the next two years, Mr. Kocherlakota said that a wave of research gradually convinced him that he was wrong. Mr. Kocherlakota had speculated, for example, that some workers might be unable to take jobs in other cities because their mortgage debts exceeded the value of their homes. Research by his own staff, however, found little evidence of this \u201chouse lock\u201d phenomenon.\u201cIt\u2019s a little embarrassing to say this, but you make a speech in August of 2010 and it inspires a whole quantity of work where people say, \u2018This is what Kocherlakota says and we will now show in this paper that Kocherlakota was wrong,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a number of ways that people can react to that, and I reacted in the only way that a sensible person can, which is to update.\u201dIn September 2012, shortly after the Fed announced a fresh expansion of its stimulus campaign, Mr. Kocherlakota returned to Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula to announce that he had changed his mind. Contrary to his prediction, inflation was slowing. That meant the Fed had the opportunity and responsibility to do more.The speech surprised people on both sides of the debate about Fed policy. Proponents of stimulus hailed Mr. Kocherlakota for what they described as intellectual honesty. Some of his former allies saw evidence that he had never shared their understanding of the way the economy works.\u201cSuffice to say that I am very surprised by his current policy views and how he articulates them,\u201d Stephen Williamson, a professor of economics at Washington University in Saint Louis, said in an email. \u201cI don\u2019t think his views have changed. I think this is just a side of Narayana we didn\u2019t know was there.\u201dIn October, Mr. Kocherlakota fired Patrick J. Kehoe, an economics professor at the University of Minnesota, from his position as a monetary policy adviser at the Minneapolis Fed. Another Fed adviser, Ellen R. McGrattan, was given a new position as a consultant. Both Professor Kehoe and Ms. McGrattan are proponents of the view that monetary policy has little power to lift an economy from recession.Some critics, including Professor Prescott, suggested that Mr. Kocherlakota was limiting internal debate and shifting the focus of the Minneapolis Fed\u2019s research. Mr. Kocherlakota declined to comment on the changes directly but said that he sees a \u201ctremendous continuity\u201d in the bank\u2019s research agenda. His board issued a statement backing his leadership.Mr. Kocherlakota did not just join the advocates of stimulus; he surpassed them. Most Fed officials have now concluded that the central bank is doing enough. But Mr. Kocherlakota maintains that the Fed should declare its intent to keep short-term interest rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate is above 5.5 percent. The unemployment rate, 6.7 percent in December, is rapidly approaching the 6.5 percent threshold the Fed established in December 2012.He said, however, that he did not necessarily plan to issue a new round of public dissents if the Fed under Ms. Yellen continues to retreat.

Facing Opposition to Trade Pacts", "Date": "2014-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For companies like General Electric and Honeywell, it would help open untapped global markets, lift exports and create middle-class American jobs. For labor groups like the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Teamsters, it is a threat to American workers, bound to lead to lost jobs and lower wages, as well as rising corporate profits.At issue is the so-called fast-track trade approval, a green light from Congress for the Obama administration to complete two sweeping trade deals, one with Pacific Rim countries and the other with Europe.President Obama, supported by many Republicans and business groups, has asked for fast-track approval to ease the eventual passage of his trade deals, which he argues would provide a shot in the arm for the economy. But he has run into staunch opposition from members of his own party, as well as labor and environmental groups. They fear a further loss of jobs to the forces of globalization and technological change and inadequate protections against environmental damage.In the past, trade deals often faced congressional opposition and long parliamentary delays, but eventually they almost inevitably won approval. This time, Mr. Obama appears to be losing the argument. And without fast track, which ensures that lawmakers cannot make changes to either deal, foreign trading partners might hesitate to agree to American demands.This week, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, came out against fast track, also known as trade-promotion authority, just a day after Mr. Obama had pushed for the two trade deals in his State of the Union address.\u201cI\u2019m against fast track,\u201d Mr. Reid told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cEveryone would be well advised just to not push this right now.\u201dMr. Reid\u2019s comments suggested that the Senate might not even take up fast-track legislation in the near term \u2014 let alone pass it \u2014 complicating the administration\u2019s continuing negotiations with foreign leaders.In July, the United States and the European Union opened trade talks, which are still considered to be in the preliminary stages. In December, Washington and 11 other Pacific Rim nations ended a round of talks on a sweeping trade deal aimed not only at reducing tariffs and trade barriers but also providing other benefits sought by some businesses. Officials involved in the talks said they would resume this year.The White House said that the administration was aware of Mr. Reid\u2019s position and that it would continue to campaign for fast-track authority and the two trade deals more generally. \u201cLeader Reid has always been clear on his position on this particular issue,\u201d said Jay Carney, Mr. Obama\u2019s press secretary. The president, he said, \u201cwill continue to work to enact bipartisan trade-promotion authority.\u201dThe United States trade representative, Michael Froman, said the administration remained confident it could negotiate a comprehensive deal that would bolster the American economy \u2014 and win over skeptics.\u201cWe have made clear that we\u2019re committed to negotiating a high-standard, ambitious comprehensive deal,\u201d Mr. Froman said in an interview. \u201cIf we can achieve that with our trading partners, we\u2019ll be able to sell it to the American public and to Congress.\u201dBut Mr. Reid\u2019s comments cast serious doubt on the administration\u2019s push. It also led to a sharp backlash from Republicans, who generally support such trade deals and see an opportunity to capitalize on the election-year rift among Democrats.House Republican leaders kicked off their annual retreat, at a Chesapeake Bay resort, by highlighting the divide between the president and the Senate majority leader. \u201cIs the president going to stand up and lead on this issue?\u201d asked House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio.Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 3 House Republican leader, added: \u201cThe president said he has a phone in his hand. The first call he should make is to Harry Reid to talk about trade.\u201dAt the heart of the disagreement among Democrats is the effect of trade liberalization on jobs. Mr. Obama and many moderate Democrats, supported by business leaders and many economists, argue that the deals would lift exports and help create more valuable jobs in manufacturing and services, even if some other jobs were lost to cheaper foreign producers. But many Democrats, joined by some economists, fear that any new trade deals, whatever their overall benefit to the economy, are likely to exacerbate the income inequality that Mr. Obama has made the banner economic issue of his remaining years in office.\u201cThe question is what are your policies doing,\u201d Mr. Furman said, adding that the whole point of the Pacific Rim trade deal \u201cis not just to sit back and passively accept globalization, including the challenges it poses, but to try to reshape it and move it in a positive direction.\u201d He said the United States might become less competitive globally if it disengaged from seeking further trade openings. \u201cIf you\u2019re not in an agreement \u2014 that trade will be diverted from us to someone else \u2014 we will lose out to another country,\u201d Mr. Furman said.Labor and environmental groups, joined by numerous progressive lawmakers, have not been swayed by such arguments. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very vigorous grass-roots campaign,\u201d said Bill Samuel, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s legislative director. \u201cIt will create some jobs, but we will lose far more jobs.\u201dReferring to the arguments by proponents of the two pacts, he added, \u201cIt always turns out to be far worse than they predict.\u201dTrade deals have never been politically popular, and an increasingly populist Congress, on both sides of the aisle, is reflecting that sentiment. \u201cThe Senate has changed,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. \u201cThe country has always been ahead of Congress on trade agreements. The country has never wanted these very much.\u201dJonathan Weisman contributed reporting from Cambridge, Md., and Steven Greenhouse from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Expect Job Data Alone to Persuade Fed on Rates", "Date": "2014-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceJust over a year ago, the Federal Reserve changed its guidance on how long it planned to keep interest rates very low.The low rate, it said, would \u201cbe appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent,\u201d assuming that inflation and expectations for inflation also remained low.Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, told a news conference at the time that this signaled no real change from the previous statement that the central bank expected to maintain superlow rates \u201cat least through mid-2015.\u201d That was the case, he said on Dec. 12, 2012, because the Fed thought the unemployment rate, at 7.8 percent in the most recent report then available, would stay above 6.5 percent until at least mid-2015.Next week, Mr. Bernanke\u2019s term ends and he will be succeeded by Janet L. Yellen, the vice chairwoman. A week after that will come the January jobs report. With the December unemployment rate at 6.7 percent, it is at least possible that the 6.5 percent target will be reached then, or within a month or two after that. Inflation has remained low.But do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates anytime soon. Since the Fed set the 6.5 percent target, the unemployment rate has been the odd man out in terms of economic statistics. It has fallen faster than the Fed, or most private forecasters, expected. But economic growth, as measured by the gross domestic product, has lagged behind those forecasts. During the last year, as the Fed grew more optimistic about the unemployment rate, it grew less optimistic about overall economic growth.Ms. Yellen has gone out of her way since then to point to a number of other labor market indicators, none of which have improved as much as the unemployment rate. The indicators she cited included the number of workers unemployed for extended periods of time. She pointed out that during the worst part of the severe recession of the early 1980s, the median time that unemployed people said they had been unemployed was 12 weeks. That figure peaked at 25 weeks \u2014 nearly six months \u2014 in 2010 and is at 17 weeks in the latest jobs report. Moreover, it has been rising since last summer as those out of work for brief periods found jobs while others did not.Indeed, the short-term unemployment rate \u2014 the proportion of the labor force out of work for less than 15 weeks \u2014 has fallen to 3.1 percent. It was higher than that before the recession. The reason the overall unemployment rate remains well above prerecession levels is that the long-term unemployment rate is at 3.6 percent and declining only slowly. Another indicator that Ms. Yellen pointed to reflects how well people with jobs are doing. That is labor\u2019s share of income in the nonfinancial corporate sector, a figure estimated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics each quarter.For decades, from 1950 through the early 2000s, labor\u2019s share rarely exceeded 66 percent and almost never fell below 61 percent.But it fell below 60 percent in 2005 and then plunged after the recession began. The last figure reported was 57.1 percent, barely above the 2011 low. Ms. Yellen appears to bring to her new job both an economist\u2019s love of statistics and a liberal\u2019s concern over those who fall behind. That was also shown in her early academic work, which focused on the labor market.\u201cBernanke was in place when thwarting depression dynamics was job No. 1,\u201d said Robert J. Barbera, the co-director of the Center for Financial Economics at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cYellen takes over amid some challenging issues surrounding labor markets. Given their particular areas of expertise, you have to like the handoff at this juncture,\u201d he said. Mr. Bernanke had studied the Great Depression when he was a professor.Thus, they argued, it could be perfectly rational for a worker to prefer to hold out for a better job that might be available when the economy improved, just as owners of empty new office buildings may prefer to wait for the market to improve rather than accept the depressed rents available during a recession.Some economists have pointed to the fact that some unemployed workers did not take whatever jobs were available as evidence that they preferred \u201cleisure\u201d over income and even concluded that such preferences argue against providing unemployment insurance because people are unemployed by choice.\u201cOur model offers an alternative rationale for a high elasticity of labor supply with respect to transitory wage movements,\u201d the 1990 paper said, using the kind of stilted language that economists seem to expect. \u201cIf the wage were rising more rapidly than the rate of time preference, a rational worker seeking long-term work would optimally wait for work, rather than commit to the best job currently available. This behavior occurs even if workers place no value at all on leisure.\u201dAt her confirmation hearing in November, Ms. Yellen was asked about the Fed\u2019s ability to increase jobs. She conceded there were \u201ca multitude of things\u201d that the Fed could not change, mentioning education and job training. \u201cBut what we can do,\u201d she added, \u201cis try to achieve, as we are, a robust recovery so that we create jobs, we have a stronger job market. And in a stronger job market, people who are having a lot of trouble getting jobs will be drawn into jobs. They\u2019ll get better jobs. There\u2019ll be more training. People will move up job ladders and opportunities will increase.\u201d Given her concerns about such issues as long-term unemployment, don\u2019t expect a 6.5 percent unemployment rate to foreshadow any meaningful change in Fed policy in the near future.Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

{"Headline": "Citing Growth, Fed Again Cuts Monthly Bond Purchases", "Date": "2014-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In its final major decision under the leadership of Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that it would continue to slowly dismantle its stimulus campaign, citing \u201cgrowing underlying strength in the broader economy.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s policy-making committee voted unanimously to pare monthly bond purchases by another $10 billion \u2014 its first unanimous vote since 2011 \u2014 despite lingering concerns about the health of the United States economy and growing signs that the Fed\u2019s retreat is causing problems in emerging markets including Turkey.The decision reflected the optimism of Fed officials that the domestic economy is finally poised for faster growth after years of false starts and setbacks. It allows Mr. Bernanke, the Fed chairman since 2006, who once hoped to oversee the end of the stimulus campaign, to step down Friday having at least directed the first steps.Looking ahead, Mr. Bernanke also leaves a clear road map pointing toward an end of the Fed\u2019s bond purchases in October or December. His successor, Janet L. Yellen, has supported that plan as the Fed\u2019s vice chairwoman. She is likely to give the first indication of her own views when she testifies before Congress next month.Stock indexes fell Wednesday as the Fed\u2019s retreat rippled through global markets, driving money toward less risky investments like Treasury securities. The broad Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 1 percent to close at 1,774.20, while the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note hit a two-month high. The Fed\u2019s retreat is producing a global shift in investment patterns as investors who chased higher returns in foreign markets are beginning to anticipate the return of higher interest rates in the United States. That is causing problems in countries like Turkey that depend heavily on foreign investment.In Turkey, the central bank tried to bolster that nation\u2019s currency Tuesday by sharply raising the benchmark rate, but the Turkish lira and other currencies of emerging markets \u2014 including that of South Africa, which also raised interest rates \u2014 continued to slump Wednesday.Fed officials, focused on the health of the American economy, are unlikely to adjust policy in response to the foreign turmoil unless they see stronger evidence that it is a threat to the domestic economy.\u201cIn the end of the day, we live in a modern, global financial system and this is, I think, just part of the world that we live in, in terms of monetary policy in the United States having effects outside the United States,\u201d John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said recently at the Brookings Institution.\u201cThe clear Fed default position is that tapering will continue,\u201d wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cIt would take serious U.S. weakness or a real emerging market disaster to make the F.O.M.C. pause.\u201dIndeed, the turmoil may make it easier for the Fed to retreat. Investors seeking to limit their risks are bidding up the price of Treasury bonds, counteracting the effect of the Fed\u2019s gradual reduction in the volume of its own purchases. Problems in Turkey, in other words, help to hold down interest rates in Omaha.Some investors, and Fed officials, also view the turbulence as the unavoidable price of a necessary reduction in the central bank\u2019s role in financial markets \u2014 particularly in the bond purchases, which are known collectively as quantitative easing.\u201cWe applaud the continuing removal of QE \u2014 even in the face of weaker economic data and higher market volatility,\u201d wrote Rick Rieder, a fixed-income investment manager at BlackRock. \u201cWe believe the program has outlived its usefulness.\u201dThe statement Wednesday from the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making group of the Federal Reserve, offers its assessment of current economic conditions.The Fed expanded its holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities by $85 billion each month in 2013 in an effort to spur job creation and drive down unemployment. In December the Fed announced that it would cut the volume to $75 billion in January. It said Wednesday that it would further reduce the volume of purchases to $65 billion in February: $30 billion of mortgage bonds, $35 billion of Treasuries. It also said it was \u201clikely\u201d to continue the retreat, setting the table for another $10 billion cut at the next meeting of the Fed\u2019s policy committee in March.The Fed did not change its guidance that it intends to keep short-term interest rates near zero \u201cwell past the time\u201d that the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent. The unemployment rate was 6.7 percent in December. The question of what to say next about interest rates \u2014 rather than how quickly to taper bond buying \u2014 is likely to be the first significant challenge of Ms. Yellen\u2019s tenure.\u201cIt will take a pretty big data surprise to knock the Fed off its course of a $10 billion per meeting reduction in asset purchases,\u201d Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote Wednesday. \u201cThis should make Yellen\u2019s job a little easier \u2014 if we don\u2019t get any big data surprises \u2014 but still leaves open the question of how forward guidance will evolve as unemployment continues to move lower.\u201dMr. Bernanke and other Fed officials have expressed growing optimism about the economic outlook for 2014, citing the combination of a strengthening private sector and the absence of fresh cuts in government spending.Wednesday\u2019s statement said that growth \u201cpicked up in recent quarters,\u201d citing strength in household spending and business investment.He added: \u201cAnother thing I\u2019m hearing is that the fourth quarter was pretty good; December was stronger than people expected.\u201dDespite the signs of an improving American economy, though, investors remain on edge about prospects here and in the rest of the world. The Dow Jones industrial average fell an even greater amount than the S.&P. 500, down 189.77 points, or 1.2 percent, to 15,738.79. The Nasdaq composite dropped 46.53 points, or 1.1 percent, to 4,051.43. In the bond market, interest rates fell. The yield on the Treasury\u2019s 10-year note dropped to 2.68 percent, from 2.75 percent late Tuesday, while its price rose 21/32, to 100 20/32.On Thursday, Asian stock markets also declined, with the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo falling about 3 percent in early trading. It was a quiet end for Mr. Bernanke, who after failing to foresee the financial crisis led the Fed\u2019s widely praised efforts to contain the damage, and then its more tentative campaign to help restore the flow of economic activity.The Fed did not observe the occasion publicly. It is likely that Mr. Bernanke\u2019s colleagues paid tribute during the meeting, but the Fed will not release a transcript for five years.The praise that Fed officials lavished on his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, upon his retirement in 2006, was not disclosed until 2011. By then, of course, Mr. Greenspan\u2019s legacy had come to be seen in a very different light. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Couples", "Date": "2014-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 From the bland figure of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who rose to the pinnacle as Monsieur Normal, have cascaded of late some startling revelations, as if the French president had abruptly decided he was boring even himself.First there was his love affair with the actress Julie Gayet. No real surprise there, but the images published by the tabloid Closer did seem to reduce the lofty presidency \u2014 De Gaulle\u2019s seat of French glory \u2014 to the level of a motorcycle courier service. A suitable caption for the helmeted gentleman en route to a tryst might have been: \u201cI am more normal than you think.\u201dWhen I asked Christine Ockrent, an acute observer of France, what she thought of the \u201caffaire,\u201d her immediate response was: \u201cHe\u2019s a man. It\u2019s normal.\u201d It would not damage Hollande for now, his popularity being so low anyway.In matters of the heart the French shrug holds sway. This is healthy. \u201cBof, c\u2019est normal,\u201d a ubiquitous phrase, is the shrugging expression of a fierce realism about life in general and sex in particular. As Saul Bellow observes in his novel Ravelstein, \u201cThe French were genuinely educated \u2014 or had been so once. They had taken a bad beating in this century. However, they had a real feeling for beautiful objects still, for leisure, for reading and conversation; they didn\u2019t despise creaturely needs \u2014 the human basics.\u201dThe French are indeed at home with creaturely needs. They do not squirm. They do not preach. It is safe enough to predict that Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, the first lady spurned, will not be at the White House with Hollande next month. She has been badly treated. Beyond that it is likely that the only consequence of Monsieur Normal\u2019s late-night forays will be the further demystification of the Fifth Republic\u2019s highest office, a process underway since Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s death in 1996.Bof, c\u2019est normal.The second revelation about Hollande may be of greater consequence. It came at a recent press conference but, because of the affair, was scarcely noted. In the midst of a performance that was a tour de force he let drop a confession that was brave. \u201cAm I a Social Democrat?\u201d Hollande said. \u201cYes.\u201dThis may not seem a radical statement in the second decade of the 21st century, but it still is in France. Hollande, adhering to French socialist principle, had never previously ventured this far. To do so was to concede that his goal is to soften the harsh edges of capitalism rather than overturn it; to pursue social cohesion through compromise between capital and labor rather than class struggle; to suggest (heresy of heresies) that wealth must first be accumulated before it can be distributed; and to abandon the heady glory of the Popular Front for staid old German social democracy.But, you may say, all this happened long ago \u2014 and you would be right. That, however, is not the point. The lexicon of political ideology is more important in France than anywhere. Hollande crossed a doctrinal line. This, in Paris, constitutes an event.Hollande went further, proposing big business tax and budget cuts, even suggesting he was a supply-sider. A name doing the rounds in Paris is suddenly that of the last Social Democrat to lead Germany, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. During his time in office, a decade ago, reforms were passed that cut social benefits and changed the rules for receiving them in ways that meant it no longer made economic sense to remain unemployed rather than take a low-paying job. The German left partially dismantled the welfare state built by the German left. Unemployment fell, the economy boomed. Germany today is Germany and France is France.This brings us to another troubled couple that once held hands, did big things and had big dreams \u2014 only to fall into a sulk. That would be France and Germany.Because the war generation is gone, because the balance in the relationship was lost to German dominance, and because ever-closer union in Europe has withered as a political idea, the nations have been looking past each other. But there are stirrings. The return of the Social Democrats in a German grand coalition and Hollande\u2019s ideological pivot has led to talk of what Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, recently called \u201ca new impulse to Franco-German cooperation.\u201dWith Britain consumed by anti-European rumblings, nothing is more important for the future of Europe than a reinvigorated French-German couple focused on political and budgetary integration, reignited growth, renewed democratic legitimacy and a revived European idea. Social democracy may be old but, as Germany shows, it is needed.A German car rental company, Sixt, has been mocking Hollande with an ad that says: \u201cMr. President, next time avoid the scooter. Sixt rents cars with tinted windows.\u201d Bof. Who cares? Step into the light, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, and lead an old couple back.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Made That Nigerian Scam?", "Date": "2014-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWho Made That?The Nigerian scam may seem like a scourge of the Internet age, but it actually predates email. Before we started getting all-caps proposals in our inboxes, con men in West Africa plied their trade by fax and paper letter. Some of the first scams to make their way to Western Europe arrived by telex in 1989 and 1990, when businessmen in Britain started hearing that a wayward tanker of Nigerian crude could have its cargo claimed for bargain prices \u2014 in exchange, of course, for some cash upfront. Before then, Nigerian fraudsters aimed their grifts at locals. One scheme was the \u201cwash-wash,\u201d a literal money-laundering in which the mark is shown a valise of supposed bills blackened with Vaseline and iodine and promised a cut if he pays for an expensive cleaning agent.Advance-fee or 419 scams, known by the section of the Nigerian criminal code that outlaws fraud, took on a global character when oil prices crashed along with the national economy. A newly installed military ruler, Ibrahim Babangida, cut salaries for civil servants and the military and ended price supports for the local currency. Within three years, the country\u2019s inflation rate was greater than 38 percent. The English-speaking, entrepreneurial class found itself with little buying power and in need of foreign money. \u201cSome of these guys came out and started perpetrating fraud,\u201d says Andrew Apter, an Africa historian at U.C.L.A. \u201cThey used the language and insignias and letterhead of financial offices to lure people in.\u201dApter has traced this sort of misuse of official iconography as far back as a century. When Nigeria was established as a colony under British rule in 1914, its first governor cracked down on scammers in fake uniforms who claimed to be collecting taxes on behalf of the empire. The advance-fee scam itself \u2014 whereby payments are extracted from a sucker who hopes to gain an enormous treasure \u2014 seems to have originated elsewhere. According to Robert Whitaker, a historian at the University of Texas, an earlier version of the con, known as the Spanish Swindle or the Spanish Prisoner trick, plagued Britain throughout the 19th century.These days, an address in Lagos would seem to be a red flag for prospective dupes, but it may be helpful for some scammers. In 2012, a researcher with Microsoft named Cormac Herley tried to model the con artist\u2019s behavior and concluded that a clear tip-off \u2014 an email address in Nigeria, for example \u2014 could, by scaring off the savvier or more suspicious sorts, enable them to focus on the most gullible victims.SCAMMING THE SCAMMERSAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Low Inflation Worries the Euro Zone ", "Date": "2014-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Consumer prices in the euro zone barely increased last month, raising fears of deflation and putting pressure on the European Central Bank to take further action.The European Central Bank seeks to keep price growth steady at about 2 percent. The situation now, in which the rate of inflation is falling, is known as disinflation. If the situation continues in this direction, Europe could face outright deflation \u2014 a debilitating economic condition in which prices actually decline across the board.As long as hints of deflation remain, the E.C.B. faces a difficult challenge.Economists do not, for the most part, expect the E.C.B. to take action when its Governing Council meets on Thursday in Frankfurt. But the issue is certain to figure prominently in discussions between the bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, and his colleagues.Clemente De Lucia, an economist at BNP Paribas, said on Tuesday that the December consumer price data might have been affected by a change in the way Germany calculated its inflation, so another month or two might be needed to be certain of the trend.\u201cYet, the level of inflation remains dangerously low,\u201d he wrote in a note. \u201cSurvey data show that the recovery is gaining some momentum. Yet its pace will remain rather low and it needs to be sustained by policy maker actions.\u201dSpain\u2019s consumer prices rose just 0.3 percent, while Italy\u2019s rose only 0.2 percent, as those two countries\u2019 troubled economies teetered near a deflationary cliff.Deflation would only add to the broader economic malaise in the region, by hurting corporate profits and by leading consumers to delay purchases in anticipation of better deals in the future. It would also weigh heavily on borrowers, making loan repayments more expensive in real terms \u2014 a particular danger for Europe\u2019s already fragile financial sector.In the view of at least one outside observer, Europe\u2019s deflationary pressure may be a symptom of a larger problem, in which austerity measures and imbalances among countries in the region have hampered growth. Jacob J. Lew, the United States Treasury secretary, said on Tuesday at a news conference in Paris that Europe needed to focus more on investment and stimulating demand, suggesting that the Continent\u2019s most powerful economic engine, Germany, should take the lead.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that some countries have more capacity to stimulate growth and demand than others do,\u201d Mr. Lew said, in a clear reference to Germany.\u201cShort-term demand has to be part of the agenda,\u201d added Mr. Lew, who is on the Continent this week for talks with government leaders and finance officials in Paris, Berlin and Lisbon. \u201cIt\u2019s too important to look at a single economic statistic.\u201dMr. Draghi has suggested that the bank\u2019s toolbox for addressing falling prices has not been exhausted, and includes the possibility of enacting negative interest rates \u2014 in effect, punishing commercial banks for depositing funds at the central bank. The goal of such a move would be to force banks to pump more money into the economy in the form of lending, which could have at least a mild inflationary effect.An earlier version of this article erroneously included one euro zone member state among those covered by the December data on inflation. The inflation rate in Latvia, which adopted the euro Jan. 1, was not reflected in the data.Advertisement"}

On Jan. 1, Greece took over the leadership at a crucial time for itself and for the union. The most troubled member, still dependent on loans from its partners and with its coalition government hanging on to power by a slim majority in Parliament, will represent the European Union for six months as its 28 members confront major questions on the group\u2019s identity and future. This presidency will not be business as usual. Elections for the European Parliament in May are expected to result in significant gains by parties of the extreme right whose mission is to undermine European unification. Greece\u2019s plight highlights the fact that European Union members are not equal, that some are grappling with debts while others are obliged to lend them money. This has allowed old prejudices to return, testing the limits of solidarity. But Greece, along with its partners and the bureaucrats at the European Union\u2019s headquarters in Brussels and at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, has to make this presidency a success. This is a make-or-break moment: The members have to show whether they will reinforce the union or let it drift. In terms of the economy, the union has allowed itself to be seen as being as weak as its weakest member. It cannot afford to do this at the political level. The situation is awkward indeed. It is difficult to see how the government of a country that depends on foreign loans will meet the target, set out in the European Union\u2019s strategic framework adopted in December 2012, of strengthening \u201cthe union\u2019s capacity to respond to the current economic, financial and social challenges.\u201d Can Greece afford the cost, in treasure and human resources, when its economy has shrunk by roughly a quarter since 2008, with unemployment over 27 percent, with taxpayers groaning under the weight of ever higher taxes in return for fewer benefits, and with the civil service facing drastic cuts? These are questions posed not only by European editorial writers but also by Greek citizens, who wonder whether the money could be put to better use. The issue, though, is not the 50 million euros that Greece expects to spend over the next six months as it hosts some 14 informal ministerial meetings and between 100 and 120 working groups on a range of issues. Rather, is Greece up to the task of being a competent member of the union, and can the union concentrate its resources and vision to make a success of the presidency? The Greek prime minister will not be the European Union \u201cpresident\u201d in the White House sense, but rather will present for discussion objectives decided by the organization over a year ago, and his ministers will preside over meetings of their colleagues. The union sets out 18-month policy programs to be executed by the next three countries holding the rotating presidency. Greece is the third presiding country in this program (following Ireland and Lithuania) and a file of some 180 pending issues has been handed over to Athens. The presiding country, of course, is able to highlight some issues, delay others, perhaps even surprise us with an inspired idea (something that has been lacking during the crisis). This is Greece\u2019s fifth presidency since it joined what was then the European Economic Community in 1981. It held the post in 1983, 1988, 1994 and 2003. At the start of its challenging last presidency, in January 2003, unity was threatened by some members (notably Britain and Spain) who aligned themselves with the United States as it prepared to invade Iraq; most members opposed the war. The Greek presidency helped cool things down and, toward the end of the semester, Athens\u2019s ancient agora hosted the signing of the accession treaties, by which 10 new members joined. Of course, 2003 is a world away: Greece was booming and about to host a successful Summer Olympics. In the years that followed, public spending and debt flew out of control, leading to the crisis that made Greece the first country to ask its union partners for support. If Greece\u2019s stewardship is deemed successful, this may give the government in Athens a necessary push before May\u2019s elections for the European Parliament, which in Greece will coincide with elections for municipal and provincial governments. If the government does badly in those polls (especially in the European Parliament one, which in Greece has always been regarded as a referendum on government policies), Prime Minister Antonis Samaras\u2019s position will be untenable, forcing him to hold early national elections. In the coming months, the European Union will be occupied with fostering economic growth and employment, reaching agreement on a banking union, simplifying procedures to boost competitiveness, and setting policy objectives in the areas of migration, security and justice. These issues are important for the future of the union and its members. Success will depend not as much on what Greece does as on the political will of union members to make tough decisions. As many of these imply handing over more national sovereignty in order to create a stronger union, the stakes are very high: Anything short of success will play into the hands of those who oppose unification, yet the fear of \u201cEuroskeptic\u201d parties makes governments wary of handing over more power to the union. Greece will not be the only country to gain if progress is made. But if the European Union chooses to stagnate, more people will question its legitimacy, and all of its members will lose.

{"Headline": "Not So Entertaining", "Date": "2014-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIN New Jersey, we like our politicians to be entertaining.Watching Chris Christie writhe for what seemed like hours yesterday, denying he knew anything about what has become known as Bridgegate, might have given joy to the \u201cjust desserts\u201d crowd. We\u2019re used to an outsize share of rogues, incompetents and in-your-face pols. Often, they\u2019re funny, even if they don\u2019t mean to be. But Mr. Christie\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t funny. He doesn\u2019t get it about funny.Kenny Gewertz was funny. The Democratic lawmaker went to state Assembly sessions in the 1970s in a yellow plaid suit and drove a Corvette with an airbrushed portrait of the Incredible Hulk on it. When an Atlantic City hooker stole his $8,000 watch, he bellowed outrage at such perfidy and called the cops. When he was feeling partisan, he hired a helicopter to buzz the county Republican picnic and blow things around.A little more in the Jersey tough-guy style was a Gewertz opponent, State Senator James M. Turner. He masterminded a plot to plant drugs in Mr. Gewertz\u2019s home in an attempt to frame and ruin him. Senator Turner got five years in prison for that practical joke, but won the Republican primary before disappearing behind bars.The Republican governor Christie Whitman, who ran the state in the 1990s before quitting in 2001 to join George W. Bush in Washington, was entertaining in her own stiff, waspy way. She once allowed herself to be photographed frisking a young black man against a wall during a state police sweep in Camden. The dopey grin on her face made the photo.Nobody much cared that her successor, Jim McGreevey, was, as he put it, \u201ca gay American.\u201d What we minded was that he appointed his untrained and incompetent squeeze, an Israeli public relations man, as his homeland security adviser. That put the personal far above the job we expect a governor to do. Mr. McGreevey wasn\u2019t funny, either, although I suppose it was kind of funny, in a pathetic sort of way, that his career imploded when his paramour threatened to sue him for sexual harassment after Mr. McGreevey had installed the guy in a $110,000 state job.Governor Christie, with hardly any visible qualifications, was named United States attorney for New Jersey in 2002. This is a great job. Kim Kardashian could find corruption in New Jersey and get convictions. We have dishonest politicians so stupid that they will risk jail for a no-show job or a free driveway paving. So Mr. Christie had good conviction numbers in the office, then had the great good fortune of running for governor against Jon Corzine, an unpopular Wall Street guy, right after Wall Street crashed the entire American economy.The Fort Lee scandal happened because Mr. Christie (or his aides) weren\u2019t content with winning re-election. He wanted to run up the score and pose as a unifier, despite his documented history of publicly abusing those who disagreed with him. The news conference yesterday was perfect. He said he had just learned what everybody in the state had suspected for weeks \u2014 that his own people had created a traffic nightmare in Fort Lee to get back at its Democratic mayor. Then he slagged his own people and called them names. Then he wallowed in self-pity for the way they had betrayed him. That\u2019s pitiful, not entertaining.Humbug, as we say in Paramus. They were his people doing what they believed was his will. If they were incompetents, they were his handpicked incompetents, with whom he was perfectly content until the heat rose on his personal backside.As my friend Tom O\u2019Neil, who has been watching the parade of Jersey pols for decades, put it, \u201cThat\u2019s why there are no-show jobs, so the clowns who got you elected don\u2019t mess things up by going to work.\u201dThat\u2019s funny.Advertisement"}

Failure to address this problem actually means that, rather than miserliness, punishment of Americans in need will be our prevailing public policy.As corporate profits soar and our wealth sector demands additional tax relief, the G.O.P. finds virtue in starving our hungry, denying comfort to our ill and turning its back on our jobless.To the Editor:There are few middle-class Americans whose savings are sufficient to finance 20 or even 30 years of unemployment; yet, with life expectancies in the low-to-mid-80s, that is exactly what Republicans are asking such people to do.Nor is poor planning the issue. Indeed, the reasonable, long-term plans of many responsible Americans have been torpedoed by a recession, rampant age discrimination and a Congress whose right-wing ideology has obstructed efforts at economic stimulus.Even more discouraging is that, rather than place blame where blame belongs \u2014 on the speculators who caused the recession and employers who discriminate \u2014 some suggest that the unemployed are not looking for work or that they are at fault for not anticipating job loss.The solution is to replace the current Congress with one that works for the middle class, not Wall Street and the billionaires \u2014 and to finally, and strictly, enforce anti-discrimination laws.To the Editor:It appears that the two political parties have hardened their positions on whether to extend unemployment benefits. Yet there may be a compromise that could win wider support.\u00a0There is universal agreement that finding suitable re-employment is more difficult with increasing age.\u00a0The duration of unemployment benefits should reflect this.\u00a0A compromise could consist of no increase for those under 35, a modest raise with increasing age for those between 35 and 55, and a more substantial increase for those between 55 and 65.\u00a0Since the long-term unemployed are likely to be disproportionately older, this may not save vast sums, but it would at least provide a rational basis for modifying current law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Euro Zone Factory Output Rallied in November", "Date": "2014-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Factories in the euro zone ramped up output in November after two months of decline, according to data released Tuesday, the latest sign that economic growth in the region might be picking up steam.For the whole European Union, production rose 1.5 percent in November from October. Both areas reported a 3 percent increase from a year earlier.The data \u201cprovide some hope that the economy might have regained a bit of momentum towards the end of last year,\u201d said Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics in London. But he cautioned that, considering the weak output of previous months, production was still not much higher than it was in June, adding, \u201cit would be wrong to get carried away.\u201dProduction of capital goods like machine tools and computers led all sectors, followed by rising output of consumer durables, which include washing machines and furniture, the data showed.Ireland, which has just exited its bailout program, led all European Union nations with an 11.7 percent gain in November, bouncing back from a 6.3 percent decline in the previous month. Mr. Loynes said that the Irish data were too volatile on a monthly basis to make firm forecasts, but that \u201cin the broader picture it\u2019s another indication that things are improving in Ireland.\u201dIn spite of this, borrowing costs for some of the euro zone\u2019s most embattled governments are returning to precrisis levels, and a report last week from the European Commission showed that confidence among consumers and businesses picked up in December.Ewald Nowotny, a member of the European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council, which sets interest rates, said Tuesday that the central bank\u2019s forecast for economic growth of 1.1 percent this year might even turn out to be too pessimistic.\u201cMaybe there is even potential on the upside,\u201d Reuters quoted Mr. Nowotny as saying in Vienna.The E.C.B.'s prediction is hardly a torrid pace, but it is robust compared with the 0.4 percent annual pace recorded for the euro zone in the third quarter.The euro zone industrial data apply to the 17 European Union nations that shared the euro in November; Latvia, which began using the euro on Jan. 1, will be included in euro zone statistics compiled after that date.Germany, the largest European economy, had a 2.4 percent monthly rise in industrial output, while France managed a 1.4 percent gain.

{"Headline": "Bernanke Should Be Thanked", "Date": "2014-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBen S. Bernanke ascended to the chairmanship of the Federal Reserve eight years ago as a little-known \u2014 albeit distinguished \u2014 Princeton economics professor who had notched just three years of federal public service.When he takes his leave this week, having presided over his final meeting of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, he will depart as one of the finest chairmen in the institution\u2019s hundred year history, having played a central role in averting a financial meltdown and lifting the nation out of recession.Mr. Bernanke\u2019s success may seem particularly surprising because before assuming the Fed chairmanship, the closest he had ever been to a financial crisis was his academic research into the Great Depression.But when the Great Moderation abruptly ended soon after his arrival as chairman in 2006, Mr. Bernanke shifted to crisis-fighting mode and proved that his first-rate mind was matched by a first-rate temperament.A key to his success was a nonideological approach that allowed him to take on each fresh challenge unshackled to a particular dogma. Similarly, even though he lacked major leadership experience \u2014 as well as any panache \u2014 he proved a calming and confidence-building figure to politicians, colleagues and the bevy of Fed watchers.And his collegial style allowed him to work effectively with two other extraordinarily capable architects of the rescue: Henry M. Paulson Jr., Mr. Bush\u2019s final Treasury secretary, and Timothy F. Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and later President Obama\u2019s first Treasury secretary.These men first threw out the playbook from past crises as inadequate to the current challenge and then threw out the rule book, as they formulated innovation after innovation to fight the conflagration.Most notable were the 2008 rescue of the insurance giant A.I.G. and the alphabet soup of programs designed to pump liquidity into the frozen financial system.I had a glimpse of Mr. Bernanke\u2019s pragmatic approach as he helped President Obama\u2019s auto task force, which I then headed, navigate the complex world of car financing in the face of obstacles erected by more sharp-elbowed regulators like Sheila C. Bair, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.To counter the recession, Mr. Bernanke championed cutting interest rates to zero. But when even that proved insufficient, the Fed began its highly controversial program to buy Treasury and other debt as a means of lowering financing costs and stimulating growth.This program, known as quantitative easing, brought a chorus of criticism down on Mr. Bernanke, ironically, mostly from Republicans.An unusually large group of 30 senators \u2014 an equally unusual coalition of inflation-obsessed conservative Republicans paired with liberal Democrats who felt the Fed favored the financial community \u2014 voted against his confirmation to a second term, in 2010.And in a November 2010 letter in The Wall Street Journal, 24 well-known, conservatively inclined economists, financiers and academics decried the asset purchase program as risking \u201ccurrency debasement and inflation\u201d while not promoting employment.Well, the group proved wrong on all counts. The program has succeeded in lowering interest rates without causing inflation \u2014 prices were up just 1.5 percent last year.Meanwhile, John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, noted at a recent Brookings Institution symposium on monetary policy that unemployment may have been pushed down by a quarter of a percentage point \u2014 roughly 400,000 jobs \u2014 by just the second phase of quantitative easing.To be sure, in parallel with mispronouncing the Great Moderation, Mr. Bernanke missed the housing bubble. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide basis,\u201d he said in 2005 while serving in the Bush White House.Similarly, after joining the Fed, Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues failed to detect the onset of recession. And before the crisis, the Fed, under both Mr. Bernanke and his longstanding predecessor, Alan Greenspan, was lax in its regulatory responsibilities.But on balance, Mr. Bernanke\u2019s reign was a godsend. In addition to his policy successes, he brought a measure of transparency to an overly opaque institution, even instituting quarterly news conferences.Importantly, he also deserves praise for being unusually outspoken (by the standards of Fed chairmen) about the nation\u2019s poor fiscal policy, and particularly the too-rapid speed at which the deficit has been reduced, which exacerbated the tepidness of the recovery.At an early January meeting of the American Economic Association in Philadelphia, Mr. Bernanke\u2019s farewell address was followed by a standing ovation, symbolic of the standing ovation he deserves from the entire country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snapshots of Globalization's First Wave", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed Contributor Every weekend in 1979, Ooi Cheng Ghee took his Leica camera out to the docks of Penang, an island off the west coast of peninsular Malaysia. Mr. Ooi, a local physician of Chinese descent, roamed the working-class district of Georgetown to document life in the harbor. By year\u2019s end, he had taken 4,000 portraits, mostly of first-and second-generation migrants from India.The photographs chronicle a vanishing world. You can see it in the sad but defiant eyes of an old man hauling jute sacks of betel nuts, an ancient trade that was fading away. By then, Mr. Ooi said, the Indian enclave of Penang \u201cgave off a feeling of having been abandoned.\u201d Modernization had eclipsed the commercial and social patterns of earlier waves of globalization. Many coastal cities across Southeast Asia gained prominence in the 15th century, as power ebbed from ancient upland capitals like Angkor and Bagan, which had become riven by conflict and were weakened by the collapse of agricultural production. Ports developed as ocean trade grew. Textiles from Gujarat and the Coromandel Coast of India were exchanged for staple goods like rice or spices and medicinal products from across Southeast Asia. The Chinese market was the most lucrative of all. Malacca, situated at the junction of the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, emerged in the 1400s as the greatest trading emporium in the region, perhaps even the world. Many smaller ports also thrived, including Aceh, Banten and Manila. Most were small principalities ruled by Muslim families, but their populations were multiethnic. The important political office of harbormaster was often occupied by foreigners, often Indians. Alongside Chinese, Indian and Arab merchants, the port towns relied on a workforce of local peoples and slaves from South and Southeast Asia. When the Portuguese conquered Malacca in 1511, the apothecary Tom\u00e9 Pires claimed to hear 84 languages spoken in its marketplace. After the Portuguese, it was the Dutch who came, then the British and the French, setting up coastal footholds around the Indian Ocean. A British colony was founded in Penang, a strategic location on the Strait of Malacca, by the East India Company in 1786 as a trading and military base. As the British expanded into Malaya in the 1870s and established plantations, Penang prospered. By the early 20th century, Malaya was the world\u2019s largest producer of rubber and Penang among the most culturally diverse cities on earth. Some migrants moved in search of fortune; others were forced to relocate by colonial authorities, labor recruiters or difficult circumstances at home. The Chinese went to all parts of Southeast Asia; Indians stayed mostly within the British Empire, concentrating in the Malay Peninsula, Sri Lanka and the area then known as Burma. But the ports\u2019 fortunes were always precarious, contingent on the fluctuations of global trade. The Great Depression hit them hard, forcing many migrant workers to head back home. Singapore and Malaysia introduced immigration controls for the first time. World War II severed already-strained trading links. After decolonization in the late 1940s and 1950s, newly independent governments favored industrialization over the export of basic goods, and the old port cities suffered. India\u2019s drive for self-sufficiency in food \u2014 supplemented as necessary by aid from the United States and bilateral deals \u2014 brought a decline in the Bay of Bengal\u2019s traditional free trade in rice. By the second half of the 20th century, nearly all of the old ports of the eastern Indian Ocean had been eclipsed by investment in new facilities as part of national development plans: Penang lost out to Port Klang, closer to Malaysia\u2019s capital, Kuala Lumpur; Calcutta gave way to Visakhapatnam. Singapore is the great exception. With few natural resources and, after independence from Malaysia in 1965, a limited domestic market, it adapted by investing in a state-of-the-art container port. The old docks at Collyer Quay and Clarke Quay have long since been turned into commercial and entertainment districts.Even the new ports that are built on very old sites \u2014 Hambantota in Sri Lanka was visited by Arab dhows centuries ago \u2014 are unmistakably modern creations: huge industrial facilities that are self-contained and divorced from their surroundings. Inhuman in size, these mega-harbors are built for an economy of scale. If the harbors of the past were set up to make the most of a site\u2019s natural advantages \u2014 like the sheltering shape of a bay \u2014 the new ports remake coastlines according to their own needs, dredging waters and reclaiming land. Fishing communities are relocated. Beaches disappear. Erosion accelerates. There is one plan to spend $60 billion by 2020 in order to build a port every 32 kilometers or so along the coast of India.In comparison, the old port cities are a picture of quaint cosmopolitanism; no wonder they are now looked upon with nostalgia. In 2008, Unesco declared Penang\u2019s Georgetown area a World Heritage Site for bearing \u201ctestimony to a living multicultural heritage and tradition of Asia, where many religions and cultures met and coexisted.\u201d The designation has brought a heritage boom. Chinese shophouses have been converted into boutique hotels, with the attendant coffee shops and art festivals. Thanks to this trend, a book of Mr. Ooi\u2019s photographs was published in 2011, after his work drew little attention for many years. It\u2019s a revivalism mostly for tourist consumption, but it has also spawned an unprecedented interest in family history among locals. Small community-led museums have opened in Penang, Singapore and elsewhere in the region, and more are planned. They tap memories long kept dormant because the assertion of ethnic identities, particularly migrant origins, raises uncomfortable questions about relations between peoples, and entitlements such as citizenship.But even these restoration efforts can produce a romanticized rendering of the past; they airbrush the ugly realities of Asia\u2019s earlier globalization. The old port cities boomed on the back of an underclass with few rights, poorly paid migrants who worked desperately to improve their lot.Mr. Ooi points out that in his photographs of Penang, \u201cThere were no curtains on any of the windows\u201d \u2014 a sign, in his view, that people \u201cknew they weren\u2019t staying.\u201d These societies were multiethnic because they had to be; their cacophony of languages and competing gods made them messy, sometimes violent, places of rough-and-ready compromise.Such hardships endure today. The dormitory settlements of South Asian migrant workers who toil from Dubai to Singapore are often out of view and far from the container ports they service. By dint of the size of these harbors, the connections between the jobs and their human cost are perhaps less immediate than they were centuries ago or even when Mr. Ooi photographed the docks of Penang. But they are no less real.And we know it. That\u2019s why we recoil at these mammoth creations and look back on the past with longing. And that\u2019s why when we see in the past the origins of the modern behemoths, we look away again. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It Started With a $2 Poster", "Date": "2014-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArt ReviewSakai Hoitsu\u2019s \u201cThe Ivy Way Through Mt. Utsu,\u201d a two-panel screen from about 1815, is one of the works in \u201cThe Flowering of Edo Period Painting: Japanese Masterworks From the Feinberg Collection,\u201d at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.The Japanese galleries at the Metropolitan Museum have been pulling crowds since John T. Carpenter became curator in 2011. He has taken the permanent collection, shaken it up, threaded it through with strategic loans and, like a good teacher, unfurled it logically around graspable themes. Who could resist a show that tells the art history of a complex culture, as Mr. Carpenter did last year, entirely in images of birds? With the \u201cThe Flowering of Edo Period Painting: Japanese Masterworks From the Feinberg Collection,\u201d he takes on a different challenge: presenting a cogent narrative within the parameters of a private collection. But given the material, it would be hard to go wrong. What a collection this is. And what histories, new and old, it holds.One history, a charmer, is that of the collection itself. Robert and Betsy Feinberg were young New York professionals in the 1970s when they bought a $2 poster \u2014 produced for a Met show, as it happens \u2014 of a 16th-century Japanese painting. They hung it in their apartment and concluded that this was the art for them.At the time, ultrarefined ink landscape painting was the Japanese art of choice among connoisseurs. No one would have looked twice at an image like the one reproduced in the Feinbergs\u2019 poster, a high-color, vividly detailed depiction of Portuguese traders, the first Europeans to arrive in Japan, galumphing around a port town like so many Sasquatches, to the appalled fascination of their Japanese hosts.As collectors with smarts and pluck often do, the Feinbergs trusted their instincts and invested in a serious way in an undervalued product, namely art of the Edo period (1615-1868), a time when modern Japan \u2014 and modern Japanese art \u2014 was being formed.It was a rough-and-tumble era. After nearly a century of territorial wars and bruising feudal chaos, consolidations were in process and centers of gravity shifting. Under military rule, the country\u2019s political weight moved from the ancient imperial capital of Kyoto to a former fishing village turned shogun castle called Edo, today\u2019s Tokyo, which was fast swelling into one of the world\u2019s largest cities.Social hierarchies were under reconstruction. A hereditary gentry and a warrior elite found themselves sitting down at the same table. Even more surprising, they were, suddenly, and with some discomfort, rubbing shoulders with ordinary people, urban tradesmen who, literate and entrepreneurial, were getting very rich, very fast.In art, as in life, old divisions were giving way. Since the mid-15th century, rival family-based schools of art had maintained class affiliations. The Tosa school, which specialized in indigenous Japanese landscapes and literary themes, was aligned with the imperial court. The parallel Kano school, which looked to China, and specifically monochromatic brush painting, for its sources, was favored by the neo-Confucian shoguns.In the Edo period, however, these two streams began to run together, sending out tributaries, and even incorporating European influences before Japan slammed the door shut on the West.All of this to say that the Met exhibition \u2014 which is fresh from a tour of Japan itself \u2014 is a thing of varied styles, moods, economies and aesthetic ideals. A good many of the 90 paintings, presented in two rotations, are fragrant with nostalgia for art of the past. But by the last third of the show, you\u2019re in a world so much in the grip of appetite, change and fashion as to have no time for anything but the now.Art, of course, had its fashions, and in Edo the so-called Rinpa painting was bedrock. Less a movement than a shared impulse to revitalize old genres, including nature painting and narrative, it originated in Kyoto early in the 17th century: A work from around 1630 by a Rinpa founder, Tawaraya Sotatsu, of a plump and adorable tiger, is the oldest piece in the show. After a half-century lull, the style was revived by Ogata Korin \u2014 Rinpa means \u201cstyle of Korin\u201d \u2014 and transplanted from Kyoto to Edo in the 19th century by Sakai Hoitsu (1761-1828).We pick up its thread in a two-panel screen by Hoitsu called \u201cThe Ivy Way Through Mt. Utsu,\u201d illustrating a scene from the venerable \u201cTales of Ise.\u201d The painting dates from about 1815 but might have been done centuries earlier judging by the antique attire worn by its principal character, the ninth-century courtier-poet Ariwara no Narihira. The landscape, though, is a giveaway. It\u2019s painted in the dripped, pooling technique, called tarashikomi, a Rinpa signature.Nature becomes even more radically and decoratively abstract in folding screen paintings of cranes by the Edo-born Suzuki Kiitsu, Hoitsu\u2019s star pupil and assistant. In this work, the younger artist makes a deep bow to his master and to the long-dead Korin, both of whom had painted versions of the same motif.After Mr. Carpenter has set out these hints of Rinpa history, his show takes a swerving route in an Edo direction. Along the way, we encounter some unorthodox sights. A Kurosawaesque painting by Soga Shohaku of two medieval action heroes competing in martial theatrics is one. A matched pair of Chinese-style ink landscapes by Kano Sansetsu that have the spectral density of white noise is another.And so it goes, this back-and-forth play of unalike styles. Ike no Taiga, who was immersed in literati culture and wowed people by painting, impromptu, with his fingers, gives us big scrawly portraits of Chinese eccentrics. At the same time, some of his late-18th-century peers were exploring a fine-tuned realism, as Mori Sosen did in a heartbreakingly tender fan painting of a stag licking a fawn, and Maruyama Okyo in a hanging scroll image of a rainbow-hued peacock, as exacting in detail as it is decorative in effect.At another time, in another place, decorative would have been a dirty word. But increasingly in the Edo period, it was the hallmark of high style. In terms of design, it could be fairly simple. Such is the case in Tani Buncho\u2019s window-size scroll called \u201cGrasses and Moon,\u201d in which a glowing circle and a splash of lines catch the mood of a lush summer night, and in a fan painting by Ike Gyokuran, wife of Ike no Taiga. Titled \u201cBamboo on a Windy Day,\u201d it\u2019s little more than a superbly controlled scattering of ink strokes that fly up like sparks.But complex design is more often the rule, particularly when we get to the Edo we know best, the 19th-century floating world of pay-for-your-pleasure inns, bars and theaters. The city\u2019s red-light district, Yoshiwara, seems, as recorded in art anyway, to exist beyond discretion, order and tradition, almost beyond history. Social hierarchies appear to have been more or less leveled. Ruling-class taste hardly matters. Street life is life, and life is art.So we get paintings of klutzy Europeans of the kind the Feinbergs first saw, and of beggars, brothel window shoppers and local beauties all but smothered in floral kimonos, with images of flowers spilling across ceramics, onto lacquer boxes and into printed books. Painted portraits of courtesans by the likes of Utagawa Hiroshige and Gion Seitoku were expensive items, made for the rich. But ukiyo-e prints of the same figures were cheap, perfect products of the Yoshiwara cash-and-carry culture.Everything was for sale; conservative values scrambled. Landscapes, once primary art subjects with spiritual dimensions, are now a backdrop for parties, or glimpsed from rooms littered with lounging lovers, all-night cooks and servants hovering for tips.In one vivacious, gender-blending 17th-century painting, artist unknown, a 12th-century dance named for the poet Ariwara no Narihira, of \u201cTales of Ise\u201d fame, is being performed. All the roles, male and female, were originally played by women. In the 17th-century update, we see a man playing the part of a woman playing the part of a man.In some ways Japanese culture was never more vigorous and diverse, and the Edo period certainly turned out great artists. Just look at the staggeringly intricate pen-and-ink notebook drawings by Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849) \u2014 he of the \u201cGreat Wave\u201d \u2014 that close the exhibition. Among a handful of entries added to the show from the Met\u2019s collection, they\u2019re realistic, fantastic, Eastern, Western, archaic and utterly modern. In short, they\u2019re in classic Edo style, a style that the Feinbergs were astute and adventurous enough to recognize as some kind of classical more than 40 years ago.\u201cThe Flowering of Edo Period Painting: Japanese Masterworks From the Feinberg Collection\u201d opens on Saturday and runs through Sept. 7, with the second rotation of paintings beginning on May 17, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org.

Family members and people I work with call me a \u201crisk\u201d because I too often barely make it to flights on time. I like to maximize the time I have, so I do cut it close. On two occasions I had to get out of a taxi and walk along the highway, roller dragging behind me, briefcase tightly tucked under my arm and cellphone blasting calls for help, just to be sure I made my flight.As an executive with MasterCard Worldwide, I am constantly at airports and it\u2019s been that way my whole career.I think my young son will be a business traveler, too. Once when I was traveling with him, we risked being separated when he was upgraded to first class. I was not. Like me, he was a gold card member. Fortunately, I eventually got an upgrade, too, and we both traveled in comfort. He really liked it. So did I.I consider myself a fairly savvy business traveler. I don\u2019t hate flying a lot because I am a firm believer in the axiom that you don\u2019t really exist until you show up. You can get some stuff done through phone calls and videoconferencing, but nothing really beats sitting down with a group of people. You develop relationships and it\u2019s those relationships that help work flourish.Despite the fact that I fly all the time, I am not immune to problems. I\u2019ve had too many lost luggage incidents to count, and I\u2019ve been forced to borrow clothes from colleagues and do presentations in my jeans.Like approximately 9 percent of other men around the world, I am colorblind. It\u2019s usually not a problem, except when I\u2019m overseas and I have to identify airport signage instructions by colored lights. It usually happens at passport control. When you are in another country you want to be on your best behavior, and not get in the wrong line. I have gotten in the wrong line.On another occasion, I was to travel to Sydney and had a ticket with a layover in Los Angeles, but I had not been able to get the Australian visa in time. I talked the airline into accepting me for the first leg of the trip from New York to Los Angeles, while my assistant continued to procure the visa as I traveled. Miraculously, upon arriving at Los Angeles International, I had the visa issued and was able to continue my trip without interruption. Thank goodness for great assistants.Because I speak several languages, I often wind up helping people out. Assisting a seatmate with forms is a given.Once on a flight from Brazil, I had to help out the crew. A fellow passenger who was on the flight became a little hysterical, claiming that she had a \u201cvision\u201d our plane would blow up.Fortunately, this was pre-9/11. I cannot imagine the havoc her vision would have caused today. To be clear, the woman didn\u2019t look dangerous, even though she ran up the aisle from economy class into the business-class area shouting about her vision in Portuguese. I started translating what she was saying, and I asked her a few questions because I thought I was hearing her wrong and misinterpreting what she was saying. I wasn\u2019t.Eventually, the attendant got her calmed down. We landed in Miami just fine. The formerly hysterical woman was quite relieved, so relieved that she hugged the plane as we were exiting. I think the plane was happy to see her go.As told to Joan Raymond; Email:\njoan.raymond@nytimes.com. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Treasury Secretary Sends Warning on Debt Limit", "Date": "2014-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew\u00a0warned Congress on Wednesday that the government would most likely exhaust its ability to borrow in late February, setting up yet another fiscal showdown with Republicans, and this time earlier than congressional leaders had anticipated.In a letter to Speaker John A. Boehner and the other top three congressional leaders, Mr. Lew said a surge of February spending, mainly tax refunds for 2013, would leave the Treasury with little room to maneuver after the official debt limit is reached on\u00a0Feb. 7.The letter amounts to an early alarm bell, coming just weeks after Congress passed its first bipartisan budget and comprehensive spending bill in years. Those bills were supposed to serve as a cease-fire in the budget wars that have rattled the country and the economy since Republicans took control of the House in 2011.But they left untouched the debt limit, which has been a rallying cry for conservatives for three years. As recently as last week, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said the debt ceiling fight could be put off until as late as May while the Treasury shuffled government accounts to meet its obligations.With his letter, Mr. Lew sought to end such speculation. Unlike past debt ceiling fights, this one is coming at a time of year when Treasury payments soar, leaving him little \u201cheadroom\u201d to put off the fight. Last February, government spending reached $230 billion, compared with $45 billion in other months. This year will be worse, because the government shutdown delayed the start of tax season and will concentrate refund payments.\u201cProtecting the full faith and credit of the United States is the responsibility of Congress, because only Congress can extend the nation\u2019s borrowing authority,\u201d Mr. Lew wrote. \u201cNo Congress in our history has failed to meet that responsibility. I respectfully urge Congress to provide certainty and stability to the economy and financial markets by acting to raise the debt limit before\u00a0Feb. 7, 2014, and certainly before late February.\u201dMichael Steel, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, reiterated that the speaker does not want to get \u201ceven close\u201d to a default on the United States debt. But, he added, a \u201cclean\u201d increase in the debt limit without some concessions to Republicans \u201csimply won\u2019t pass in the House.\u201dMr. Boehner said last week, \u201cI would hope that the House and Senate would act quickly on a bill to increase the debt limit.\u201d But aides signaled they would need some face-saving measure to placate House conservatives who still want to force concessions from the White House, possibly on controlling the growth of entitlement programs like Medicare or easing the path to an overhaul of the tax code.President Obama continues to say he will not negotiate over the debt limit, which he said is a congressional responsibility, not a bargaining chip. Republicans were infuriated by that stand during the 16-day government shutdown in October. But they acquiesced, reopening the government and suspending the debt ceiling until Feb. 7. Senior congressional Democrats are pushing the White House to maintain its no-negotiating stance.House Republicans will gather next week for their annual planning retreat. That will kick off efforts to resolve an impasse on the debt ceiling.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Russia, Skating Booms Again", "Date": "2014-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by16 PhotosMOSCOW \u2014 After almost a decade without any top-level women\u2019s figure skaters, Russia suddenly has more than it can use. Discovered in distant provinces and aging rinks, trained by the country\u2019s leading coaches and eyeing one another\u2019s every move, the skaters have a surprising leader in Julia Lipnitskaia, the newly crowned European champion. Only 15, Lipnitskaia is two years younger than her Olympic teammate, Adelina Sotnikova, and much younger than the top medal contenders. Over the past year, Lipnitskaia and Sotnikova emerged from an intense competition for the two places on Russia\u2019s Olympic team from a talent pool that includes Elizaveta Tuktamysheva, 17, and two more 15-year-olds, Anna Pogorilaya and Elena Radionova. And while the pressure is intense on all Russian athletes to succeed in Sochi, the skaters\u2019 rapid rise has some observers contemplating one prize the country has never won at the Olympics: a gold medal in women\u2019s singles.\u201cThere were two, then three, and now there\u2019s already really a lot of competitors, and so Russian figure skating is blossoming,\u201d said Tuktamysheva, rolling through Moscow on a bus after a training session. \u201cIn order to be selected, you need to be able to do the more complicated moves, and so that was a sort of stimulus from the very beginning.\u201dSotnikova, who won Russia\u2019s national championship at age 12, said: \u201cIt\u2019s competitive at every stage. All the girls watch each other.\u201dThe exceptional competition for places has raised the level of all the skaters, giving Russia a good chance for an Olympic medal. Although not expected to beat the favorites, South Korea\u2019s Kim Yu-na and Japan\u2019s Mao Asada, who are both 24, the young Russians are strong contenders for at least a bronze. Russia has won only two medals in the event at the Games, and never the gold. \u201cI think Lipnitskaia could be the surprise of the Olympics,\u201d said Tara Lipinski, the American who won the gold medal at age 15 in the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. Lipinski said that she saw a bit of herself in all five of the young Russian skaters. \u201cThey all have the goods,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s just who is also the competitor and has the mind-set for it.\u201dThe team of prodigies began to attract notice during the 2010-11 season, as podiums at international junior competitions suddenly started filling with Russian skaters. Since then, a Russian has won or placed second in every major international junior final. Now the Russians are breaking through at the senior level, with Sotnikova, Lipnitskaia and Tuktamysheva winning medals in their debuts at the senior European championships. Lipnitskaia\u2019s gold at the event in Hungary in January was Russia\u2019s first in the women\u2019s competition since Irina Slutskaya won the last of her seven titles, in 2006.Such a large number of elite skaters is all the more remarkable because Russian skating had seemingly been in crisis since 2010, when the country left the Vancouver Olympics without a gold medal.\u201cUntil last year we didn\u2019t have anybody,\u201d Slutskaya said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut now we have all these young girls.\u201dSlutskaya is Russia\u2019s most successful female skater, the winner of 40 gold medals in major competitions and the only Russian woman to win medals at the Olympics, with a silver in 2002 and a bronze in 2006. Since her retirement in 2006, the country has been without a top singles contender.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have diamonds before,\u201d Slutskaya said. \u201cNow we have some.\u201dUntil six months ago, few would have predicted that Lipnitskaia would go to Sochi, much less as a medal contender. Russian hopes had been fixed on Sotnikova, who improved noticeably during the latter part of the Grand Prix season. Trained since she was 8 at Moscow\u2019s CSKA skating school, Sotnikova was picked out for Sochi early on, working under one of Russia\u2019s most acclaimed coaches, her routines choreographed by a former Bolshoi ballerina. Taller and more powerful than Lipnitskaia, Sotnikova has moves that are generally more finished than the other skaters\u2019.\u201cShe\u2019s starting to be like a real professional,\u201d Slutskaya said. \u201cShe\u2019s grown up.\u201d For the past two seasons, Sotnikova\u2019s chief rival had been Tuktamysheva. Dark-haired and with hooded eyes, Tuktamysheva radiates a peculiar calm, smiling faintly before her routines. Born in Glazov, a city more than 700 miles from Moscow and known for uranium production, she used to make a two-day journey to St. Petersburg every three weeks to train under a veteran coach, Alexei Mishin. When asked what she liked about skating, she smiled simply and said, \u201cTo jump.\u201d Mishin, 72, was more emphatic. \u201cShe jumps like a military torpedo,\u201d he said.Tuktamysheva\u2019s chances for Sochi were derailed this year as her body matured and she lost some of the prepubescent straightness that allows skaters to complete complex jumps flawlessly. The timing of the Olympics also did not fall right for Radionova, the youngest of the new generation; she turned 15 in January, outside the minimum age requirement to compete at Sochi. So many Russians being in contention for medals would have been unimaginable until recently. When the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s, its sports training system disintegrated as state financing dried up. That left rinks to rot and prompted many of the most experienced coaches to seek work abroad. At the same time, the pool of amateur skaters shrank as parents, struggling to stay afloat financially amid economic chaos, stopped sending their children to train.Russia\u2019s prominence in figure skating started to slip. As the last of the skaters who had trained under the Soviet system retired, none stepped forward to take their place. The fallow period is over. A more stable economy has allowed parents to send their children to skate again. Many new municipal rinks have been opened in the past five years; most were intended for hockey teams, but they are also available to figure skaters. Stipends provided by the Russian federation are now enough to support skaters and their families.\u201cPeople started taking their children to classes again,\u201d said Tatiana Flade, a veteran skating commentator, who has watched the Russian girls grow up. \u201cAnd there was just a bigger base. It\u2019s easier to find talented skaters now, and they are pushing each other.\u201dUnlike so much with the Sochi Games, the rise of the teenage skaters is not the result of a Kremlin decree. Despite diverting huge resources to the construction of the Olympic facilities and to more popular sports like hockey, the Russian government turned its attention to figure skating only recently. A number of the Russian girls\u2019 coaches said that money had begun to flow significantly into the sport only in the past year and a half. Instead, the process has been more organic. In 2008, coaches began to seek out girls independently. Mishin, who has trained four men\u2019s gold medalists \u2014 the most recent was Evgeni Plushenko, in 2006 \u2014 began traveling to Russia\u2019s provinces, visiting distant rinks.Sotnikova\u2019s trainer, Elena G. Vodorezova, a former child champion and another institution of Russian skating, established a new team at the CSKA Olympic sports complex. Radionova and her trainer, Inna Goncharenko, joined her there.\u201cAt the beginning we weren\u2019t thinking about the Olympics,\u201d Vodorezova said. \u201cWe just had this girl, who it was interesting for me to work with, who embodied all my ideas, who I wanted to have beautiful women\u2019s skating.\u201dA new generation of lesser-known coaches also emerged, training girls from a young age to establish themselves. Lipnitskaia\u2019s trainer, Eteri G. Tutberidze, 40, is among that group. One of the skaters who emigrated during the 1990s, Tutberidze returned to Moscow in 1998 after four years of skating and training in the United States. Perceived as an outsider, Tutberidze struggled initially, but she has created a group of skaters who are among the best in the country. The creation of Russia\u2019s Olympic skating team is not a collaborative effort. The girls train at separate rinks, and the coaches can be ruthlessly competitive; just before she found Lipnitskaia, Tutberidze said, Mishin poached virtually her entire squad.\u201cThey took a whole generation from me,\u201d she said, though she admitted, \u201cMaybe I\u2019d have done the same thing in that situation.\u201dThe large number of girls has itself pushed up the level of Russian skating, and the greater competition has pushed the skaters to excel individually. Although the girls are cordial toward one another, they are not close friends. Since each works with a different trainer, there is little sense of team spirit. \u201cI think a rivalry is always needed,\u201d Lipinski said. \u201cI had one with Michelle Kwan, and I didn\u2019t slack off one day because I knew she was practicing hard somewhere. And I think these girls see that, and I think they know that someone could take their place in an instant and so they have to be better.\u201dLipnitskaia seems to have thrived the most on the competition. Childishly small but with heavily muscled shoulders, she is different from the other girls, more intense in conversation, worried about even a few minutes lost in training. Her drive to be the best is probably best summed up by her mother, Daniela, who sat in the basement of a rink last month and shrugged, saying, \u201cYou can teach a bear to dance on ice if you train a lot.\u201dWhile Tuktamysheva and Radionova prefer high-tempo, flamenco-style backing tracks, Lipnitskaia\u2019s signature piece is skated to John Williams\u2019s score from \u201cSchindler\u2019s List.\u201d Since Lipnitskaia\u2019s triumph at Skate Canada in September, her confidence has grown with each victory. She won two more events and was a close second at the Russian nationals before capturing the European title in Budapest. \u201cI changed in that my skating has changed,\u201d she said days before the Russian nationals. \u201cIt\u2019s got more mature, in my head, in my thoughts.\u201dHer strength has been her technique and her elasticity \u2014 when she spins she becomes a perfectly upright top, her face vanishing into a blur \u2014 but she had been criticized for a lack of expression. That changed in Budapest. \u201cShe set herself an adult\u2019s task as a child,\u201d Tutberidze, her trainer, said. \u201cThat\u2019s why she seems closed.\u201dIn Sochi, Lipnitskaia will face skaters who are much older, and most experts say she may need her competitors to make a mistake if she is to win the silver or better. But she will not be content with that.In November, Lipnitskaia won the Moscow event of the International Grand Prix, beating the world champion, Carolina Kostner of Italy. Afterward, Lipnitskaia was distraught; she had botched two jumps in her win. \u201cI thought that was a sign,\u201d Lipinski said of the reaction. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018You are a little Olympic champion.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Life in Transit", "Date": "2014-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElisabeth de Waal\u2019s posthumously published novel takes place in the aftermath of some of the 20th century\u2019s greatest calamities, as it follows Austrian exiles returning to their homeland to encounter a dramatically altered physical and psychological landscape. By 1954, when the action of the novel begins, Vienna has witnessed not only the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire but the Anschluss and Hitler\u2019s reign of terror against the Jewish population, as well as repeated bombings during World War II and simultaneous occupation by four victorious foreign powers. Written during the late 1950s, \u201cThe Exiles Return\u201d has an immediacy that makes de Waal\u2019s readers feel the experiences of its characters in a visceral way.Eighteen-year-old Marie-Theres (Resi) Larsen is the American daughter of Austrian \u00e9migr\u00e9s. Exceptionally moody and even downright hostile, she frustrates her parents with her behavior, but instead of sending her to a psychiatrist, they opt for a change of scenery, sending her back to Europe to live with some relatives. As she is torn between two worlds, her emotional difficulties only mount when she arrives in Vienna. There she attracts the attention of a wealthy businessman, Theophil Kanakis, who has come to the city for very different reasons, hoping to increase his fortune by cashing in on the depressed, postwar economy.De Waal\u2019s most vividly drawn character is Kuno Adler, a research scientist who, despite building a comfortable life for himself in Manhattan, has abandoned his wife and returned to his native Vienna in part to escape his adopted country\u2019s ingrained anti-Semitism: \u201cHe had not been prepared for it in America, where, although there was no danger of physical extermination, there was an ever-present insidious consciousness of it, like a suppressed toothache which one could never quite forget.\u201d But, of course, the city of his birth has changed a great deal during his 15-year absence.De Waal brings these characters together in a tightly wound story of love, betrayal and class tension among Austria\u2019s aristocratic, clerical and intellectual spheres. If the plot can seem a bit like a PBS costume drama waiting to happen, so does de Waal\u2019s personal history. She was born in 1899 into what her grandson, Edmund de Waal (best known for his memoir, \u201cThe Hare With Amber Eyes\u201d), calls in his foreword to the novel \u201ca dynastic Jewish family that had adopted Vienna as its home.\u201d Before World War II, she studied law, economics and philosophy; wrote poetry; and engaged in an extensive correspondence with Rainer Maria Rilke. She would go on to write five unpublished novels and hold a fellowship at Columbia University, eventually settling in London. Clearly, she knew a little something about life as an exile, and she renders her characters\u2019 inner lives \u2014 most notably Resi\u2019s \u2014 with tremendous nuance.Any story that takes place amid major historical events runs the risk of what you might call, thinking of James Cameron\u2019s bloated 1997 movie, the Titanic effect. In many such novels, an all-too-real tragedy functions something like the static backdrop to an old cartoon, and the fictional characters never engage with it in any meaningful way. For the most part, \u201cThe Exiles Return\u201d manages to sidestep that problem.\u201cWho speaks of victory?\u201d Rilke wrote. \u201cTo endure is everything.\u201d But that\u2019s not entirely true.

{"Headline": "Erosion of Argentine Peso Sends a Shudder Through Latin America", "Date": "2014-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIn 80 years, there\u2019ve been tough times, but it\u2019s never been as bad as this,\u201d Irma Herrera, 80, a retired psychologist, said Friday after the government announced that it would make it easier for Argentines to buy dollars amid the financial upheaval.\u201cI\u2019m not going to buy dollars when my monthly pension doesn\u2019t even stretch to buy food,\u201d Ms. Herrera said.In a matter of days, Argentina has become a symbol of the economic stresses mounting in developing countries around the world. Fears are rising that the demand for commodities, a centerpiece of Argentina\u2019s economy, is weakening in places like China, a slowdown that could threaten developing nations.At the same time, the prospect of better returns in the United States is drawing money out of the developing world and battering currencies from Turkey to Russia to South Africa.The worries over contagion are spreading. In Brazil, the country\u2019s powerful automobile industry is bracing for the problems in Argentina, one of Brazil\u2019s biggest export markets. But beyond the global forces at play, the financial swings this week have called attention to the particular challenges for some of Latin America\u2019s most vulnerable economies.\u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s happening all over Latin America, which is that the region is coming to the end of its commodities boom,\u201d said Francisco Rodr\u00edguez, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cSome countries are more vulnerable than others, and definitely the Venezuelas and Argentinas of the world are more vulnerable. Markets are getting very nervous about what will happen to them if you enter a period of a slump in commodities prices.\u201dThis week in Venezuela, the government announced what amounted to a partial devaluation and new currency controls. On Friday, travel agents said several airlines had either stopped selling tickets over the last few days or made only a very limited number of seats available.The airlines say they have $3.3 billion in revenues in Venezuelan banks that the government has not let them take out of the country. They worry that the value of that money, which is still in local currency, could shrink significantly.\u201cThis is one of the high points when you speak to airline C.E.O.\u2019s,\u201d said Peter Cerda, regional vice president for the Americas of the International Air Transport Association. \u201cWhat keeps them up at night is exactly this. What their money\u2019s worth today, it might not be worth tomorrow.\u201dOn Friday, Venezuela\u2019s government also put new limits on the dollars it promises to sell citizens traveling abroad, with a cap of $700 per trip to Florida, compared with $2,500 for travel elsewhere in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s madness,\u201d said Antonio Miglio, 42, a businessman, who flies to Orlando, Fla., every year with his family to go shopping. \u201cThe government made this decision because of the economic crisis, but this will only make the crisis worse.\u201dIn Argentina, the pressures have been building for years. Generous social spending after the crisis in 2002, like freezing household electricity rates and making payments to poor families, has widened Argentina\u2019s deficit. The country has been printing money, fueling inflation. The issue has been so polemical that the government has been in a fight for years over how high inflation really is; independent economists say it reached 28 percent in 2013, while officials say it was 10.9 percent.To prevent that exodus, the authorities have tried to restrict access to foreign currency. Now, with a nearly 20 percent drop in the value of the peso just this week, the government said Friday that it would allow people to buy dollars with greater ease. The economy minister described the shift as a response to \u201cpsychosis\u201d in Argentina\u2019s financial markets.\u201cThe government is trying to find a way out of the mess it got into,\u201d said Fausto Spotorno, an economist at Orlando Ferreres y Asociados in Buenos Aires. \u201cBut there\u2019s so much more to do, like tackle inflation.\u201dRather than stemming the anxiety, the government\u2019s announcement on Friday seemed to sow confusion.\u201cThis is all improvised,\u201d said Antonio L\u00f3pez, 63, an administrator for an office building. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\u201dThe economy minister, Axel Kicillof, lashed out at financial analysts who contended that the peso might weaken further, calling them \u201cgreat liars.\u201d In comments to an Argentine radio station, he attributed the sharp fall in the peso to a \u201cspeculative attack\u201d put into motion by the oil giant Royal Dutch Shell.\u201cThe authorities in Argentina are suffering from low credibility,\u201d said Alberto Ramos, an economist at Goldman Sachs. \u201cThe situation can get as bad as they want to make it.\u201dThe streets of downtown Buenos Aires were bustling but calm on Friday, with more dark humor than signs of panic. \u201cGreat, we can buy dollars now,\u201d said Nicol\u00e1s Titaro, 61, a company treasurer. \u201cWe just need salaries that let us.\u201dOther Argentines wondered whether another period of economic turmoil loomed. \u201cIt\u2019s always the same here, a crisis every 10 years,\u201d said Marcelo Rosales, 50, a security guard. \u201cThe government will not assume the political cost of dealing with this. It is only healing minor cuts with plasters.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the location of a reporter.

{"Headline": "Severe Drought Grows Worse in California", "Date": "2014-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNORDEN, Calif. \u2014 Cattle ranchers have had to sell portions of their herd for lack of water. Sacramento and other municipalities have imposed severe water restrictions. Wildfires broke out this week in forests that are usually too wet to ignite. Ski resorts that normally open in December are still closed; at one here in the Sierra Nevada that is open, a bear wandered onto a slope full of skiers last week, apparently not hibernating because of the balmy weather.On Friday, Gov. Jerry Brown made it official: California is suffering from a drought, perhaps one for the record books. The water shortage has Californians trying to deal with problems that usually arise in midsummer. With little snow in the forecast, experts are warning that this drought, after one of the driest years on record last year, could be as disruptive as the severe droughts of the 1970s.Under state law, that would allow the governor to \u201cwaive laws or regulations and expedite some funding,\u201d said Jeanine Jones, deputy drought manager for the State Department of Water Resources. \u201cIt does not create a new large pot of money for drought response or make federal funding available.\u201dSigns of drought are everywhere, affecting vast sectors of the economy. A sense of dread is building among farmers, many whom have already let fields go fallow. Without more water, an estimated 200,000 acres of prime agriculture land will go unplanted in Fresno County, according to Westlands Water District officials. Cattle ranchers accustomed to letting cows graze on rain-fed grass have had to rely on bought hay or reduce their herds.Clergy of all faiths have been exhorting the faithful to pray for precipitation. \u201cMay God open the heavens, and let his mercy rain down upon our fields and mountains,\u201d Bishop Jaime Soto, the state\u2019s Roman Catholic conference president, said last week. The Sacramento Valley chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations followed suit by announcing that area mosques would offer the traditional rain prayer, Salatul Istisqa.California gets much of its water from the snowpack of the Sierra Nevada, so towns like this one have a front-row view of the problem. The base at Donner Ski Ranch, a family-owned resort with limited snow-making capacity, was less than a foot of snow this week. Usually, it would be several feet deep in January, like other resorts in the Sierra.\u201cThis is the worst I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Lincoln Kauffman, 55, the resort\u2019s general manager, who has been skiing in these mountains since the early 1970s. \u201cI think 1976 and 1977 were comparable to this \u2014 that was a really tough one. I remember the restrictions on showers and flushing toilets.\u201d\u201cWe still have extreme fire conditions throughout the state in January,\u201d said Dennis Mathisen, a spokesman for the state\u2019s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \u201cThis is definitely not the norm for us.\u201dThe snowpack plays a critical part in what is one of the world\u2019s most sophisticated and complex water delivery systems, supplying water to more than 25 million people and the $44.7 billion agricultural industry. The snow that piles up on the Sierra Nevada\u2019s 400-mile range during the winter acts as a reserve that starts to melt in the spring. The melting snow drains into rivers that feed reservoirs below, providing water to densely populated communities hundreds of miles south in Southern California.After the survey this month, the Department of Water Resources said that the snowpack was only 20 percent of the historical average.The lack of precipitation has been caused in large part by a high-pressure zone stretching along the coast from Oregon to northern Mexico. The zone acts like a mountain range, blocking storm systems from striking land. Storms are pushed instead north into Canada and Alaska, contributing to the extreme cold weather seen in recent weeks across much of the Midwest and Northeast. Though such high-pressure zones are normal during the winter, they usually dissipate and re-form, allowing storms to blanket the state in snow and rain.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a ridge of high pressure sitting overhead, and it is not budging,\u201d said Diana Henderson, a forecaster with the National Weather Service.In Truckee, a ski resort town near here, the Back Country store was holding a clearance sale on mountain bikes, which some people were riding this winter instead of skiing.\u201cThese should be sitting on the shelves this time of the year,\u201d an employee, Aaron Breitbard, said of CO2 cartridges used to inflate flat tires in an emergency. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been selling. And, as you can see, we\u2019re building one bike and repairing another one.\u201dAbout a hundred miles west of here, the relics of Red Bank, a Gold Rush-era town that, according to California State Parks, included a mine, winery and dairy, now lie exposed on the dry bed of Folsom Lake. A few dozen locals had come to look at nails, glass and bricks scattered here and there.\u201cEverybody\u2019s been talking about how low the lake is,\u201d said Ramone Velazquez, who was visiting with his wife, Mariana, and their young daughter, Juliet.\u201cI\u2019m really worried about how this drought is going to affect us,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard about the drought in the \u201970s, and how people couldn\u2019t water their lawns and wash their cars. They could take only one-minute showers.\u201d\u201cCan you believe that?\u201d his wife said. \u201cWe\u2019re used to taking an hour.\u201dNorimitsu Onishi reported from Norden, and Malia Wollan from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can the European Center Hold?", "Date": "2014-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMILAN \u2014 My father is 97 years old. Angelo Severgnini \u2014 Gino to his friends \u2014 was born during a world war, fought in another (first with the Germans, then against them) and witnessed the subsequent Italian civil war. He saw the coming and going of Fascism, Nazism and Communism. And he adores the European Union. He has seen it bring former enemies together, create lasting peace across the Continent and enable his children and grandchildren to make friends abroad and move freely from Italy to Britain, the Netherlands and Poland. Sadly, my father is in a minority these days.Europe\u2019s narrative is in the hands of its foes. While the friends of Europe chat busily among themselves in the narrow circles of government, business and the media, anti-Europe parties are gathering momentum across the Continent. The list is long: Beppe Grillo\u2019s Five Star Movement in Italy. Nigel Farage\u2019s U.K. Independence Party. Alternative for Germany. The Danish People\u2019s Party. True Finns. The Sweden Democrats. In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders\u2019s Party for Freedom. In France, Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front. Although sometimes lumped together as the \u201cEuropean Tea Parties,\u201d they make a somewhat motley political crew. But they share the conviction that the European Union must go.Which would be a shame. The European Union may grind out far too many regulations, but it wasn\u2019t responsible for the current economic slump. And it has brought good things to its member countries. The \u201cfour freedoms\u201d \u2014 free movement of goods, capital, services and people \u2014 help member economies, as Britain would soon find out if it left. Without a common agriculture policy, Europe would be swamped by cheap imports, and farmers would go out of business. From competition to food safety, the environment, safety at work, the length of court proceedings and conditions in prisons, it is the European Union that sets the standards. Even soccer\u2019s Champions League would be a shade less exciting without the 1995 Bosman ruling, which allowed footballers, just like any other European worker, to move freely across the union. Europe\u2019s voters take all this for granted. Instead, they blame the union for budget restrictions and austerity measures. Europe may be slowly sorting out its banking mess, but the European Union still gets the blame for youth unemployment. The European Commission\u2019s Eurobarometer, which has kept tabs on public opinion since 1973, shows that a record 60 percent of respondents \u201ctend not to trust the E.U.\u201d The European Commission is worried. Last April its president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, introduced \u201cA New Narrative for Europe,\u201d inviting the union\u2019s artists, intellectuals and scientists \u201cto engage with and contribute to a reflection on the European \u2018story.\u201d\u2019 Last month in Milan, Mr. Barroso said that Europe should again become \u201can object of desire.\u201d But rekindling enthusiasm for Europe with new banking regulations, which is where the big focus within the union lies today, is like attempting to boost libido by reading the instructions on a packet of condoms: possible, perhaps, but something of a challenge.All bleak on the European front, then? Not necessarily. If a political storm is on its way, that is good news: Europe needs a good fright to find its courage. The European Union functions by transforming fear into energy. When things go quiet, Europeans tend to sit back and bellyache.Over the last century, there have been four major, salutary scares, each of which has pushed Europe closer together.The first followed World War II. Fearing another war might be possible, the former enemies linked together their coal and steel production, in 1951, and then their economies, with the 1957 Treaty of Rome. A second scare followed the oil crisis and the economic slump of the 1970s. Brussels started to construct a single market, which was initiated in 1992 and has worked well ever since.The third scare came with the fall of Communism from 1989 to 1991. Having no idea about what to do with all those new democracies on its eastern borders, the European Union panicked, as usual. Then it took a flier and significantly enlarged its membership. The fourth scare followed the financial crisis of 2008-9. Many in London and the United States predicted the collapse of the euro, which didn\u2019t happen. New rules for national budgets avoided a major crisis. Today, banking and fiscal unification are on the way.Now another Europe-bracing scare looms. Those Euroskeptic parties are likely to do well in European parliamentary elections in May, which will serve to concentrate minds. Do we care about Europe? Then let\u2019s say so, loud and clear. The so-called Erasmus generation \u2014 the millions of young men and women who spent their 20s sharing offices, labs, lecture halls, apartments and beds across the European Union \u2014 is coming of age. They have a duty, and a privilege, to stand up for Europe. It cannot be left to Ukrainians protesting in favor of integration with the West, or Africans risking their lives on rickety migrant boats, to tell us that Europe is a nice place to live because the rule of law is upheld and its welfare-protected citizens can enjoy agreeable cities set in lovely countryside. We take all this for granted, but we shouldn\u2019t.In 1919 William Butler Yeats wrote, in \u201cThe Second Coming,\u201d that \u201cthe best lack all conviction, while the worst/Are full of passionate intensity.\u201d Anti-Europeans are not necessarily evil people, yet their passion is driven by regrettable intentions. They are out to dismantle what we, and our parents, have put together. My father, who is older than Yeats\u2019s poem, has seen Europe disunited and united. That\u2019s why he likes the European Union, and he won\u2019t give it up without a fight.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Czech Parties Agree to Form Center-Left Coalition", "Date": "2014-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 A leftist former finance minister was expected to become prime minister of the Czech Republic after three political parties signed an agreement on Monday to form a center-left coalition government. The deal helped to bring to a close one of the most acrimonious periods of political crisis in the country\u2019s recent memory.Under the agreement, the former official, Bohuslav Sobotka, 42, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, will become prime minister, returning his party to power after more than seven years in opposition. Mr. Sobotka, a longtime member of Parliament who trained as a lawyer, also served as deputy prime minister under a previous government. He has vowed to increase government spending after a period of grinding austerity. He has also indicated that he seeks strong relations with the European Union and the United States.Mr. Sobotka, who is known for his uncharismatic personal style, has faced infighting from within his own party including a failed attempt to unseat him as leader after October elections. He is a churchgoing father of two, and has been unscathed by accusations of corruption. On Monday, he heralded a new period of stability. \u201cThe emerging coalition is ready, both in terms of personnel and program, to assume government responsibility,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt brings hope for a change for the better.\u201dThe Czech economy has teetered in recession over the past two years and has shown only limited signs of recent recovery. Though Mr. Sobotka has promised to counter growth-busting austerity, the coalition has nevertheless said it aims to keep the deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product, as required by the European Union. Some analysts predicted a potential clash between the left-leaning Mr. Sobotka and his likely finance minister, Andrej Babis, a blunt-spoken and economically liberal Slovak food, media and chemicals billionaire with a Czech passport. His anti-establishment party, Ano, or Yes, won the second largest number of votes in October elections.Mr. Babis said Monday that he wanted to focus on tax collection, combating fraud and improving the absorption of European Union funds. Though he has vowed to clean up the country\u2019s culture of sleaze, some analysts have raised questions about potential conflicts of interest, since his vast empire includes 200 companies.The parties will now ask Mr. Zeman to appoint Mr. Sobotka as prime minister along with his cabinet. Analysts warned that political harmony was far from assured as Mr. Zeman, a former member of the Social Democrats, was a bitter political rival of Mr. Sobotka\u2019s, and he has already indicated that he may oppose some of Mr. Sobotka\u2019s ministerial picks.Jan Richter contributed reporting from Prague.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tale of a House, and an Entire Market", "Date": "2014-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHome-Price EconomicsIn 1990, almost a million houses were built in the United States. One of them, at 12204 Backus Drive in Bowie, Md., was a four-bedroom colonial with a bay window. The average home price that year was $150,000; this house, in a desirable middle-class suburb of Washington, sold for $227,140.Like every house, it became a vessel for its inhabitants\u2019 personalities and possessions \u2014 the vast record collection of the first owner, the wedding photos of the most recent ones. It also came to hold a promise of prosperity, as the boom encouraged Americans to think of houses as not just places to live, but as investments that, thanks to rising prices, could dispense huge cash returns.The story of 12204 Backus Drive is in many ways the story of the American housing market: first anodyne, then ruinous, then resilient. It is peopled with losers and villains, lucky winners and a young couple hoping for, but not counting on, good fortune. This house\u2019s value peaked at $540,000, plunged to $215,000, and rapidly convalesced until, last year, it sold for an amount that might be considered auspicious.Virtually all the economic turmoil of the last seven years started with the housing market, which powered the economy during the bubble and then nearly melted down, taking the financial system with it. Almost five million homes were lost in foreclosure in the last five years, according to CoreLogic, and houses in some cities lost two-thirds of their value before starting to recover a couple of years ago.Now prices have bounced up 10 to 25 percent from their bottom, so quickly that a few economists have warned of a second bubble. As the rebound effect fades and interest rates continue to rise, that growth, already uneven, is expected to slow considerably. But experts say that if the job market keeps improving, the housing market will rise with it.The various owners of 12204 Backus Drive still see homeownership as a sound choice \u2014 even those who were badly pummeled by market forces. They are joined in that belief by a vast majority of Americans; lending for home purchases rose from a low of $404 billion in 2011 to an estimated $652 billion last year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. But while Americans still want to own their homes, the scars of the financial debacle hold them back in other ways. Some large banks, unmotivated by low interest rates and afraid they will have to buy back any loans that go bad, have cut back on mortgage lending. Tighter lending standards are shutting out close to 12.5 million consumers who would qualify in normal times, according to an analysis by Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics. But perhaps more significant, individual attitudes have changed. A house is a residence, sure. A better investment than renting, yes. But it is no longer an A.T.M., a source of ready cash for a better lifestyle. Suburban Dreams, Found and LostBowie, a bedroom community in Prince George\u2019s County, a 30-minute drive from Washington, was built on the ideal of affordable suburban living. It was first developed in the 1960s by the company that created Levittown, N.Y. The 1980s saw the rise of a second wave of homebuilding, as more luxurious subdivisions with larger houses, swimming pools and tennis courts were carved out of forests. At that time, a house was a place to live, not a way to get rich. The first owner of 12204 Backus Drive, a teacher, actually took a small loss \u2014 about $10,000 \u2014 when he sold it after eight years and moved to another suburb of Washington.But by 2002, prices had been rising for roughly a decade \u2014 and Roberto Ramos and Chong Kim, owners of a seafood takeout counter, bought 12204 Backus Drive for $299,000. They put 10 percent down and took out a fixed-rate mortgage.Like so many houses at the time, this one quickly became a source of cash. Mr. Ramos and Ms. Kim refinanced twice, which allowed them to siphon out $175,000. In retrospect, such behavior may seem reckless; hundreds of thousands of people wouldn\u2019t have lost their homes in the crash if they hadn\u2019t depleted their equity during the boom. But for those with good timing, like Mr. Ramos and Ms. Kim, the system worked: In April 2006, they sold the house for $540,000, more than enough to pay off their loans. The value of 12204 Backus Drive had risen 80 percent in four years. Even at that price tag, the house struck Leslie Johnson as a good deal. Rising prices had taken on an aura of inevitability, and the whole country seemed to believe that they would never fall. All over the country, house prices are rising. But in some regions, prices are recovering from much deeper troughs. Below are six houses that were sold several times in the last few years, reflecting the overall market trends in their metropolitan areas.Ms. Johnson, a billing specialist at a law firm, had a son who was living in a nursing home after being severely disabled in an accident. She already owned a house, but says her homeowner\u2019s association was making it difficult for her to install a wheelchair ramp and to build an accessible bathroom so her son could live at home.The $540,000 price of the Backus Drive house seemed beyond her reach. But after providing documentation of her income (which she declined to disclose publicly), she was told that she had been preapproved. \u201cThey told me to go ahead and buy and just refinance later on to a more manageable mortgage payment,\u201d she said.From that point on, some of the most unsavory aspects of the subprime lending industry came into play.With a credit score at the low end of average, Ms. Johnson got a loan with high interest but a low teaser rate for the first two years. In February 2006 \u2014 when prices in Prince George\u2019s County were nearing their peak \u2014 she put 5 percent down, and got a piggyback loan to cover the rest of a 20 percent down payment. Even with the teaser rate, her monthly payment was $4,175 for both loans, more than she was taking home in her paycheck each month. (That figure is based on public records; Ms. Johnson recalls the payment being somewhat lower.) But she had some savings that would help her cover the payments, she said, until she could refinance, which the bank assured her she could do very soon.The new loan, from New Century Mortgage, was interest-only at first, so Ms. Johnson\u2019s monthly payment actually decreased a bit, to $4,000. But that did not make it affordable. By her fourth payment, she was falling behind, and after less than a year, she had stopped paying altogether. She spent months trying to persuade the bank to lower the payment.In January 2008, her loan servicer gave her a loan modification that actually increased her payments to more than $4,500.Wanting out, Ms. Johnson hired a man named Barry Edmonds to negotiate a short sale with her lender. She began making her mortgage payments to an account he controlled. After more than two years, in May 2010, he instructed her to move out temporarily so he could ready the house for sale, she said, and she left behind furniture, photo albums and a new Jenn-Air oven. When she returned a couple of months later to pick up some belongings, she saw notices that the house was being repossessed. The locks had been changed. Shortly after that, Mr. Edmonds, and some $100,000 of her money, disappeared.(Mr. Edmonds was fined in absentia by Maryland authorities for more than $100,000 in Ms. Johnson\u2019s case, and did not respond to attempts to reach him by phone and email and on social media.)So far, Ms. Johnson said, she has received nothing except a wrecked credit record. Hardwood Floors From the AshesFor two years, 12204 Backus sat vacant, its lawn overgrown and the paint on its garage door peeling. The bank tried to sell it for $265,000, then for $250,000. At one point, Martha and Jonathan Kim, a young couple out house-hunting, peered through a window and saw a mess. \u201cNo way we\u2019re buying this house,\u201d Ms. Kim said to herself. \u201cI don\u2019t care how cheap it is.\u201dBut foreclosed homes like this one were attractive to investors with cash. Big fund managers like the Blackstone Group and Colony Capital snapped up 100,000 homes nationwide, according to Green Street Advisors, a research firm. Investors helped prices recover faster, but regular buyers, particularly those with impaired credit, complained that they couldn\u2019t compete.Prices in Prince George\u2019s County never fell quite low enough to attract bulk buyers. That created an opportunity for smaller investors, like a construction company called Greenway Homes that moved from construction to flipping houses. In April 2012, an affiliate of Greenway bought 12204 Backus Drive for $215,000 cash. Two Dumpsters full of trash had to be tossed, and all appliances \u2014 except Ms. Johnson\u2019s Jenn-Air oven \u2014 replaced, said Traci Barsy, who oversaw the renovation. The company usually makes a profit of 10 percent, said Kate Weaver, the vice president, but she estimated that the return was lower for this house because its size drove up the renovation cost.The house received a new roof, air-conditioner, hardwood floors, tile and carpeting, a wet bar in the basement and extras like custom cabinets, upgraded molding and brushed nickel fixtures. When the listing hit the Internet, priced at about $390,000, a friend sent the link to Ms. Johnson. Having sunk her retirement savings into the house, Ms. Johnson was moving from rental to rental, unable to provide a suitable living space for her son. When she saw the photographs, she cried.The Kims \u2014 he a 31-year-old auto parts manager, she a 28-year-old second-grade teacher \u2014 saw the listing, too. They had been searching for a house for two years and had tucked away more than $100,000 by living with Mr. Kim\u2019s parents, said Ms. Kim, who calls herself a \u201chard-core saver.\u201d \u201cI think paying rent is the biggest waste of money,\u201d Ms. Kim said, adding that the couple weren\u2019t counting on increasing home values or even a stable economy.\u201cWe didn\u2019t overextend ourselves like so many people did in the past,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would still be able to afford the mortgage payment if one of us lost our jobs.\u201dEven with their large down payment, the Kims are paying a higher interest rate, 3.9 percent, than if Mr. Kim had had a better credit score, they said.The couple bought the house in March 2013; the recorded sale price was $381,000. Ms. Kim was initially reluctant to pay so much for a house that had so recently been much cheaper \u2014 until she saw the renovation. \u201cIt was so beautiful,\u201d she said. Of the investor, Mr. Kim said, \u201cI\u2019m sure they deserve what profit they made.\u201dIn the aftermath of the crash, many have made the argument that public policy overly encourages homeownership. Robert J. Shiller, the Nobel-winning economist (and a contributor to Sunday Business), says that while owning a home may be worthwhile for many reasons, historically, most homeowners have reaped little financial return for their investment. As for 12204 Backus Drive, Mr. Mayer pointed out that even its lowest price in the crash was about the same as its previous trough, when the first owner sold it, but that its peaks had been much higher.Despite their travails, all the recent owners of the house aspire to homeownership. The big winners in the boom, Mr. Ramos and Ms. Kim, went on to get burned in the bust, buying a bigger, more expensive house and losing it in a short sale. They are saving to buy again, Mr. Ramos said.Ms. Johnson, who went into foreclosure, is less hopeful, but would like to own a home. \u201cI do believe in having your own home,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re paying rent, you\u2019re just helping someone else pay off their mortgage.\u201dMartha and Jonathan Kim agree, and right now their $1,800 monthly mortgage payment is cheaper than rent would be. But in the house on Backus, more than half the rooms are sparsely furnished and rarely used, and that makes Ms. Kim uneasy. Seated at her kitchen table, she half-joked about taking in boarders. \u201cSometimes I feel like we\u2019re wasting money,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re just kind of sitting on too much land.\u201dThe Home Front: Articles in this series will\nexamine the new landscape of\nthe rebounding American\nhousing market.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Obama, Investing in Brighter Futures Remains a Tough Sell", "Date": "2014-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Whatever President Obama has accomplished, he has made little headway on the goal he values most: government action to lift long-term economic prospects for average Americans.Mr. Obama calls it \u201cmake or break,\u201d \u201cthe defining issue of our time\u201d and his personal measure of success in the White House. But his State of the Union address on Tuesday, which is sure to highlight once again the challenges facing the middle class and the poor, could underscore his inability so far to convert talk into the taxpayer-financed investments that he and other Democrats believe can make the biggest difference. Congress has shunned a $75 billion plan to expand early childhood education that Mr. Obama proposed in last year\u2019s State of the Union, and the infrastructure bank he has pushed for four years.As aides draft their 2015 budget plan, their 2014 version shows this bottom line for Mr. Obama\u2019s sixth year in office: Government investments in infrastructure, research and development, and education and training, at 3.3 percent of the nation\u2019s economy, match the level from President George W. Bush\u2019s sixth year in office.That reflects the impact of the economic emergency that consumed the opening of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency and the effectiveness of congressional Republicans who don\u2019t share Democrats\u2019 confidence in government. In an era dominated by concern over deficits, Republicans have largely controlled the debate, even as Democrats have won four of the last six presidential elections.President Bill Clinton, too, saw public investment in areas like education and transportation as critical to lifting the stagnation in middle-class living standards that began in the 1970s. Adjusted for inflation, the $283 billion in federal investments in 2000, Mr. Clinton\u2019s last full year in office, was $6 billion lower than it was in the last year of his predecessor, President George H.W. Bush.\u201cIt has not been possible to significantly shift the needle,\u201d said Laura D\u2019Andrea Tyson, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who headed Mr. Clinton\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cWe should be raising those levels, and we\u2019re not.\u201cI guess the good news,\u201d Ms. Tyson added, \u201cis that the share hasn\u2019t been plummeting.\u201dOver the last half-century, though, it has plummeted. Spending on what the federal government classifies as investments peaked in 1968 at 6.6 percent of the economy, twice the current proportion.Mr. Obama\u2019s greatest success came during the recession and financial crisis in 2009. The two-year stimulus law included more than $125 billion for education and job training, $68 billion for energy projects, $48 billion for transportation and $22 billion for science and research. Some of that money has been used to spur larger investments by state and local governments and private businesses.The administration can point to other major policies it believes have put ordinary Americans on sounder financial footing, now and in the future. The 2010 Wall Street regulation law includes new consumer protections. The Education Department\u2019s Race to the Top program has awarded $4 billion to 19 states to upgrade elementary and secondary schools.The Affordable Care Act includes about $940 billion in spending over 10 years to expand health insurance coverage. So long as the recent moderation in health care costs persists, White House aides contend, the law will increase the ability of businesses to raise wages.\u201cFrom the vantage point of income inequality and ensuring economic mobility, providing health care access is a pretty significant thing,\u201d said Neera Tanden, a former Obama administration official who now directs the left-leaning Center for American Progress.Yet that is not the answer to global economic pressures that have sapped the earning power of American workers. The two parties disagree sharply on what is an effective answer.Republicans lean more heavily on individual initiative and the private market, Mr. Obama and Democrats on government\u2019s role in upgrading \u201chuman capital\u201d as well as the physical kind. But since the Tea Party sweep of 2010, Democrats have faced mainly frustration.The squeeze on investments in long-run projects reflects a basic truth of modern politics: Lawmakers tend to focus on the near term.They also find it easier to cut discretionary spending \u2014 the part of the budget containing investments, which Congress approves each year \u2014 than the much larger \u201centitlement\u201d spending that flows automatically to those who qualify. The biggest entitlement programs, Medicare and Social Security, benefit retirees who vote in disproportionate numbers.Republicans have fought virtually all the president\u2019s initiatives. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economic adviser to the younger President Bush, asserts that Mr. Obama might have won compromises on investments in areas like infrastructure had he shown a greater commitment to change government.Some Democrats question the president\u2019s earlier priorities. Overhauling the health care system \u201cwas a worthy goal,\u201d Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in a speech last week, but it was not the foremost concern of Americans facing declining incomes.Still, Mr. Schumer sees the recent bipartisan budget deal \u2014 though it merely restored domestic spending levels to those of the Bush era \u2014 as an important signal of change. Others include falling budget deficits and a change of tone in Congress, where Republicans with national ambitions, like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, are increasingly talking about helping the poor.\u201cWe\u2019ve been playing on a Reagan playing field \u2014 a cut-government, shrink-programs field \u2014 since 1981,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s all turning around now.\u201dIf he is right, the president has three years left to capitalize. Neither Mr. Obama nor his aides evince much confidence.The White House is increasingly depending on the president\u2019s executive authority and on seeking agreements outside the government. For example, Mr. Obama has used existing funds to start manufacturing innovation centers and pressed colleges to help vulnerable students. He plans to encourage states to raise minimum wages, major businesses to expand job training, and private backers to finance early childhood education if Congress will not.No one knows if Mr. Obama can succeed with those alternate routes to expanding economic opportunity. Budget pressures, though easing now, will only grow in the next decade as more baby boomers move onto Social Security and Medicare rolls.\u201cIf you score him by intent and things he has proposed, he\u2019d get pretty good marks,\u201d said David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIf you were grading him on results, which is what matters to the next generation, he would get a much poorer grade.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Study of Books Finds Economic Link", "Date": "2014-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe researchers, based in Britain, sifted three million digitized English-language books through a statistical sieve and created a \u201cliterary misery index\u201d \u2014 calculated by an equation that subtracts the frequency of words associated with joy from words associated with sadness.\u201cOne of the biggest peaks in literary misery is after the Great Depression,\u201d Dr. Bentley said. While his team did not analyze specific books, Dr. Bentley said, to use the example of Steinbeck: \u201cIt\u2019s not about the time when he\u2019s writing. It\u2019s about the times that he\u2019s drawing upon that goes into his writing.\u201d The study, which used 20th-century fiction and nonfiction books, was published Wednesday by the Public Library of Science\u2019s journal PLOS One. Dr. Bentley acknowledged that some people learning of these results \u201cwould say, \u2018no duh,\u2019\u00a0\u201d but, he said, \u201cTo me it confirms that we do have a collective memory that conditions the way we write, and that economics is a very important driver of that.\u201d Authors and other literary figures reacted with some amusement to the findings, noting that books take years to write, so they naturally reflect earlier times. \u201cI admit, I am laughing,\u201d Jane Smiley, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1992 for \u201cA Thousand Acres,\u201d wrote in an email. In a telephone interview, she said: \u201cWe think we\u2019re all unique, and we think every novel is individual, and it is. So when they reduce us all to a bunch of data about words, I guess you have to laugh.\u201d Chang-rae Lee, another novelist, said, \u201cMy impression is, of course there\u2019s a lag\u201d between economic conditions and their reflection in literature. \u201cFor fiction writers, you have to be able to ingest and digest this stuff.\u201d Kimberly Neuendorf, a communications professor at Cleveland State University who studies content analysis, said that using powerful search tools to analyze a serious subject like literature was \u201ca welcome alternative to the pop application of big data to analyze Twitter trends and Google search popularity.\u201d She added: \u201cAnyone with a computer can pull this big data together and find out what the current mood is of Kanye West, but this is much bigger. It makes me think how important our economy seems to be to our culture.\u201d She cited a few earlier studies melding science and art. A 1990 study, for example, found that depressing lyrics in Top 40 songs predicted economic pessimism about two years later. A 1999 study found that when social and economic conditions were bad, movie actresses with \u201cmature facial features\u201d \u2014 small eyes, thin cheeks, large chins \u2014 were popular, but when conditions were good, the public liked actresses with childlike features. In the new study, researchers also analyzed 650,000 German books and found the same misery correlation. Still, the practice of applying data-sorting algorithms to art can only go so far. For one thing, the lists of emotion words, created by other researchers and used for years, include some surprising choices: words like \u201csmug\u201d and \u201cwallow\u201d were among 224 words on the \u201cjoy\u201d list; potentially neutral adjectives like \u201cdark\u201d and \u201clow\u201d were among 115 words on the \u201csadness\u201d list.What about authors who produced work over several decades? Is the mood of each book really influenced by the economy of the previous 10 years, or have they developed a style based on other factors? Lorin Stein, editor of The Paris Review, said that Philip Roth\u2019s \u201cGoodbye, Columbus,\u201d published in 1959, may have had echoes of the prosperous economy during the previous decade, but the economy could not explain later works like \u201cAmerican Pastoral,\u201d published in 1997. \u201cThe tricky thing is that people get older and no one stays cheerful forever,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cLook at Roth. His later works included unrelenting misery. Yes, America happened to be a much richer country in \u2018Goodbye, Columbus,\u2019 but he was also young.\u201dMany personal factors likely influence writers before economic developments would, Mr. Stein said. With John Cheever, for example, \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with someone who\u2019s wrestling with alcoholism and latent homosexuality \u2014 every writer I know has some version of that,\u201d he said, adding that it was difficult to conceive of having \u201cso much data that you can factor out everybody\u2019s drinking problem, everybody\u2019s prostate cancer, everybody\u2019s lumpectomy.\u201dAnne Bernays, who has written 10 novels, said most novels were not \u201chappy books\u201d anyway. \u201cThey\u2019re about conflict and tension and about misery.\u201dHer first book, \u201cShort Pleasures,\u201d published in 1962, did not reflect the positive economy of the 1950s, she pointed out. Among its lines are: \u201cIt was hopeless. I began to cry.\u201d And her newest book, \u201cThe Man on The Third Floor,\u201d was published in 2012, but takes place in the 1950s. Some writers could cite a book or two that tracked with the study\u2019s results. Ms. Smiley\u2019s \u201cHorse Heaven,\u201d published in 2000, reflected 1990s prosperity, focusing on horse racing culture, she said. But most of her other works developed because she was \u201cdriven by a particular subject, and you write about it no matter what.\u201d Mr. Lee\u2019s just-published novel, \u201cOn Such a Full Sea,\u201d is a dystopian futuristic tale woven around three stratified social classes. \u201cThat\u2019s clearly an anxiety that I\u2019ve been mulling over, my sense that there\u2019s a sort of skewing of income equality,\u201d he said. But with his 1995 novel \u201cNative Speaker,\u201d about a Korean-American immigrant\u2019s experience, Mr. Lee said he did not see a connection to the previous decade\u2019s economy. \u201cIn 1985 I was in college, in my little cocoon,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Banks Take On European Debt, Despite Underlying Problems", "Date": "2014-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 A wave of euphoria has swept over financial markets because investors now think Europe\u2019s sovereign debt crisis may be ending. But the enthusiasm masks a lingering problem. The harsh austerity programs used to regain their confidence have fanned deep recessions and high unemployment across Southern Europe.Emboldened by promises from Europe\u2019s central bank to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to keep financial crisis at bay, investors are rewarding countries for sticking to their medicine. In the rush to grab profits, said Mohamed A. El-Erian, the chief executive of Pimco, one of the world\u2019s largest bond investors, \u201cinvestors are choosing to overlook all sorts of things.\u201dWith deficits starting to decline in some countries, and tentative signs of recovery emerging in others, investors are again willing to finance European governments at affordable rates. Banks, which dumped European sovereign debt during the crisis, have been loading up on it again, scrambling to profit from returns that are among the most lucrative in the world.Borrowing costs for Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Greece have fallen to levels not seen since 2010, when the effects of depressed economies and a fiscal straitjacket imposed by the strictures of being bound to a common currency led investors to drive those same costs sky-high, forcing several countries to take international bailouts.\u201cThe market is honoring fiscal improvement,\u201d said Rainer Guntermann, an analyst at Commerzbank, which is based in Frankfurt.By spurring policy makers to reduce deficits, overhaul labor markets and curb the runaway spending that helped lead to the crisis, \u201causterity has been a necessary condition for countries to regain the confidence needed to keep market access,\u201d Mr. Guntermann said.In Ireland, which stuck to a harsh austerity plan and recently became the first euro zone country to leave a bailout, yields on the benchmark 10-year bond have fallen to 3.2 percent. That is well below 14 percent at the height of the crisis.Spain\u2019s borrowing costs have slumped to the lowest levels since 2006, and Portugal\u2019s have fallen to the lowest since 2010. Even the bonds of Greece, one of Europe\u2019s sickest economies, are trading at 7 percent in the secondary market, down from nearly 50 percent less than two years ago.Signs suggest an economic recovery, though economists vociferously debate how much austerity had to do with it. The economies of the 18-member euro bloc fell 0.4 percent last year after a 0.7 decline in 2012. A mild recovery of 1.1 percent is forecast for this year.Nevertheless, the speed and sweep of the improved sentiment toward the euro zone has alarms ringing. Rising long-term unemployment, the high rate of jobless youth, social distress and the low level of economic growth coinciding with rising debt levels strongly suggest that the economies of these countries are still not healthy. \u201cThere are pretty alarming numbers,\u201d Mr. El-Erian said. \u201cAll of these things have not been solved.\u201dAusterity programs forced governments to tackle the financial and structural problems they created when times were good. Last week, officials from countries that took bailouts at the height of the crisis said that the austerity they were required to undertake by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission, the so-called Troika of lenders, was inevitable.\u201cThe program, although rigorous and painful, is the only way that will enable the country\u2019s exit from the crisis,\u201d Cyprus\u2019s central bank said in a letter to the European Parliament. In Portugal, where public enmity flared against austerity, the finance ministry said that its bailout, despite the hardship it induced, \u201cremains a suitable and rational response to the crisis of credibility threatening our country.\u201dBut the rapid pace with which spending cuts and tax increases were made has created new risks that could reignite the euro\u2019s troubles later.In Greece, which set off the euro crisis in 2010, politicians passed emergency austerity measures to fix the economy, even as doing so set off protests. When financial markets began to sour on other euro zone countries with similar problems, governments from Ireland to Italy quickly followed suit.\u201cPanic in the financial markets led to panic in the world of policy makers,\u201d said Paul De Grauwe, a professor of European political economy at the London School of Economics.The result, Mr. De Grauwe said, is that austerity, which was intended to put countries on a path toward reducing debts and deficits, instead choked growth so much that governments have struggled for enough tax revenue to do so. Rather than falling, debt as a percentage of gross domestic product has instead risen in Greece, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Portugal.But if investors start worrying again and rates again rise, pressure may build for more austerity, Mr. De Grauwe said. \u201cAusterity is not over. The debt overhang and a decline in inflation will force the countries to intensify austerity, which is not good news for the prospect of sustained recovery.\u201dAnd while the financial side of Europe\u2019s crisis has abated for now, new risks have risen in its place, especially on the political front. After five years of recession and surging unemployment, especially across Southern Europe, disenchantment with austerity is widespread. Unemployment in the euro bloc is near a record 12.1 percent. In Spain and Greece, the rate is above 26 percent, and youth unemployment in both places has surged to above 57 percent.\u201cA key issue is the social tolerance of the population,\u201d Mr. El-Erian said. The rally in euro zone bond markets might be good for investors, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t translate into food on the table.\u201dVoters are expected to manifest their anger in May in elections for the European Parliament, where anti-European Union forces could be elected in greater numbers. That could make it difficult for governments to enact legislative changes needed to stabilize the euro\u2019s foundations, including strengthening regionwide banking regulation, more central bank coordination and improved political integration.Groups including Greece\u2019s neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, France\u2019s Front National, the Dutch Freedom Party and the anti-euro True Finns party represent \u201ca rejection of austerity and a system that people were told would bring heaven on earth,\u201d Mr. De Grauwe said. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s become a hell for many, and that leads to loss of credibility of the dominant political systems.\u201dThe specter of deflation has cropped up as a new menace to the euro zone\u2019s health. A slow recovery on the southern tier, reduced wages and high unemployment have crimped consumers\u2019 spending power and threatens to drive prices into a destabilizing downward spiral.For now, investors seem content to overlook such troubles, especially after Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, repeated his pledge this month to try to control any fresh financial turmoil. \u201cWithout Mr. Draghi, these countries would still be very risky,\u201d said Thomas Mayer, a senior fellow at the Center of Financial Studies at Goethe Universit\u00e4t in Frankfurt, and an adviser to Deutsche Bank.If borrowing costs remain low, activity should improve. Better financing conditions encourage countries to move toward growth-enhancing changes, and credit may flow to the economy again as the costs of financing fall.This week, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France pledged tax cuts to stimulate business, something analysts said is partly made possible by low borrowing costs. In Italy, the finance minister recently said lower rates would free resources for investment and tax cuts.But as has happened many times during the crisis, in the absence of pressure from financial markets, governments lose the will to carry out change seen as necessary to build a healthier base for future growth. In Italy, where a market panic in 2011 helped force then-premier Silvio Berlusconi from office, his successor Mario Monti soothed fears by pledging a spate of structural changes. Once markets calmed, the Italians returned to procrastinating.With so many uncertainties still swirling, Mr. El-Erian said,\"the jury is still out on what will happen in Europe.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Proposed Abortion Restrictions in Spain Face Backlash", "Date": "2014-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy\u2019s proposal to enact some of the toughest abortion restrictions in Europe has exposed his already unpopular government to a building political backlash and criticism from the European Parliament, while reinvigorating his Socialist opponents and opening divisions in his own conservative Popular Party.On Sunday, demonstrators gathered in downtown Madrid to protest the government\u2019s health care cuts and the abortion proposal, which was introduced in December and would allow the termination of a pregnancy only if it was the result of rape or if having the baby would significantly endanger the mother\u2019s health. It would not allow abortions if the fetus was deformed.\u201cThose who give birth should be deciding,\u201d said Pilar G\u00f3mez, an administrator of the Los Y\u00e9benes health care center in Madrid. \u201cAfter all the advances that we had made, we\u2019re now being taken right back to the days of Franco.\u201dThe current abortion law, adopted under the previous Socialist administration, allows women to end a pregnancy within the first 14 weeks and beyond that period in cases of life-threatening problems related to the fetus.On Wednesday, Elena Valenciano, the deputy leader of the Socialist Party, argued that Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government, which up to now had been focused on Spain\u2019s ailing economy, was also taking a \u201creal step back in history\u201d with a proposed law that she described as an affront to women.She predicted that the law would turn on Mr. Rajoy by dividing his party rather than strengthening his electoral appeal among conservatives. Already, some senior members of his Popular Party have urged the prime minister to soften the legislation.The abortion debate has transcended Spain\u2019s borders. Protests were recently held outside Spain\u2019s embassy in Paris, and France\u2019s minister for women\u2019s affairs, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, said it was \u201cterrible to see Spain about to take a step back on the right to decide over one\u2019s own body.\u201d Last week, the European Parliament held a heated session over what Spain\u2019s planned U-turn would mean for the rest of the Continent. In Portugal, news media have started speculating about whether the country\u2019s abortion clinics could cope with an influx of women from neighboring Spain.Mr. Rajoy\u2019s Popular Party has a comfortable majority in Parliament. But the Socialists have urged the government to allow voting on the abortion law to take place by secret ballot, to help encourage dissenting conservative lawmakers to break ranks.Advertisement"}

It was 2009, and he had been appointed acting mayor \u2014 effectively the local manager of the massive construction project already underway \u2014 and in Russia incumbency means victory. His many prospective challengers included a K.G.B. veteran accused of poisoning the fugitive secret-service officer Aleksandr Litvinenko with polonium; a prima ballerina who had become even more famous after the Bolshoi dismissed her for being overweight; and a pornographic actress, Yelena Berkova, who ran a campaign ad that showed her gamboling topless along one of the Black Sea beaches that first made Sochi popular in the early 20th century.Many challengers did not even make it to the ballot, barred for various reasons, real and contrived. Those who did qualify as candidates \u2014 most significant, Boris Nemtsov, a Sochi native and former deputy prime minister under Russia\u2019s first president, Boris Yeltsin \u2014 never had a chance. Nemtsov and the others faced constant harassment and were denied crucial access to television and radio channels controlled by the state. Pakhomov won 77 percent of the vote, officially at least. Nemtsov sued \u2014 and lost \u2014 and his contempt lingers. \u201cA real idiot, right?\u201d he told me recently, referring to the man who bested him in an election that amounted to a farce.Pakhomov is a garrulous, barrel-bellied apparatchik of the new Russia, whose biography cites not one but two Ph.D.'s. When I interviewed him in December in his office, the mayoral building was, like most of the city, still enveloped in scaffolding for the final pre-Olympic cosmetic touches. After introductions, he did not wait for a question but launched into a pre-emptive defense of the games, monologuing for 15 minutes before I managed to interject, briefly. \u201cWe built 438 transformer substations, 17 power-distribution hubs, two thermoelectric power stations!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWe generate 540 megawatts!\u201d The Olympics, he went on, have done nothing less than transform Sochi, a subtropical resort that stretches about 90 miles along a narrow coastline at the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. Three new water-purification plants; more than 200 miles of new roads; 22 tunnels and 55 bridges to ease the city\u2019s chronically snarled traffic; 13 new and renovated railroad stations; five new schools; six medical centers \u201cwith top-of-the-line medical equipment\u201d; 49 new hotels with 24,000 rooms. Pakhomov picked up a laser pointer and turned it to a wall-size map of Sochi, highlighting the sites of the shimmering new Olympic stadiums and arenas, the ski resorts carved out of the mountains above a once-tiny-and-remote village, Krasnaya Polyana, the new airport terminal, the port that will become a yacht marina, the complex of railroad lines and stations that he compared favorably with the Baikal-Amur Mainline, or BAM, the enormous railroad project built across an inhospitable Siberia and Far East in the 1970s and \u201880s by a dying Soviet Union. Not since Stalin favored Sochi as the sunny retreat of the Soviet elite has so much been done to remake the city\u2019s landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s incomparable!\u201d Pakhomov bellowed.The Soviet proclivity for superlatives endures. So does the notion that a country\u2019s greatness stems from its ability to execute improbably gigantic projects of dubious economic viability. Soviet history is replete with these megaprojects, top-down endeavors that, in the name of collectivism, industrialized the nation, conquered the Arctic, built the military that crushed the Nazis and stood toe to toe against the United States and NATO. They were ideological as much as economic, intended above all to demonstrate the superiority of the Soviet political system. By the dusk of the Soviet era, they became largely discredited. The last Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, promised to end the megaprojects and embrace more sensible development strategies.The megaproject has returned \u2014 another Soviet legacy pursued by the singular will of Vladimir Putin, who seems incapable of escaping the ideas that nurtured him from youth. The Olympics in Sochi are often called Putin\u2019s games, a profligate investment to prove to the world Russia\u2019s resurrection, a personal validation of his 14 years \u2014 and counting \u2014 as the country\u2019s paramount ruler. They are the realization of Putin\u2019s power and a vital instrument in keeping it. In the nearly seven years since Russia was awarded the games, Putin\u2019s government has spent a sum so staggering \u2014 officially, at least $51 billion, though according to some estimates much higher \u2014 that Sochi has become the most expensive Olympics ever, far surpassing the $40 billion that China spent on the Summer Olympics in Beijing in 2008.Sochi is simply the most prominent of many megaprojects through which Putin has distributed the nation\u2019s wealth to buy loyalty and to discipline the lack of it. The government spent nearly $7 billion in the Volga River city of Kazan to hold last year\u2019s summer Universiade, the biennial athletic competition of university students that hardly ranks as a major international event, and it has already won the right to hold the winter Universiade in 2019 in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk. Russia is building or refurbishing 12 stadiums and upgrading hotels and transportation in 11 cities to hold the FIFA World Cup in 2018 \u2014 at an estimated cost that has already doubled to nearly $20 billion since 2010.The megaprojects are not limited to sporting events. Russia spent $20 billion to remake Vladivostok \u2014 including a new university complex and a bridge linking the city to an island that was once a closed military zone, largely in preparation for holding a two-day summit meeting in 2012 of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation nations. (When I attended as a reporter traveling with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the dorm rooms had been completed so recently that they reeked of glue and fresh paint.) To facilitate natural-resource extraction in the Far North, the Russian government, in collaboration with the energy giant Gazprom, is spending billions to complete an Arctic railway that was a failed megaproject in the Soviet era. Stalin decreed a similar railroad project in 1949, using the slave labor of the gulag to carve the route though the frozen earth. (It was abandoned when he died in 1953, but not before tens of thousands of prisoners perished during the effort.) Putin\u2019s design for the Arctic seems no less grandiose.Putin and his supporters say that these projects are economic-stimulus programs to modernize and expand a sagging economy, but others see a darker underside. In a forthcoming book, \u201cThe 2014 Winter Olympics and the Evolution of Putin\u2019s Russia,\u201d two scholars at George Washington University, Robert W. Orttung and Sufian Zhemukhov, argue that what we\u2019re seeing is a return to the national purpose of the Soviet megaprojects, though without an explicit ideology \u2014 other than the continuation of Putin\u2019s rule and the enrichment of a new oligarchy. \u201cThe games,\u201d they write, \u201chelp to promote regime stability by providing a sense of national pride for the masses and a source of rent distribution for key elites whose support is crucial for the leadership to maintain the status quo.\u201dThe only time in nearly an hour that Pakhomov lowered his voice was when I asked him about Putin\u2019s regular oversight of the construction in Sochi, which has been fraught with well-chronicled delays, cost overruns, environmental abuses and, as with Peter the Great\u2019s creation of a czarist St. Petersburg, the squalid treatment of laborers. Putin\u2019s meetings are staged affairs, broadcast slavishly by state television networks to show the man very much in charge. They occasionally become vehicles for him to scold minions who have disappointed. \u201cAfter the journalists leave,\u201d Putin told his assembled subordinates during a meeting in 2012 on preparations for the Olympics, \u201cI will tell you what failures to meet the deadlines will amount to.\u201d Another public dressing-down last year, involving delays and cost overruns in construction of the ski jump in Krasnaya Polyana, was so terrifying that the project manager, a vice president of the Russian Olympic Committee, promptly fled the country with his brother after being fired. (He later claimed he was poisoned with mercury.) \u201cPersonally, I am always very tense and nervous when I\u2019m invited to present a report to the president,\u201d Pakhomov told me, his voice at last a hush. \u201cHe sets the tasks, but he never says you did a good job. He always says simply that everything has to be finished.\u201dThe project was an engineering marvel and, to critics, a boondoggle that has created an environmental calamity. The railroad begins at a new train station (now the largest station in all of Russia) in Adler, a district of Sochi. It then courses up the Mzymta River, which, once pristine, now churns downhill in a muddy brown, washing past construction detritus left behind. The impact was so extensive that the United Nations Environmental Program pressed Russia to adopt a restoration plan, while Unesco has repeatedly questioned the effects of the construction on the Western Caucasus, which it describes, along with a forest in the Urals, as \u201cthe only large mountain area in Europe that has not experienced significant human impact.\u201dThe project was overseen by Russia Railways, the state-owned company that is the country\u2019s largest employer. Since 2005, it has been led by Vladimir Yakunin, a friend of Putin\u2019s whose posting as a diplomat at the United Nations at the end of the Soviet era fueled speculation \u2014 never confirmed or denied \u2014 that he, too, worked for the K.G.B. Under Yakunin, the company has become enormously profitable. For the Olympics it also refurbished the railroad from Moscow to Sochi (now a 23-hour ride) and the local lines in Sochi itself. The city now has a network of new trains linking the city center to its airport in Adler, the Olympic Park and the mountains. The ride from Adler to the mountains takes 43 minutes and costs 56 rubles, or about $1.70. In an interview in the railways\u2019 headquarters in Moscow, Yakunin said that the company\u2019s return on its share of the investment \u2014 roughly $1.3 billion \u2014 would take at least 20 years. Whether the project is economically sound is not the point, though, when the state is the only shareholder, and Putin decides what\u2019s best for it. Yakunin compared the project with the trans-Siberian Railway built under Czar Nicholas II. Commercially, it too was unsustainable, he said, but without it, \u201cwe would not have Russia today at all, at least in the borders we have.\u201d\u201cWhat is really interesting is that Putin believes nobody knows about the corruption,\u201d Nemtsov said over dinner in Moscow. It\u2019s not for Nemtsov\u2019s lack of trying. In a report he co-wrote and distributes at political protests, he noted that Russian Railways contracted the bulk of the road and railway project to two companies, including one that is now partly owned by a businessman named Gennady Timchenko, who has longstanding connections to Putin. Nemtsov also claims that 15 percent of the entire Olympic budget went to companies owned by the brothers Rotenberg, Arkady and Boris, who were Putin\u2019s friends and judo partners when they were coming of age in the 1960s. After Putin\u2019s rise to power, they advanced in the ranks of Russia\u2019s oligarchs. In an interview with The Financial Times in 2012, Arkady Rotenberg defended his friendship and said he had not used it for personal gain. \u201cI have great respect for this person,\u201d he said of Putin, \u201cand I consider that this is a person sent to our country from God.\u201dEvery Olympics costs more than the initial projections, but Russia\u2019s costs have increased more than fourfold since Putin\u2019s initial estimate of $12 billion. As Nemtsov figures, because most games typically double in cost, the difference in Russia \u2014 $25 billion to $30 billion \u2014 can be attributed to outright thievery. \u201cThis is a festival of corruption,\u201d he said. And he argued that everything \u2014 from the choice of Sochi, to the design of the buildings, to the contracts parceled out \u2014 was effectively controlled by Putin. \u201cThere was no public discussion about the place. Zero. Not even one discussion in Parliament. Zero. No discussion on Putin TV, the zombie box. It was completely closed.\u201dNaberezhnaya asked that a colleague and I meet her at a bus stop in Bytkha, a working-class neighborhood that climbs into the hills along the coast and is likely to be trod by few, if any, of the visitors who come for the Olympics. It was already dark when we arrived, and she appeared at the bus stop a few minutes later. She took us on a rambling walk through darkened streets and alleys before we arrived at the back of a Soviet-era apartment building, with an expansive view of Sochi\u2019s center and the mountains cast in silvery moonlight. An old shed had been converted into a crude apartment, sparsely furnished and occupied most of the time by a lone cat. Stacked around were boxes of campaign literature for Yabloko, one of the oldest democratic parties in Russia, to which many of the environmentalists also belong. It is here that Naberezhnaya is finishing work, in virtual collaboration with the alliance\u2019s now-scattered members, on a final report on the environmental impact wrought not only by the Olympics but also by the rapacious development underway in the region\u2019s protected parks, including a supposed research center above Sochi that is widely believed to be a personal mountain resort, replete with helipads and several Swiss-style chalets, for Putin.She cited a new law that was proposed by the Kremlin and dutifully adopted by both houses of Parliament in November 2007, effectively superseding all other relevant laws regarding the use of environmentally sensitive areas. \u201cThe territory planning documentation for the location of Olympic facilities shall be approved without holding public hearings,\u201d the law declared.In her dim shed-apartment-office, Naberezhnaya described a sort of golden age of environmentalism after the collapse of the Soviet Union, where activists could openly call for preservation and collaborate with foreign advocates and scientists to protect Russia\u2019s abundant natural wonders. Since Putin, she said, there has been a steady deterioration of rights that has polarized the country into loyalists and enemies. \u201cAt the beginning, when we used to handcuff ourselves to the mayor\u2019s building in protest, the police would unhook us gently. Now they pull us by our hair.\u201d She told me of a good friend who worked for the special police, known as OMON, who warned her: \u201cBe careful. One day we\u2019ll be on the opposite sides of the barricades.\u201d Naberezhnaya compared this kind of deadening paranoia to something out of Kafka\u2019s \u201cCastle,\u201d the dark and surreal novel in which the protagonist, K., struggles to engage an opaque, all-powerful authority. She noted that there had been a Russian film version made in 1994, the early days of Russia\u2019s democratic transition. \u201cThe film is very atmospheric,\u201d she wrote in an email a few days later. \u201cWatch carefully.\u201dIn 2012, however, Putin declared his intention to return to the presidency, and since then has presided over an intensifying crackdown on dissent. He forced through a new law requiring nongovernment organizations that receive funding from abroad to register as \u201cforeign agents,\u201d a term with echoes of Soviet persecution of dissidents. He banned the adoption of orphans by Americans. He signed a new law that made it a crime to propagandize \u201cnontraditional relationships\u201d to minors, prompting international outrage and calls for a boycott of Sochi by gay rights organizations. Many prominent world leaders, including President Obama, have made excuses not to attend the Sochi games, thus avoiding having to appear beside Putin as he basks in the international attention.Human Rights Watch and other groups like the Environmental Watch on the North Caucasus have chronicled a range of abuses, including the gross exploitation of migrant laborers, many of them shuttled in from abroad. While Russian officials dispute the accusations of corruption, the evidence has mounted to the point that even a member of the International Olympic Committee, Gian-Franco Kasper, told Switzerland\u2019s SRF radio this month that roughly a third of the spending on the games had been lost to embezzlement.Many of the stadiums, the Alpine ski courses, the sleek new bobsled track, are ready and have already been tested in international competitions, but construction work has continued up to the last minute, with complaints from organizers that hotels and other amenities might not be ready in time. When I visited the site of the freestyle ski events, the surrounding area was a muddy mess, cluttered with construction equipment and debris. Aleksandr Savilov, the site\u2019s manager, said the progress that had been made was almost unimaginable. \u201cTwo years ago, there was almost nothing here,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s like mushrooms after the rain.\u201d It was late November, and it still had not snowed, the weather in the mountains being so unpredictable that organizers had stockpiled snow from last winter and built the world\u2019s most extensive system for making artificial snow. Looking from a platform over the work still underway at the village where athletes will stay, he shrugged off the delays. \u201cEven if it\u2019s not finished,\u201d Savilov said, \u201cthe snow will cover it.\u201dIn his office overlooking the coast, Dmitri Chernyshenko, the president of the Sochi Olympic Organizing Committee, acknowledged that it was \u201ca very risky decision\u201d for the international committee to choose Sochi, but that Russia had succeeded in using the opportunity to redevelop the only subtropical seashore it has. \u201cWe need such a project to unite the nation,\u201d he said.Like Chernyshenko, Pakhomov has little patience for the critics, especially his former challenger. \u201cHe must be ashamed,\u201d he said of Nemtsov. \u201cWhen he was running for mayor, he said, \u2018It\u2019s impossible \u2014 nothing can be built here.\u2019 Now he can see that everything has been built.\u201d Pakhomov complained to me that Russia remained burdened by old stereotypes, recalling a visiting foreign official asking him, \u201cWhat else do you have except vodka and bears?\u201d He said Russia was a different place from the Soviet Union when it held the Summer Games in 1980. \u201cEven now the goals are different,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe want to be open to the entire world and to show the world our hospitality, our culture, our love of sport, our beauty, the cleanliness of our streets. And of course, we would like to get rid of the drivel that we have endured and is not so pleasant.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Study Suggests Recovery in U.S. Is Relatively Vital", "Date": "2014-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Academic heavyweights have been debating whether the current United States economy is so sluggish because of too much government stimulus or not enough, or because slower growth had become the norm even before the recession.But maybe these arguments share a faulty premise. It found that relative to previous American financial crises, the current economy is doing substantially better. Across nine major financial crises in the United States, the average peak-to-trough decline in inflation-adjusted per-capita gross domestic product is about 9 percent, and it has taken an average of 6.7 years to recover to the precrisis peak. During the years after crises, five of the nine episodes also had a \u201cdouble-dip\u201d downturn.By contrast, the recent American subprime crisis beginning in 2007 had \u201conly\u201d a 5 percent drop in per capita output, and took \u201conly\u201d six years to get back to the precrisis peak. And so far, at least, there has been no second downward turn. Employment and other measurements currently remain well below their precrisis peaks, but it is difficult to compare those numbers to past crises because the historical data for those categories is not as reliable, Ms. Reinhart said. Relative to its current peer countries, the study says, the United States is also doing unusually well.Eleven other countries experienced systemic crises around the time the United States did: France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Ukraine and Britain. Six years later, just two of them \u2014 the United States and Germany \u2014 have recovered to their previous peak in real income.While the United States has been doing well relative to historical crises, the other advanced countries seem to be doing especially poorly compared with their performance after previous crises. \u201cThis crisis may in the end surpass in severity the Great Depression in a large number of countries,\u201d Ms. Reinhart said in an interview. \u201cIn fact, it may very well have one of the most protracted and painful recoveries for advanced countries in the aggregate.\u201dMs. Reinhart offered a few explanations for why the study showed the United States doing unusually well compared with both its past self and its current peers, however bad it still feels to the typical American worker. Among the biggest likely contributors are the major monetary and fiscal stimulus measures American policy makers undertook early in the crisis, which helped limit losses from the recession.The United States also had some effective restructuring of debt through foreclosures. In some states, when the house is seized, borrowers do not usually still owe the balance of the loan. In much of Europe, Ms. Reinhart said, \u201cYou lose your house, but not the debt.\u201d Finally, and perhaps most significant, the United States was still able to borrow money easily as the rest of the world sought safe assets. These enthusiastic lenders allowed American politicians to avoid the truly crippling austerity measures that countries like Greece resorted to in order to try to pay their bills.\u201cWhy would any politician in their right mind undertake the kinds of austerity measures Greece has done? Because no one will lend to them, and existing creditors want full repayment,\u201d Ms. Reinhart said. \u201cWhen the rest of the world is unwilling to lend, you do things that are driven by necessity.\u201d Ms. Reinhart said one of the policy implications of the new study was that Europe needed to engage in substantially more restructuring, both of public and private debt. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to engage in austerity, your best shot is if you at least couple it with something else, like debt write-offs, or inflation,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they\u2019re all ugly scenarios, really.\u201dAsked about the debate on whether some underlying \u201csecular stagnation\u201d might have also predated the subprime crisis, as Lawrence H. Summers, her Harvard colleague and a former Obama administration official, has been arguing, she said it was too soon to tell. But she said the long-term decline in labor force participation was worrisome.These doldrums, he said on Saturday, stem from factors including slower population growth, a possible decline in technology innovation and changes in the distribution of income \u2014 not only between the rich and poor but also between corporations and households.With interest rates already so low, he said, it is difficult to use expansionary monetary policy to encourage investment. Instead, he called for government spending, particularly on infrastructure, especially while government borrowing costs are so cheap.\u201cThe central imperative is anti-austerity, not austerity,\u201d he said, \u201cand it has the potential to be as free a lunch as economics will ever find.\u201dIf Mr. Summers\u2019s theory is accurate, said John B. Taylor, a Stanford economist who served in Republican presidential administrations, \u201cYou would have expected the economy to not have been working so well before the crisis. He says it wasn\u2019t. I say it was.\u201dMr. Taylor said that such measures as inflation, housing investment and unemployment showed a strong economy leading up to the crisis.Unlike the Reinhart-Rogoff work, Mr. Taylor argues that it is fair to compare some postwar recoveries to the current one \u2014 a comparison that does indeed make today\u2019s economic conditions look unusually bad. He places blame for this tepid recovery on economic uncertainty and regulation, and on what he calls a departure from rules-based, predictable monetary policy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Upward Mobility Has Not Declined, Study Says", "Date": "2014-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoth President Obama and leading Republicans, like Representative Paul Ryan, have argued recently that the odds of climbing the income ladder are lower today than in previous decades. The new study, based on tens of millions of anonymous tax records, finds that the mobility rate has held largely steady in recent decades, although it remains lower than in Canada and in much of Western Europe, where the odds of escaping poverty are higher.The results suggested that other forces \u2014 including sharply rising incomes at the top of the ladder, which allows well-off families to invest far more in their children \u2014 were holding back talented people, the authors said.The study has the potential to alter the way Mr. Obama and other public figures talk about mobility trends.\u201cThe facts themselves are pretty unassailable,\u201d said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has read the paper, which the authors will soon submit to an academic journal. \u201cHow you want to interpret them is the question.\u201dThe study found, for instance, that about 8 percent of children born in the early 1980s who grew up in families in the bottom fifth of the income distribution managed to reach the top fifth for their age group today. The rate was nearly identical for children born a decade earlier.Among children born into the middle fifth of the income distribution, about 20 percent climbed into the top fifth as adults, also largely unchanged over the last decade.Today, the odds of escaping poverty appear to be only about half as high in the United States as in the most mobile countries like Denmark, Mr. Saez said.The new study is based on a much larger data set than previous work. The earlier papers had to rely on surveys, while the latest paper examines the tax records, stripped of identifying details, of nearly every American born in a given year.The subject of mobility has become politically popular, as Democrats make the case that the affluent are choking off opportunity from others, and Republicans contend that a large, intrusive government is the culprit.But even a second measure \u2014 absolute mobility, which examines people\u2019s annual incomes relative to their parents\u2019 \u2014 produces a mixed picture.Yet the growth rate of absolute mobility has slowed, as economic growth has slowed to a disappointing level over the last 15 years. The incomes of middle-class and poor families have slowed even more sharply, because a large share of recent economic gains have gone to a small slice of affluent workers \u2014 often described in political shorthand as \u201cthe 1 percent.\u201dIn the most mobile metropolitan areas, such as Salt Lake City and San Francisco, mobility rates are similar to those in western Europe. In the least mobile areas, including Atlanta, Charlotte and much of the industrial Midwest, the odds are much lower.The variation, Mr. Saez said, offers hope that researchers will be able to learn more about the factors that contribute to upward mobility.For all the continuity over recent decades, the authors emphasized that parents appeared to cast a longer shadow over their children\u2019s lives, in some ways, than before. As inequality has risen, pushing the rungs on the income ladder further apart than they once were, the average economic penalty of being born poor has grown over time.\u201cIt matters more who your parents are today than it did in the past,\u201d Mr. Chetty said.

Lundgren, Macy\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cWe have identified some specific areas where we can improve our efficiency without compromising our effectiveness in serving the evolving needs of our customers.\u201dMacy\u2019s said sales at stores open for at least a year and online at macys.com and bloomingdales.com grew 3.6 percent in November and December over the same period in 2012. A report by the research firm ShopperTrak, also released Wednesday, found that sales at brick-and-mortar stores over all increased a lackluster 2.7 percent. (While online shopping is a growing force, more than 90 percent of retail commerce in the United States still occurs in stores, according to ShopperTrak.) The news, released shortly before the stock market closed, moved Macy\u2019s stock upward. It rose 2.6 percent in after-hours trading. The last time Macy\u2019s laid off several thousand workers was in 2009, when the company consolidated four large divisions into a single organization and cut 7,000 jobs. But 2009 was in the midst of the recession, and these days, things are looking bright for Macy\u2019s. The company reported good growth in the third quarter, even as many of its competitors reported disappointing earnings and trimmed their forecasts for the year.

Mr. Paul suggested, for example, that Congress could move forward on portions of an immigration overhaul if it were not for Democrats\u2019 demanding an all-or-nothing approach to granting citizenship.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, cautioned that his party\u2019s willingness to compromise would extend only so far.\u201cWe\u2019re anxious to help him create jobs, but we\u2019re not going to go over and endorse more spending, more debt, more taxes and more regulation,\u201d he said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\u201cI think for the president to ask for a clean debt ceiling, when we have a debt the size of our economy, is irresponsible,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cSo we ought to discuss adding something to his request to raise the debt ceiling that does something about the debt \u2014 or it produces at least something positive for our country.\u201d\u201cOf course we should do something,\u201d he said on the CBS News program \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t just write a blank check.\u201dMr. Pfeiffer said on Fox: \u201cOur position on this is the same as it was in October, and the same that it\u2019s been for more than a year, which is the American people should not have to pay the Republican Congress ransom for doing their most basic function, which is paying the bills.\u201dvideovideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Next Accident Awaits", "Date": "2014-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 THE United States is facing an industrial chemical safety crisis. The horrifying chemical spill that recently contaminated the drinking water of hundreds of thousands of people in West Virginia is the latest in a relentless series of disasters and near-misses across the country. It is clear to me, as chairman of the independent federal agency charged with investigating industrial chemical accidents, that urgent steps are required to significantly improve the safety of the nation\u2019s chemical industry \u2014 an industry vital to our economy, yet potentially dangerous to those who live near the thousands of facilities that process or store hazardous chemicals.Those facilities include ones like the Chevron refinery in Richmond, Calif., where aging, corroding pipes resulted in a huge fire in August 2012, and the fertilizer plant in West, Tex., where stores of ammonium nitrate exploded last year and laid waste to a large part of the town, killing more than a dozen people.While there is now, at last, a strong current within industry to adopt this safer technology as a best practice, many still oppose any actual regulatory requirements, arguing they are too costly and prescriptive. We can\u2019t wait for corporations to volunteer, because the accidents continue, often with devastating consequences. What we need is comprehensive regulatory reform. But achieving safety reforms is complicated and time-consuming. In the interim, the Environmental Protection Agency should step in and use its power under the Clean Air Act\u2019s general duty clause to compel chemical facilities to take steps to make their operations inherently safer. The law assigns owners and operators of these facilities a general duty to identify hazards, design and maintain safe facilities and minimize the consequences of leaks. The E.P.A. should follow up by adopting specific regulations to meet those goals.Twelve years ago, the E.P.A.\u2019s administrator, Christine Todd Whitman, proposed regulations that would have encouraged producers and users of high-risk chemicals to find safer alternatives or processes. But her proposal stalled in the face of strong opposition from American companies, which are already required to use safer technologies and other risk reduction methods at their European operations. (Insurance data indicate that losses from refinery accidents, for instance, are at least three times lower in Europe than in the United States.) In 2012, Ms. Whitman urged the agency to use the Clean Air Act to require safer technology \u201cbefore a tragedy of historic proportions occurs.\u201d The E.P.A. said recently that it was considering such an approach. The agency\u2019s own National Environmental Justice Advisory Council has urged it to issue new rules to reduce the \u201cdanger and imminent threat\u201d posed by chemical plants, manufacturing and transport. Across the nation, an estimated 13,000 facilities store or process chemicals in amounts hazardous enough to endanger the public, according to the E.P.A.But that estimate understates the dimensions of the problem. For example, the West Virginia facility implicated in the recent spill, which stored chemicals used in the coal industry, would not fall under criteria used by the agency to come up with its estimate.Consider how a requirement forcing safer practices and technologies might have prevented the three accidents I\u2019ve mentioned. The Chevron refinery would have been required to replace aging, corroded pipes with safer corrosion-resistant material that almost certainly would have prevented the rupture that endangered 19 workers caught in the initial vapor cloud, not to mention the smoke plume that sent 15,000 Bay Area residents to hospitals. The refinery industry accident rate overall is unacceptably high.The agricultural chemical company in West, Tex., would have used safer storage practices and safer fertilizer blends, and kept far less ammonium nitrate on site. The lives of more than a dozen firefighters and residents might have been spared, and the widespread damage to homes, schools, a nursing home and other structures would not have occurred. And the decades-old chemical storage tank in West Virginia that leaked as much as 10,000 gallons of chemicals used in coal processing into the nearby Elk River, contaminating the water supply of some 300,000 Charleston-area residents, would have been moved and replaced by modern, anti-leak storage tanks and safer containment.After the West, Tex., explosion, President Obama issued an executive order requiring federal agencies to review safety rules at chemical facilities. I am strongly encouraged by the White House leadership on this issue. The E.P.A. is working with other agencies to comply. But in the meantime, the agency has the authority to act now, on its own, to require inherently safer design, equipment and processes that would go a long way toward preventing more catastrophes.

{"Headline": "For China, a Shift From Exports to Consumption", "Date": "2014-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 BoConcept, a Danish furniture company that has more than 260 stores around the world, opened an outlet in Hong Kong last week amid flashing cameras, the deafening noise of drums and cymbals and a pair of lion dancers performing a traditional ceremony aimed at bringing good fortune to the shop.The store is the first in Hong Kong for BoConcept, but the company already operates 18 in mainland China and is planning another six to eight across the country as it bets that rising affluence will continue to lift demand for its sleek sofas and coffee tables.\u201cWe see a lot of opportunities in China,\u201d said Kim Moelholm, regional director for Asia-Pacific at BoConcept. China is in the midst of a major overhaul aimed at weaning its economy off its decades-long reliance on often inefficient state-driven investment and a manufacturing sector that has been highly geared to exporting to the rest of the world.Raising domestic consumption of things like cars, washing machines and furniture is a key element of this rebalancing effort. So whether Mr. Moelholm is right in his assessment is of great importance for the Chinese economy, as well as for the many other retailers, manufacturers and service providers \u2014 including Ford Motor, the clothing company Burberry and the hotel chain Marriott \u2014 that have been expanding in China.\u201cConsumption is a key element of China\u2019s rebalancing act,\u201d said Stephen Green, head of Standard Chartered\u2019s Greater China research in Hong Kong.Data released Monday underlined just how rapidly the overall economy has been cooling as Beijing has sought, over the past two years, to rein in often poorly allocated lending and close down inefficient or polluting industries.After years of supercharged growth and annual expansion rates of 10 percent or more, the economy expanded at 7.7 percent last year, the national statistics bureau said Monday. That was above the government\u2019s target of 7.5 percent and the same as in 2012, but many analysts expect the pace to cool further this year as Beijing\u2019s \u201ctough love\u201d approach to overhauling the economy continues to crimp lending and industrial activity. Similarly, factory output and investment in fixed assets, which have been losing steam over much of the past year, continued to do so in December, the data showed. But retail sales, which give a sense of how spending among China\u2019s 1.3 billion inhabitants is holding up, have remained relatively firm, and notched a gain of 13.6 percent in December. The data, said Yao Wei, China economist in the Hong Kong office of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, was a bright spot in the statistics released Monday.\u201cConsumption is not exactly booming, but it is likely to remain okay this year,\u201d Mr. Green said. Moreover, he said, official figures tend to underestimate the role that consumption plays in the overall economy, as unrecorded \u201cgray income\u201d supplements the actual wealth of many households. Wages have risen as millions of Chinese have moved from the countryside into the cities. And because China is rapidly aging, this means it is gradually getting harder for employers to find and retain workers.Official figures released by the statistics office on Monday put the increase in the disposable income of urban residents at 9.7 percent last year, or 7 percent when factoring in inflation. Rural residents\u2019 net income rose 9.3 percent when adjusted for inflation. That has made life harder for many exporters, who are finding it difficult to deliver goods inexpensively.But it has also increased the spending power of people like Li Yang, 32, a financial officer of a ship-repairing company.Mr. Li bought his first car, a BYD Qin worth 210,000 renminbi, or $34,700, last month.\u201cI feel confident about China\u2019s economic outlook and optimistic about my career,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the media\u2019s exaggeration of short-term fluctuations. China is far from what they like to suggest being on the verge of collapse. There is still much room for growth.\u201dMr. Moelholm, the BoConcept executive, likewise has witnessed big changes in the way many Chinese spend.\u201cWhen we first started in Shanghai, 15 years ago, modern, imported furniture was still very uncommon,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we are still niche and premium, but it is not uncommon now for people to come into one of our stores and place orders for 100,000, 200,000 or 300,000 renminbi.\u201dThe key question now is whether China\u2019s consumption resilience will continue.For China to generate more domestic consumption, said Richard Ho, who recently founded Athenee, a boutique advisory firm in Shanghai, it needs to foster a more vibrant private sector.\u201cIf you can unleash the power of private enterprise and create a level playing field for private and state-owned businesses,\u201d he said, employment and wage growth can continue \u2014 supporting domestic consumption.\u201cIt\u2019s a circle \u2014 they need to get the private sector right in order to get consumption going,\u201d Mr. Ho said. \u201cBut it won\u2019t happen overnight. For the next three to five years at least, the authorities will have no choice but to pump more \u2018cold medicine\u2019 into the economy, in the form of investments into fixed assets like infrastructure and plants.\u201dThe authorities have begun to clamp down on official bank lending and \u201cshadow\u201d banking activities outside the regulated sector over the past year in a bid to reduce the risk of potential defaults further down the line. But a surge in these activities and in debt accrued by local governments since the global financial crisis means it will be hard to avoid at least some defaults, many analysts say.\u201cOur concern is that problems in the shadow banking sector could spill over into the formal banking system,\u201d said Tom Byrne, a senior vice president and manager for Moody\u2019s Sovereign Risk Group.Chinese state-owned banks are well capitalized, he said, and as long as the economy manages growth of about 7 percent without generating still more rapid credit growth, he said, the banking system is likely to be able to absorb any losses. If economic growth slows to 6 percent, he said, \u201cmaybe. At 5 percent, probably not.\u201dAt the same time, however, the restrictions on lending also risk hurting economic activity, so Beijing will have to be careful not to roll back state investment and lending too rapidly, analysts caution.All of this makes it all the more crucial that China\u2019s structural overhauls \u2014 which were outlined in fairly broad terms at a party meeting in November \u2014 bear fruit quickly. \u201cThis is a make-or-break year for China,\u201d said Mr. Green, the Standard Chartered economist.Mr. Green said he was a \u201ccautious bull\u201d on China. \u201cBut if we\u2019re here next year and can\u2019t point to a few substantive reforms, then we can start to worry a bit more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to see the rubber hitting the tarmac this year.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Leader Pledges Aid on Africa Tour", "Date": "2014-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s prime minister finished a three-nation tour of Africa on Monday in which he offered aid and development projects potentially worth billions of dollars to help his nation catch up with China\u2019s enormous footprint on the continent.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has said he wants to expand Japan\u2019s presence in Africa, and tap a region that can serve as both a source of minerals and energy for Japan\u2019s industrial economy and a new market for Japanese goods.Mr. Abe has made Africa one of the centerpieces of a diplomatic push to complement his domestic growth policies, known as Abenomics, which aim to end Japan\u2019s long economic decline.By placing more emphasis on Africa, Mr. Abe is throwing Japan into a scramble for resources there that also involves companies from China, the United States and other Western countries. Japan is particularly keen to find new sources of so-called rare earth metals, raw material used in electronics and cellphones that it currently imports mostly from China. But Japan also finds itself lagging far behind its rival China, which has been investing heavily in Africa for a decade. As if to underscore that rivalry, at the same time that Mr. Abe was in Africa, China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, was on a four-nation visit to the region.Japanese officials have said that while they cannot match the $75 billion in development aid that China has poured into Africa since 2000, they hope to close the gap in other ways. One is to use Japanese aid to train African engineers and technicians, in order to differentiate Japanese efforts from Chinese projects that have been criticized for employing mainly Chinese workers while offering few jobs to Africans.The tour, which imade stops in Mozambique, Ivory Coast and Ethiopia, also brought an unusual amount of showmanship to Japan\u2019s often drab style of diplomacy. On Friday, Mr. Abe traded jokes and even exchanged soccer jerseys with the president of Ivory Coast, Alassane Ouattara. The next day, Mr. Abe attended a tournament of the Japanese sport of judo in Abidjan. Advertisement"}
