{"Headline": "Ukraine Chief Loses Support in Stronghold", "Date": "2014-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe men, Hennadiy Korban and his partner Borys Filatov, decided to remove advertising videos featuring glamorous models from a large outdoor screen at an upscale shopping mall called Passage and replace them with a live broadcast of raucous antigovernment protests at Independence Square in Kiev.They also ordered their local properties to hoist the flags of the European Union and Ukraine, a gesture of open revolt in a Russian-speaking region where economic and political power have traditionally been united in looking more to Moscow than to Europe for guidance.Retribution, or at least some extraordinarily bad luck, swiftly followed. Hours after the flags went up on Jan. 25, all three of their company\u2019s shopping malls in Dnepropetrovsk lost their electricity, and panicked shoppers scrambled through the dark for the exits.The video screen outside went dark, silencing the antigovernment chants from Kiev and, at least on the surface, restoring Dnepropetrovsk as a bastion of calm support for Ukraine\u2019s embattled president, Viktor F. Yanukovych.The defection of two provincial businessmen \u2014 motivated as much by resentment of the strong-arm tactics of rivals in league with the government as by lofty ideals \u2014 will not tip the balance of power in Kiev or even here in this city of more than a million people, its economy dominated by huge Soviet-era factories like Yuzhmash, a rocket maker still owned by the state.But it underscores how a protest movement that the government dismisses as the work of nationalist extremists from the country\u2019s west has reached into Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s political power base in the east and is even eroding the loyalties of those who have thrived under him.And it shows how, for all their differences, the disaffected moguls and the protesters are driven by a deep frustration with what they see as the country\u2019s lawless law-enforcement system and ubiquitous corruption. Both camps call for not just democracy but for a more \u201cnormal,\u201d European-style government with transparent institutions, secure property rights and an impartial justice system.Fearing arrest, Mr. Korban and Mr. Filatov fled Ukraine for Israel last week. A Dnepropetrovsk judge ordered on Jan. 29 that Mr. Korban be detained and interrogated as a witness in connection with a previously dormant investigation of a 2012 murder.According to the pair\u2019s lawyers, state security officers then raided the premises of their accountant, saying they were looking for bombs or other evidence of terrorism. They found none, said one of the lawyers, Oleksandr Sanzhara.The businessmen do not regret their decision. \u201cWe decided that we had to do something as citizens, to send a signal that not all businessmen are afraid,\u201d said Mr. Korban, an aggressive local tycoon whose interests include a string of hotels, three big shopping centers and stakes in many of Ukraine\u2019s biggest companies.\u201cWe want to live in Europe, not in an outpost of the Russian empire,\u201d added Mr. Korban, 43, speaking by phone from Israel.Ukraine\u2019s biggest business moguls, known as oligarchs, have so far mostly hedged their bets, with the exception of Petro Poroshenko, a shipping, confectionery and agriculture magnate whose television station, Channel 5, has been broadcasting around the clock from Independence Square.Others have made cautious, coded statements hinting at discontent with the government and with a new generation of nouveaux riches rivals, including the president\u2019s son, Oleksandr, who have come from nowhere to amass great fortunes.Choosing, however, carries heavy risks. \u201cA majority share our views but do not say anything publicly because they are afraid of what will happen to their business,\u201d Mr. Filatov said. \u201cThey can see what happened to us.\u201dBut their defection has already lifted the spirits of President Yanukovych\u2019s opponents. \u201cThis is an absolutely positive sign for us,\u201d said Pavlo Khazan, a local environmentalist and antigovernment activist who has helped organize rallies in support of pro-Europe protesters in Kiev. \u201cIt shows that this corrupt system is starting to crack.\u201dThe cracks, however, are caused as much by economic self-interest and clan allegiances as by any idealistic embrace of European values. By openly siding with the president\u2019s opponents, Mr. Korban and Mr. Filatov have exposed the anger of established businessmen against a system that many feel no longer serves their primary interest: protecting their assets.Though publicly declared only recently and cast as a political act, the rupture between the two businessmen and the government began in earnest in May last year with a bitter struggle over a railway switch factory controlled by a friend and occasional business partner of Mr. Korban and Mr. Filatov.The authorities, they say, unleashed a flood of inspectors and urged their friend to sell the factory, estimated to be worth nearly $100 million, to an upstart business rival for just $35 million.After a bruising fight, Mr. Korban\u2019s partner managed to hold on to the plant. \u201cThe conflict is over, but the bad feelings remain,\u201d Mr. Korban said.He dismissed his own reputation as a sharp-elbowed corporate raider as a byproduct of post-Soviet prejudice against capitalism and a misunderstanding of how it works. \u201cIn America, they call this mergers and acquisitions, not raiding,\u201d he said.When the electricity finally returned to their shopping centers, Mr. Korban and his partner lobbed another grenade at the government. The screen outside the Passage mall lit up with a video of \u201cSwan Lake,\u201d the Tchaikovsky ballet that is indelibly associated with the death rattle of the old Soviet system. The ballet appeared on Soviet television in August 1991 when a clique of hard-line Communists briefly seized power and suspended regular programming. The Soviet Union collapsed four months later.Rattled government loyalists have made venomous attacks on the two businessmen. Dmitry Shpenov, a pro-government lawmaker from Dnepropetrovsk, issued a statement ridiculing them for \u201ctrying to present themselves as human rights defenders\u201d when their business careers had been \u201caccompanied by murders and deaths.\u201d Their real goal, he added, is to \u201cseize the regional government in a raid.\u201dMr. Korban and Mr. Filatov say Ukraine\u2019s business community has been far more supportive. They said they had received calls offering sympathy and support from tycoons still in Ukraine, including the country\u2019s best-known oligarchs.Far less wealthy entrepreneurs in Dnepropetrovsk say they are suspicious of Mr. Korban\u2019s metamorphosis into a dissident but share his rage at a government they see as addled by corruption and incompetence. \u201cIt used to be bandits who extorted money, but now it is the government,\u201d said Andrii Vakulenko, the owner of a small furniture business. \u201cIf you do anything in business, you have to pay.\u201dThe local authorities, firmly in the hands of people loyal to Mr. Yanukovych, insist they had nothing to do with the mysterious electricity cutoff at the shopping malls and blame an accident that somehow hit only properties owned by the rebellious local oligarchs. The electricity company blamed faulty \u201cvacuum circuit breakers\u201d for the failure.So far, according to the opposition activists in Dnepropetrovsk, the regional government\u2019s main response to widening discontent has been to sharply increase the risks of disloyalty. The police arrested 24 people who attended a modest opposition rally in the city on Jan. 26 and charged them with \u201cparticipation in a mass disturbance,\u201d a crime carrying a penalty of up to eight years.The rally, near the regional administration building, turned violent when unidentified men in track suits started beating pro-Europe demonstrators. The administration building is now a fortress, its main entrance protected by riot police officers behind a barricade of icy snow, its lobby strung with razor wire and packed with security officials. The police block all but official cars from taking a nearby road.\u201cThey feel under siege and are trying to build a castle to keep out the enemy,\u201d said Yuri Raikhel, a local political commentator. \u201cThey all understand that everything they have could collapse like a house of cards.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Nonprofit Lender Revives the Hopes of Subprime Borrowers", "Date": "2014-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Home FrontWASHINGTON \u2014 About 200 people struggling to become homeowners filled the pews of Plymouth Congregational church on a recent Saturday morning. Some were self-employed, others short on a down payment, many branded by credit problems. Mortgage lenders would have thrown money at them a decade ago. Now, the chastened industry turns them away.Bruce Marks, the unconventional lender who organized the gathering, is determined to demonstrate that the rest of the industry is wrong.Mr. Marks\u2019s nonprofit organization, the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, has $10 billion in funding from Bank of America to make loans on its own terms over the next decade. It does not require down payments. It does not consult credit scores. Its loans all carry interest rates below 4 percent.It has enough money to mint about 50,000 homeowners, but Mr. Marks has a larger goal. He wants to show that it is possible to lend to lower-income borrowers on terms that are profitable and sustainable. He wants to expand homeownership. He wants to redeem the original idea behind subprime lending.\u201cI think that everybody should have an opportunity to own a home,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to rekindle hope in people, especially minorities who threw everything into the dream of homeownership and lost it.\u201dThe great recession unsettled Washington\u2019s longstanding commitment to homeownership. Mortgage companies are reluctant to lend to anybody but the safest of borrowers, and the government \u2014 led by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency created largely to protect mortgage borrowers \u2014 has raced to formalize that new caution. Public policy has shifted from expanding homeownership to preventing bubbles.Even some advocates for lower-income families have reassessed the importance of helping people buy homes.\u201cI\u2019ve seen too many neighborhoods devastated, too many families devastated by giving them credit that they could not afford,\u201d said Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates, an umbrella group for legal aid providers. \u201cWe need to build communities and wealth so that people can then go ahead and build sustainable homeownership.\u201dMr. Marks, an energetic 58-year-old with a salt-and-pepper beard, has little patience for such fears. He says low interest rates and housing prices have created a second chance \u2014 an opportunity to help lower-income families buy homes, but this time on terms they can afford.He is part of a growing chorus in the housing industry warning that the government\u2019s push toward safety is reviving an earlier era when homeownership was beyond the reach of too many families, particularly minorities.\u201cI find that in this overall discussion, the borrower sort of gets left on the sidelines,\u201d Teresa Bryce Bazemore, president of the mortgage insurance company Radian Guaranty, said at a December event here organized by the Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cYou can protect the market and the government to the point where no one can buy anything.\u201dMr. Marks has a reputation as a flamethrower. He mounted a series of confrontational campaigns in the 1990s demanding money from banks to make loans in underserved communities. He once publicized the extramarital relationship of a recalcitrant bank executive by distributing leaflets to his neighbors. In 1999, then-Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican of Texas, denounced Mr. Marks as an \u201cextortionist\u201d on the Senate floor.During the housing crash that began in 2006, Mr. Marks used similar tactics to press banks for the authority to modify loans, transforming his nonprofit intoone of the largest sources of help for homeowners facing foreclosure.But this time, he says, he is focused on making his point by making loans. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see how many people we can make homeowners,\u201d he said, \u201cand can we make this a new way of doing business.\u201dThe innovation that sets Mr. Marks apart from other mortgage lenders was the result of a late-night conversation on a Boston porch in the early 1990s. Mr. Marks, then working for the local hotel workers union, was drinking beer and trading ideas with an idealistic banker named Kevin Winn.The union had won a few million dollars in funding from local banks to help its members buy homes. Most of the workers \u2014 like the people who gathered at the Washington church \u2014 did not meet the standards of conventional lenders. They could not afford down payments. They did not have histories of repaying previous loans.Subprime lenders charged such borrowers high interest rates, at least in part to compensate for the higher risk of default. But Mr. Marks wanted to charge the same rates the banks gave wealthy customers.That meant he needed a different way to reduce the risk of default. He planned to rely on careful screening of applicants and on building a sense of community among the borrowers, in part by requiring them to join the nonprofit for a $20 annual fee and to participate in its advocacy. These are time-tested strategies for reducing defaults.Mr. Winn suggested they also needed a new kind of safety net. Borrowers are usually required to pay for an insurance policy that compensates the lender if they default. Mr. Marks\u2019s organization instead requires borrowers to contribute to a fund that prevents defaults by making loans to people facing medical emergencies or a job loss.\u201cWe knew we were stretching the traditional definition of affordability,\u201d Mr. Winn said. \u201cWe knew that sometimes things would go wrong. The question is, \u2018What happens next?\u2019 \u201dSince then, the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation has made more than 35,000 home purchase loans. It originated 4,005 of those loans from 2004 to 2006, at the peak of the housing boom. About 6.4 percent of those borrowers have received assistance from the insurance fund, but only 2.6 percent lost their homes to foreclosure, less than a third the national rate, according to a study the nonprofit commissioned from the Promontory Financial Group.After a lull, the pace of lending is beginning to revive. Donita Mays, 28, found a house in the southeast Washington neighborhood where she was raised. Ms. Mays, a federal contractor, made enough money to qualify for a $300,000 loan, but her credit score was in the low 600s and she lacked the savings for a down payment.A friend at church mentioned Mr. Marks\u2019s program. She began attending the required homeownership education classes. She demonstrated that she could afford a loan by setting aside every month the amount that would become her monthly payment. In November, she received a loan with an interest rate of 2.875 percent.\u201cI\u2019m a single mother, grew up poor. I said, I\u2019m never going to be able to afford a home,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just awesome.\u201dFederal standards that began to take effect in January, intended to protect people from borrowing more than they can afford, limit the amount of money that borrowers can put up to buy down the interest rate, as Ms. Mays did. Lenders are not required to comply with the standards \u2014 instead, loans that do are shielded from subsequent litigation \u2014 but in the current climate of abundant caution, nearly all loans fall within the standards. And some mortgage industry executives say lenders will be reluctant to make other kinds of loans even as the economy begins to improve.Before the housing collapse, in 2005, almost 13 percent of conventional loans went to borrowers with credit scores below 620. Last year, that figure was 0.22 percent, according to CoreLogic, a real estate data and analytics company. Subprime lending has almost disappeared.Administration officials say it is too early to judge the results, and they are willing to make adjustments. Already regulators are backing away from a requirement for a minimum down payment of 20 percent.Officials have pushed back, however, against the idea that the new standards are overly restrictive.\u201cAs we all know, before the crisis, credit was too easy to get,\u201d Shaun Donovan, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said in early February. \u201cBut now, it\u2019s too hard to obtain for qualified Americans. We are confident that our actions have found the right balance between responsibility and opportunitymoving forward.\u201dSome advocates say the administration, and the new consumer agency, deserve the benefit of the doubt.Michael Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending, shares some of the concerns about access to credit expressed by Mr. Marks. About 15 percent of the mortgage loans made by Self-Help Credit Union, a lender affiliated with the center, would not meet the new standards.But Mr. Calhoun said the consumer agency was on the right track. \u201cThey have done everything that they can to facilitate an expansion of credit,\u201d he said.And even some who share the concerns expressed by Mr. Marks see his approach as unnecessarily confrontational.\u201cHe means well, and what he does helping people is why I support him,\u201d said Representative Corrine Brown, a Florida Democrat who has been a regular guest at the nonprofit\u2019s housing fairs. \u201cBut over time you need to learn to work with people and mellow.\u201dMr. Marks does not intend to let the issue rest quietly, however. He has all the lending money he can use. He makes $165,000 a year, owns a comfortable house with his wife, a lawyer who also works for the nonprofit. They have a teenage daughter. Yet he still is fueled by a burning anger that some people are not getting what he views as a fair chance at homeownership.\u201cPeople say to me all the time, \u2018Will you be less confrontational, less aggressive, less pushing the limits?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThe time where we stop pushing is when they should find someone else to run the organization.\u201dThe Home Front: This series is examining the new\nlandscape of the rebounding\nAmerican housing market.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fake Putin Diary!", "Date": "2014-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDear Diary,I am surrounded by idiots. I create the greatest Olympics in human history. The Russian team I selected wins the medal count. I do all this while propping up Assad in Syria and sexting half the athletes in the Olympic Village. Meanwhile, that tool Yanukovych can\u2019t even manage to keep himself in power in Kiev.Why is it that every autocrat but me is always a day late and a dollar short? They try to be a little nice and a little nasty and they end up outraging everybody while intimidating nobody. Yanukovych was ridiculous with his zoo and his rare goats. His son the dentist won 50 percent of all the government contracts issued last January. People like that give kleptocracy a bad name. That yutz has created two giant vulnerabilities for me, a regional one and a domestic one. My entire worldview is based on the idea that societies exist in one of two states: centralized control or terrorism and chaos. My life project has been to impose top-down order so Russia can return to its former grandeur. Regionally, that\u2019s meant reconstituting the Russian empire with a Eurasian Union. Domestically, it\u2019s meant restoring the legitimacy of autocratic rule. The bandits in Ukraine have suddenly called both into question. With no Ukraine in my orbit, I\u2019ve got no empire. I\u2019ve got no Eurasian project. Meanwhile, it wasn\u2019t nice to see an autocrat get toppled just next door. It sets a bad example for the children (my subjects). Suddenly, I find myself in a moment of extreme vulnerability. Fortunately, I\u2019ve got one of the greatest leaders in human history on my side: myself.Machiavelli was right. Fortune is a woman; only the audacious win her love. That\u2019s why my technique has always been to create facts on the ground. Act first, while everyone else dithers. Force them to react to my reality. That\u2019s why I alone am Mr. Big on the world stage. Heroes drive history, and I will not be ignored!The na\u00efve Westerners (forgive the redundancy) think Ukraine is about democratic ideals, or whether the country will turn West or East. Please. There is no room for ideals in my worldview. People are motivated by money and fear.First, I\u2019m going to evict the Westerners from Ukraine. I liked it better when the West conquered countries with the 82nd Airborne; now they just use the I.M.F. Fortunately, as one expert put it, they always bring a baguette to a knife fight. The West will not actually spend the money necessary to keep Ukraine out of bankruptcy. They won\u2019t want to hand it over to corrupt officials who will immediately ship it to London.I\u2019ll just outbid them. Ukraine is out of money, and countries with no money have no choices. They are going to have to put themselves up for sale, and I\u2019ve shown I\u2019m willing to pay a higher price.Moreover, the country has the same politico-economic system as Mother Russia. Something like 80 percent of the economy is controlled by the oligarchs. If the current oligarchs don\u2019t do what I want, I just replace them with some nice Russian ones. Some politicians are good at organizing coalitions. I\u2019m good at organizing corruption. Then I\u2019ll insinuate myself and manipulate electoral reform law. I can squeeze them with oil and gas supplies. I\u2019m already enlisting Russian troops to preserve the Crimea. If the country threatens to split up, there\u2019s always the Georgia solution. Send in the troops. The West won\u2019t like it, but what will they do? If they try to hurt me, I\u2019ll stop cooperating on Syria, Iran and the places that really matter to them. Dealing with my domestic vulnerability just takes a little productive paranoia. I\u2019ve already shut down civil society step by step. I\u2019ve even banned independent pollsters and persecuted officials who fought corruption. (Yes, that\u2019s right. I\u2019ve made honesty a crime.) Recent events call for another round of crackdowns. Will my crackdown spark a violent reaction I can\u2019t now anticipate? In less deft hands that might happen, but, remember, I am me.It\u2019s easy to govern when you\u2019ve got the winds of history at your back. I\u2019ve got the wolves of chaos growling in my face. Capital flight is accelerating. The ruble is devaluing. Social media, the youth culture, the tides of mass protest, democracy and capitalism undermine the authoritarian mind-set. Yet I impose my will with the beauty of gold and the wisdom of sapphire. I don\u2019t \u201cevolve,\u201d as everybody suggests. Evolution leads to chaos. I learned that from Gorby! The events of the 1990s gave the world one narrative, the Velvet Revolution narrative. But I\u2019m going to teach another narrative: that what begins with people massing in a city square ends with a strongman triumphing in a palace. In my own way, I will define this age.

{"Headline": "Chinese Arts Company Goes Public in Bid to Grow", "Date": "2014-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The China Poly Group Corporation, a state-run conglomerate that got its start selling weapons to the People\u2019s Liberation Army, has over the past few decades successfully branched into developing real estate, selling sports cars and producing television sitcoms. Now the company\u2019s huge arts and culture division \u2014 Poly Culture Group Corporation \u2014 is planning an initial public stock offering that could raise up to $330 million and bolster the prospects of the company in the world\u2019s biggest and fastest-growing art and auction market.By filing this week to sell shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Poly Culture hopes to become an international brand. It already manages dozens of Chinese cinemas, theaters and performance halls, and it competes with the world\u2019s largest auction houses, Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s, in art sales. \u201cWe are very big in the art auction market in mainland China but still have a long way to go to become the biggest auction house worldwide,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive, Jiang Yingchun, said at a news conference last week, according to Chinese news media.Beijing Poly International Auction, a division of Poly Culture, is already the world\u2019s third largest auction house, with about $1 billion in reported sales in 2012. Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s were, until recently, restricted from doing business in mainland China and operated mostly from Hong Kong. Now, Christie\u2019s operates independently in China, and Sotheby\u2019s has a joint-venture partner here. Still, both can deal only in watches, wine, jewelry and contemporary art, not the more lucrative markets of cultural relics, calligraphy and ancient works. The initial public offering for a division of Poly is a sign of China\u2019s transformation into a market economy, and the government\u2019s eagerness to develop its cultural organizations to protect and promote Chinese culture at home and abroad. Several other divisions of Poly are already publicly listed, including Poly Real Estate Group. According to the new filing, the Beijing-based Poly Group, which has longstanding ties to the military and the family of the former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, will retain 67 percent of Poly Culture\u2019s shares.In the prospectus filed last week, investors were cautioned about the potential risks of investing in Poly Culture, which was formed around 2000.It, for example, has suffered, as other Chinese auction houses have, from a problem that has plagued the nation\u2019s art market: buyers who bid up prices but then fail to pay for the items after the auction. According to the prospectus, settlement rates on its auctions have declined in recent years. \u201cAlthough we actively review the outstanding fees and liaise with relevant parties to speed up the collection process,\u201d the company wrote, \u201cthere is no assurance we could settle all the amounts from relevant buyers in due course, or at all.\u201dAlso, last year the United States imposed sanctions on Poly Technologies, a defense equipment division that American authorities accused of violating the nonproliferation policy that controls weapons traffic with Iran, Syria and North Korea. (The Chinese government has opposed the sanctions and insisted they be lifted.)Graham Bowley contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Honda Appoints First Woman to Board", "Date": "2014-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Honda Motor has appointed a woman to its board for the first time and given a major promotion to a foreigner, in a sign that the automaker wants to change perceptions of a hidebound corporate culture.Hideko Kunii, 66, a technology expert, will join the board, and Issao Mizoguchi, a Brazilian of Japanese ancestry, who has worked with Honda\u2019s South American operations for nearly 30 years, has been appointed an operating officer, Honda said Monday. The appointments need shareholder approval at a meeting set for June.Companies have come under fire within Japan for not promoting anyone other than Japanese men. Putting women in leadership positions is a pillar of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s policies to revive the moribund Japanese economy.Toyota has a foreigner on its board, Mark Hogan, an American who formerly worked at General Motors, but has yet to appoint a woman, and said it was not necessarily looking to do so. Nissan Motor has been the most progressive in promoting diversity but has yet to appoint a woman to its board. Asako Hoshino, a woman who is a management expert, is among the top Nissan executives, serving as corporate vice president. Nissan has three non-Japanese on its 12-member board, including the chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, who is also chief of the French automaker Renault.Honda has cultivated an international image from its early years, as Soichiro Honda, its founder, had global acceptance as part of his vision for the company. It was the first Japanese automaker to open a vehicle assembly plant in the United States. But the addition of Mr. Mizoguchi, 54, as one of the top executives at headquarters, as well as the appointment of Ms. Kunii, a professor at the Shibaura Institute of Technology, is a major move for the company.Ms. Kunii studied at San Jose University and the University of Texas at Austin, and previously worked for the Japanese electronics maker Ricoh. She is now in charge of promoting gender equality at the university in Tokyo. Mr. Mizoguchi now serves as senior vice president and director of Honda South America.Despite Mr. Abe\u2019s prodding to promote women to corporate boards, Honda is the first major Japanese company to follow suit. Honda officials stressed that Ms. Kunii was picked because she was the right person for the job, not because of her gender.Japanese society is expected to lose its potential for growth and innovation if it cannot do more to encourage women to enter the work force, as its population is aging and dwindling.Japanese women say the difficulties of finding proper child care as well as cultural expectations about women doing housework make it tremendously difficult to pursue a career. Also, the nation\u2019s tax system encourages women to stay in poorer-paying part-time jobs, and there is a lack of role models in corporate Japan.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Turkey Struggles to Protect Its Lira", "Date": "2014-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 It was late afternoon in Istanbul. But seven time zones away, on Wall Street, the opening bell was ringing.Seconds later, in a dingy alley of Istanbul\u2019s vast Grand Bazaar, several dozen men with cellphones pressed to their ears began gesturing and shouting loudly.They were currency traders, who every day buy and sell tens of millions of dollars, euros and Turkish liras in a narrow space that is sheltered by a sagging blue-striped canopy and furnished with an old refrigerator and a few plastic stools.The traders had been noisily plying their craft since early morning. But when they learned from the television screens inside the nearby gold shops that the Dow Jones industrial average had opened higher in New York, the trading turned even more tumultuous. The dealers locked in or unwound their bets on which direction the dollar would head in relation to the Turkish lira.The frenzy was a demonstration of how the value of Turkey\u2019s money \u2014 which has broad implications for the national economy \u2014 is determined largely by events beyond the country\u2019s control. And lately the lira has been alarmingly weak.The currency has lost as much as a third of its value against the dollar, since the Federal Reserve in Washington began making noises last May about cutting back on its stimulus program, prompting investors to move their money from risky emerging markets to the United States in anticipation of higher interest rates there. More recently, the steady exit of foreign money has been more of a stampede, with about half the lira\u2019s decline occurring since mid-December, as political turmoil engulfed the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and violence raged in neighboring Syria and Iraq.Investors\u2019 jitters about Turkey might grow after weekend clashes between the riot police and demonstrators protesting a new law that would allow the government to block web pages without a court order.The lira\u2019s plunge has endangered the Turkish economy, which is heavily dependent on dollar- and euro-pegged transactions and loans for the country\u2019s everyday business. The decline has raised fears of a fresh financial crisis on the edge of Europe. On Friday the ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s lowered Turkey\u2019s credit rating to \u201cnegative,\u201d down from \u201cstable.\u201dThe currency trading in the Grand Bazaar represents but a sliver of Turkey\u2019s multibillion-dollar foreign exchange market, in which most trades are conducted anonymously on electronic exchanges. Here in the bazaar, the trading is done mainly on behalf of money-changing shops.No cash changes hands in the impromptu exchange. The sums are transferred among the traders\u2019 clients later.But lately this narrow alleyway has become a microcosm of Turkish macroeconomics. While traders and some financial analysts say that Turkey is not in an economic crisis \u2014 not yet, anyway \u2014 there is a rough sense of uncertainty about the financial future.Osman Atac, a 52-year-old currency trader known as Billiard Osman for his prowess with a pool cue, conceded that this slump in the lira was different \u2014 sharper and deeper \u2014 than others he had seen in the quarter century since he switched from selling used cars to trading money in an alley.\u201cWe earned in \u201994, we earned in 2001,\u201d said Mr. Atac, referring to past global currency upheavals, when the lira plummeted but traders profited by arbitraging the exchange rates. But the steady, inexorable decline this time has provided fewer sharp swings that would give the traders opportunities for arbitrage.\u201cIn this turbulence,\u201d Mr. Atac said, \u201cno one is making any money.\u201dMr. Atac, clutching the battered Nokia cellphone he uses to keep in touch with his customers, said he thought the lira would not get any weaker than the record of 2.39 to the dollar it hit on Jan. 27. That is a sentiment shared widely in Turkey.So far, Mr. Atac has been right. The lira has recovered somewhat since the low point, strengthening Monday to about 2.21 to the dollar, a 23 percent decline since May.But the consequences of a further decline would be serious. Turkish companies have borrowed $130 billion in foreign currencies, according to the International Monetary Fund. Such loans offered lower interest rates, but came with a higher risk that is now materializing. When the lira goes down, it becomes more expensive for a Turkish company to make its payments on a dollar loan. If the lira weakens further, hundreds of companies could go bust.\u201cThe depreciation of the lira has already eaten into revenues and profits,\u201d said Sinan Ulgen, chairman of the Center for Economic and Foreign Policy Studies, known by its Turkish initials EDAM, a research organization in Istanbul. \u201cThe next steps will be to force them toward a process of bankruptcy.\u201dA steep rise in official interest rates, imposed by the Turkish central bank the week before last in an effort to halt the lira\u2019s decline, is likely to choke the easy credit that has fueled a boom in consumer spending.\u201cAt the present time what we are looking at is not a meltdown but a sharp slowdown in growth,\u201d said Adam Slater, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in Oxford, England. But he added, \u201cIt\u2019s a moving target.\u201dTurkey might seem to offer disturbing parallels to countries like Ireland or Spain at the beginning of the euro zone crisis four years ago. As in those countries, Turkish developers funneled foreign capital into construction projects, covering the dry hills surrounding Istanbul with endless tracts of high-rise apartments, office buildings and shopping centers connected by crowded freeways.But many Turks insist there is no property bubble like the one that devastated Ireland and Spain.Baris Dumankaya, vice chairman of a construction company that bears his family name, pointed out that half of Turkey\u2019s 81 million people are younger than 30, which he says should ensure steady demand for housing. Banks require high down payments, which means that prices would have a long way to fall before homeowners owed more than their properties were worth, Mr. Dumankaya said. Inflation, at more than 7 percent and rising, also makes declines in real estate prices less likely.Nor does Turkey have the government debt and deficit problems that crippled the Greek economy and continue to threaten Italy\u2019s.Mr. Dumankaya, whose family has been in the construction business for half a century, agreed that the flood of easy money attracted people into the industry who had little experience and might be overextended. Sales of apartments in newly constructed buildings have slowed slightly, he said, and banks have become choosier about lending.The plunge of the lira has already exposed the Turkish economy\u2019s dependence on short-term foreign investment. Most foreign capital is invested in Turkish stocks and bonds rather than longer-term projects.All it takes is a phone call or a few clicks of a mouse for short-term investors to move their money elsewhere, and that is what foreign investors have been doing, not only in pulling money out of Turkey but from countries like Russia, Argentina and South Africa, whose currencies have also fallen as a result.Mehmet Kutman, chief executive of Global Investment Holdings, a private equity firm in Istanbul that invests in assets like port facilities for cruise and cargo ships, said he thought the lira could still fall 5 to 10 percent further.\u201cThe good thing is that it will stop excess leverage,\u201d Mr. Kutman said, referring to the country\u2019s high level of private debt.Whatever the outcome, Turkey is largely at the mercy of foreign investors and policies made in Washington. No one is more aware of that than the currency traders at the Grand Bazaar.Mr. Atac, the trader, looked like an ordinary shopkeeper in his wool cap, long wool coat and fleece-lined snow boots to protect against the cold paving stones. But though his education stopped at high school, he is well versed in his chosen field. He could recite the calendar of upcoming U.S. economic data releases and talk at length on the likely direction of Fed policy as Janet L. Yellen takes over as chairman from Ben S. Bernanke.\u201cYellen was Bernanke\u2019s strongest supporter and is going to stick with his plan,\u201d Mr. Atac said.Yet, in an ominous sign, some of the traders in the bazaar had already burned up their capital and gone bankrupt as the lira plunged, Mr. Atac said.Whether that proves to be a metaphor for the Turkish economy will be revealed in coming months.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Credit-Card Debt Can Help the Poor", "Date": "2014-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyLast October, Jeffrey Shavers, a hotel maintenance worker in Chicago, took out an extremely unusual $300 loan. Shavers might have liked to use the money to visit his daughter, a college student in New Orleans, or to buy his 10-year-old son a new bike. But he couldn\u2019t, because Shavers never actually saw the money. The cash went into a locked savings account that he couldn\u2019t access. \u201cIt\u2019s like an abstract $300,\u201d he explained.But the money wasn\u2019t just sitting there. It was helping him build credit. Shavers began paying back the loan, which was orchestrated by the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a community-development organization, in $25 monthly installments. And for each $25 that he paid on time, another $25 entered the locked savings account. By the end of a year, the original $300 will be coupled with those payments for about $600 in cash. More important than the money itself, however, is the credit score he will have earned if he pays on time: something close to 689, the national average. With a good payment record, he might be able to get something much more concrete: a Visa card.Encouraging low-income people to borrow money, and then to get a credit card enabling them to borrow more, may seem counterintuitive or even a little risky. For generations, we\u2019ve heard that hard work and thrift are all Americans need to get ahead. The financial crisis also taught us that unscrupulous lenders stand ready to prey on poor people eager to take the ready cash. But this dichotomy \u2014 debt: bad, savings: good \u2014 is out of touch with the way we live now. More than 70 percent of Americans have a credit card, and very few of us buy a house or a car without borrowing some money. Credit is so central to our lives that job applicants can expect to have theirs checked as a proxy for responsibility and trustworthiness.Life without credit is not only expensive; it\u2019s also potentially ruinous. The most desirable apartments are off-limits, because their landlords run credit checks. Without credit, you have to make large deposits to turn on your electricity or gas or to put your phone bill in someone else\u2019s name. If you want to buy a car, and you have good credit, a $10,000 loan might cost you $1,300 in interest. With bad credit, you\u2019ll pay $7,600. If that car breaks down, a $500 expense might mean a crushing payday loan, or even a lost job. Shavers, who currently makes $16.50 an hour, would like to own a home one day. He knows that he\u2019ll never be able to do it unless he builds his credit first.It\u2019s time that Americans learn how to save. Last year, we saved an average of 4.5 percent of household income \u2014 about half the historic rate \u2014 and most of that was concentrated among wealthier households. So it\u2019s understandable that a number of groups are fixated on teaching the poor to save money. But a growing number of them are recognizing that to enter the economic mainstream, people also need good credit. (Even the post office has explored the possibility of modest banking and loan services for customers.) This can be a hard sell. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting against the sentiment that you should cut up all your credit cards,\u201d says Ricki Granetz Lowitz, a director at the Local Initiatives Support Corporation.Yet saving and responsible borrowing, Lowitz realized, amount to the same thing: putting aside small sums to reach a goal. So she took the type of matched savings account that is used to encourage low-income people to save and tweaked it into something called Twin Accounts \u2014 the sort of loan that Shavers received \u2014 which builds both savings and credit. \u201cI thought that people who were poor paid more for everything, and that\u2019s absolutely not true,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s people with poor credit.\u201d Eugene Reese, a 38-year-old candy-factory worker who just paid off his Twin Accounts loan, remembers trying to buy a $6,500 Cadillac. Another customer had $500 and a credit score above 700. Reese had $2,800, but no credit. The other guy got the car. \u201cIt made me realize that saved money \u2014 you might as well just keep it under your pillow,\u201d Reese says, \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore.\u201dFrom a behavioral-economics perspective, borrowing can actually be easier than saving, and not just because it offers instant gratification. While a vow to save $100 a month may quickly go the way of many diets, owing someone else $100 a month is a powerful motivator. Jonathan Morduch, an economist at New York University who studies the spending habits of low-income families, tells the story of Khadeja, a woman from Bangladesh who borrowed money at 36 percent interest to invest in gold jewelry. She knew she would most likely never be able to save enough to get it, but she would be sure to make her payments to the lender. \u201cKhadeja saw the truth of an odd-sounding paradox,\u201d Morduch and his co-authors wrote in \u201cPortfolios of the Poor: How the World\u2019s Poor Live on $2 a Day.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re poor, borrowing can be the quickest way to save.\u201dKhadeja may have paid more to borrow, but she was also buying a service \u2014 being forced to pay. Most of us already make constant use of this service, managing our money by borrowing and saving at the same time. In 2000, two business-school professors found that 90 percent of Americans with credit-card debt also had liquid assets, and about a third of them had enough to pay off the entire debt. But they didn\u2019t. One reason is that if you spend your savings, you\u2019re back to zero quickly. So you may prefer to pay a little more to borrow while keeping something in reserve. \u201cWe use credit cards all the time, so why shouldn\u2019t other people be able to borrow as needed?\u201d Morduch says. \u201cThey have the same needs. The impulse to stay away from helping people get access to credit is based on good intentions, but it\u2019s not based on an understanding of how people live their lives responsibly.\u201dIndeed, the fear that offering credit to the poor will lead to an inevitable disaster may be overblown, according to Morduch\u2019s latest research. The study, which focuses on lower and moderate income groups in the United States, indicates that one group in particular, the Bangladeshis, immediately start building their credit upon arrival in the U.S., probably at the advice of relatives who have been here longer. As a result, they are much more likely to have a credit card, and a higher credit limit, than members of other groups in the study. They are also more likely to stay well within their limit and pay their bills on time.They may even be helping the overall economy. It\u2019s perpetually difficult to tell whether programs that put money in the hands of the poor, like microlending, lift the overall financial well-being of the community. But credit gives people a greater ability not only to weather shocks and take control over their finances. It also helps get their money off the sidelines and into circulation. \u201cIt allows them to spend their own money,\u201d Morduch says. And that, too, is how America gets ahead.Shaila Dewan is an economics reporter at The Times. Adam Davidson is off this week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Highlights From the Chicago Auto Show", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 2015 Subaru Legacy.With the Detroit auto show already growing smaller in the rearview mirror, the next big show of the 2014 season is underway in Chicago. The noticeably confident Detroit automakers may have received most of the attention at the show in their hometown, but this week, on the other side of Lake Michigan, the spotlight was on foreign manufacturers.Here are the highlights from the Chicago Auto Show:The 2015 Versa Note SR is Nissan\u2019s sporty take on the subcompact hatchback and features special styling cues to differentiate it from its more pedestrian brethren. Although the front-drive SR\u2019s Xtronic C.V.T. and 109-horsepower 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine may not be considered very sporty to some drivers, the car does achieve estimated fuel economy of 31 m.p.g. in the city, 40 on the highway and 35 combined.The front-wheel-drive Soul E.V. is the first electric car Kia is bringing to market. The car features an air-cooled 27-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion polymer battery powering a 109-horsepower electric motor that produces 210 pound-feet of torque. Kia says the range of the vehicle is an estimated 80-100 miles. To start, the Soul E.V. will be sold in only a few states, including California, Oregon, New York, New Jersey and Maryland.Although the midsize 2014 Optima Hybrid looks the same as the restyled Optima unveiled at the New York auto show last year, it received a few Hybrid-specific tweaks to go along with its new face, including drag-reduction vents in the front bumper. The powertrain and fuel-economy numbers remain unchanged: The gasoline engine and electric motor produce a combined 199 horsepower and 235 pound-feet of torque, and the LX model gets 36 m.p.g. in the city, 40 on the highway and 38 m.p.g. combined. The EX trim level gets a one-mile-per-gallon decrease.The Niro poses a what-if question with its complicated hybrid powertrain and all-wheel-drive system. Kia said the car was aimed at \u201cactive lifestyle\u201d owners, which explains its somewhat aggressive, go-anywhere looks. At less than 14 feet long, it could certainly go most places on a city\u2019s tight streets. Power comes from a turbocharged 160-horsepower 1.6-liter engine and a rear-wheels-only electric hybrid system that gets its power from regenerative braking and adds to the car\u2019s traction portfolio when the front wheels begin to slip.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India's Particulate Problem", "Date": "2014-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 Two years ago, China seemed oblivious to the extraordinary levels of air pollution in many of its cities and the health consequences. But over the past six months, there has been an explosion of information on pollution concentrations, warnings from the media and new policies from the government. It took a long time, but change is happening.Could India be next? In January, India was startled by the release of the annual country rankings of the Yale Environmental Performance Index, which highlighted its troubling air pollution. The calls for change have started: On Monday, the country\u2019s powerful Supreme Court will hear an amicus plea on the worsening pollution in New Delhi.Despite a national election coming in May, air pollution has been largely absent from the debate between the two major political parties, Bharatiya Janata and the Indian National Congress. But many successful Indian environmental policies have come from the Supreme Court, and we encourage it to proceed in this vein by embracing more transparent and flexible market-based regulations to better protect the health of its citizens and allow robust economic growth to continue.According to the most recent data from India\u2019s Central Pollution Control Board, the 2010 average for respirable particulate matter concentration across 180 monitored Indian cities was six times what the World Health Organization considers safe and twice India\u2019s own national standards. And the concentration in Delhi is about 13 times higher than the W.H.O. guideline.A 2013 study (co-written by one of us, Michael Greenstone) measured the effects of particulate matter on life expectancies in China. It found that an additional 100 micrograms per cubic meter of particulate matter in the atmosphere reduced life expectancy at birth by about three years. Using this metric, we estimated that the 200 million people who live in the 180 Indian cities would lose an average of 3.3 years of life because of particulate matter concentrations that exceed India\u2019s standards.This translates into the loss of about 650 million years of life for just the one-sixth of India\u2019s population that lives in these cities. Satellite data makes clear that pollution also exists outside the monitored zones where the other one billion people who make up the rest of India live. So the total loss of life expectancy is much greater.The recent decades of economic growth reflected, in part, significant reductions of regulatory constraints, and the fear of slowing growth has reduced the political will to increase regulations on emissions. But India can continue that growth and provide its citizens with a healthier environment by adopting a regulatory system that is both effective and efficient.India\u2019s current command-and-control style of regulating is handicapped on both counts. It mandates that industrial plants purchase expensive pollution abatement equipment and specifies common pollution standards across the board. Because emissions reductions are much more costly for some plants than for others, these standards are excessively onerous for some and fail to compel the most cost-effective reductions.Regulators at undersourced pollution control boards must rely on infrequent and often unreliable manual monitoring samplings of emissions by their staffs, which in the best case occur only a couple of times per year, to identify the plants that are violating the standards. As a result, expensive pollution abatement technologies that plants are mandated to install are not used efficiently and sometimes not at all.So the outcome is doubly bad: Regulations impose substantial costs on the economy while pollution emissions often exceed the state-mandated limit.Even worse, any violations of these standards are criminal offenses. This means that to penalize violators, regulators must file and win a criminal case in India\u2019s overburdened justice system, making enforcement difficult. So the only potential, swift alternative for regulators is to close down a business \u2014 but this, too, is often challenging to enforce.Cap-and-trade would impose a cost on polluters for every unit of pollution emitted and create incentives to reduce those emissions. At the same time, it would decrease the economic burden of regulation by allowing the regulated firms to coordinate among themselves to hit a specific emissions reduction target in the most cost-effective manner.In the 1980s, the United States instituted a cap-and-trade market to solve the problem of acid rain; it greatly reduced sulfur-dioxide emissions at a fraction of the projected cost. However, the American experience makes clear that cap-and-trade succeeds only when governments are fully committed to the enforcement of the rules.India has taken initial steps toward implementing cap-and-trade markets for particulate matter pollution. With guidance from the national regulator, some state regulators are already piloting continuous emissions monitoring and training potential participants for cap-and-trade markets. But more support is necessary to get India\u2019s fledgling cap-and-trade markets off the ground.When the Supreme Court takes this up on Monday, it should consider two key policy changes that would allow India to more efficiently regulate pollution.First, stationary sources, like power and industrial plants, should be required to install continuous emissions monitoring equipment in order to provide reliable real-time reporting of emissions by polluters and to make these data publicly available. While increased transparency about pollution greatly enhances regulators\u2019 effectiveness in its own right, it is also a critical ingredient for a cap-and-trade market.The second critical ingredient: Instead of having to take polluters to court for breaking the law, regulators should be authorized to impose financial penalties on firms that breach emissions regulations. The United States\u2019 successful cap-and-trade markets were, in part, made possible by a little-known but very important part of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments that enhanced the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ability to levy large civil fines on environmental violators.It is also essential that the pilot markets are rigorously evaluated in stages to ensure that regulators and the public are informed about costs and benefits.Pollution is not simply an unavoidable side effect of economic growth, but a reflection of societal choices. Seizing these opportunities for reform would lead to longer and healthier lives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s in Store for 2014? Here\u2019s What to Watch", "Date": "2014-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFOR investors, this year is off to a mixed start. Stock market indexes maintained their gains from last year before dropping. Treasury bonds continued their losing streak in the weeks after the Federal Reserve announced that it was reducing its bond-buying program \u2014 until the stock sell-off caused people to buy bonds. Interest in emerging markets has dropped.On a positive note, politicians in Washington did nothing in January to cause jitters in the financial markets. But there are still 11 months to go, and another deadline to raise the debt ceiling.A variety of legislative actions and policy changes have gone into effect, are in effect but are only being felt now, or could come along later this year. What impact they could have on the financial markets and investors\u2019 psyche is hard to predict. Putting aside the unpredictability of the troubled health care overhaul, here\u2019s a look at some of the main policy events that could affect returns. What are the alternatives? The simple one is to invest in stocks, but many investors have a parallel fear \u2014 heightened, no doubt, in the last few weeks \u2014 that stocks are overvalued. Anh Tran, a managing director at Modern Wealth Advisors in Irvine, Calif., said she had told clients to consider high-dividend-paying stocks and variable-rate high-yield bonds as alternatives to Treasuries. These two assets offer income and a hedge against rising inflation that fixed-rate bonds do not. \u201cThey aren\u2019t your Facebooks or tech companies,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are large-cap companies that have remained consistent, like Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola.\u201dFor investors who prefer to hold bonds for income, there are products that can insulate them from rising rates and inflation. Steve Sachs, head of capital markets for ProShares, a provider of exchange-traded funds, said his firm had started two E.T.F.\u2019s to hedge the risks for high-yield and investment-grade bonds. Mr. Sachs said the E.T.F.\u2019s were created to answer the question many investors have about Treasury bonds now: \u201cWhat happens when the risk management tool you\u2019ve been using to mitigate your risk becomes the source of your risk?\u201dThere is a contrarian view of the Fed\u2019s actions.The Fed is tapering \u201cat a time when the government is shrinking its deficit,\u201d said Gary Ran, managing partner at Telemus Capital, a Focus Financial Partners firm. But that situation \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean rates are going to go higher.\u201dStill, he said his firm had advised clients not to go too far one way or another. He said his firm was mindful that the economy could improve more quickly, which would cause the Fed to raise rates sooner than expected.\u201cThey\u2019ve been stated, postponed, somewhat implemented, but the end result is heightened regulation of banks is breaking the traditional business model,\u201d said Greg Peterson, director of investment research at Ballentine Partners, an adviser to high-net-worth clients. \u201cThey can\u2019t make the loans they used to.\u201dThis is not great for businesses that need loans, but it is an opportunity for nontraditional lenders. Mr. Peterson said he had talked to clients about investing in funds that lend directly to smaller companies. They are not without risks.\u201cIn some sense, the systemic risks in the economy have been pushed out of the banks and onto the investors,\u201d he said. \u201cIf one of these firms goes bankrupt, there\u2019s no recourse. The investors have lost their investment.\u201dFor this reason, he said investors needed to be vigilant in assessing managers and making sure their qualifications were not overstated. For many municipal bond analysts, the bigger concern is Puerto Rico, whose bonds are more widely owned because of the tax advantages. The island\u2019s ability to pay on these bonds has been questioned for months, and last week two ratings agencies downgraded its rating to junk. Jim Cahn, chief investment officer at the Wealth Enhancement Group, said that what he called the \u201cDetroit effect\u201d caused investors to be more discerning, but that he hadn\u2019t lost faith. Higher taxes will continue to make municipal bonds attractive, he said, because the interest they pay is not taxed federally. This year the Labor Department is expected to rule on whether a fiduciary standard needs to be in place for the management of 401(k) plans and other investment vehicles that come under its purview. The ruling is expected to make anyone who offers advice on these plans adhere to the fiduciary standard. But Knut A. Rostad, regulatory and compliance officer at Rembert Pendleton Jackson Investment Advisors and president of the Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, said how transformative the ruling would be would depend on how advice and education were defined. A firm calling its advice education might not be bound by the fiduciary standard. \u201cMany brokers work very hard underneath the headlights to provide a fiduciary level of service, even though they\u2019re not required to,\u201d Mr. Rostad said. \u201cBut there are many who don\u2019t do that. From a regulatory point of view there is no way for a broker to be a fiduciary for retirement assets but not everything else.\u201dThis is where any ruling from the Securities and Exchange Commission would have a broader impact. Advisers like Mr. Rostad worry that an S.E.C. requirement for brokers to be fiduciaries could be so vague it would be worse than no requirement at all. \u201cVirtually overnight every single financial investment intermediary would call themselves a fiduciary, but they would be working under the same rules that they are now,\u201d he said.This is where investors need to become more vigilant in the questions they ask about how their advisers or brokers are paid and whether they are given further incentives to sell products by their own firm or any other. \u201cI think investors should understand what rubric they\u2019re falling under,\u201d said Mr. Cahn, whose firm operates as both a registered investment adviser with a fiduciary responsibility and a registered representative of a broker-dealer. \u201cWhat kind of responsibility does the person have? They need to ask that question.\u201dMr. Peterson said the investment opportunities were great, particularly in companies building refineries and pipelines to move oil and natural gas. \u201cOil production increased to such a high rate last year that it flooded the system and we couldn\u2019t move any more,\u201d he said. In addition to higher taxes on earnings, taxes on capital gains went up last year. Couple that with a banner year for stocks and there are two immediate problems. The first is that investors may be hesitant to sell a stock on which they will have to pay a large capital gains tax, even though the company behind that stock is no longer as strong. But at least those investors have a choice. The second problem is that people who owned stocks in mutual funds, which are required by law to distribute capital gains, had no choice but to pay taxes on the gains. Michael Cronkhite, a senior vice president at Stephens Wealth Management, said he could imagine investors looking to replace mutual funds that simply track an index with lower-cost exchange-traded funds that are not required to make the capital gains distributions. \u201cThe caveat is if the mutual fund you\u2019re in has appreciated a lot, you\u2019ll trigger capital gains by selling it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about control for the client.\u201d And when it comes to policy decisions, that is one area where investors do not have as much control as they might like.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Officials Widen Campaign Against Vices", "Date": "2014-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The Chinese government has widened a crackdown on prostitution, gambling and drug use to major provinces across the country, according to reports on Monday in state-run news organizations.The crackdown is being overseen by officials in the Ministry of Public Security, which manages most police forces in China. Officials in the ministry had already sent a supervisory group to carry out the first step in the nationwide sweep, which began on Feb. 10 in the southern city of Dongguan, according to a statement on the ministry\u2019s website. Dongguan, a manufacturing hub teeming with migrant workers, is sometimes known as China\u2019s Sin City, and prostitution there had long been tolerated as a significant part of the local economy.On Monday, a Chinese newspaper, Beijing News, reported that the Ministry of Public Security had ordered provinces across China to follow the example of Guangdong, the southern province next to Hong Kong that includes Dongguan. The report said 16 cities in nine provinces had begun taking part in the \u201csweep yellow\u201d campaign, called that because yellow in Chinese can refer to things of an erotic, lewd or sexually illicit nature.Since the start of the sweep, police units across China had investigated almost 1,500 cases related to prostitution, uncovered 73 criminal gangs, arrested more than 500 people and shut down more than 2,400 sites where sex was for sale, Beijing News reported Tuesday.The new crackdown appears intended to send a message similar to the so-called anticorruption campaign promoted by President Xi Jinping, the Communist Party leader. Mr. Xi has made it a goal to force recalcitrant elements of the party to fall in line with the central leadership.\u201cI think it is another step by Xi to tighten control on ideology and society,\u201d said Ai Xiaoming, a literature professor at Zhongshan University in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, and a gender studies scholar. \u201cXi wants a China that is completely under control and has no such thing as a sex industry. There is no such thing as a sex worker in Xi\u2019s China dream.\u201dLi Sipan, a women\u2019s rights advocate in Guangzhou, said: \u201cXi has his own vision for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, which has a very strong moral aspect.

It is another step towards Xi-style China.\u201d\u201cAs a women\u2019s rights advocate, I\u2019m worried that there might be a lot of abuse of power by the police towards sex workers,\u201d Ms. Li added.News reports in recent days have listed participating provinces, including Gansu, Guangxi, Heilongjiang, Hunan, Jiangsu, Shandong and Sichuan.One report, for example, said 6,500 police officers had been involved in a crackdown on prostitution, gambling and drug use in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan. The crackdown began on Feb. 10, and 335 people have been arrested on charges related to the three vices, the report said.In Harbin, the frigid capital of Heilongjiang Province in northeast China, more than 4,800 police officers checked more than 2,700 locations and detained at least 27 people, according to one news report.Prostitution is common across China, where many hotels offer sex for pay, and hair salons and massage parlors often serve as fronts for brothels.People\u2019s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party, has been publishing editorials and commentaries supporting the crackdown.

{"Headline": "Taiwan and China Edge Ever Closer", "Date": "2014-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorNOTTINGHAM, England \u2014 Government officials from China and Taiwan met last week for the first time in an official capacity in more than six decades. The talks were uneventful \u2014 producing modest agreements to establish communication channels and other practical arrangements \u2014 but they were symbolic of the strengthening of cross-Strait ties under President Ma Ying-jeou of Taiwan. Since being elected in 2008, Mr. Ma has adopted a conciliatory approach toward China and pushed through a number of cooperative policies, including a free-trade agreement. While most Taiwanese strongly favor maintaining Taiwan\u2019s functional independence, Mr. Ma has started an irreversible trend toward closer ties and political negotiation with Beijing. Economic interaction is the force that drives this trend, but it\u2019s more comprehensive than one based on economics alone. For decades, hostilities between the Kuomintang (K.M.T.) government in Taiwan and the Chinese Communist Party led to a policy on the Taiwan side of \u201cno contact, no compromise and no negotiation.\u201d Even as China opened up and Taiwanese investors and manufacturers brought the two economies together, political relations remained deadlocked. Tentative contacts in the early 1990s were stalled by what Beijing called the \u201csecessionist\u201d policies of former presidents Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian. When he became president in 2008, Mr. Ma announced that, contrary to his predecessor, he would accept the idea of \u201cone China, different interpretations\u201d that is Beijing\u2019s bottom-line position. Mr. Ma\u2019s unequivocal assurances soon led to the expansion of transportation links, suspension of competition for diplomatic allies and agreements on crime, food safety, tourism and education. But Taiwan\u2019s separation from the mainland continues to remind China\u2019s leaders of colonial, in particular Japanese, bullying at the end of the 19th century. The new Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has held up the \u201cChinese Dream\u201d as the maxim for his leadership, aiming to recapture the prestige that was lost during \u201c100 years of national shame.\u201d A major component of that goal is restoring lost territory, chiefly Taiwan, which was ceded to Japan in 1895 following the first of a series of military defeats and invasions that are the source of continuing Chinese antipathy. Defeat by the Communists in the Chinese civil war forced the K.M.T., and its army and supporters, to evacuate to Taiwan, where it ruled through martial law for four decades before steering the island toward democracy in the late 1980s. It is only in recent months that Mr. Xi has been able to devote his energy to the Taiwan issue. Since his rise to the top of the Communist Party in late 2012, Mr. Xi has been preoccupied with consolidating power and setting out an ambitious plan to reform the economy, while launching an internal anticorruption campaign and managing deteriorating relations with Japan.Mr. Xi showed his determination to press for political talks at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Bali last October, where he told a Taiwanese representative that progress toward a political resolution must be accelerated.Now that Mr. Xi\u2019s house is in better order, and as the China-friendly Mr. Ma enters the final two years of his presidency, there is a renewed sense of urgency in both camps. Mr. Ma\u2019s many opponents, including those in his own party, note that his enthusiasm for pursuing links with China is not in line with public opinion. Surveys over the past 20 years show a consistently large majority of Taiwanese, over 80 percent in the most recent poll late last year, support some version of the status quo. Support for immediate or future unification was less than 12 percent. Mr. Ma\u2019s approach will be put to the test in 2016 when voters go to the polls to choose his successor. Although some say that Mr. Ma has been overly accommodating, there is every reason to expect continuity in Taiwan\u2019s policy toward China if the K.M.T. retains the presidency. A victory for the Democratic Progressive Party, on the other hand, is likely to bring about a period of uncertainty in China-Taiwan relations. Long a staunch defender of Taiwan\u2019s autonomy, the D.P.P. has shown a willingness to engage with China, but the policy platform it recently put forward as a basis for conducting cross-Strait relations was swiftly rejected by Beijing.Still, a D.P.P. victory would slow down the process, but is unlikely to reverse the long-term trend toward closer ties. Taiwan\u2019s economy depends on trade, and China is its biggest export destination and source of a huge trade surplus. China is central to the supply chains of Taiwanese manufacturers, and 80 percent of Taiwanese foreign direct investment goes to China. A significant add-on to the free trade agreement in the area of services and trade awaits ratification in Taiwan\u2019s legislature. Aside from this economic interdependence, China imposes its power on Taiwan in many ways, creating momentum that is difficult to withstand indefinitely. The area across the strait from Taiwan is lined with Chinese missiles. Chinese influence and opposition restricts Taiwan\u2019s participation in international society, including signing other bilateral and regional economic agreements. China exerts influence on hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese businesspeople residing in China, and has started to target Taiwanese politics, allegedly contributing to election campaigns, mobilizing influential supporters and investing in Taiwanese media. Against these formidable pressures, Taiwan has limited resources to call upon. Its most potent weapon is its robust democracy. The moral support that Taiwan claims from the international community for its mode of governance is an important constraint on China. Any leader in Taipei who attempts to preserve the status quo of functional independence can rightly say that the government is merely following public opinion. The Taiwanese people desire the peace and prosperity that positive relations with China could bring, yet they do not want to give up their sovereignty or democracy to achieve it. But Beijing\u2019s position is implacable, and its power and influence is inescapable. As it ramps up the pressure on Taiwan in different ways, there is an inevitable drift toward the unification that China craves. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "January Ends With Another Decline on Wall Street", "Date": "2014-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors were hit from all sides in January. Concerns about the global economy and company earnings in the United States, as well as turmoil in emerging markets, led major indexes to their worst month in two years. However, many remain hopeful that the problems in January will not spill over into the rest of 2014. They even see the month\u2019s downturn as healthy, given the market\u2019s torrid 30 percent rise last year.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.3 percent in January, the worst start to a year since 2009. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 3.6 percent in January, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2 percent.Many investors expected 2014 to be more muddled and volatile, looking for additional pullbacks and possibly a drop of at least 10 percent in one of the market indexes, known as a correction. \u201cPeople did look at these stock market valuations at the beginning of the year with a degree of nervousness,\u201d said David Kelly, chief market strategist at J. P. Morgan Funds. \u201cA correction would probably be healthy for the market.\u201dEven so, many investors were surprised by January\u2019s turbulence. With one exception, the Dow had triple-digit moves every trading day in January.Investors point to the December jobs report, released on Jan. 10, as a starting point for the recent troubles. The government said then that employers created only 74,000 jobs in December, the worst month for job creation since 2011 and far below expectations. Up until that point, weeks of data showed that the economic recovery was accelerating. \u201cIt set a negative tone for the market,\u201d Mr. Kelly said.Other economic reports also painted a picture of growth possibly flattening out instead of accelerating. Added to these worries were mixed signals from companies in the United States. Half of the members of the S.&P. 500 have reported, and while fourth-quarter corporate earnings are up a respectable 7.9 percent from a year earlier, companies have been cutting their full-year outlooks and reporting weaker sales, according to the data provider FactSet.Then there are concerns about overseas markets. In China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, a recent report showed that manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in January. Then came the currency troubles in smaller emerging markets, particularly Argentina, South Africa and Turkey. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 149.76 points, or 0.94 percent, to 15,698.85. The S.&P. 500 dropped 11.60 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,782.59, and the Nasdaq lost 19.25 points, or 0.47 percent, to 4,103.88.In bond trading, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 14/32 to 100 29/32, and its yield fell to 2.65 percent from 2.69 percent late Thursday.Investors should not panic yet, money managers say. More opportunities for good news abound, including next week\u2019s jobs report for January, and another 93 members of the S.&P. 500 are scheduled to report earnings.\u201cA 5 percent decline in equities is not an earth-shattering event by any measure, particularly after last year,\u201d said Krishna Memani, chief investment officer at Oppenheimer Funds. \u201cIt\u2019s still way too early to give up on equities.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Ambiguous Omen, U.S. Household Debt Begins to Rise Again", "Date": "2014-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cAfter a long period of deleveraging, households are borrowing again,\u201d Wilbert van der Klaauw, senior vice president and economist at the New York Fed, said in a statement.Asked if the report was good news or bad news for the economy, Mr. van der Klaauw gave a little laugh. \u201cGood or bad, it\u2019s hard to say,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a steady state you would expect, in nominal terms, household debt to grow.\u201dIt was a measured statement that glossed over the complexity of the report. While a willingness to borrow can be an indication that households are more confident in their economic futures, it can also indicate that they are struggling to maintain spending levels in the face of high unemployment and stagnant wages. Some kinds of debt, like car loans and mortgages, may be a positive sign that people are investing in the future. Other kinds, like student loan debt, can put a damper on the economy by suppressing discretionary spending for years. There is rising concern that student debt is contributing to a slowdown in the creation of new households, keeping young people living with their parents and 30-somethings from becoming homeowners.The debt increase in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by new mortgages, which grew by $152 billion; car loans, which grew by $18 billion; and student loans, which grew by $53 billion and had the biggest percent increase at 5.2 percent. Total household debt grew steadily before the financial crisis and peaked in 2008, at $12.7 trillion, at a moment when, it is now clear, Americans were dangerously overleveraged. It then decreased to a low of $11.2 trillion before starting to edge back up in the second half of last year.David Strasser, a retail analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, was skeptical of claims that the increased borrowing meant increased optimism. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re not seeing job growth; you\u2019re not seeing wage growth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still overleveraged by any historical measure.\u201d Historically, the debt-to-income ratio was well below 90 percent, he said, though it peaked at almost 130 percent just before the recession. At the end of the third quarter of 2013, before the increase seen in the Fed report, it was still above 100 percent. The savings rate also decreased each month in the fourth quarter.But Chris G. Christopher Jr., director of consumer economics for IHS Global Insight, said the small increase in credit-card debt, $11 billion or 1.6 percent, was not a big concern. \u201cThe debt is on the housing side, which is gaining some traction,\u201d he said.The $152 billion rise in mortgage debt, 0.2 percent over the year, was driven by people with very solid credit scores (higher than 720) and by people under 40; every older age group reduced their mortgage and home equity debt. The growth in auto debt, which rose by 10.2 percent to $863 billion, was spread across credit scores and age groups.Increases in credit-card debt were driven by people whose credit scores were well above average. That was in contrast to 2006, when people with below-average credit scores were much more likely to borrow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Science Linking Drought to Global Warming Remains Matter of Dispute", "Date": "2014-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn delivering aid to drought-stricken California last week, President Obama and his aides cited the state as an example of what could be in store for much of the rest of the country as human-caused climate change intensifies.But in doing so, they were pushing at the boundaries of scientific knowledge about the relationship between climate change and drought. While a trend of increasing drought that may be linked to global warming has been documented in some regions, including parts of the Mediterranean and in the Southwestern United States, there is no scientific consensus yet that it is a worldwide phenomenon. Nor is there definitive evidence that it is causing California\u2019s problems.In fact, the most recent computer projections suggest that as the world warms, California should get wetter, not drier, in the winter, when the state gets the bulk of its precipitation. That has prompted some of the leading experts to suggest that climate change most likely had little role in causing the drought.\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the severity of this thing is due to natural variability,\u201d said Richard Seager, a climate scientist who studies water issues at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.To be sure, 2013 was the driest year in 119 years of record keeping in California. But extreme droughts have happened in the state before, and the experts say this one bears a notable resemblance to some of those, including a crippling drought in 1976 and 1977.Over all, drought seems to be decreasing in the central United States and certain other parts of the world, though that is entirely consistent with the longstanding prediction that wet areas of the world will get wetter in a warming climate, even as the dry ones get drier.What may be different about this drought is that, whatever the cause, the effects appear to have been made worse by climatic warming. And in making that case last week, scientists said, the administration was on solid ground.California has been warming along with most regions of the United States, and temperatures in recent months have been markedly higher than during the 1976-77 drought. In fact, for some of the state\u2019s most important agricultural regions, summer lasted practically into January, with high temperatures of 10 or 15 degrees above normal on some days.The consequence, scientists say, has been that any moisture the state does get evaporates more rapidly, intensifying the effects of the drought on agriculture in particular. \u201cWe are going through a pattern we\u2019ve seen before, but we\u2019re doing it in a warmer environment,\u201d said Michael Anderson, the California state climatologist.The White House science adviser, John P. Holdren, said in a briefing last week: \u201cScientifically, no single episode of extreme weather, no storm, no flood, no drought can be said to have been caused by global climate change. But the global climate has now been so extensively impacted by the human-caused buildup of greenhouse gases that weather practically everywhere is being influenced by climate change.\u201dThe drought eased a bit with heavy rains in Northern California this month, but many major reservoirs have only half the water expected for this time of year. \u201cI think the situation is still pretty severe,\u201d said Prof. Alex Hall, who studies climate at the University of California, Los Angeles.California gets much of its water from snow in the winter along the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada. That means 38 million people and a $45 billion agricultural economy are critically dependent on about five heavy storms a year.If a ridge of high atmospheric pressure develops off the California coast, it can easily push moisture-bearing winds to the north, so that the water falls closer to Seattle than Sacramento. Just such a ridge has been parked off California for much of the last three years.A decade ago, scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, published a tantalizing set of papers that predicted a greater likelihood of such a ridge. The lead researcher, Jacob O. Sewall, harnessed substantial computing power to run forecasts of what would happen in a future climate after a substantial melting of sea ice in the Arctic. The ice is already melting because of fast-rising temperatures in the region that many scientists attribute to human emissions.Dr. Sewall expected some sort of disturbance in the circulation of the atmosphere, but he and his adviser, Lisa Cirbus Sloan, were not prepared for the answer they received. \u201cThe surprise jumped out that, wow, all of a sudden it got a whole lot drier in the western part of North America,\u201d Dr. Sewall recalled.His first study on the question was published in 2004, and was based on conditions that were expected by midcentury. Arctic sea ice then fell much faster than expected, hitting a record low in 2007 and then another record low in 2012.He and several other scientists said the loss of ice has allowed extra heat to escape from the Arctic Ocean into the atmosphere in the fall and early winter, disturbing weather patterns over vast distances. That, they said, has made extreme weather events of all kinds more likely in the Northern Hemisphere, possibly including winter extremes like the cold blasts hitting the East Coast these days.At the same time, the California drought, now in its third year, bears a striking resemblance to the atmospheric pattern predicted in Dr. Sewall\u2019s computer analysis.The resemblance is so uncanny that Dr. Sewall, who now works at Kutztown University in Pennsylvania, suspects an element of coincidence, but he also calls the correlation \u201cfrightening.\u201d If this kind of drought has indeed become more likely for California, that means the state \u2014 where some towns are now worried about running out of drinking water \u2014 is getting a glimpse of its future.Since his studies were published, other research has come to somewhat different conclusions. Many of those studies have found a likelihood that climate change will indeed cause the American West to dry out, but by an entirely different mechanism \u2014 the arrival of more dry air from the tropics. And the most recent batch of studies predicts that effect will not really apply to the western slope of the Sierra. Climate projections show that the area should get somewhat more moisture in the winter, not less.It may take years to resolve the scientific uncertainty. But with California\u2019s growing population, the state faces increasing pressure to resolve tensions involved in apportioning its water among city dwellers, farmers, industry and an environment under increasing strain from global warming.Dr. Seager of Columbia University pointed out that much of the Southwestern United States had been in a drought of fluctuating severity for 15 years. In some areas, moreover, the warmer climate is causing winter precipitation to fall as rain rather than snow, meaning less melting snowpack to help parched states through the hotter summers.\u201cIt all adds up across the Southwest to an increasingly stressed water system,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they might as well get ready for.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Monday about the relationship between drought conditions and global warning paraphrased incorrectly from comments by Richard Seager, a climate scientist at Columbia University. He said that much of the Southwestern United States \u2014 not the West Coast \u2014 had been in drought for the past 15 years.Advertisement"}

This enabled Republicans to champion an austerity policy that produced deep reductions in discretionary spending, undoing many of the gains begun in 2009. The result has been a post-stimulus recovery that remains weak and struggling, undermining an economic legacy that should be seen as a remarkable accomplishment.Government spending worked, helping millions of people who never realized it.

{"Headline": "Protests Over Government and Economy Roil Bosnia", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Thousands of angry Bosnians took to the streets on Friday for a fourth day of protests against the political paralysis and economic stagnation that have engulfed one of Europe\u2019s poorest and most divided countries.In protests being called the Bosnian Spring for the sheer depth of their intensity, unemployed youths, war veterans and disgruntled workers, among others, set fire to government buildings in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s capital, and across the country.Srecko Latal, an analyst at the Social Overview Service, a research organization based in Sarajevo, said in a telephone interview that the capital looked like a \u201cwar zone,\u201d with cars set on fire and overturned, buildings burning, and smoke from tear gas billowing into the sky. He said protesters had attacked the headquarters of the Bosnian presidency on Friday, a potent symbol of the country\u2019s chronic dysfunction.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen violent scenes like this since the war in the 1990s,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are fed up with what has become total political chaos in Bosnia, with infighting over power, a dire economic situation and a feeling that there is little hope for the future. The protests are a wake-up call for the international community not to disengage from Bosnia.\u201dThe protests started on Tuesday in Tuzla, a former industrial center, when more than 10,000 factory workers gathered in front of a regional government building to voice their anger over factory closings and unpaid salaries, for which they blamed poorly executed state privatizations. The anger soon spread to other parts of Bosnia.The political and economic deterioration has its roots in the aftermath of the brutal ethnic war in Bosnia, which ended in 1995 after more than 100,000 people were killed. The Dayton Peace Agreement, brokered by the United States, ended the war. But it also divided Bosnia and Herzegovina, a former Yugoslav republic, into two entities \u2014 a Muslim-Croat Federation and a Serbian Republic \u2014 and created a complex and unwieldy power-sharing system that has helped engender political infighting and stagnation.Over the past several years, the poor and ethnically divided country has teetered from one crisis to the next. The political instability has undermined the country\u2019s prospects of joining the European Union, and fanned economic hardship, including unemployment of more than 27 percent.In June, about 1,500 lawmakers, government employees and foreign guests were held hostage for hours after thousands of angry demonstrators formed a human chain around the Bosnian Parliament building in Sarajevo to protest an impasse over a law on identification documents.Mr. Latal said the current protests were primarily in the Muslim-Croat part of Bosnia but had also spread to its Serbian Republic. He said the disenchantment with the political paralysis transcended ethnicity, and paradoxically was unifying disparate ethnic groups around a common cause.As the protests flared this week, Nermin Niksic, the prime minister of the Bosniak-Croat Federation, acknowledged some of the grievances of the protesters, including that workers had been deprived of pensions and health benefits. But he said that hooligans were taking advantage of the situation to foment chaos.Suad Zeljkovic, the prime minister of the Sarajevo regional government, drew anger this week when he said that the people of Sarajevo were not justified in their dissatisfaction.\u201cIn Sarajevo, no one has reasons for unrest and actions like this,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThere is not a single unpaid salary, nor does any sector of society have reasons for dissatisfaction.\u201dAdvertisement"}

By any name, his cooking brought renown to El Bulli, above a bay on the Costa Brava near Rosas, Spain, a Catalonian beach town not far from Cadaqu\u00e9s, the summer home of Salvador Dal\u00ed, a better-known Catalonian Surrealist.The dishes that Mr. Adri\u00e0 and his collaborators painstakingly created at El Bulli during more than two decades were about as close to art as food gets. Visually striking, they thwarted expectations, confused the senses and tickled the mind with their transformations and disguises. They were such head trips of sight, smell, taste and touch (the tongue\u2019s), that they seemed all but nonfunctional: Nourishment had little to do with it. Mr. Adri\u00e0 himself often characterized El Bulli as a kind of theater, more about the experience than about the food.At the \u201cFerran Adri\u00e0: Notes on Creativity\u201d exhibit at the Drawing Center, several of the chef\u2019s plating diagrams from El Bulli are on view.The Drawing Center has often seemed overeager to prove that drawing is an infinitely elastic category, as with a recent exhibition of the charming writings on various odd scraps of paper by Emily Dickinson and the Swiss novelist Robert Walser.\u00a0One way Mr. Adri\u00e0 encouraged creativity was to disrupt typical restaurant habits. For example, to avoid simply repeating their recipes, he and his team closed El Bulli for six months each year and repaired to a laboratory in nearby Barcelona. There, using chemistry beakers as much as mixing bowls, they devised a completely new menu, while designers created new settings and, when necessary, the tools needed to make and the utensils for eating their offerings.The vitrines devoted to the drawings and notebooks of the Adri\u00e0 brothers and Mr. Castro aren\u2019t nearly as orderly as Mr. Huber\u2019s. The three largest notebooks bulge with papers; their covers are messily scrawled with one year or another, as if by some distracted high school senior. One pencil drawing, in particular, encapsulates El Bulli\u2019s ethos of intensive labor yielding deceptively simple results. Dashed off in an abbreviated style reminiscent of William Wegman or Roz Chast, this sketch centers on a flat little rectangle with a lattice motif on its surface (think of shortbread) connected by about three dozen radiating lines (think of a free-form halo) to as many little scribblings, each presumably indicating an ingredient or technique.Several drawings bring to mind the lists and diagrams frequent to early Conceptual Art. And three elaborate charts enlarged and transferred to walls map the creative, culinary and gastronomical process with the inspirational verve of a Joseph Beuys blackboard.\u00a0In the enclosure, eight large bulletin boards festooned with drawings, notes and photographs lean against the wall, some devoted to the annual menus. Another records the evolution of the last of the 1,846 dishes devised for El Bulli: a new version of peach melba in honor of the French chef Auguste Escoffier, who created this classic dessert in the early 1890s, and coincidentally, was born in 1846.As these marvels glide past, much enlarged, they variously evoke jewelry, sculpture, architecture, landscape architecture, furniture, early Dal\u00ed paintings and so forth.

{"Headline": "How It All Began: A Cold War Battle Heats Up", "Date": "2014-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are three core factors that led to the chaos:First is a broken promise between a leader and his citizens: President Viktor F. Yanukovych had long promised to integrate Ukraine with the European Union by signing sweeping political and trade agreements. In November, he refused to sign.Second is a lingering Cold War-era fight between Russia and the West for influence over countries in Eastern Europe still suffering from political and economic problems rooted in the Soviet era. While Europe and the United States have made a priority of fostering democracy in the former Soviet republics, the Kremlin sees an ulterior motive: the expansion of Western military and economic power. Perceiving a threat to its big military and economic interests in Ukraine, Russia exerted enormous pressure to scuttle the accords with the European Union.Now, a quick recap of how recent events unfolded.Russia had serious reasons for unease. Its Black Sea naval fleet is based in Ukraine, and crucial pipelines in Ukraine carry Russian natural gas to customers in Europe. European officials repeatedly dismissed Russia\u2019s concerns in what in hindsight they viewed as a serious miscalculation given Russia\u2019s control over Ukraine\u2019s gas supply, and eastern Ukraine\u2019s heavy dependence on Russia for business and trade.Ukraine has long been caught between Europe and Russia, and Mr. Yanukovych, elected in 2010, had tried to strike a balance even as his own Eastern Ukrainian, Russian-speaking heritage seemed to place him personally closer to Moscow.These included the beating by the police of young protesters on Nov. 30, which prompted demonstrators to seize public buildings and occupy Independence Square, as well as the ramming through of new laws severely restricting free speech and assembly.The protests turned deadly as demonstrators, furious over the legislation, threw firebombs at the police and the authorities responded in some cases with gunfire. Mr. Yanukovych tried to stem the violence by firing the government, but calls for his own resignation grew louder anyway.Tensions simmered until last week when it seemed Parliament might squelch a deal to reverse constitutional changes that had expanded presidential powers earlier in Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s term. Demonstrators marched toward Parliament, setting off what quickly became the most violent clashes yet.An earlier version of this article misstated the day that President Viktor F. Yanukovych fled the capital, Kiev. It was Friday, not Saturday.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Ukraine Can Be Saved", "Date": "2014-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorROME \u2014 Ukraine is in the middle of a violent political crisis. Dozens of people died this week and hundreds more were injured as protesters fought police in the capital, Kiev. Lethal violence has been spreading to the rest of the country, and a truce announced early Thursday fell apart as the death toll kept growing.What began in November as a series of peaceful protests in favor of closer ties with the European Union and greater autonomy from the influence of Russia has escalated into a conflagration.To save Ukraine, the government and opposition alike must make the difficult but necessary choice to compromise and reconcile. European leaders should immediately schedule direct talks with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his top officials to find a temporary solution to stop the bloodshed and a longer-term plan that would allow Ukrainians to determine their political destiny in a peaceful and democratic fashion.But the West must make clear to Moscow that Ukraine \u2014 a bridge between East and West \u2014 should not be the object of geopolitical games. European leaders should back down from their threats of sanctions against Ukraine and its embattled president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, which would only prolong the suffering of the Ukrainian people. But Russian interference in Ukraine\u2019s internal affairs must not be tolerated.Only a few weeks ago, there were signs of progress in Ukraine, with the government offering concessions to the protesters while working to restore order. Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government passed an amnesty law, released detained protesters and introduced legislation to amend the Constitution to place greater power with the Parliament. Protesters began to vacate government buildings, and the country seemed to be stepping back from the brink.But now the demonstrations have taken a new, dangerous turn. Reversing the previous progress, radical agents began to attack police, start fires, seize buildings and create an environment of destruction.There can be no forgiveness or leniency for those who provoke violence and the loss of human life, whether they are street thugs or misguided nationalists.Many or even most of the protesters are sincere and want a peaceful Ukraine that is stable and democratic.But there is also a violent faction, which is occupying government buildings and attacking police officers with guns and explosives. It includes far-right nationalist groups like Right Sector, a new extremist movement, and Svoboda, an openly anti-Semitic group that is now the country\u2019s third-largest opposition party. (The party, which first won seats in Parliament in 2012, had a paramilitary wing until it was disbanded in 2004.)While legitimate dissent is essential to democracy, violent attacks have no place in political dialogue. The leaders of Ukraine\u2019s opposition movement and the peaceful protesters in Independence Square should forcefully and unequivocally repudiate these violent extremists and their tactics. The radicals should be brought to justice.But restoring peace will also require calm moderation from Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government, which must be ready to stand down once order is restored, so that the country can start to heal. Last month, he offered the jobs of prime minister and deputy prime minister to leaders of the opposition \u2014 who refused, demanding new presidential elections. On Wednesday, the president dismissed the head of the armed forces, Russia condemned the violence as an \u201cattempted coup,\u201d and European Union leaders prepared to meet in Brussels to discuss potential sanctions.Mr. Yanukovych must extend an olive branch, and the opposition must try to meet him halfway, so that a new bipartisan government can be formed to restore order and manage the country\u2019s troubled economy. Then protesters should remove their barricades and go home.The government has met many of the demands outlined by the protesters and their message has been heard loud and clear; this is democracy at its best. European leaders must encourage this progress and avoid the appearance of interference, which would encourage only more division.Some in the European Union have lost sight of the basic truth that we need Ukraine as much as Ukraine needs us. We need to rebuild trust and restart the movement toward integrating Ukraine into the rest of Europe.As president of the European Commission a decade ago, I oversaw the largest single enlargement of the European Union in its history, with the inclusion of seven former members of the East Bloc.Europe needs Ukraine as a bridge to Russia more than ever. In recent days, talks between the two sides have only yielded bad faith. Mistrust has steadily grown: Moscow views Europe\u2019s diplomacy as empire-building in all but name, while Brussels sees a jealous Russia determined to recreate an imperial past.Ukraine, this fragile and vital bridge, is in danger of collapsing. To threaten sanctions, to condone violent extremists in the streets and to ignore Ukraine\u2019s financial troubles \u2014 as some European leaders seem to be doing \u2014 would be to hasten the destruction of the bridge. Instead, we should be supporting and repairing it.Europe should not accept interference by Russia in Ukraine\u2019s affairs, but it also cannot stand by as the crisis in Kiev rages. The European Union should re-engage Mr. Putin and make clear that all parties have everything to lose, and nothing to gain, from further violence.\u00a0Updated Feb. 20, 2014: This Op-Ed article has been updated to reflect news developments.\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Medicines Made in India Set Off Safety Worries", "Date": "2014-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIndia\u2019s pharmaceutical industry supplies 40 percent of over-the-counter and generic prescription drugs consumed in the United States, so the increased scrutiny could have profound implications for American consumers.F.D.A. investigators are blitzing Indian drug plants, financing the inspections with some of the roughly $300 million in annual fees from generic drug makers collected as part of a 2012 law requiring increased scrutiny of overseas plants. The agency inspected 160 Indian drug plants last year, three times as many as in 2009. The increased scrutiny has led to a flood of new penalties, including half of the warning letters the agency issued last year to drug makers.Dr. Hamburg was met by Indian officials and executives who, shocked by recent F.D.A. export bans of generic versions of popular medicines \u2014 like the acne drug Accutane, the pain drug Neurontin and the antibiotic Cipro \u2014 that the F.D.A. determined were adulterated, suspect that she is just protecting a domestic industry from cheaper imports.\u201cThere are some people who take a very sinister view of the F.D.A. inspections,\u201d Keshav Desiraju, India\u2019s health secretary until this week, said in a recent interview.The F.D.A.'s increased enforcement has already cost Indian companies dearly \u2014 Ranbaxy, one of India\u2019s biggest drug manufacturers, pleaded guilty to felony charges and paid a $500 million fine last year, the largest ever levied against a generic company. And many worry that worse is in store.More tests of hospital medicines found dozens more that were substandard, including a crucial intravenous antibiotic used in sick infants.\u201cSome of the fake tablets were used by pregnant women in the post-surgical prevention of infections,\u201d said Dr. M. Ishaq Geer, senior assistant professor of pharmacology at the University of Kashmir. \u201cThat\u2019s very serious.\u201dInvestigations of the deaths are continuing, but convictions of drug counterfeiters in India are extremely rare.Satish Reddy, president of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, said Indian drug manufacturers were better than the F.D.A. now contends. \u201cMore rigorous enforcement is needed, for sure, but this impression that India is overrun with counterfeits is unjustified,\u201d Mr. Reddy said.But Heather Bresch, chief executive of Mylan, which has plants in the United States and India, said regulatory scrutiny outside the United States was long overdue. \u201cIf there were no cops around, would everyone drive the speed limit?\u201d Ms. Bresch asked. \u201cYou get careless, start taking risks. Our government has enabled this.\u201dFor Dr. Hamburg, the trip is part of a long-running effort to create a global network of drug and food regulators to help scrutinize the growing flood of products coming into the United States, including 80 percent of the seafood consumed in the United States, 50 percent of the fresh fruit, 20 percent of the vegetables and the vast majority of drugs.She has gone to conclaves of regulators from Europe and elsewhere to coordinate policing, but Indian officials have so far not attended such meetings.Many of India\u2019s drug manufacturing facilities are of top quality. Cipla, one of the industry\u2019s giants, has 40 plants across the country that together can produce more than 21 billion tablets and capsules annually, and one of its plants in Goa appeared just as sterile, automated and high tech on a recent tour as those in the United States.Cipla follows F.D.A. guidelines at every plant and on every manufacturing line, and the company exports more than 55 percent of its production, said Yusuf Hamied, the company chairman.But Benjamin Mwesige, a pharmacist at the Uganda Cancer Institute in Kampala, said in an interview in July that the institute had stopped buying cancer drugs from India in 2011 because it had received shipments of drugs that turned out to be counterfeit and inactive, with Cipla labels that Mr. Mwesige believed were forged.He became suspicious when doctors began seeing chemotherapy patients whose cancer showed none of the expected responses to the drugs \u2014 and who also had none of the usual side effects. The drugs that had been prescribed were among the mainstays of cancer treatment \u2014 methotrexate, docetaxel and vincristine. Laboratory tests confirmed that the drugs were bogus, and Mr. Mwesige estimated that in 2011 20 percent of the drugs that the institute bought were counterfeit.This absence of oversight, however, is a central reason India\u2019s pharmaceutical industry has been so profitable. Drug manufacturers estimate that routine F.D.A. inspections add 25 percent to overall costs. In the wake of the 2012 law that requires the F.D.A. for the first time to equalize oversight of domestic and foreign plants, India\u2019s cost advantage could shrink significantly.Some top manufacturers are already warning that they may leave, tough medicine for an already slowing economy.\u201cI\u2019m a great nationalist, an Indian first and last,\u201d Dr. Hamied said. \u201cBut companies like Cipla are looking to expand their businesses abroad and not in India.\u201dAmerican businesses and F.D.A. officials are just as concerned about the quality of drugs coming out of China, but the F.D.A.'s efforts to increase inspections there have so far been frustrated by the Chinese government.\u201cChina is the source of some of the largest counterfeit manufacturing operations that we find globally,\u201d said John P. Clark, Pfizer\u2019s chief security officer, who added that Chinese authorities were cooperative.Using its new revenues, the F.D.A. tried to bolster its staff in China in February 2012. But the Chinese government has so far failed to provide the necessary visas despite an announced agreement in December 2013 during a visit by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said Erica Jefferson, an F.D.A. spokeswoman.The United States has become so dependent on Chinese imports, however, that the F.D.A. may not be able to do much about the Chinese refusal. The crucial ingredients for nearly all antibiotics, steroids and many other lifesaving drugs are now made exclusively in China.Denise Grady contributed reporting from Kampala, Uganda, and Hari Kumar from Srinagar, Kashmir.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy Swears In New Prime Minister, 39, After Ouster", "Date": "2014-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe main challenge for Mr. Renzi\u2019s broad coalition is the ailing economy, just beginning to show signs of rebounding after several years of stagnation. Youth unemployment is hovering around 40 percent. Mr. Renzi, 39, quit his post as mayor of Florence this month to take up his first national government job.He has vowed to push electoral changes through Parliament in hopes of ending chronic political instability by reducing the influence of Italy\u2019s tiny parties.He must first win confidence votes in Parliament this week. That will not be easy, because he angered many in his Democratic Party when he maneuvered to oust Enrico Letta as premier in mid-February, breaking a promise to wait until eventual elections to gain the premiership.The usually easygoing Mr. Letta gave Mr. Renzi a chilly, limp handshake during a handover ceremony at the presidential palace that lasted 20 seconds. Mr. Letta did not smile, and neither man looked the other in the eye.The Democratic Party is the main partner in the coalition government, which includes smaller parties ranging from center-right to center-left that were also a part of Mr. Letta\u2019s coalition.Some centrists indicated they might not back Mr. Renzi in Parliament after his new cabinet excluded their only minister, who had held the defense post. In a surprise move, Mr. Renzi also excluded Emma Bonino, a staunchly pro-Europe foreign minister.Mr. Renzi has said little about Italy\u2019s relationship with the European Union, except that a union-ordered overemphasis on austerity measures would discourage economic revival.One of the few nonpolitical appointees, Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan, missed the swearing-in. Mr. Padoan, who had been chief economist of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, was in Australia when named to the post.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Petition to Nullify Thai Election Is Rejected in Setback for Opposition", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 A petition to nullify Thailand\u2019s general election was rejected Friday on procedural grounds by the country\u2019s ombudsman, a setback for the opposition Democrat Party, which is allied with protesters trying to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.Days after the vote, there are contradictory signals about which side has the upper hand in Thailand\u2019s debilitating power struggle.The Yingluck government has been weakened by its inability to pay farmers as part of a failed rice subsidy policy, which the opposition says is emblematic of the governing party\u2019s wasteful populist policies. On Thursday, a prominent aristocrat who took part in the military-installed government after the 2006 coup called on Ms. Yingluck to step down, something that the government says is impossible until a new government is formed.The Election Commission has yet to announce a detailed plan for the completion of voting.There are also signs of weakness in the protest movement, which in recent weeks tried and failed to shut down Bangkok. The evolution of the movement from an anticorruption crusade to a group that is aggressively blocking elections has sidelined some erstwhile supporters. A gun battle on the eve of elections \u2014 in which gunmen allied with the protesters shot at would-be voters \u2014 has blunted the protest leaders\u2019 message that they are peaceful and unarmed. Government supporters have sought to capitalize on that episode, which has spawned a catchphrase: \u201cWe wanted ballots, but we got bullets.\u201dProtesters are still blocking a number of crucial intersections in Bangkok, but they have retreated from other areas. Attendance at the protests appears to be waning, especially during the day.With both sides weakened, the power struggle increasingly resembles a war of attrition, one that business executives warn could have severe effects on the economy.Thais have been reading the political tea leaves, looking for signals from the country\u2019s most powerful institutions, including the monarchy, the military and the courts.Prayuth Chan-ocha, the head of the army, said this week that he would not do anything \u201cbeyond the limits,\u201d a statement that the Thai news media interpreted to mean that he would not stage a coup. But he added, \u201cI would rather not say whether I approve of the election.\u201dSignals from the courts have been mixed during the crisis. But after having refused several times to issue arrest warrants for the protest leaders, a court this week approved warrants for 19 of them on charges of violating emergency rule declared last month. A prosecutor also rejected a request by lawyers for Suthep Thaugsuban, the main protest leader, to postpone a murder case against him on charges of ordering the use of live ammunition against protesters when he was in power in 2010. Dozens of people were killed during the crackdown.One of the most striking commentaries on the crisis in recent days was offered by Veerapong Ramangura, an economist who has served many governments, including the present one and those installed after military coups.Mr. Veerapong, who rarely appears on television, lashed out at the protest movement during an hourlong interview, calling the leaders\u2019 plans \u201cnonsensical.\u201d Without mentioning names, Mr. Veerapong said that there had been \u201can agreement to stage a coup d'\u00e9tat\u201d and install a former general as leader, but that the plan had been scrapped because the head of the army had refused to go ahead with it.\u201cThe protest leaders are now stuck,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how to back out of this.\u201dThe comments were especially notable because Mr. Veerapong has worked closely with the military and other establishment figures over the years, and because, while he has advised the current government, he has also been sharply critical of it, especially its management of the rice subsidy program.Mr. Veerapong said he believed that some judges and members of state agencies were now hoping to remove the government and install their own government.\u201cIt\u2019s not doable because these organizations cannot tear up the Constitution,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brownback Leads Kansas in Sharp Right Turn", "Date": "2014-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne-Party RuleTOPEKA, Kan. \u2014 Sam Brownback took office as Kansas\u2019 chief executive more than three years ago, promising a conservative revolution. By all accounts he has kept his promise.Mr. Brownback, 57, has overseen the largest income tax cuts in state history, an expansion of gun rights, restrictions on abortion, sharply reduced welfare rolls, increased voter-registration scrutiny and a paring of state government bureaucracy. To accomplish his goals, he helped push the Republican-majority Legislature further to the right by working to oust moderate Republicans, deepening a longstanding rift within the state\u2019s G.O.P.\u201cWe believe this is a strategy that builds a strong state in the future on the red state model,\u201d Mr. Brownback said in an interview in his Capitol office here. \u201cI think we are doing this aggressively and I think you\u2019re going to see some very good things moving forward. It\u2019s not as if we haven\u2019t tried the blue state model, because we have.\u201dBut revolutions come with risks, not least because change comes so fast. Single-party control got things done here, but it also ignited an intraparty struggle, as the governor learned last year when some of his allies resisted the higher sales tax rate he requested to balance the state\u2019s books. And while many Kansans remain in Mr. Brownback\u2019s corner, moderate Republicans and Democrats are loudly expressing their anger. With Mr. Brownback facing re-election, voters will be assessing a mixed scorecard of achievement.The Kansas economy is growing, but like the nation\u2019s, it remains sluggish. Elementary school students are testing well, yet the achievement level of black pupils is slipping. And while income taxes have been slashed, the poorest Kansans have seen their tax burdens increase with the elimination of tax credits. As a result, this year\u2019s campaign for governor is shaping up to be more competitive than the one in 2010, when Mr. Brownback was swept into office with 63 percent of the vote.Paul Davis, a Democrat and the House minority leader, who is challenging Mr. Brownback, is hoping to ride a wave of discontent by focusing on education. Mr. Brownback has been heavily criticized for enacting huge tax cuts at a time when schools are not funded at the constitutionally mandated level. Advocates of increased school funding have sued, and the case is now before the state Supreme Court. But the governor and the Legislature have vowed to ignore any ruling that requires them to increase spending to a specific amount, asserting that elected lawmakers, not judges, should make those decisions.\u201cHe has really set things up on an ideologically based model designed for his own political reasons, to try to gain him a good deal of attention nationally,\u201d Mr. Davis said of the governor. \u201cI don\u2019t think people have reacted very well to that.\u201dSome of the most heated criticism has come from fellow Republicans \u2014 those with more centrist views who say he abandoned them when they faced primary challengers two years ago. A handful of senators lost their seats, including the former Senate president.While Mr. Brownback\u2019s supporters say he is more of a mediator than an imperial presence, opponents say he declines ideas that deviate from his ideology.Even as his bullishly conservative agenda has unsettled the state\u2019s political equilibrium, Mr. Brownback maintains the gregarious, faith-driven manner that has defined him since his days as a United States senator, long-shot presidential candidate and hero of the country\u2019s Christian right.In the Senate from 1996 to 2011, he vigorously opposed abortion, promoted low taxes and less government, and worked against the genocide in Sudan, which won him praise from some liberals. In Kansas, Mr. Brownback has argued that he is not beholden to ideology. He has, for instance, championed wind energy, supporting the renewable energy production requirement \u2014 something conservatives in the state have wanted to eliminate \u2014 and he signed legislation to help conserve water in the Ogallala Aquifer.Kansas has a long history of moderation. It entered the Union as a free state more than a century and a half ago after years of bloody battles against pro-slavery insurgents. The state\u2019s economy \u2014 founded on cattle, wheat and other crops \u2014 has been balanced more recently by aviation and technology. While the political power currently resides with the far right, this home state of Bob Dole and Dwight D. Eisenhower has a history of being governed from the center. It has elected five Democratic governors over the past 50 years, and many of the Republicans who ran the state called themselves moderates.This election year, voters will have a chance to decide whether they still feel comfortable with having strayed from a centrist course. Some political analysts say Mr. Brownback is favored to prevail even though his approval ratings have dropped over the years. Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster who has worked for Mr. Brownback, said that given President Obama\u2019s roughly 35 percent approval rating in Kansas, it would be difficult for any Democratic challenger to beat an incumbent Republican. Mr. Brownback\u2019s signature achievement as governor has been eliminating income taxes for almost 200,000 small businesses and deeply cutting individual income taxes. He said that the Kansas economy was already showing signs of moving forward because of the cuts. Unemployment fell to 4.9 percent last December, the lowest level in more than five years and lower than the national average of 6.6 percent in January. When he started his term in January 2011, the state had $876 in the bank; now there is more than $700 million in cash reserves and Kansas personal income, a measure of family earnings, is growing. The state had more than 15,000 new business filings in 2012, a record, and sales tax receipts have risen.\u201cIt\u2019s working,\u201d Mr. Brownback said, sporting black cowboy boots as he lounged on a green nailhead-trim love seat in his office. \u201cI can tell you where you would\u2019ve been had we not changed the policies. You\u2019d be having higher unemployment, you\u2019d continue to have out-migration in the state of Kansas. You wouldn\u2019t have this level of job growth taking place. You would not have this number of new business formations in the state of Kansas, and you\u2019d still have a broke state government.\u201dBut there is far from universal agreement. Personal income and gross state product are growing at a slower rate than the national average. And the state\u2019s nonpartisan legislative research department has projected that the budget will face a $213.6 million shortfall in fiscal 2017, in large part because of the deep tax cuts that are expected to cost the state about $3.9 billion over the next five years.A look at the party splits in the states on different issues.Social service supporters say the governor has failed to help poor Kansans. Under the theory that the best form of welfare is a job, the Brownback administration has made it more difficult for poor families to get welfare \u2014 the number of people receiving it has dropped by nearly 45 percent since he took office. But there is no evidence that those people are finding work. The childhood poverty rate has gone up slightly under his watch, though the trend started before he took office.Advocates for the poor were outraged last year when the agency overseeing public assistance proposed making the state\u2019s benefit card bright red, something the advocates said would only serve to shame recipients. A different design was eventually chosen. (Although there was never an intent to shame anyone, Mr. Brownback said, \u201cI could see the point of the people that were opposed to that color.\u201d)\u201cI believe he really, honestly cares,\u201d about the poor, said State Senator Oletha Faust-Goudeau, a Democrat. But she added, \u201cActions speak louder than words. I\u2019m hearing one thing, but something else is being done.\u201dMr. Brownback also entered office with a goal to increase fourth-grade reading proficiency. Although the state has remained among the top five in the nation, the share of Kansas\u2019 black fourth graders reading below a basic level rose to 53 percent last year from 44 percent in 2009, before the governor took office.Mr. Brownback said that while he empathized with struggling Kansans, far too much money had gone into the welfare system with lackluster results, so it was time to change the model, focusing instead on education, employment and family.Those who know Mr. Brownback say that his concern for the poor can be easily overlooked. A convert to Catholicism, he often opens meetings with a prayer asking for wisdom. He occasionally serves meals or packs of food to poor families at the Topeka Rescue Mission.\u201cThe thing that\u2019s remarkable about him, to me, is how sincere he is with the people that he talks to, whether it be a staff member, a volunteer or a recipient of services,\u201d said Barry Feaker, the mission\u2019s executive director.\u201cA Kansas purpose is how I describe it,\u201d Mr. Brownback said in an interview. \u201cHere, you got a mostly rectangular state, in the middle of the country, about three million people, no mountains, no ocean, a lot of wind. O.K., so what\u2019s so special? But then you look at what\u2019s happened in the history of this state, and it\u2019s an incredible place.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bane and the Boon of For-Profit Colleges", "Date": "2014-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneMarc Jerome, the executive vice president of Monroe College, says his business is being unfairly targeted as corrupt.And yet, a frustrated Mr. Jerome told me, the college founded by his grandfather 80 years ago is being singled out as one of the bad guys: private, for-profit universities that lure poor, unprepared students with misleading ads that promise good jobs on graduation but discharge them with limited employment prospects and a crushing burden of debt.\u201cThat is not good public policy,\u201d Mr. Jerome said. \u201cTargeting only for-profit institutions and exempting public or nonprofit institutions with poor outcomes is ultimately more harmful to the students the administration is seeking to protect and could ultimately drive them to schools with lower graduation rates, higher default rates\u201d and weaker potential for future earnings, he said.For-profits make up the fastest-growing segment of higher education, accounting for 20 percent of the two-year associate\u2019s degrees granted in the United States, up from 8 percent two decades ago. Their share of bachelor\u2019s degrees has risen to 7 percent, from virtually nothing.They are better than community colleges at graduating students from two-year programs. And they are more nimble at tailoring their courses to the shifting realities of the job market.\u201cThey can very quickly develop a curriculum and hire faculty to offer a credential in, for instance, how to work in a clean room in a nanotech facility,\u201d John D\u2019Agati, deputy commissioner for higher education at the New York State Education Department, told me. \u201cIn traditional colleges you have an internal process that is very slow.\u201dFor-profits, Mr. D\u2019Agati added, will also take a chance that many other schools won\u2019t on older students who might have had poor grades in high school but are now more mature and ready to advance their education.Most important, nobody else is stepping up to fill the growing demand for a higher-education degree. \u201cThey are adding to the supply,\u201d said Mr. Deming, an assistant professor of education and economics at Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Education. \u201cThey are reaching students in a different way, opening in places where there are no community colleges. They are filling in the cracks.\u201dBetween 1995 and 2011 the share of Americans who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree rose to 39 percent, from 33 percent. But the jump was much greater in the industrial nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development as a whole, where the share increased to 40 percent, from 20 percent.But American graduation rates from two-year colleges have grown faster than in other industrial countries, jumping to 12 percent, from 9 percent, over the same period to exceed the O.E.C.D.\u2019s 11 percent. Schools pursuing the profit motive account for much of that increase.The Education Department hopes to regulate the sector as vocational education. Under federal law, all programs offered by for-profits \u2014 like nondegree certificate programs at other institutions \u2014 must prepare students for \u201cgainful employment in a recognized occupation\u201d to remain eligible for federal aid.Until the Obama administration took office, nobody had bothered to codify what \u201cgainful employment\u201d meant. But proposed new rules that the Education Department submitted to the White House in January, after months of debate with both advocates for and critics of the sector, will define it in terms of students\u2019 ability to repay their college debt.This approach satisfies few. For-profit colleges say they are being held to a higher standard than public and nonprofit institutions, whose degree programs don\u2019t have to meet any such requirement. Mr. Jerome also complains that such colleges are being pulled in different directions by different regulators: Even though the federal government may define Monroe to be vocational, New York State requires it, like any other college, to offer liberal arts credits that may not immediately turn a profit in the job market.Mr. D\u2019Agati, the state education official, sympathizes. \u201cYou can\u2019t just offer a course where all 60 credits are how to weld,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that also means you can\u2019t turn around and say, \u2018O.K., but your student didn\u2019t get a job as a welder.\u2019\u00a0\u201dProfessor Deming worries that regulations might simply encourage for-profit schools to be more careful at selecting students, screening many out to improve their scores. \u201cSchools are going to push certain students out,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we want that to happen? It certainly will.\u201d\u201c\u00a0\u2018Gainful employment\u2019 only tries to get at excessive debt that students can\u2019t handle,\u201d Mr. Miller said.An alternative would be to require for-profit schools to meet the same accreditation and quality standards as any other institution of higher education. \u201cI understand why the federal government is using gainful employment as an indicator of success,\u201d said Mr. D\u2019Agati. \u201cBut it might not be the best indicator.\u201dIn any event, advocates for stricter regulation of private, for-profit colleges should recognize there is a trade-off. The United States must satisfy a growing demand for higher education, particularly from low-income students. If for-profit colleges are discouraged from fulfilling it, somebody else has to.Email: eporter@nytimes.com;\nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economists Sound the Alarm on Deflation in Europe", "Date": "2014-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Whether or not Mario Draghi and his European Central Bank colleagues plan to do anything about it at the monthly meeting Thursday, many economists are sounding the alarm. It is time, they say, to act defensively against the danger of deflation.\u201cWe don\u2019t know if we\u2019re in deflation now, but we can\u2019t afford to take the risk,\u201d said Gilles Mo\u00ebc, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in London. \u201cThe problem is that it\u2019s very hard to know when you\u2019re in it, and usually when you do, it\u2019s too late. That\u2019s what Japan found.\u201dThe European Central Bank tries to maintain an inflation rate of just below 2 percent.When it takes hold, deflation \u2014 a decline in the general level of prices \u2014 undermines growth, and lowers corporate earnings and the values of assets like real estate. And in economies burdened by a debt overhang, as much of the euro zone still is, deflation can drive a self-reinforcing downward spiral, in which borrowers are bankrupted by their inability to repay loans on devalued assets.In contrast to inflation, which erodes the real value of loans, making it easier for borrowers to repay, deflation does the opposite. It makes money dearer, raising the burden of repaying existing loans \u2014 and adds to the stress on fragile banks that hold the loans when borrowers cannot repay. The E.C.B., which is undertaking a careful review of banks\u2019 finances in its new role as bank supervisor for Europe, is keenly aware of that danger.The central bank\u2019s Governing Council meets on Thursday with its president, Mr. Draghi.The bank cut its main rate target in November to a historic low of 0.25 percent after inflation for October came in at a record low. But the bank\u2019s ability to use interest rates, the conventional tool for influencing prices, is limited by the fact that nominal interest rates cannot go below zero.The E.C.B., which sets monetary policy for the euro zone, has argued that there are limits to what it can do.By whatever definition, some euro members are experiencing deflation now. Greece and Cyprus have been posting across-the-board price declines, and Portugal, Spain and Ireland are a whisker away from zero. Even in Germany, haunted by the historical hobgoblin of inflation fears, prices rose at an annual rate of just 1.2 percent last month.Mr. Mo\u00ebc said the bank could use \u201ctechnical measures\u201d to increase the amount of cash in the market by as much as 160 billion euros, or $216 billion. Or it could \u201csend a signal\u201d with a small rate cut, perhaps reducing its main rate down to 0.15 percent. He also suggested the E.C.B. could take the extraordinary step of changing the interest rate it pays banks for their excess deposits \u2014 currently at zero \u2014 to minus 0.10 percent. That negative rate, in effect, would force banks to pay the E.C.B. to hold their money.\u201cThat sends the message that \u2018I haven\u2019t reached the limits of interest rate policy,\"\u2019 Mr. Mo\u00ebc said.Negative interest rates, however, have been employed only rarely by central banks, with uneven results. And Mr. Mo\u00ebc noted that with emerging markets currently looking precarious, negative rates could have unforeseen, and potentially destabilizing, consequences for both the euro currency and global markets.Still, Mr. Mo\u00ebc said, taking such measures now would reassure the market that the bank is determined to stave off deflation \u2014 and if necessary would pave the way for a future \u201cquantitative easing\u201d stimulus plan like those that have been employed by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England. In those campaigns, which the Fed has begun \u201ctapering\u201d off, the central banks bought hundreds of billions of dollars worth of bonds to flood the market with liquidity and keep borrowers afloat.Many economists would argue otherwise.Advertisement"}

A given search result will show all available flights, with fare comparisons and a breakdown, by flight segment, of amenities and services on a particular airplane.Mr. Saltzburg said: \u201cCustomers will have transparency while they\u2019re making a booking decision between Flight A and Flight B, which might be the same cost. Are extra-legroom seats available for sale? That\u2019s clearly indicated on the initial results page.\u201dOther information is presented, like seat pitch, flight on-time records, and availability of Wi-Fi and in-seat power ports, as well as seatback video and TV. Search results will also display what Mr. Saltzburg calls \u201ccandid photos\u201d taken by customers on thousands of flights.For many business travelers, the old days of faithfully booking the airline on which the traveler has loyalty status are waning, as airlines around the world put a price tag on many perks \u2014 better (or less-awful) coach seats, upgrades and the like \u2014 that used to be given as awards for mileage-program status. Meanwhile, as airlines have merged and begun sharing more flights through global alliances, the experience of booking an international trip, even on a favored airline, has become more complicated.\u201cWith airline consolidation, customers have more choice of who they can fly, even within their loyalty network, while the value of loyalty programs has been diminishing year over year,\u201d Mr. Saltzburg said. Comparing and evaluating costs and services airline by airline, even airplane by airplane on specific flight segments, can be a real challenge.He added, \u201cWe know which routes which aircraft are assigned to,\u201d on any airline\u2019s scheduled flight (though, of course, airlines occasionally change an aircraft model at the last minute). Those flying in business class, for example, would like to know that a 747-8 on a long international flight might have all flat-bed seats, while another flight might have older-style, less comfortable seats at basically the same price. \u201cThat can be a meaningful decision point\u201d in booking, Mr. Saltzburg said.\u201cFor business-class travelers, is it a flat seat that you\u2019re about to purchase, is it an angled flat, or a cradled business-class seat?\u201d he said. \u201cAll are very different and can be hugely important for that flight you\u2019re going to be taking from Los Angeles to Sydney.\u201dIn all flying classes, legroom and seating comfort are by far the main considerations passengers cite when asked about the most important in-flight amenity, assuming they are given a choice.Incidentally, as the economy improves, more business travelers are flying internationally, and more are flying up front in the expensive seats. \u201cSince the fourth quarter of 2013, business has been really strong on both trans-Atlantic and Asia routes,\u201d said Paul Metselaar, the chief executive of Ovation Corporate Travel, a major agency that does a big business in business-class and first-class bookings. \u201cOur clients across the board are traveling much more globally and much more in general.\u201dClients of a big corporate travel agency like Ovation can depend on experts to manage all details, negotiate prices with airlines and customize their bookings. Business travelers who make their own plans while staring at a screen and trying to sort through the array of choices, however, have long clamored for simplicity and transparency in what is, after all, a shopping experience.TripAdvisor, which was spun off in 2011 by the online booking company Expedia, operates more than a dozen other travel sites. They include SeatGuru.com, which provides diagrams and evaluations of airplane seats and cabin layouts by model of plane and airline. TripAdvisor, which makes its money mostly from advertising, does not book travel. Once a choice is made, the search engine sends the customer to the airline or a global booking site.But it does provide easy-to-see information for making those choices. TripAdvisor, for example, claims more than 100 million user-generated hotel evaluations and other travel reviews.In booking a flight, Mr. Saltzburg said, the revamped Flights feature \u201cwill help consumers understand they can have a very different experience at the same dollar, whether it\u2019s a four-hour flight or a 15-hour one.\u201dEmail: jsharkey@nytimes.com Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Misread Crisis in 2008, Records Show", "Date": "2014-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On the morning after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in 2008, most Federal Reserve officials still believed that the American economy would keep growing despite the metastasizing financial crisis. The Fed\u2019s policy-making committee voted unanimously against bolstering the economy by cutting interest rates, and several officials praised what they described as the decision to let Lehman fail, saying it would help to restore a sense of accountability on Wall Street.James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, urged his colleagues \u201cto wait for some time to assess the impact of the Lehman bankruptcy filing, if any, on the national economy,\u201d according to transcripts of the Fed\u2019s 2008 meetings that it published on Friday.The hundreds of pages of transcripts, based on recordings made at the time, reveal the ignorance of Fed officials about economic conditions during the climactic months of the financial crisis. Officials repeatedly fretted about overstimulating the economy, only to realize time and again that they needed to redouble efforts to contain the crisis.The Fed\u2019s chairman at the time, Ben S. Bernanke, was unusually clearsighted in warning of the risk of a severe recession as the nation entered into a presidential election year. But he struggled to persuade his colleagues, and at crucial junctures he did not push forcefully for stronger action.The Fed\u2019s current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, was even more alarmed by the deterioration of economic conditions. She and Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, are the most forceful and persistent advocates for stronger action in the transcripts. But they, too, underestimated the downturn until the final months of 2008.The transcripts also show, however, that Fed officials responded decisively in those final months, probably preventing an even deeper recession. By the end of 2008, the Fed had reduced short-term interest rates nearly to zero for the first time since the Great Depression, and it had become a primary source of funding not just for the global financial system but for American homeowners and for companies that made food and cars.Ms. Yellen summed up this new ethos at a Fed meeting six weeks after Lehman\u2019s failure, telling colleagues, \u201cGiven the seriousness of the situation, I believe that we should put as much stimulus into the system as we can as soon as we can.\u201dIn normal times, the Fed is a powerful but somnolent institution, charged with keeping a steady hand on the rudder of the economy. It moves interest rates up and down to moderate inflation and minimize unemployment. But beginning in 2007, it was forced to take on a far more challenging role as the central backstop for the global financial system. The Fed\u2019s understanding of the crisis, however, was clouded by its reliance on indicators that tend to miss sharp changes in conditions. The government initially estimated, for example, that the economy expanded in the first half of 2008 because it basically assumed that some economic trends, like the pace of business creation, had continued apace. The Fed also relied on economic models that assumed the existence of smoothly functioning financial markets, limiting its ability to project the consequences of a breakdown. And the outlook of Fed officials also reflected a deeply ingrained bias to worry more about the risk of inflation than the reality of rising unemployment.As Fed officials gathered on Sept. 16 at their marble headquarters in Washington for a previously scheduled meeting, stock markets were in free fall. Housing prices had been collapsing for two years, and unemployment was climbing.On Feb. 22, the Federal Reserve released the transcripts of the 2008 meetings of its Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy. The transcripts provide a detailed account of some of the Fed\u2019s key decisions during that crisis year.Yet most officials did not see clear evidence of a broad crisis. They expected the economy to grow slowly in 2008 and then more quickly in 2009.The transcript for that meeting contains 129 mentions of \u201cinflation\u201d and five of \u201crecession.\u201dMr. Bernanke even told his colleagues that it was clear the economy had entered a downturn but that he still did not favor cutting rates.\u201cI think that our policy is looking actually pretty good,\u201d he said.That optimism would not long endure. Just minutes after the end of that first meeting, a smaller group of Fed officials agreed to rescue the faltering insurance giant the American International Group, a company never before subject to Fed supervision that until then was barely on the government\u2019s radar.In the succeeding weeks, as evidence of a downturn became unmistakable, the Fed would announce a seemingly endless series of programs to buttress the economy, leading Fed officials to joke about the resulting alphabet soup of acronyms.In early October, a few weeks after the decision to stand pat, the Fed convened an unscheduled meeting to cut interest rates in an action coordinated with other major central banks.\u201cIt\u2019s more than obvious that we have an extraordinary situation,\u201d Mr. Bernanke told colleagues.\u201cI should say that this comes as a surprise to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI very much expected that we could stay at 2 percent for a long time, and then when the economy began to recover, we could begin to normalize interest rates. But clearly things have gone off in a direction that is quite worrisome.\u201dHe closed on a prescient note, telling the committee that he did not expect that monetary policy could solve the problem, but that the Fed should not be hesitant to use the tools that it had.By the end of the year, the Fed had cut interest rates nearly to zero and started to buy mortgage bonds in a further effort to stimulate the housing market and the broader economy. More than five years later, it is still pursuing both policies even as the economic recovery remains incomplete.Some Fed officials have argued that the Fed was blind in 2008 because it relied, like everyone else, on a standard set of economic indicators. As late as August 2008, \u201cthere were no clear signs that many financial firms were about to fail catastrophically,\u201d Mr. Bullard said in a November presentation in Arkansas that the St. Louis Fed recirculated on Friday. \u201cThere was a reasonable case that the U.S. could continue to \u2018muddle through.\u2019\u00a0\u201dWithin weeks, Mr. Bernanke also began to insist that the failure of Lehman could not have been prevented without changes in federal law. Furthermore, some officials began to argue that the importance of the failure had been overstated because the economy was already falling apart.\u201cThe whole framing, which seems to have hardened now, that the world ended with the Lehman bankruptcy is just deeply unfair to the basic truth,\u201d Timothy F. Geithner, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said at an October meeting. \u201cIndependent of whether there was an option available at the time, the erosion in underlying economic conditions and in confidence in the future outlook was powerful and substantial going into August and early September.\u201dMr. Bernanke hoped to delay any action until the first scheduled meeting of 2008 in late January, but over the three-day Martin Luther King weekend, he concluded that the Fed could not wait. He convened a conference call at 6 p.m. on Monday, Jan. 21, and won agreement to cut the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate 0.75 percentage point, the largest cut in more than two decades.\u201cThe risk of a severe recession and credit crisis is unacceptably high,\u201d Ms. Yellen said at the meeting.Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said this week that the decision was an awakening. \u201cIf maybe we were a little slow to recognize what was happening, Martin Luther King weekend in January 2008 was a decisive point in terms of interest rate policy,\u201d he said.By early March, the Fed was moving to replace investors as a source of funding for Wall Street.Financial firms, particularly in the mortgage business, were beginning to fail because they could not borrow money. Investors had lost confidence in their ability to predict which loans would be repaid. Countrywide Financial, the nation\u2019s largest mortgage lender, sold itself for a relative pittance to Bank of America. Bear Stearns, one of the largest packagers and sellers of mortgage-backed securities, was teetering toward collapse.On March 7, the Fed offered companies up to $200 billion in funding. Three days later, Mr. Bernanke secured the Fed policy-making committee\u2019s approval to double that amount to $400 billion, telling his colleagues, \u201cWe live in a very special time.\u201d Finally, on March 16, the Fed effectively removed any limit on Wall Street funding even as it arranged the Bear Stearns rescue.And then the Fed paused. By the end of April, it had cut short-term rates to 2 percent from 5.25 percent the previous September \u2014 one of the fastest falls in Fed history \u2014 and officials said they had done enough to shore up the financial system. They predicted that the economy would narrowly avoid a recession.\u201cI think it is very possible that we will look back and say, particularly after the Bear Stearns episode, that we have turned the corner in terms of the financial disruption that we have just experienced,\u201d Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed governor, said during a meeting at the end of April.The summer passed relatively quietly. Officials began to fret about inflation. The transcripts include long conversations about when the Fed should start to raise interest rates.\u201cWe saw growth of about 2 percent in the second quarter, which suggests a campaign slogan for the Republicans, \u2018The Economy: It Could Be Worse,\u201d Mr. Bernanke joked in early August.But it was only the eye of the storm. By the third week of September, it was clear that Mr. Bernanke was right: Things could be worse. The financial crisis had arrived, as Ernest Hemingway once wrote of bankruptcy, \u201cGradually and then suddenly.\u201dA headline with an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the situation that Federal Reserve policy makers misjudged in 2008.

{"Headline": "El Salvador and Costa Rica Hold Presidential Elections", "Date": "2014-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Two Central American countries, El Salvador and Costa Rica, put incumbent parties to the test on Sunday in what were expected to be closely fought presidential elections that focused less on ideology than on unease over unemployment, corruption and crime.In both countries, left-leaning candidates either led or surged in late polls, but analysts saw the campaigns more as referendums on the status quo. The front-runners were seeking pluralities large enough to avoid runoffs in the spring.The F.M.L.N. candidate, Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n, a former guerrilla commander, is the vice president and has promised to expand welfare programs and benefits put in place by President Mauricio Funes, who sought a more moderate stance for the party and could not run again because of term limits.Mr. S\u00e1nchez, whom some conservative politicians in the United States view with alarm because of his guerrilla background, has also promised to rise above partisanship and work with political opponents. Early results showed him nearly 10 percentage points ahead of his nearest competitor, but below the threshold to avoid a runoff.Conservatives in El Salvador \u201cno longer say Venezuela or Cuba are going to rule El Salvador, like they said five years ago,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Maria Tojeira, a former rector at the Universidad Centroamericana who closely follows Salvadoran politics. \u201cThe fear of ideological extremism has ended.\u201dMr. S\u00e1nchez faced a strong challenge from Norman Quijano, a former mayor of San Salvador and the candidate of the right-leaning Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, who was in second place in the early results.But Arena has been hurt by a corruption investigation of former President Francisco Flores, who was Mr. Quijano\u2019s campaign chief until Thursday. And on the eve of the election, Mr. Funes announced that another top Quijano adviser was wanted by Interpol in a sex-crime investigation in Panama. Those controversies could help a distant-third candidate, Antonio Saca, who was president from 2004 to 2009.\u201cThe most important thing for the Salvadoran people right now is security,\u201d said Luis Gonzalez, 58, a federal worker who said he had voted for Mr. Saca. \u201cPeople are dying indiscriminately from such a big wave of violence.\u201dIn Costa Rica, Johnny Araya \u2014 a former mayor of San Jose, the capital, and the candidate of the incumbent, centrist National Liberation Party \u2014 fought a surge in polls by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Villalta, a young left-leaning lawmaker who capitalized on voters\u2019 anger about unemployment, crime and corruption scandals that have put President Laura Chinchilla\u2019s approval ratings among the lowest in Latin America.But in early results, Mr. Araya was neck and neck with another centrist, Luis Guillermo Sol\u00eds of the Citizens\u2019 Action Party, a political newcomer who served in National Liberation governments and campaigned largely on fighting corruption and shoring up the government social security system.Mr. Araya and Mr. Sol\u00eds each had about 30 percent of the vote. Mr. Villalta, of the Broad Front party, trailed with 17 percent.Thirteen candidates were running, with four top contenders: Mr. Araya, Mr. Sol\u00eds, Mr. Villalta and another left-leaning candidate, Otto Guevara of the Libertarian Movement Party. The wide field was a sign of the fragmentation of parties and ideologies in Costa Rica, said Kevin Casas-Zamora, a former vice president who is now political secretary at the Organization of American States. Even in the final hours, many voters were undecided.\u201cParty loyalty has all but dissolved,\u201d Mr. Casas-Zamora said. \u201cThe feeling is there is a desire to reject the status quo, less of a commitment to ideology.\u201dMr. Villalta had appeared to gain strength in the past several months, rising from a dark horse to a top contender, with promises to tackle inequality in a nation where the economy is growing but many people remain unemployed or underemployed.In an environmentally conscious nation, Mr. Villalta made Mr. Mora\u2019s death a campaign issue. But his opponents sought to tarnish him by pointing out his party\u2019s roots in communist ideology, and Mr. Casas-Zamora and other analysts suggested that Mr. Sol\u00eds might appeal to voters dissatisfied with the government but not ready to turn to the left.Mr. Araya tried to distance himself from the Chinchilla administration and said he would be best suited to tackling the public debt, including, if necessary, by imposing new taxes.No matter who wins, the political splintering will make it hard to get laws through a legislature where no party has a majority, said Bruce Wilson, a professor at the University of Central Florida who studies Costa Rican politics.\u201cThat is an even bigger mess,\u201d he said. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a mass mandate, from the polling data. If Congress is so fractious, to get your agenda through will be very difficult.\u201dGene Palumbo contributed reporting from San Salvador.Advertisement"}

But its efforts have gotten nowhere in a legislature dominated by Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s governing Party of Regions.Ms. Ashton, who has made repeated trips to Kiev since November, met with Mr. Yanukovych and opposition leaders during her current visit but seems to have made little headway in easing the stalemate. At the news conference, she spoke of frustration with the political paralysis: \u201cWhat I really need to feel is a growing sense of momentum on this. I think that that is where we need to see more work.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But when the new site finally glimmered on screen last month, Mr. Springer didn\u2019t celebrate with a team of programmers in Lower Manhattan\u2019s Silicon Alley, the city\u2019s hot tech corridor. He savored the moment alone at a desk in his studio apartment in Sunnyside, Queens, just nine paces from the kitchen where he blends the spinach-avocado smoothies that power him through his solitary workdays.He is 32 and a member of New York City\u2019s growing tribe of independent contractors and freelancers who are hoping to transform hardship into opportunity on the sidelines of the nation\u2019s traditional 9-to-5 economy.Like many other millennials, Mr. Springer chose his path after being slammed by the Great Recession and the sluggish economic recovery that has followed. Since leaving college in 2005, he has been laid off twice, most recently in 2011. Last year, after the unemployment checks finally ran out, he set out on his own as a website developer and social media consultant.\u201cIt\u2019s great, it\u2019s scary, it\u2019s worrisome, it\u2019s stressful, it\u2019s exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s every extreme adjective I can think of.

Last Monday, for instance, found Mr. Springer cross-legged at a 9 a.m. class titled \u201cBeginning Mindfulness Meditation for Freelancers\u201d in Brooklyn, prone at an 11 a.m. acupuncture session in Queens and in full-fledged business mode for a 1 p.m. meeting with a client in Midtown Manhattan.But whether this \u201cgig economy\u201d will truly benefit men and women like Mr. Springer remains uncertain. Twenty-nine percent of the union\u2019s New York City members earn less than $25,000 a year, statistics show. In 2010, 12 percent of members nationally received some form of public assistance.Even Mr. Springer, who embraces his new life, has teetered on the edge. On the day that he celebrated the website launch, he was behind on his utility bills and student loans because three of his clients hadn\u2019t paid him on time.All told, he earned $15,000 in 2013, his first full year as a freelancer, so little that he qualified for Medicaid. By contrast, his last full-time job paid $50,000 a year and offered health benefits, vacation pay and a retirement plan.\u201cThe biggest reason I wake up at night or have trouble falling asleep is financial stress,\u201d said Mr. Springer, who lives with his girlfriend, who helps pay the rent.His mother, Sheri Springer, wonders what the future holds for him and other 30-somethings who are piecing together part-time jobs because full-time work is so hard to find.

{"Headline": "Memories of Chile", "Date": "2014-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 A little over a quarter-century ago, when Gen. Augusto Pinochet ruled Chile with an iron fist, a few fellow correspondents and I decided to go down to the port of Valparaiso for a fish lunch washed down with Sauvignon Blanc. It was Sunday. The sun was shining. Nothing would happen. Over the boozy meal we joked that Pinochet would no doubt choose that day to get assassinated.Of course, he almost did.That afternoon leftist guerrillas opened fire on Pinochet\u2019s armor-plated Mercedes as he drove toward Santiago. Five of his bodyguards were killed in the Sept. 7, 1986, ambush. The general only escaped because a rocket failed to explode. Instead of a lazy Sunday afternoon we had to scramble back to Santiago and scramble to clear our heads.The ensuing clampdown was vicious even by Pinochet\u2019s standards. A state of siege was declared. The military poured through city shanties, throwing victims into the backs of unmarked pickup trucks. Throat-wrenching tear gas spewed from police vans. Santiago was a terrifying city, soldiers in camouflage with fidgety fingers lurking behind trees on the banks of the Mapocho.I ran into a slum kid called Alfredo Diaz whose plight I described in The Wall Street Journal: \u201cHe has very little hair. This month, soldiers slashed off most of it, then stuffed it in his mouth. His wrists are dotted with circular burn marks. The soldiers stubbed out their cigarettes on him. His face is cut and his eyes are restless with fear. They finished by dumping him naked in a pond.\u201dDiaz survived, unlike the more than 3,000 killed or disappeared under Pinochet between the 1973 coup that toppled the socialist government of Salvador Allende and the return of democracy in 1990. More than 38,000 people were imprisoned or tortured. Chile was a brutal epicenter of the surrogate struggles of the Cold War. That scary September and, two years later, the irrepressible joy of the opposition victory in a plebiscite that brought down the curtain on Pinochet\u2019s rule marked me.But you forget. The drama moves on. Nations change history \u2014 Chile, Poland or Bosnia \u2014 and then subside into a relative normalcy that no longer commands attention. Back in Chile for the first time in many years, I find Santiago doing its best to be like other cities: the global wrap, the global muffin, the global high-rise, the global Irish Pub, global sushi, global malls, global brands, global coffee shops and the global ATM. I can reproach it for none of this. Better a latte in the late-afternoon sunlight than a knife at your throat in the dusk. Chileans are free. Theirs, on the whole, is a conspicuous success story in a continent still riven by ideological divides, but no longer murderous ones, a better South America than I knew.What strikes me is how much time is needed for judgment \u2014 and how inadequate judgment is. Pinochet, initially backed by the United States, was a brutal, corrupt dictator never sentenced for his crimes. He inflicted agony on many compatriots; the father of President-elect Michelle Bachelet was tortured and died in detention. Yet Pinochet\u2019s legacy is still controversial, battled over between left and right.His success in transforming the Chilean economy (I recall interviewing his youthful \u201cChicago Boys\u201d and being struck by the intensity of their drive to privatize and modernize) provided the basis for export growth, free trade, an independent central bank and a limited state sector \u2014 achievements a democratic Chile has been able to build on to become the most prosperous country in the region.Nothing can excuse what Pinochet did. He murdered the innocent. He pocketed bribes while invoking the honor of the soldier and the patriot. It took a very long time to escape his shadow, but when it did Chile was ready for the responsibilities of democracy: It had the education levels, the economic foundations and the buried traditions of pluralism to move forward, once the Cold War ended.That September day is long gone. I could not have imagined this Chile then. The tides of social change are unimaginably slow beneath the rat-tat-tat of connectivity.A quarter-century after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Ukrainians die in a brutal clampdown involving another clash between authoritarian and democratic visions of a country\u2019s future \u2014 a surrogate battle-redux between Moscow\u2019s sphere and Washington\u2019s. The people of Ukraine, like the people of Chile, should be free to choose their future. The Russian imperium can no longer draw lines across Europe.In Egypt, perhaps Field Marshal Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi will turn out to be a brutal modernizer in the Pinochet mode who will bequeath a nation that proves capable of sustained democracy. Perhaps, like Latin America over the past three decades, the Middle East will escape its destructive cycles. That, however, is a long shot \u2014 and judgment will have to wait until about 2040.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some See Biden\u2019s \u2018Third World\u2019 Description of La Guardia as Too Kind", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe indignities of modern air travel are legion.From the cramped cabins and stale air to the interminable security lines where, along with their liquids, travelers surrender a little bit of their soul with each pat-down, the joy of jet-setting has departed long ago.But in some places, the airport itself can provide refuge.In Hong Kong, travelers can play a round of golf while waiting for a connecting flight. In Seoul, South Korea, people can strap on skates and kill time on the ice at the Sky Rink. And in Paris, parents are provided with free strollers as they cruise newly upgraded terminals.As the crowd laughed, he added: \u201cI\u2019m not joking.\u201dMr. Biden\u2019s comments on Thursday in Philadelphia might be perceived as insulting or funny, if they did not have an element of truth. \u201cI agree with him,\u201d said Patrick J. Foye, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the region\u2019s major airports. For the past decade, Mr. Foye said, the Port Authority had devoted much of its time and billions of dollars to rebuilding the World Trade Center complex. But it is now finally able to turn its attention to the airports \u2014 something that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said was long overdue.Many countries in Asia and the Middle East have already been engaged in an arms race of sorts, according to people who have studied the industry, building better and bigger airports as they vie to become essential travel hubs that will draw flights, as well as investment and visitors. Even countries that could be considered third world have recently invested in their airports as a way to lift their economies.A quick survey by the Global Gateway Alliance, at the request of The New York Times, found that many airports in less-developed nations offer amenities that La Guardia does not. Grantley Adams International Airport in Barbados has free Wi-Fi, a post office and fast-track service through customs. Jorge Chavez International Airport in Peru has a hotel, spa and post office on site, and is undergoing a major expansion. The international airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, has a children\u2019s play area and free Internet access, but also offers \u201cExpress Rail\u201d train service to the city center in under 28 minutes. There are, undoubtedly, places in the world that would be worse to land than La Guardia. But Cindy Josseran, a legal assistant at the International Criminal Court, said that while some African airports may lack some of the comforts of more developed countries, they had their own advantages.\u201cAt least in Liberia, people wait for you outside in group singing and dancing,\u201d she said. \u201cThat definitely won\u2019t happen in New York.\u201dDespite the chorus of people criticizing La Guardia, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Mr. Biden\u2019s comments were \u201cinappropriate,\u201d saying that while the airport needs \u201can upgrade,\u201d \u201cas a proud New Yorker, I didn\u2019t like that comment and I think it was not the right way to talk about it.\u201d A centerpiece of the improvement plans at La Guardia will be the replacement of its aging central terminal with a modern 35-gate, 1.3-million-square-foot building that will be able to handle 17.5 million passengers by the time it is scheduled to open in 2021. The projected cost is $3.6 billion. Advocates for travelers are pushing for improvements that would be faster to introduce, like free Wi-Fi and better amenities at the terminals. Getting to the airport is another area that could stand improvement; there is no train to La Guardia, and the only public transportation to the airport is by bus.On Friday, a trip on the M60 bus from 106th Street and Broadway to La Guardia took nearly 90 minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s a hassle,\u201d said Katrina Amara, 44, who lives on the Upper East Side. \u201cBut the cabs are so expensive.\u201d Another bus rider, Nina Sudarsan, 25, a Columbia law student, said Mr. Biden\u2019s comments have been widely discussed among her friends on Facebook, most in agreement.\u201cHaving been in and out of third world airports, I think Joe Biden is being unfair to them,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery other airport beats it out. They are more modern, nice seats, windows, nicer eating places. This is not somewhere you want to be stranded.\u201dEdna Ishayik contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Has either of you opened the other up to different kinds of book or favorite authors?\u00a0I don\u2019t read enough nonfiction, and David tends to read fiction as homework for new projects. (A bunch of books about the Spanish Civil War and the Abraham Lincoln Brigade showed up in the house recently.) But David\u2019s reading more novels by women, and I\u2019ve started Sheri Fink\u2019s \u201cFive Days at Memorial.\u201dBoth of you are former journalists. How has that experience affected your sense of story? To what extent do your novels arise from the reporting you did at The San Antonio Light and The Baltimore Sun?\u00a0In my newspaper days, your endings could be literally sliced off in the composing room, so it was dangerous to get attached to them. Yet I think this has made me work harder on endings in fiction. Twenty years as a reporter left me with a healthy but not obsessive desire to get things right, as did Mary McCarthy\u2019s \u201cThe Fact in Fiction,\u201d a seminal essay for me. It also left me with a real distaste for anyone who fabricates, or passes off nonfiction as fiction, and yes, I\u2019m sorry but that includes David Foster Wallace.Sell us on your favorite overlooked or underappreciated writer.\u00a0Edward Eager wrote a series of children\u2019s books that are in danger of being forgotten. But they\u2019re divine, stories about ordinary kids who stumble on magical things \u2014 a coin, a lake, a book, a thyme garden, a well. The magic changes them, they try to change the magic, the magic moves on. Great female characters, too \u2014 strong, smart, capable, not killjoys. \u201cHalf Magic\u201d is his masterpiece, but I have a soft spot for \u201cKnight\u2019s Castle,\u201d which is set in Baltimore.What kinds of stories are you drawn to? And how would you describe the kinds of books you steer clear of?\u00a0I like books steeped in the quotidian \u2014 details about work and place. You can learn how to run a chicken-and-waffle restaurant by reading \u201cMildred Pierce.\u201d And I like fiction about money. I wish there were more novels inspired by the economy, from the micro (Jess Walter\u2019s \u201cThe Financial Lives of the Poets\u201d and Eliot Perlman\u2019s \u201cThree Dollars\u201d) to the macro (John Lanchester\u2019s \u201cCapital,\u201d Adam Haslett\u2019s \u201cUnion Atlantic\u201d). I am leery of writers who are too in love with their protagonists and assemble choruses of secondary characters to sing their praises. She\u2019s so beautiful! She\u2019s so smart! Nancy Drew is a prime example, but it happens in literary fiction too.Which books might we be surprised to find on your bookshelves?\u00a0For someone who\u2019s skeptical of memory, I read a lot of memoirs. But I prefer memoir in audio format. The best readers aren\u2019t necessarily professional performers, although I love everything Julia Sweeney has done and Simon Pegg\u2019s \u201cNerd Do Well\u201d is outstanding, one of a kind. Bill Bryson is my favorite among all audio readers; I always buy his books in multiple formats. I also have a shelf dedicated to the bonkbusters written by my friend Rebecca Chance. They\u2019re delectable. Plus, I like to say \u201cbonkbuster\u201d whenever the opportunity presents itself.Do you have a favorite poem?If we agree that Stephen Sondheim is a poet, then I pick \u201cSomeone in a Tree,\u201d which encompasses all my favorite subjects \u2014 perspective, memory, who gets to tell the story. My more traditional pick would be W.\u2009H. Auden\u2019s \u201cIn Memory of W.\u2009B. Yeats,\u201d particularly for the lines about poetry flowing past the places \u201cwhere executives would never want to tamper. .\u2008.\u2008. ranches of isolation .\u2008.\u2008. raw towns.\u201d I covered poverty for The Baltimore Sun for a long time, and there was definitely a raw town vibe to that beat.\u00a0A favorite love story?\u00a0Ruth McKenney\u2019s \u201cLove Story.\u201d McKenney is remembered for the \u201cMy Sister Eileen\u201d stories, but this is about her marriage to Richard Bransten. It has a terribly sad coda, however. Her husband killed himself on her 44th birthday, and she never wrote again. Given that Eileen had died in a car crash with her husband, Nathanael West \u2014 well, McKenney had more than her share of tragedy. Yet, despite knowing all of this, I find \u201cLove Story\u201d heartening. I\u2019ve just found out that Christina Stead has a posthumous novel based on McKenney and Bransten, and I\u2019m dreading reading it but probably will.\u00a0A favorite novel?\u00a0\u201cLolita.\u201d I read it when I was 12. Not that I was a prodigy. I was a kid obsessed with dirty books, and I had inferred from a Jean Kerr piece, a parody of \u201cCan This Marriage Be Saved?,\u201d that \u201cLolita\u201d was really dirty. I read \u201cLolita\u201d over and over, trying to find the dirty parts. Rereading \u201cLolita\u201d became an annual tradition for me. In the annotated version, Alfred Appel \u2014 I took his class at Northwestern University \u2014 seemed to think that Nabokov was mocking the detective novel with his precise clues about Lolita\u2019s abductor, but I yearn to believe Nabokov admired Poe. And I love, love, love how Clare Quilty\u2019s name slides right past Humbert in Mona Dahl\u2019s letter. Um, spoiler alert.\u00a0What were your favorite childhood books?\u00a0The Betsy-Tacy books were essential to me. Beverly Cleary\u2019s Ramona Quimby is a great achievement, a character for the ages. Elizabeth Enright; Irene Hunt; E.\u2009L. Konigsburg; Zilpha Keatley Snyder; Sydney Taylor\u2019s All-of-a-Kind Family books; Lenora Mattingly Weber\u2019s Beany Malone books; Eleanor Estes, \u201cThe Hundred Dresses\u201d in particular. The \u201cShoe\u201d books. \u201cThe Great Brain.\u201d And as the mother of a 3-year-old to whom I read nightly, I just want to say \u2014 my daughter has horrible taste in books. Horrible.\u00a0What was the last book that made you laugh?\u201cCivilWarLand in Bad Decline.\u201d I\u2019m late to George Saunders. I\u2019m often late.\u00a0The last book that made you cry?\u00a0\u201cCivilWarLand in Bad Decline.\u201d\u00a0The last book that grabbed you to the point you found yourself telling others, \u201cYou must read this book\u201d?\u00a0\u201cWhatever Happened to Baby Jane?\u201d The film is quite true to it, but the book is even better.\u00a0If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?\u00a0I\u2019d give him a list of academic novels from which to choose \u2014 David Lodge\u2019s \u201cNice Work\u201d; Michael Chabon\u2019s \u201cWonder Boys\u201d; A.\u2009S. Byatt\u2019s \u201cPossession\u201d; Jane Smiley\u2019s \u201cMoo\u201d; Richard Russo\u2019s \u201cStraight Man\u201d; Francine Prose\u2019s \u201cBlue Angel.\u201d It\u2019s been said politics is meanest where the stakes are smallest, but it seems to me that politics has gotten pretty mean at the top. So perhaps one of these books could prove instructive.What does your personal book collection look like? Do you organize your books in any particular way?\u00a0I\u2019m a librarian\u2019s daughter. I know the Dewey Decimal System, and I am familiar with the Library of Congress classification system because it\u2019s used by Baltimore\u2019s public library, the Enoch Pratt. My fiction is alphabetized by author, divided between adult and children\u2019s literature, hardcover and paperback. I let my husband organize the nonfiction. It breaks my heart, but I let him.\u00a0Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel you were supposed to like, and didn\u2019t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?I put books down all the time and am often out of step with mainstream opinion. I stopped reading one beloved book on the penultimate page because I didn\u2019t want to reward the writer by caring enough to finish. And there\u2019s one admired writer, a Man Booker winner, who has lured me into three books, all of which made me insane with anger. Beautiful beginnings, then he punts the ending every time. It\u2019s as if a strong, credible ending makes him feel dirty in some way. But I don\u2019t name names. You could say I\u2019m a wimp, but I prefer to steal a line from Kathy Griffin: \u201cI talk about people behind their backs. It\u2019s called manners.\u201d\u00a0What books are you embarrassed not to have read yet?\u00a0There\u2019s so much. There\u2019s so much that I\u2019m beyond embarrassment. I should hang a sign around my neck that says, \u201cOops, majored in journalism.\u201d Maybe I\u2019ll go back to college with my daughter when she heads there in 14 years, take a degree in literature. And won\u2019t she love that?\u00a0What book are you most eagerly anticipating in 2014?\u00a0\u201cThe Fever,\u201d by Megan Abbott. Megan is a friend, but I was a fan first. With each novel, she creates a fresh voice, a voice integral not just to the characters, but to the milieu. The druggy dreamscape of \u201cBury Me Deep,\u201d the rat-a-tat \u201cSweet Smell of Success\u201d rhythms in \u201cThe Song Is You,\u201d the coiled gymnastic energy of \u201cDare Me\u201d \u2014 I can\u2019t wait to see what she does with a town full of girls suffering from the same mysterious affliction.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.O.P., Though Deeply Split, Has Election Edge, Poll Shows", "Date": "2014-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublicans are in a stronger position than Democrats for this year\u2019s midterm elections, benefiting from the support of self-described independents, even though the party itself is deeply divided and most Americans agree more with Democratic policy positions, the latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows.The independents in the poll \u2014 a majority of whom were white or male or under age 45 \u2014 continued to sour on President Obama\u2019s job performance. Republicans hold their edge despite the fissures in their party over whether it is too conservative or not conservative enough, and many are discouraged about the party\u2019s future.Democrats, in turn, are more optimistic and relatively united. Nonetheless, they, too, are held in low regard over all by a public fed up with Washington\u2019s failure to compromise, and they have failed so far to energize a broader segment of the population.A majority of Americans surveyed also said they wanted both parties to do more to address the concerns of the middle class, reduce the budget deficit with both tax increases and spending cuts, and let illegal immigrants stay in the country and apply for citizenship. Mr. Obama shares those positions on the budget and immigration.Those stances among voters have not translated into support for the president\u2019s party, as 42 percent say they will back Republicans in November, and 39 percent indicate that they will back Democrats, a difference within the poll\u2019s margin of sampling error.There is a sense of foreboding in the public as well, with 63 percent of Americans saying the country is on the wrong track, and 57 percent indicating that they disapprove of Mr. Obama\u2019s handling of the economy. In addition, eight in 10 Americans are dissatisfied or angry with how things are going in Washington.How do the Republicans and the Democrats differ? How are they similar? The New York Times and CBS News asked Americans for their views on various issues, their attitudes toward the parties and their opinion of a number of possible presidential candidates.At least one Republican leader is faring far worse in the public mind than Mr. Obama. Speaker John A. Boehner had an approval rating in the poll of just 26 percent. More notable, perhaps, was that it was just a bit higher, 33 percent, among Republicans.The nationwide poll was conducted Feb. 19 to 23 by landline and cellphone among 1,644 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for all adults and plus or minus 6 points for Republicans, Democrats and independents. The survey comes more than eight months before Election Day, and less than a quarter of those who responded said they were paying a lot of attention to the 2014 election, meaning that each party has ample opportunity to sway voters.One issue, though \u2014 the Affordable Care Act \u2014 seems to have solidified some opposition to Democrats, and historical trends such as an older, whiter midterm electorate are also favorable to Republicans.\u201cIt seems all the Democrats are for Obamacare, and I think this is a really bad deal,\u201d Larry Walker, an independent voter from Torrance, Calif., said in a follow-up interview.Mr. Obama\u2019s approval rating is now at 41 percent, with 51 percent of Americans saying they disapprove of his performance, his worst standing in the past two years, with the exception of a CBS News survey last November in the midst of the troubled rollout of the new health care law. Such ratings amount to an early political alarm for Democrats on the ballot this year. When a party controls the White House, its performance in midterm congressional elections typically tracks closely to the popularity of the sitting president in the fall.But while the 2014 outlook is challenging for the Democratic Party, whose voters traditionally turn out in lower numbers in years without presidential elections, the Republican Party is contending with more profound structural challenges. Forty-two percent of Republicans said they were \u201cmostly discouraged\u201d about the future of their party, and among Tea Party supporters, that number was 51 percent.Further, Republican lawmakers appear out of step with the public on a range of issues, according to the survey. On immigration, same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization and gun control, Republican lawmakers hold to the minority position. Some of these policy matters illuminate the party\u2019s internal divisions. Half of people under age 45 who lean Republican support legalizing marijuana, and a majority of the same cohort of Republicans also backs same-sex marriage.Over all, Republican support for same-sex marriage is on the rise. In the fall of 2012, just 24 percent of Republicans backed legalizing the unions; now 40 percent of Republicans do so.\u201cWhy is gay marriage being decided by political parties?\u201d asked Chip Myers, a Republican and a self-described \u201cfederalist\u201d from Harpers Ferry, W.Va. \u201cAnd abortion is a person\u2019s right to decide.\u201dBut other Republicans are angry at their party for not being conservative enough on critical issues. \u201cOur schools are overrun with immigrant children,\u201d said Betty Worley, a Republican from Charlotte, N.C. \u201cThere are people coming over every day, and they should put a stop to it.\u201dRepublican legislators are also in the minority of public opinion on matters related to the economy. Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe that the distribution of wealth should be more equitable, and most, regardless of party affiliation, think that any plan to reduce the federal budget deficit should include both tax increases and spending cuts.Two-thirds of the public favors raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour from $7.25, an issue Democrats are seizing on. As for the Affordable Care Act \u2014 opposition to which forms the centerpiece of many Republican campaigns this year \u2014 half of Americans think that there are some good things in the law, but that some changes are needed to make it work better, while 42 percent say it needs to be repealed.When asked about the 2016 presidential race, more than eight in 10 Democrats say they want Hillary Rodham Clinton to run, showing a level of interest in her that no other potential candidates \u2014 Democrat or Republican \u2014 come close to matching among their party\u2019s voters.Drawing the most interest after Mrs. Clinton are Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, a Republican; and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. For all of them, about 40 percent of self-identified members of their party said they hoped the men would run. As for Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who many had once thought to be a Republican favorite, more in his party say they do not want him to seek the presidency (41 percent) than say they do (31 percent).Allison Kopicki, Dalia Sussman and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tempering Oil Dependence", "Date": "2014-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsWASHINGTON \u2014 When we graduated from the Naval Academy in 1968, the American economic engine was powered by a domestic oil industry in the midst of a boom: American production accounted for one-quarter of the global total. Texas, rather than Saudi Arabia, was the world\u2019s swing producer, and the United States had handled the 1967 Arab oil embargo by increasing production, keeping markets stable.Times were about to change. Five years after our graduation, with its oil fields producing at full capacity, America found itself utterly unprepared for another oil embargo. This one, orchestrated by the Arab members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel, delivered an economic shock that set off nearly a decade of financial turmoil, geopolitical uncertainty and damaging volatility in the global oil market.Today, the 1973 oil embargo is often remembered as a crisis caused by America\u2019s over-reliance on imported oil. Crude imports almost tripled between 1970 and 1973, to reach nearly 30 percent of supplies. This did leave the country vulnerable to supply shocks \u2014 and our political leadership conveyed the idea that what America needed, above all, was \u201cindependence\u201d from foreign producers. This analysis was simply wrong. The key to America\u2019s crisis in 1973 was our dangerous dependence on oil to power the economy, particularly transportation \u2014 and not on our dependence on overseas suppliers per se. At the time of the embargo, petroleum fuels accounted for 96 percent of the energy consumed by our cars, trucks, ships and aircraft. Consumers and businesses that depended on oil to power their transportation had no choice but to pay more at the pump, or travel less. It was that vulnerability that put us at the mercy of the global oil market and actors like OPEC.What our leaders in 1973 failed to comprehend or communicate was that no matter how much oil the United States might produce, merely being a large producer would not confer immunity from global oil market volatility. For proof, look no farther than countries like Canada and Norway, which are net oil exporters but whose consumers face the same oil-price volatility as Americans.Today, America\u2019s energy landscape again appears abundant. Improved production technologies have unlocked vast sources of domestic oil. American crude production is projected to approach a historical record as soon as 2015, and net liquid fuel imports are expected to account for less than 30 percent of American oil supplies this year, down from nearly 60 percent in 2008. This dramatic turnaround has led many to suggest that the era of oil insecurity is over.Don\u2019t be fooled: Despite advances in energy and automotive technologies, we remain as vulnerable as ever. Since 1973, our transportation sector\u2019s reliance on oil has dropped by just 3 percent, to 93 percent from 96 percent. Unless we act, 90 percent of our transportation will remain oil-dependent through 2030, according to the Department of Energy. And we must expect interruptions to global oil supplies, oil-price spikes and market manipulation by OPEC.If America is to remain prosperous and secure in the 21st century, we must make significant progress toward ending our oil dependence. Improvements in fuel economy are a valuable move in the right direction, and President Obama\u2019s announcement of tougher rules for trucks last week should be applauded. But efficiency alone is not enough. We need fuel diversity in the transportation sector to shield our economy from swings in global oil prices. Our objective should be to reduce the role of oil in transportation to 50 percent within the next 25 years. We can accomplish this through more deployment of fuels like electricity and natural gas, which are domestic, plentiful and not subject to the kinds of anticompetitive forces that manipulate the global oil market. To measure progress, we should establish an interim goal of 75 percent by 2030. This ambitious but achievable target would provide the American economy with a crucial degree of insurance against future oil-price spikes, while supporting economic growth and a healthy balance of trade. We propose a three-pronged strategy.First, the federal government should double research and development spending on advanced transportation fuels and automotive technologies. The increased funds would accelerate the technological developments needed to make critical components like automotive batteries and natural-gas storage tanks more economically competitive in the future. Second, public-private partnerships designed to deploy alternative fuels must be fostered. To get cars and trucks powered by natural gas and electricity will require a coordinated rollout of infrastructure and regulatory policy involving a variety of stakeholders, from cities and utilities to automakers. A key first step would be to build a natural gas refueling network for heavy-duty trucks. Finally, these initiatives should be funded by the revenues from increased domestic oil production in order to minimize their effect on the federal debt. Over the past year, lawmakers from both political parties have proposed the establishment of an Energy Security Trust Fund to invest in research in future technologies. The concept of using oil revenues to fund energy security deserves support.Our decades of military and government experience have taught us that it\u2019s best to take difficult action from a position of strength. This period of energy abundance presents an opportunity for America to achieve lasting energy security. It is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Minimum Wage Increase Would Have Mixed Effects, C.B.O. Report Says", "Date": "2014-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A popular Democratic proposal to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, championed by President Obama, could reduce total employment by 500,000 workers by the second half of 2016. But it would also lift 900,000 families out of poverty and increase the incomes of 16.5 million low-wage workers in an average week.The nuanced analysis provided instant fuel for both supporters and critics of raising the federal minimum wage, a policy heavily favored by Democrats but viewed skeptically by Republicans in Congress. Republicans contended the policy would be a job-killer, while Democrats asserted it would help alleviate poverty. Economists said both might be right. And the White House, in an unusual twist, openly disputed the budget office\u2019s math.Jason Furman, the chairman of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said that the office\u2019s estimate of the potential lost jobs might be too high. In a call with reporters, Mr. Furman said that finding no jobs effect at all would be a \u201cperfectly reasonable estimate.\u201dThe analysis does not reflect \u201cthe consensus view of economists,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, you have to have respectful disagreement.\u201dBut the report was embraced by leading Republicans, who have opposed the legislation despite its widespread popularity in public opinion polls. \u201cRaising the minimum wage could destroy as many as one million jobs, a devastating blow to the very people that need help most in this economy,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader. \u201cIf and when Democrats try to push this irresponsible proposal, they should be prepared to explain why up to a million Americans should be kept from having a job.\u201dDemocratic lawmakers and liberal groups joined the White House in challenging that view. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Republicans this excited about something that bucked the trend in their favor since the last poll showing Mitt Romney was about to be elected president,\u201d said Brad Woodhouse, the president of Americans United for Change, a liberal advocacy group. \u201cBut sorry to rain on their parade \u2014 one report does not a trend make.\u201dThe budget office found that lifting the federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour, would have a complicated effect on the labor market, acting as a boon and a burden for businesses and workers.Over all, the budget office estimated that lifting the minimum wage to $10.10 and indexing it to inflation would reduce total employment by about 0.3 percent, or 500,000 workers. But it cautioned that the estimate was imprecise, with the job losses likely to fall in a range from practically nothing to one million.The proposal would result in winners and losers among the low-wage workers it would target, the report found. Some businesses, squeezed between increased costs and the inability to raise prices or sell more goods, would hire fewer low-wage workers because of a higher minimum wage, the report said. But increasing the minimum wage would bolster the earnings of about 16.5 million workers: providing $5 billion a year more for families living in poverty, $12 billion a year more for families earning from one to three times the poverty threshold.Several top labor economists said on Tuesday that the budget office was overstating the proposal\u2019s effect on the job market. Lawrence Katz of Harvard, for instance, said that the budget office had used \u201ca lot of off-the-shelf estimates\u201d of the jobs effect, and that if it had emphasized findings from higher-quality studies, it would have found a smaller or negligible impact on total employment.More conservative economists said that the profession had long viewed raising the minimum wage, like any increase in price, as having an effect on the demand for jobs.\u201cThe Congressional Budget Office confirms the president proposes an unprecedented increase in the minimum wage that will cost hundreds of thousands of jobs,\u201d said James Sherk, who analyzes the labor markets for the Heritage Foundation, a right-of-center research group. Liberal economists said that quibbling over the jobs numbers neglected a central finding in the report: that many workers would benefit from an increase in income.\u201cThe C.B.O. chose a higher number than I think reflects the best work, but they\u2019re not way off the reservation,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a former Obama administration economist now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cEven if they\u2019re right, the beneficiaries far, far outweigh the people who are hurt by this.\u201dThe budget office analyzed two proposals in its report. The first would increase the minimum wage to $10.10 by mid-2016 and would tie it to the Consumer Price Index, so that it would increase with inflation over time. It would also increase the minimum wage for workers who receive tips for services.The second proposal would increase the minimum wage to $9, without any indexing for inflation. That would have much smaller effects, the budget office found. It would reduce employment by 100,000 workers by the second half of 2016, and push about 300,000 people above the poverty line.The higher minimum wage would reduce employment in two main ways, the budget office report said. Businesses facing higher labor costs would raise prices, passing those higher costs on to their customers. That would lead their customers to cut back on their purchases, meaning that businesses would need fewer workers.Raising the minimum wage would also make hiring low-wage workers more expensive relative to other investments, like new machinery. Businesses might then reduce their use of low-wage workers and shift their spending toward other things, like automated systems.But a higher minimum wage would offset at least part, if not all, of that effect by helping increase spending by lower income workers throughout the economy.Several Democratic lawmakers said that the budget office\u2019s findings only underscored the need for the $10.10 minimum wage to pass. \u201cThe C.B.O. made it absolutely clear: raising the minimum wage would lift almost one million Americans out of poverty, increase the pay of low-income workers by $31 billion and help build an economy that works for everyone,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thai Court Orders Protest Leader Released From Detention", "Date": "2014-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Thai court on Thursday ordered the release from detention of a prominent leader of the protest movement seeking to overthrow the government, a case that highlights the movement\u2019s influential backing amid Thailand\u2019s debilitating power struggle.Sonthiyarn Chuenruethai-naitham, who has been described by the Thai media as an adviser to the Crown Property Bureau, the agency that manages the massive royal fortune, was arrested by the police on Monday for his role in organizing the protests.He was described by Tharit Pengdit, the secretary general of Thailand\u2019s Department of Special Investigation, as the \u201csecond-most important\u201d person in the protest movement.The court ruled Thursday that Mr. Sonthiyarn should be released because the authorities had already obtained sufficient information from him, according to the Thai media. The government responded that it would continue to detain Mr. Sonthiyarn on separate charges of rebellion.During three months of protests against the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, a powerful tycoon living in self-exile, it has never been fully clear who was backing the protest movement. The conflict has divided the country between supporters of the governing party in the north and its detractors in Bangkok and the south.The news media have published a list, which was described as a leak from the authorities, of backers of the protest movement that included a number of major Thai corporations. Mr. Tharit, whose department is the equivalent of the F.B.I., said that some of the names on the list were correct.The government says that Mr. Sonthiyarn was a major financial planner and strategist for the protests and that he could provide further insights into the efforts to overthrow Ms. Yingluck and her allies.\u201cMr. Sonthiyarn is the person who contacts those behind the scenes who have not yet clearly been made public,\u201d Mr. Tharit said Monday. Protest leaders have said that the protests cost more than $100,000 a day, including the costs of the giant screens and audio amplification at major intersections that protesters are blocking in Bangkok.Protesters, who are allied with the opposition Democrat Party, blocked hundreds of thousands of people from voting in the general election earlier this month and said their goal was to seize \u201csovereignty.\u201d They are calling for the suspension of electoral democracy and for an appointed government on the grounds that the governing party is corrupt and has abused its majority position in Parliament.The protests have left Thailand, the second-largest economy in Southeast Asia, with an enfeebled government and the prospect of months of deadlock. In districts where protesters blocked voting, elections have been rescheduled for April.Although the number of protesters has waned in recent days \u2014 leaders say they will hold a major \u201cValentine\u2019s Day\u201d rally this weekend \u2014 the antigovernment movement has been encouraged by a number of rulings in the courts and state agencies.The anticorruption authorities have prioritized cases against Ms. Yingluck and the governing party, most prominently an investigation into a subsidy policy for rice farmers that has backfired on the government and may cost the country billions of dollars. There appears to be no disagreement on the notion of large-scale subsidies to farmers \u2014 both the opposition and the governing party support subsidies \u2014 but the opposition as well as many independent analysts say the current rice policy has been poorly managed and created wasteful stockpiles of rice.Some rice farmers have joined the antigovernment demonstrations while others have demanded that banks loan the government money to pay for the subsidies.The government, which is restricted in its spending because of its status as caretaker during the election period, says the unusual speed of the investigation into the program shows that it is politically motivated.The country\u2019s Constitutional Court has issued a number of controversial rulings favorable to the opposition in recent months, including a judgment this week that the protest movement, which has shut down a number of government buildings, was not an effort to \u201coverthrow\u201d the country\u2019s democratic system.But the court Wednesday also rejected a petition by the Democrat Party to nullify the election. The Democrats, the country\u2019s oldest party and one that represents the country\u2019s moneyed elite, boycotted the elections and risk being shut out of Parliament if the election is completed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Health, Work, Lies", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd now you know everything you need to know about the latest falsehood in the ever-mendacious campaign against health reform.This good news got drowned out, however, by false claims about the meaning of the second health care appendix, on labor supply.It has always been clear that health reform will induce some Americans to work less. Some people will, for example, retire earlier because they no longer need to keep working to keep their health insurance. Others will reduce their hours to spend more time with their children because insurance is no longer contingent on holding a full-time job. More subtly, the incentive to work will be somewhat reduced by health insurance subsidies that fall as your income rises.The budget office has now increased its estimate of the size of these effects. It believes that health reform will reduce the number of hours worked in the economy by between 1.5 percent and 2 percent, which it unhelpfully noted \u201crepresents a decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million.\u201dWe should add that the budget office believes that health reform will actually reduce unemployment over the next few years.So was Mr. Cantor being dishonest? Or was he just ignorant of the policy basics and unwilling to actually read the report before trumpeting his misrepresentation of what it said? It doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 because even if it was ignorance, it was willful ignorance. Remember, the campaign against health reform has, at every stage, grabbed hold of any and every argument it could find against insuring the uninsured, with truth and logic never entering into the matter.Meanwhile, the reality is that American health reform \u2014 flawed and incomplete though it is \u2014 is making steady progress. No, millions of Americans won\u2019t lose their jobs, but tens of millions will gain the security of knowing that they can get and afford the health care they need. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On a Caribbean Rum Trail", "Date": "2014-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cCare to kiss the ground?\u201dThe question came, with a slightly patronizing grin, from Norman Murray, local sage and tour guide in the rural parish of St. Elizabeth, Jamaica.\u201cOur visitors from Europe, America \u2014 this is a holy pilgrimage for them. So, really,\u201d he egged me on, \u201cfeel free.\u201dI composed myself, and resumed the tour, moving from fermentation to distillation to tongue-titillation \u2014 a.k.a. tasting \u2014 under Mr. Murray\u2019s erudite command. I learned how rum was born in the 17th century, when industrial waste \u2014 molasses residue from slave-era sugar production \u2014 was transformed via yeast into drinkable stuff, marketable especially in New England, where the \u201cspirit of \u201876\u201d so saturated American culture that George Washington demanded it at his inauguration. I also sampled molasses, met a donkey that demonstrated old-time methods for crushing cane, discovered how rum gets flavor and color (wood-barrel aging) and recorded factors affecting the final product (soil, climate, variety of cane, strain of yeast). I heard of Joy Spence, one of the rum world\u2019s only female master blenders (\u201cShe\u2019s all ours!\u201d Mr. Murray affirmed). And thus this ardent rum fan did not divert from her sober \u2014 er, sometimes sober \u2014 mission: travel the Caribbean, steered by rum.Call it rumming around: traversing three islands via the inebriating stuff \u2014 the oil of the colonial era \u2014 that, for centuries, lubricated economies and fueled bloody deeds. This string of islands may chat in disparate tongues and dance to divergent soundtracks, but one heady draft remains its common denominator: brown or white, served neat in roadside watering holes or garnished with cherries and umbrellas in tourist spots, rum yokes the region historically, culturally, intoxicatingly.The bottle screamed \u201cold-tyme pirate\u201d \u2014 yellowing label, baroque lettering. I poured a glass on the rocks and savored its dense, caramel flavor.\u201cI drink it neat, and sometimes atop a nice fruit salad,\u201d Mr. Blackwell said in a phone interview, adding that rum is the first venture he\u2019s put his name on. It\u2019s also a return to roots: Mr. Blackwell\u2019s grandfather once ran J. Wray & Nephew, the Jamaican rum company that now owns Appleton, which makes Blackwell Rum; the younger Blackwell started a record label instead. In other words, had the rum industry been more alluring, the world might be devoid of many a reggae masterpiece.Goldeneye, Mr. Blackwell told me, is his rum\u2019s \u201cspiritual home.\u201d The place is matrix-like \u2014 a perfect marriage of barefoot funkiness (album-art walls, a soundtrack that veers from Bob Marley to U2) and elegance (a footbridge over the lagoon is torch-lit, illuminating the path to fine dining). My stay was punctuated by ordinary activities that become extraordinary at Goldeneye: transcendent outdoor showers under a half-moon; sublime swims in the lazy lagoon, escorted by flying fish and butterflies. Blackwell Rum was at the heart of it all. By day I sipped it with watermelon and ginger, meditating on the way sunlight pirouettes off a golden-eye mosaic in the pool; by night it marinated my lobster and coconut rice.Following the rum route led south to Treasure Beach, a blissfully untouristy sliver of Jamaica where there are no all-inclusives or \u201cyah, man\u201d knickknacks. I checked into Jakes, a boutique hotel that\u2019s really a band of fanciful cottages along six rocky acres \u2014 a place where your room experience hinges on the time of day: At what angle is the daylight reflecting off the blue bottles embedded in my outdoor shower? How fiercely does the sea splash on the crags of my deck this hour of the tide? In May, Jakes will stage Jamaica\u2019s first food-and-rum festival \u2014 fitting for a property so close to the island\u2019s spirits mecca.That mecca, the Appleton Estate, seems like a tropical mirage. Set in a luxuriant landscape \u2014 11,000 acres of swaying sugar cane, and terrain resembling an upside-down egg carton \u2014 is cumbrous industrial equipment for producing spirits. The ultimate effect, though, elevates industry: rum as testament to human innovation. \u201cA journey through rum,\u201d read Mr. Murray\u2019s tour-guide shirt, and indeed it was. Appleton dates back to 1749. In the 19th century, Jamaica became the region\u2019s leading rum producer, famous for its so-called overproof, whose extra-high alcohol content made it easier to ship. Nowadays overproof is almost exclusively a local thing, accounting for some 90 percent of rum sales here.\u201cI use it,\u201d said Mr. Murray, holding a bottle of Wray & Nephew overproof to his nose, \u201cto clear sinuses. For headaches. And to clean my tub. Just don\u2019t strike a match nearby when doing that.\u201dThe climax of our tour came in a reggae-infused bar: 13 varieties for tasting, including one standout \u2014 Berry Hill, flavored with pimento.\u201cDon\u2019t be shy, folks.\u201d Mr. Murray decreed. \u201cWe\u2019ve got more. Keep drinking!\u201dI did, on another island. After the rugged terrain of Jamaica, Barbados\u2019s flatness was striking. Such topography is ideal for cultivating cane. Barbados is one of the region\u2019s only coral limestone islands, said to lend an inimitable flavor to the water used in rum production.I planned to remain clothed, and slightly sober. Mr. Yellin had other ideas about this last bit.\u201cBreakfast in one distillery, lunch in another. And definitely more rum for dinner,\u201d he explained, picking me up in his truck after sunrise. Breakfast never made it past the car: fish cakes with tangy pepper sauce that I devoured as we traversed a cane field. We toured the Foursquare Rum Distillery and Heritage Park, a sugar plantation turned modern factory. Wandering through the Willie Wonka-like plant and grounds, dotted with guava trees and pastel lampposts, home to a \u201cfolk museum\u201d and a gallery of outmoded sugar-production tools, Mr. Yellin noted an irony: Once rum was the extra stuff made from the real moneymaking crop, but our globalized economy turned this on its head. Sugar, no longer profitable in the Caribbean, is now a footnote to today\u2019s cash cow: rum.All Mount Gay rums, I learned, are blends of distillates and none are age-specified \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s ready when its ready,\u201d goes the logo. Rum matures faster than whiskey; unlike wine, it stops aging once it leaves the barrel. At the aroma bar, stooping before scented bowls, I learned what to taste for, in Mount Gay brands I\u2019d never seen in an American bar: banana, almond, vanilla. The brand\u2019s newest debut became my favorite: Black Barrel, finished in charred bourbon oak barrels. Here lies a delectable flavor that\u2019s fruity, spicy, peppery \u2014 alcoholic fruitcake in a snifter.But back to that irony. It hit me after our on-site lunch and dessert of local chocolate (accompanied by rum, naturally), as we passed through the rum museum honoring Bajan activities and events that go well with Mount Gay: domino-playing, sailing and Crop-Over, a festival once marking the end of the cane-harvesting season, now the island\u2019s annual carnival. Ogling the extravagant costumes, I meditated on the manic-depressive vagaries of Caribbean history: a drink born in suffering \u2014 on the backs of slaves \u2014 is born again as fuel for an exultant, life-affirming ritual.Such is the reality of Barbados\u2019s past. It\u2019s said that 17th-century Bridgetown boasted one \u201ctippling house\u201d per 20 residents; nowadays the number of rum shops dotting the island is disputable, but all agree on one answer: many. Between swim stops at spectacular beaches, I drove through countryside populated by small chattel houses, testing bar stools from one end of the island to the other. My haunts bore names like De Nest Bar and Hide Away, Survival Bar and Marshall\u2019s \u2014 the latter owned, naturally, by Marshall, brother to a cricket player whose photo adorns the bar. One had a sign reading, \u201cabusive language not allowed\u201d; another had room for just a single stool; all were populated by motley regulars, debating elections and cricket in the same breath. On the Atlantic side I relished Bathsheba, where the views become cliffside dramatic. There I drank Mount Gay and coconut water with an eye on the frothy sea. Next thing I knew I was dancing to soca music in a rum shop just past the barber shop, to the left of the roundabout; then I was dancing while devouring something heavenly called \u201cpickled seacat,\u201d which is actually a ceviche of octopus.Just when I thought I had a handle on rum, I discovered rhum. Enter Martinique, elegant French island, home to cane and banana fields, a hikable volcano, black-sand beaches \u2014 and a nationalistic, revisionary rum legacy.I explained to my guide that I was familiar with the production process, having just come from Jamaica and Barbados. Grand faux pas.\u201cMadame,\u201d Emmanuelle said. \u201cThey make rhum industriel in those islands. Only the French make our rum \u2014 the rhum agricole.\u201dAh, oui, oui, I reassured her. Rhum agricole, like Brazilian cacha\u00e7a, is made not from molasses but the cane juice itself, which the French tell us is truer to the sugar flavor.(\u201cRhum industriel? Ha!\u201d Mount Gay Ambassador Chesterfield Brown had muttered during his tasting session at the Barbados Food & Wine and Rum Festival. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing industrial about our rum.\u201d)In the end, it\u2019s a matter of taste. Distinguished by alcohol level, color, age and, like wine, terroir, rhum agricole is earthier than my beloved Appleton. The whites had a sweet, flowery flavor; the extra-olds, unique vintages, evoked maple and coffee.But in Martinique the taste of the rum was beside the point; the distillery was everything. Rum touring in Martinique rivals Napa wine jaunts.\u201cOur whole history is wrapped up in this alcohol,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what is it? Depends who you ask, yes? For the European visitors, it\u2019s holiday. To the bekes\u201d \u2014 white Martinicans, colonial descendants who still run the bulk of the island\u2019s economy and all but one of its distilleries \u2014 \u201crum is pride. To blacks, locals, it\u2019s also colonialism, slavery, alcoholism, sadness. We drink Champagne at weddings. Rum is for funerals.\u201dBut during an audio tour that thoroughly covered rum history and production \u2014 maps, diagrams, photo exhibits, French-accented voice-overs \u2014 I decided that here lay the educational apex of distillery-hopping. I wandered through the plantation\u2019s sculpture garden and, reflecting on the legacy of the liquid I\u2019d been trailing, spotted something remarkable: blood on the leaves. A massive red statue of the word \u201cBlood,\u201d poised before a picture-perfect cane field. It evoked, of course, the Billie Holiday song \u201cStrange Fruit,\u201d about lynchings in a pastoral Southern landscape: \u201cBlood on the leaves and blood at the root,\u201d she sang. This scene, stunning yet haunted by perennial pain, struck me as perfect homage: Behold a spirit whose legacy contains all the paradoxes and complexity of the wistfully beautiful region that gave birth to it so long ago.Baz Dreisinger is a journalist and associate professor of English at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who writes about Caribbean culture. IF YOU GOHistoryThese books are excellent sources on rum and its history.AccommodationsLooking AheadThe newest offerings from Jamaica come from two members of the country\u2019s famed Marley family. Cedella and Rohan, her brother, have developed two rums, each representative of their unique personalities. Cedella\u2019s rum, named Silver Root, is a four-year aged, smooth, clear, ultrapremium rum. Rohan\u2019s rum, named Spiced Root, is also super premium liquid aged four years. In contrast to Silver Root, Spiced Root is a spiced rum and loaded with traditional Jamaican flavors including cinnamon and vanilla. Both rums are currently being test marketed and will be widely distributed beginning in April of this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Library for Obama First Needs an Address", "Date": "2014-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn election night in 1992, James L. Rutherford, known as Skip, was celebrating with other key Clinton supporters on the streets of Little Rock, Ark., when he felt the hand of Herschel Friday, a prominent Arkansas lawyer and member of the Clinton finance committee, on his back.\u201cHey, Skip,\u201d Mr. Rutherford, now dean of the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service, recalled the lawyer saying. \u201cNow we have to start thinking about that presidential library.\u201dOn Friday, supporters of the president kicked off the Barack H. Obama Foundation, an administration-blessed organization to find the money and address for an eventual Obama library. As expected, the foundation is led by Marty Nesbitt, a Chicago investor and Obama friend, along with J. Kevin Poorman, a businessman, and Julianna Smoot, the president\u2019s go-to fund-raiser.\u201cThe foundation envisions a facility that, through its mission, initiatives, and physical and virtual presence, can become an anchor for economic development and cultivate a strong relationship with the library\u2019s surrounding community,\u201d read a statement announcing the foundation.But the question of which community, and which state, is unique. The search for a state to call home reflects the president\u2019s itinerant upbringing. He was born in Hawaii, and was brought up there and in Indonesia, before attending universities in Los Angeles, New York and Boston. But it was Chicago where he came of political age and made his career.\u201cEvery president has a biographical background that speaks to where they will put their library,\u201d said Mark Langdale, who led the library effort for George W. Bush and has met with representatives from Hawaii and with Susan Sher, a University of Chicago official and former chief of staff for the first lady, Michelle Obama.But some critics see less of a personal journey and more of a financial one in the search for an Obama library\u2019s home. While there has been stiff competition among Chicago universities for the library, some prominent Obama donors have heard from people close to the president that he would rather live his post-presidential life in New York and that Chicago feels \u201csmall for him.\u201d Columbia University is apparently interested.\u201cColumbia is proud to count President Obama among its alumni,\u201d wrote Robert Hornsby, a university spokesman. \u201cWe look forward to learning more about the plans of the Barack H. Obama Foundation for the development of a library reflecting the president\u2019s values and priorities.\u201dOther donors close to the president dismissed the notion that the library could land anywhere other than Chicago. Mr. Obama is not terribly popular among New York donors, many of whom feel jilted by the politician they helped elect. Several skeptical donors attributed the talk about New York to a fund-raising strategy intended to spook Chicago supporters and universities into opening their checkbooks.\u201cThey need this to be a bit of a bidding war,\u201d said one prominent Obama donor who spoke candidly on the condition of anonymity. Another donor said fund-raisers were putting the library price tag as high as $800 million. Anita Dunn, an administration veteran representing the\u00a0foundation, said there was not a target figure.The foundation became a source of tension in the months before it was announced, as Obama loyalists, including the senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, gravitated toward the plum gig, which could itself serve as a cozy home for post-administration life.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Months After Typhoon, Philippine City Suffers From an Exodus of Jobs", "Date": "2014-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTACLOBAN, the Philippines \u2014 As Jesse Siozon waited for his grandfather\u2019s funeral to begin, beneath the orange and blue tarps that serve as the roof for the storm-damaged Santo Ni\u00f1o Church, he spoke of a double loss.His grandfather may well have been the last person in this bedraggled city to succumb to injuries and illnesses brought on by Typhoon Haiyan. And now Mr. Siozon, a 30-year-old nurse, is being forced to leave Tacloban, his family\u2019s hometown for four generations, because efforts to rebuild have stalled and jobs have disappeared for skilled workers like him.\u201cI wish I could have worked here,\u201d he said, as sunlight streamed through the hole in a stained-glass window donated by his grandfather. \u201cI don\u2019t even have a place to live here.\u201dThe city is caught in a spiral of deprivation that will be hard to break, especially given the scope of a catastrophe that killed at least 6,000 people and was the deadliest natural disaster in the world last year.Without power and other basics, businesses are finding it difficult to recover. And without commerce, the city will continue to lose money \u2014 and talent.The continuing confusion has left this city, which once envisioned becoming a new economic hub, struggling to hold on to young and talented residents. Like Mr. Siozon, they are leaving for work elsewhere in the Philippines\u2019 growing economy.\u201cThe young professionals whom I know have left, because of the quality of life here,\u201d said Jerry T. Yaokasin, the deputy mayor of Tacloban. \u201cWhen I look around, it is as if it happened yesterday \u2014 there is still so much devastation.\u201dSitting in a modest second-floor office, in a municipal building where the first floor was gutted by the storm, Mr. Yaokasin checked off the list of people he knows who have left. His cousin, a lawyer, now works for a large company in Manila. The secretary at his church took a job at a call center in Cebu, on another island 100 miles away.Even students have left. More than a third of the 1,370 students at the University of the Philippines campus here have transferred to other campuses. An additional 130 dropped out, some because they could no longer afford to attend. Enrollment has dropped by a third at the 1,900-student ACLC College, which teaches mainly computer skills, but has been reduced to classroom lectures because its computers were destroyed in the storm.The flight of those most able to find opportunities elsewhere is leaving behind a city of the poor, including those left destitute by the typhoon.Almil Rama is a 35-year-old kindergarten teacher who lost her husband and house in the storm and now lives with her three children in a room rented from a friend.The storm killed 22 of the kindergartners at her school, San Jose Elementary, and 94 students soon moved away with their families and have not come back. The school still has 137 kindergartners, but it lost its books and its ceiling fan in the storm. Even if the fan is replaced, there is no power to run it.\u201cWe need electricity,\u201d said Ms. Rama, who lights her rented room with candles.Many people here are living in tents. The temporary homes rejected by United Nations experts \u2014 little more than rows of plywood stalls under a high roof, with shared bathrooms nearby \u2014 are being renovated. But widening the living areas will mean fewer families can move in.And the lack of electricity is a constant worry for those trying to breathe life into the city\u2019s mostly moribund economy and forestall a further exodus.Running gasoline or diesel generators is prohibitively expensive for many businesses, in some cases costing six times as much as grid electricity. So they operate at less than full capacity, if at all.That can have a compounding effect. I. P. Car Tech, the biggest truck and car repair shop in the region, can operate only one of its 18 vehicle lifts at a time with its diesel generator. That means many of the thousands of typhoon-damaged cars, trucks and even ambulances needed for commerce and daily life remain unusable.Energy Secretary C. Jericho Petilla initially promised a restoration of electric service by Dec. 24, then pushed the target to the end of March. But with fewer than a quarter of the buildings reconnected to the grid at all, even that goal appears elusive.Up to a third of Tacloban\u2019s transformers were torn apart for their copper cores, which could be sold for scrap at $220 apiece on the black market. The transformers cost $1,600 apiece to replace, plus labor. Sections of fallen power lines were also snipped and stolen for the copper inside, making it impossible to simply send out trucks to lift the lines back onto poles.In any case, a lack of spare parts means that two of the local utility\u2019s six boom trucks are unusable. So line workers are sent out in vans every day to bundle up fallen lines before they, too, can be stolen.Morale is low: The utility is demanding four to six hours a day of unpaid overtime from its workers, plus a full unpaid day on Saturdays, though it says it hopes to reimburse them later.Vendors of crucial supplies like concrete poles have begun demanding cash on delivery from the struggling cooperative.\u201cI would not be surprised if 12 months from now, there are customers still not connected to the grid,\u201d said Adam Victor, chief executive of New York-based TransGas Development Systems, which recently completed a detailed assessment.It was the lack of electricity that helped drive Mr. Siozon, the nurse, away from his beloved hometown, and his calling.The wiring in 95-year-old Bethany Hospital, where he worked, was so badly damaged that much of the hospital cannot be reconnected to the grid, even though power to its area has been restored.The hospital plans to partially reopen in early summer as a small outpatient clinic, and it will have scant need for post-surgery nurses like Mr. Siozon.His new job: working at an Aetna call center in the capital, fielding health insurance questions from Americans.Advertisement"}

Ms. Rousseff faces re-election in October, but lacks Mr. da Silva\u2019s popularity.Mr. da Silva, 68, popularly known as Lula, has been campaigning for Ms. Rousseff, and he predicted she would win.Asked to explain Brazil\u2019s inability to attract investment from technology companies in the same way that China does, Mr. da Silva questioned the comparison. While acknowledging that Brazil suffered competitive deficiencies, he said the rise in wages and benefits for Brazilian workers benefited the economy.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be competitive like China is, where there\u2019s no welfare program, where you have no obligation to the workers, pension funds, trade unions, and people earn very low wages,\u201d he said through a translator. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that model for us. We\u2019re doing well as we are today.\u201dDuring Mr. da Silva\u2019s last year in office, Brazil\u2019s economic growth rate was 7.5 percent, but it has fallen sharply under Ms. Rousseff, partly because of a slowdown in China, which has been a voracious consumer of raw materials from countries like Brazil.He also dampened speculation that he might run for president again, possibly if Ms. Rousseff\u2019s re-election campaign falters or maybe even in 2018. Under Brazilian law, a president cannot serve three consecutive terms.\u201cI don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m going to be alive in 2018,\u201d said Mr. da Silva. \u201cI think I\u2019ve fulfilled my mission.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vatican Gets Fiscal Shake-Up", "Date": "2014-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Pope Francis announced a major restructuring of the Vatican\u2019s outdated administrative and economic bureaucracy on Monday as he established a new agency to oversee budgets and financial planning and also created a powerful auditor-general to guard against fiscal mismanagement.The changes are the latest example of how Francis is moving to confront management problems in the Vatican as part of his broader mandate to reform the Roman Curia, the administration that runs the Holy See. He has begun shuffling personnel while also speaking out against careerism in the Roman Catholic Church, especially inside the Vatican.To lead the new Secretariat of the Economy, Francis selected Cardinal George Pell, the archbishop of Sydney, who is also one of the eight cardinals serving on a special commission advising the pope on administrative reform and other issues. Shortly before Francis was elected pope last March, Cardinal Pell was openly critical of mismanagement under Pope Benedict XVI \u2014 in particular a scandal over private letters leaked by Benedict\u2019s butler.\u201cIt would be useful to have a pope who can pull the show together, lift the morale of the Curia and strengthen a bit of the discipline there,\u201d Cardinal Pell told The Associated Press at the time.One question that still remains unanswered is the fate of the Vatican Bank, officially known as the Institute for the Works of Religion. Magistrates in Italy are investigating allegations of money laundering linked to the bank. Meanwhile, a management team, appointed by Benedict in the final days of his papacy to address the problems, has been poring over the bank\u2019s accounts, looking for irregularities, while also working to bring the institution into compliance with international norms.Francis has not yet signaled his plans for the bank \u2014 one possibility would be to shut it down \u2014 and the announcement on Monday did not mention it.\u201cWe have not yet heard any decisions or deliberations,\u201d said Max Hohenberg, a spokesman for the bank.But Alberto Melloni, a historian of the Vatican, said the latest changes signaled a further diminution of the bank, which once operated with independence and limited oversight, factors that contributed to the recent scandals. He said now the bank would serve essentially as \u201ca wallet\u201d while economic decision-making would be made in the new Secretariat of Economy. He also said the appointment of Cardinal Pell underscored the growing influence of the \u201cGroup of Eight\u201d cardinals over functions once dominated by the Curia.Francis has pledged to bring greater transparency and collegiality to the workings of the Vatican, and the announcement on Monday said the new Secretariat was created to help \u201csimplify and consolidate existing management structures and improve coordination and oversight.\u201dThe new auditor-general, who will be directly appointed by the pope, will be \u201cempowered to conduct audits of any agency of the Holy See and the Vatican City State, at any time,\u201d the Vatican said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s the Economy", "Date": "2014-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmericans have struggled mightily since the nation\u2019s birth to overcome racial prejudice. Recently, as symbolized by President Obama\u2019s ascendancy and his message of racial reconciliation, we have basically succeeded and are now healing from our racial wounds. Or so the story goes. In \u201cA Dreadful Deceit,\u201d the distinguished historian Jacqueline Jones vehemently rejects this redemptive and self-congratulatory narrative. She believes that the country\u2019s racial problems have little to do with racism and everything to do with economic exploitation. And, she claims, we have not even begun to come to terms with this.Jones is the author of numerous books, including \u201cLabor of Love, Labor of Sorrow,\u201d which won the Bancroft Prize in 1986. This new book, a sweeping account of the role of race in American history, is structured around the stories of six extraordinary but largely unknown individuals, each of African descent. There\u2019s Antonio, murdered in colonial Maryland for refusing to submit to enslavement; Boston King, a former slave from South Carolina turned loyalist during the American Revolution; the Afro-Indian Elleanor Eldridge, who started several successful businesses in Providence, R.I., in the early 19th century; the Reconstruction-era Georgia politician Richard W. White; the early-20th-century educator William H. Holtzclaw, who founded a Tuskegee-like school in Mississippi; and finally the radical labor activist Simon P. Owens in mid-20th-century Detroit.The six stories, told in vivid detail, are fascinating and a pleasure to read, particularly the one about Owens, whom Jones sometimes uses as a mouthpiece. Yet the life Jones is most interested in is the life of the concept of \u201crace,\u201d which, following the radical abolitionist David Walker, she terms a \u201cdreadful deceit.\u201d Her book is a call to renounce the very idea of race as a dangerous misconception. This argument will be familiar to scholars, but Jones seeks to bring it to a broader audience.To explain how racial conflict has masked power struggles for control over others\u2019 labor, Jones surveys compelled work in its many varieties, from slave labor under the lash on tobacco plantations in Maryland to mandatory overtime in unsafe and sweltering auto plants in Detroit. Racial ideologies, she argues, are like mob violence, disenfranchisement and discriminatory laws \u2014 merely tactics used to secure material advantages in social contexts perceived as zero-sum.So the refusal of white colonists to recognize black claims to equal liberty was not premised on racial considerations, Jones argues, but on naked self-interest. She acknowledges that intellectuals like Thomas Jefferson were moved to reconcile Enlightenment values with slavery. But most propertied white men didn\u2019t see a need to justify their dominance apart from citing their economic interests, the same interests that led them to exploit Indians, poor whites and women. A racial justification for slavery emerged only in the 19th century, in response to the Northern abolitionist movement.Similarly, Jones describes early-19th-century white working-class hostility to blacks as springing from economic competition. \u201cBy keeping blacks in menial jobs permanently,\u201d she writes, \u201cwhites might reserve new and better opportunities for themselves and ensure that someone else did the ill-paying, disagreeable work.\u201d Throughout the period from colonial settlement to the Civil War, she says, racial ideologies played only a minor role in sustaining white dominance.Jones acknowledges that \u201cwhiteness\u201d functioned as a powerful idea during Reconstruction, uniting whites of opposing political views and conflicting class interests. But racial ideologies were \u201cremade\u201d at the turn of the 20th century, when blacks were imprisoned or killed as sexual and criminal deviants in order to prevent them from joining forces with poor whites against white elites. Moving into the present, she attributes contemporary ghetto poverty and its associated ills to a lack of jobs for low-skilled workers. Black subordination no longer requires racial myths to perpetuate it. Vulnerable blacks can be defrauded, imprisoned, disenfranchised and left to die in floodwaters without appeals to race.A core theme in \u201cA Dreadful Deceit\u201d is the contradictory depictions of blacks. They are at once lazy, childlike, stupid and submissive, but also murderous, calculating and subversive, intent on stealing white men\u2019s jobs. Jones regards this lack of coherence as evidence that a conception of inherent racial difference has not been a driving factor in the way whites have treated blacks. And she laments the preoccupation with battling these myths, which she believes too often obscure the pressing need to address material inequality.Yet isn\u2019t it obvious that whites sometimes hate blacks simply because they are black? No, Jones says. When whites express contempt or hatred for blacks it is because of the stigma attached to servitude, or because blacks have refused to submit quietly to economic marginalization.Jones celebrates interracial working-class solidarity (though she recognizes that white workers have generally resisted uniting with black workers). At the same time, she is ambivalent about whether \u201cblackness\u201d itself can ever be a basis for identity or solidarity. She says of Owens, \u201cBecause generations of white people had defined him and all other blacks first and foremost as \u2018Negroes,\u2019 he had no alternative but to acknowledge \u2014 or rather, react to \u2014 that spurious identity.\u201d Even if what blacks have in common is not their race but \u201can overarching political vulnerability traced back to enslaved forebears, a political and historical status,\u201d there might be times, she admits, when it would be legitimate to describe this commonality using the language of race. However, she also believes that doing so keeps a \u201cdestructive\u201d idea alive.Jones\u2019s argument shares features with W. E. B. Du Bois\u2019s theory in his 1940 book, \u201cDusk of Dawn: An Essay Toward an Autobiography of a Race Concept.\u201d But the differences make a difference. Du Bois too welcomed multiracial working-class solidarity, yet he thought that many oppressed whites were strongly attached to their \u201cwhiteness\u201d as a marker of status, despite the fact that it brought them few or no material advantages. While Jones contends that racial justifications for unequal treatment are tactical and self-serving lies, Du Bois emphasized that those who accept racist thinking are generally self-deceived, entranced by mystifying fictions. And although he is no less concerned about black economic disadvantage than Jones, Du Bois worried as well about the self-contempt that racial defamation causes. Material well-being without self-respect, he insisted, is an undignified existence.Precisely because race is, as Jones says, a \u201cstrange and shifting idea,\u201d both malleable and capacious, Du Bois believed it could be remade and used for good. Over the years, those who have had the label \u201cblack\u201d imposed on them have revised its meaning to better reflect their experiences and collective memory, and employed it as a means of overcoming their oppression. Thus, \u201cblack is beautiful,\u201d \u201cblack pride,\u201d even \u201cblack power.\u201d When Du Bois called on the \u201cdarker races\u201d to stand together against imperialism, economic exploitation and white supremacy, he was invoking race, but not in a morally troubling way.Engagement with Du Boisian ideas might have made \u201cA Dreadful Deceit\u201d more convincing (and its practical implications less ambiguous). Still, if contemporary discussions of race could be focused on the interconnections between racial ideologies, political power and economic vulnerability, as Jones would like, that would be a dramatic improvement over the \u201cpostracial\u201d narratives that currently reign.

{"Headline": "Even Out of Office, a Wielder of Great Power in Yemen", "Date": "2014-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileSANA, Yemen \u2014 THE old man still rises at 5:30 a.m., as he did during the three decades he ruled this tumultuous country. He does some physical therapy to help his scarred body recover from the 2011 bomb blast that nearly killed him. He reads the papers. And then, sitting in a gazebo in a high-walled compound that rivals the presidential palace, he begins receiving the endless tide of visitors who still treat him as if he were the most powerful man in Yemen.Ali Abdullah Saleh is a rare figure in the Arab world, or anywhere else: an autocrat overthrown by popular revolt who nonetheless remains in his country, unmolested.Nominally, Mr. Saleh, 71, is a retired statesman writing his memoirs. He was granted immunity from prosecution under the terms of the deal that removed him from power in 2012. But his many enemies say he still plays a powerful and poisonous role here. They accuse him of arranging terrorist attacks and some of the assassinations of more than 150 high-ranking officers and political figures over the past two years.Even the current president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who was Mr. Saleh\u2019s deputy for 18 years, has accused him of orchestrating the attacks on oil and power lines that scourge Yemen\u2019s economy and cast an aura of incompetence on the new administration. Diplomats at the United Nations have accused \u201celements of the former regime\u201d of playing an obstructive role, and have even hinted at possible sanctions on the former president.Mr. Saleh, a gruff man with a proud scowl stamped permanently on his face, showed no emotion when those accusations were repeated.\u201cThese people are not confident of their power, and still consider themselves as employees of Ali Abdullah Saleh,\u201d he said during an interview in the vast courtyard of his compound. \u201cThey think anything that happens in the country, large or small, must have been done by Ali Abdullah Saleh.\u201dHe always speaks of himself in the third person. Around him, aides shuffle, offering papers and phones, and well-wishers and political figures hover in the middle distance, waiting their turn. One man stands waiting with an umbrella, ready to protect Mr. Saleh\u2019s skin from the sun whenever he steps away from the shade of the gazebo.It is impossible to know whether the darker accusations against him are true, diplomats and analysts say. Investigations of political violence are scant and inconclusive in Yemen, and the government is still crippled by corruption. There are plenty of other possible culprits, including Al Qaeda\u2019s regional branch, though it is an easy scapegoat.There is no doubt that Mr. Saleh still wields enormous power here. He remains the leader of Mr. Hadi\u2019s own political party, to the president\u2019s chagrin. Many in the military are still loyal to him. His residence in the capital is barricaded for blocks in every direction by concrete barriers and soldiers.Born into a peasant family, Mr. Saleh had little formal education, and he rose through the ranks of the army after Yemeni officers overthrew the old religious monarchy in 1962. When he came to power in 1978, few expected he would last; the previous two presidents had been assassinated. But he outmaneuvered his opponents, and in 1990 he unified the north with South Yemen, previously a Soviet client state.By the time the Arab uprisings started in 2010, Yemen was convulsed with insurgencies and discontent, and Mr. Saleh\u2019s hold was weakening.RECENTLY, he has signaled an alliance of sorts with the Houthis, an insurgent group in the far northwest with which he fought a bitter, intermittent war for years. The Houthis have grown into a broad national political movement since 2011, fueled largely by a hatred of Islah, the Yemeni Islamist party that is the equivalent of the Muslim Brotherhood. Mr. Saleh hates them both, but he clearly also resents Mr. Hadi, who frequently disparages him.Few accuse Mr. Saleh of scheming to return to power himself. Although his mind seems clear enough, he suffered serious injuries in the bombing in 2011, which killed six guards and maimed many others. (It is still not clear who carried it out.) He moves slowly and haltingly, and the skin on his hands and face is patchy from burns. He underwent the latest of numerous operations in January.Instead, many critics say he aspires to clear a path for his family. In the years before his fall, Mr. Saleh appeared to be grooming his son, Ahmed Ali Saleh, much as a former leader of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak, prepared his son Gamal for a succession. Mr. Mubarak was overthrown, and his son was imprisoned on corruption charges. Mr. Saleh installed dozens of other relatives in powerful positions, especially in the military and security services. Most have now been purged, but none have been prosecuted.When Mr. Saleh was asked about these ambitions for his son, his scratchy voice rose in protest. \u201cI did not want that for him then, much less now,\u201d he said. He went on to deride the opponents who still seem so focused on him. \u201cIt is not enough for them that I have left power,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think they will not rule Yemen until I also leave the country, and die.\u201dIt is entirely possible that Mr. Saleh\u2019s son or nephews could eventually inherit his mantle. Many Yemenis speak admiringly of Egypt\u2019s military chief, Field Marshal Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, who forced that country\u2019s elected president, Mohamed Morsi, from power last summer and is now poised to become Egypt\u2019s next president. He has been uncompromising in his dealings with the Muslim Brotherhood, using lethal force to silence its members and having it declared a terrorist organization.DESPITE the democratic yearnings stirred by Yemen\u2019s popular uprising in 2011, many people here are frustrated with the country\u2019s chaotic politics and view Mr. Hadi as irresolute. Yemen\u2019s major Islamist party, Islah, has wide popularity, but like the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, it is widely distrusted, partly because of its compromises during Mr. Saleh\u2019s rule.In theory, Yemen is healing its political fractures through a process of accommodation, not a return to brittle strongmen. Last month was the conclusion of the National Dialogue Conference, a 10-month exercise in group political therapy that was called for in the United Nations-brokered deal that removed Mr. Saleh.The conference involved endless, often fractious encounters among 565 people representing Yemen\u2019s many political parties and social classes, tribal sheikhs, religious leaders, businessmen, women and \u201crevolutionary youth.\u201dMr. Saleh offered muted praise of the National Dialogue. \u201cThere was a good effort,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is political will, I think there could be some implementation.\u201dBut when asked about the Arab uprisings of 2011, Mr. Saleh returned to the theme that helped keep him and other Arab rulers in power for so long: fear of the alternative. \u201cThe Arab Spring was born dead,\u201d he said. \u201cIt came in the shadow of hard circumstances in the Middle East, and it became a weapon in the hands of the Islamic movements.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beauty Among the Ruins", "Date": "2014-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe world loves all things Italian, but the same cannot always be said of Italians themselves. Luigi Barzini Jr.\u2019s book \u201cThe Italians\u201d was read by millions around the world, but by few in Italy. Tourists flock to the Cortona countryside in Tuscany, but Italians could take it or leave it. Former Prime Minister Mario Monti was hailed outside Italy as our euro-crisis savior, but we Italians were less impressed.The same thing is happening to the director Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s new film, \u201cThe Great Beauty,\u201d which won the Golden Globe for best foreign-language film and is considered a front-runner for the Oscar in the same category. The world loves it; Italy, not so much \u2014 a fact that says a lot about how the world sees my country, but even more about how my country views itself.\u201cThe Great Beauty\u201d tells the curious tale of 65-year-old, Naples-born, Rome-based Jep Gambardella, a journalist who specializes in cynicism, small talk and all-night partying around the Italian capital. It is full of lush urban landscapes and scandals amid the ruins; critics have praised it as a beautifully melancholic sweep of Italian history and national character. Italian critics, though, aren\u2019t having it. It is pretentious, anachronistic and vapid, they say. The newspaper Il Foglio, comparing it unfavorably with \u201cLa Dolce Vita,\u201d wrote that people assailed Federico Fellini\u2019s film at first \u201cbecause it was ahead of its time. This film lags behind, clinging onto the Sad \u201970s.\u201d My own newspaper, Corriere della Sera, said, \u201cThe over-affected literary dialogue ends up sounding verbose to the point of sententiousness.\u201dI\u2019ve seen the film \u2014 twice \u2014 and I have to say I\u2019m with the non-Italians. But I\u2019m also interested in why my country is getting so worked up about it. It\u2019s true, as the ancient Romans said, that no man is a prophet in his own country. And that\u2019s precisely what is happening here. \u201cThe Great Beauty\u201d rubs many Italians the wrong way because it disturbs them, and is a hit with non-Italians because it fascinates them. For a start, it traces a paradoxical, but effective, sketch of a city that can digest anything, from popes to governments, pilgrims, tourists, artistic geniuses, social climbers, literary conceits and beautiful bodies. Rome is not Italy, but it is emblematic of Italy\u2019s history, grandeur and perils. Mr. Sorrentino, who, like Jep Gambardella, is from Naples and who moved to the capital with his family a few years ago, renders all this intelligible with the frankness of an outsider. \u201cThe Great Beauty\u201d is a portrait of a decadent, endearing city. Compassion laced with censure is too much for some Italians.Of course, \u201cLa Dolce Vita,\u201d the 1960 film that directly inspired \u201cThe Great Beauty,\u201d is also a film by a non-Roman, and it likewise depicts a decadent, endearing city. But Romans and other Italians liked it for one simple reason: Fellini depicted a Rome and an Italy on the way up. In contrast, Mr. Sorrentino describes a city and country going nowhere. Fellini\u2019s Rome inspires indulgence and emotion; Sorrentino\u2019s merely apprehension.Jep Gambardella, played by Toni Servillo, is a bizarre, acute observer of a city and country hiding their anxieties under a veneer of nonchalance. His characters are like the busts of famous, long-dead Italians that decorate Rome\u2019s Pincian Hill: They remind us that all sorts of things have gone on in the city, but there may be no more history being made. Everything worth celebrating is in the past.It is this sensation of greatness veined with apprehension that many Italians find so unsettling. It whispers in our ear that Italy\u2019s great beauty could become a great burden, an intimidating, consoling, reassuring, energy-sapping encumbrance. Remember that the nation with one of the world\u2019s largest artistic heritages is also the only country in the euro zone where per capita gross domestic product has shrunk since the currency was introduced in 1999. Great beauty and a mediocre economy, but beauty won\u2019t pay the rent.People abroad like \u201cThe Great Beauty\u201d because it shows how behind every defect lies a virtue, and vice versa. But to do this, the film turns its spotlight on our defects, and it\u2019s not nice to have a bright light shining in your face. Of course, New York, London, Tokyo and Beijing swarm with pseudo-intellectuals and talent-bereft artists, but in Italy, they\u2019re more entertaining and take themselves less seriously. The Jep Gambardella lifestyle is unsuited to Stockholm or Zurich, where a 65-year-old man rolling home at daybreak would be greeted with disapproving looks, not a surprise around every corner and a 40-something woman in his bed.\u201cThe Great Beauty\u201d appeals to non-Italians because its excitable, anxiety-ridden characters are familiar to all of us. \u201cItaly is the land of human nature,\u201d observed the American travel writer E.R.P. Vincent many years ago. Rome was, and still is, its capital city. Foreigners, drawn to the place yet leery of it, can sense this. They love Italy and fear it. Around the world, my country is seen as an emotional proving ground and a world congress for sensuality. The Italy of \u201cThe Great Beauty\u201d is a great temptation. We are what others would like to be, at least some of the time \u2014 but don\u2019t dare try.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Major Indexes Fall Slightly After Volatile Trading Day ", "Date": "2014-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market showed little change in a volatile trading session on Wednesday after a positive report on private sector hiring did little to ease investors\u2019 uncertainty over the health of the American economy. The major indexes closed down marginally. After the steep sell-off on Monday when a report showed weakness in the manufacturing sector, many investors remain leery, waiting to see other economic reports and company earnings for clues about whether the recovery is on track.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing some buyers coming in on the weakness, but not enough to push the market higher,\u201d said Joe Bell, senior equity analyst with Schaeffer\u2019s Investment Research. The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell more than 100 points in early trading before rebounding, closed down 5.01 points, or less than 0.1 percent, at 15,440.23.

{"Headline": "Credit Card Debt Threatens Turkey\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2014-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 Ozcan Yuksel\u2019s descent into debt began with a stroll down Istiklal Caddesi, a popular Istanbul promenade teeming with shops and restaurants.Bank employees were passing out credit card applications and helping people fill them out. Mr. Yuksel made the equivalent of a few hundred dollars a month working for a lighting fixture shop. But it turned out that did not matter.\u201cThey were asking people to sign, and I did,\u201d he said. Within a week he had a card and a spending limit many times his paycheck.That was in 2001. Today, Mr. Yuksel, a 32-year-old father of two, owes more than $8,000, much more than his annual income and an amount that will take him more than a decade to repay. He is among millions of Turks who are in over their heads in debt they incurred after local banks aggressively marketed credit cards to low-income people.Mr. Yuksel\u2019s tale of living on borrowed money illustrates one of the ills plaguing the country\u2019s economy and threatening a new financial debacle in an unstable region. It echoes the subprime mortgage calamity in the United States in 2008, in that the Turkish banks often seemed oblivious to the risk that their new customers might not pay them back.The credit ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s warned in a report last week that the boom in consumer credit had become a serious risk for Turkish lenders. Slowing economic growth, political turmoil and increasing reluctance by foreign investors to provide financing \u201care prompting a deterioration in the operating environment for Turkish banks,\u201d S.&P. said.Even as turmoil in Ukraine lately has overshadowed Turkey\u2019s political and economic crisis, the problems here on the other side of the Black Sea have not diminished. On Thursday, Turkey\u2019s dangerously weakened currency, the lira, lapsed to a three-week low as political opponents of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan continued to raise allegations in the graft scandal clouding his government less than a month before local elections.When foreign capital was flowing freely into Turkey and other emerging markets, the nation used it to splurge on consumer goods and real estate, rather than on new businesses that would support lasting growth. Now the bill is coming due. A big issue facing Turkey is what financial and political havoc this pile of consumer debt could create as a plunge in the value of the Turkish lira and a pullback by foreign investors forces the country to live within its means.Much of Turkey\u2019s rapid growth in the last decade came from consumer spending based on credit. Debt from credit cards rose 31 percent nationwide in 2012. In 2013 it rose an additional 22 percent. From practically nothing a decade ago, consumer debt in Turkey now equals 55 percent of household disposable income, according to Oxford Economics, a research organization in Britain. Until the Turkish government recently curtailed the practice, stores habitually offered to sell almost anything on installment, even a pair of jeans.The debt overhang adds to the stress on the Turkish economy, which is already intense. Debt by the Turkish private sector, including businesses other than banks, totals more than 60 percent of gross domestic product. That is one of the highest levels among developing countries, according to Oxford Economics.An additional danger is that foreign investors are increasingly less willing to finance this debt, preferring to deploy their money in the United States and Europe as those regions grow faster and offer better returns. The danger is seen in Turkey\u2019s current-account deficit, a measure of how much imports exceed exports. The deficit of 7.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2013 is really a representation of how much more Turks were spending than they were earning. Such a deficit is sustainable only as long as foreigners are willing to keep extending credit. Signs suggest they are not. That means the boom in consumer spending stops suddenly, forcing a sharp decline in living standards.In response, the Turkish central bank has raised official interest rates sharply. The move seems to have stabilized the lira from further declines, but it has raised the cost of borrowing, which will slow the economy. Fewer people will shop if they can\u2019t buy on credit.Some analysts say the amount of consumer debt in Turkey, about $131 billion, is not big enough to threaten the country\u2019s banks in the way that subprime mortgages, and securities tied to them, undermined the health of banks in the United States and other nations.They say that because Turkish banks are considered well capitalized and the number of problem loans, at less than 5 percent of the total, is considered low. But S.&P. warned in its report that the official numbers may understate the scope of problem loans. Banks may be allowing debtors to take out new loans to repay old ones, rather than classifying the loans as being in arrears.In a slower economy, it will be even more difficult for low-income people like Mr. Yuksel to get pay raises or better jobs that would help them escape indebtedness. Umit Kumcuoglu, chief executive of Kare Investment and Securities, an Istanbul fund manager, said Turkey needed to do more to improve the climate for business and increase exports. \u201cThe way to achieve that is through entrepreneurship,\u201d Mr. Kumcuoglu said.Instead, Mr. Yuksel earns the equivalent of about $420 a month working for a lighting shop. When a customer buys a fixture, he installs it in the customer\u2019s home.A slightly built man with a dark beard and sad eyes, Mr. Yuksel grew up in a village in eastern Turkey and is among the millions of people who have migrated from poor rural areas to Istanbul, looking for better opportunities and swelling the city\u2019s population to more than 10 million.After Mr. Yuksel received his first credit card, banks kept sending him more offers, he said. Within a year and a half he had eight credit cards, and was borrowing from new cards to make payments on old ones. The Turkish Central Bank has become concerned about outrageous interest payments. In December it imposed a cap on credit card interest payments of 27 percent per year. The permissible rate can still be as high as 35 percent for people who are behind in their payments.That does not help Mr. Yuksel much. At first he used the cards only for necessities like food, he said, but later succumbed to temptation and bought items such as a plasma television and a refrigerator.Mr. Yuksel consolidated his debt on two cards and canceled the rest. Still, by 2011, he said, the payments on the credit cards exceeded $1,000 a month, more than twice his salary.Soon the banks started to call. One day in 2012 a collection agency came to Mr. Yuksel\u2019s workplace during business hours, shaming him in front of co-workers, he said. Now the agency takes a quarter of his net income every month. About an additional quarter goes to support his 8-year-old daughter from a previous marriage.Mr. Yuksel\u2019s second wife and their newborn live on what is left. He said they sometimes go for two months without eating meat. It will take him six or seven years to repay just the debt to one bank, he said. Then it will be the other bank\u2019s turn. Turkish law has no provision for personal bankruptcy, and, in any case, failing to repay a debt is considered a deep dishonor.\u201cI blame myself,\u201d Mr. Yuksel said. \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t I more careful?\u201dBut he is also angry at the banks. \u201cThey saw how much I was paid,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are given this card beyond your means. It sits in your pocket. No matter how hard you try, you spend it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft\u2019s Stakes in the Battle for Handsets", "Date": "2014-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseWhen Microsoft announced in September that it was buying Nokia\u2019s struggling handset business and would meld its Windows operating system with the devices, it offered two major reasons for the $7.2 billion deal:\u25a0 Apple and Google were already combining their software and hardware.\u25a0 The deal would ensure the survival of Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system in a mobile universe.That was then. Last month, Google threw in the towel on its foray into handsets, selling its Motorola Mobility division to Lenovo of China for $2.91 billion.So much for Microsoft\u2019s rationale. Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s incoming chief executive, faces some urgent questions: Does the Nokia deal still make sense? And how does Microsoft expect to survive, let alone prosper, in a cutthroat hardware market where Google is giving up?The basic problem for Microsoft is that most consumers have already chosen an operating system.\u201cGoogle has won,\u201d said Nicholas Economides, an economics professor at the Stern School of Business of New York University, and currently a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley who specializes in network economics and electronic commerce. \u201cWe\u2019re in a world where the biggest market share by far is Android. And the second-biggest is Apple. Then, way behind, is Microsoft. What\u2019s in this game for Microsoft?\u201dFrom Microsoft\u2019s perspective, the answer may be that it is in a different war \u2014 one that isn\u2019t over handsets or even the operating systems embedded in them, but the ecosystem of applications and services that sit on top of them. And if that\u2019s the case, Microsoft had little choice but to double down on Nokia and its handsets, since the alternative would be worse.In an email to Microsoft employees on Feb. 4, his first day as chief executive, Mr. Nadella said, \u201cOur job is to ensure that Microsoft thrives in a mobile and cloud-first world.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to imagine how Microsoft could be \u201cmobile and cloud-first\u201d without mobile.Microsoft\u2019s \u201cobjective is to get to the point where Windows phones would be able to use Microsoft software and applications for PCs and tablets,\u201d Professor Economides said. \u201cIf they can get there, that would be a huge win. They could leverage all their applications and be a formidable competitor. But they\u2019re not there. Saying that\u2019s the objective doesn\u2019t mean it will happen.\u201dKirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore Partners who covers Microsoft, agreed that the company had little choice. \u201cIt was a fairly low-risk way for Microsoft to dip its toe into the market and try to extend Windows\u2019 relevance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be pretty. They\u2019re already running uphill. But investors have very low expectations. If Microsoft can regain any momentum, it\u2019s all upside for them.\u201dWith $83 billion in cash on its balance sheet, Microsoft\u2019s investment in Nokia is relatively modest.In its last earnings report as a handset manufacturer, Nokia said last month that the handset division it was selling to Microsoft lost 201 million euros in the fourth quarter and sales fell 29 percent. Microsoft has said it needs to sell 50 million Lumia units a year to break even, and it is nowhere near that yet.Google seems to have made only a halfhearted effort in its foray into handsets, but its numbers were also grim. Under Google, Motorola had operating losses of $1.1 billion in 2012 and $645 million for the first nine months of 2013.But analysts I interviewed said Microsoft may not have the luxury that Google did of abandoning a money-losing handset operation. \u201cMicrosoft doesn\u2019t have the same hand to play as Google,\u201d said Ken Sena, the Evercore analyst who covers Google. Unlike Microsoft, Google does not have to worry about its ecosystem since Android is the largest handset operating system by far. Android ensures access for Google\u2019s search engine, which is where Google earns the bulk of its profit. Selling Motorola to Lenovo will strengthen a growing competitor to Samsung, even as it gets Google out of a business that put it in the awkward position of competing with some of its largest customers.Without Nokia\u2019s commitment to Windows, Microsoft was in danger of extinction on handsets. And Microsoft does not really have to worry about competing with partners who use Windows in their handsets, since there are so few.And at least, the deal buys Microsoft some time. \u201cMicrosoft needs to see how Windows works on a handset,\u201d Professor Economides said. \u201cHaving a division that does it for you is very useful. Otherwise you have to beg or persuade Samsung or someone else to make a Windows device. But Samsung already sells millions of Android phones, and it doesn\u2019t care about Windows.\u201d (Samsung does offer Windows on some phones and computers.)Then, there is Apple, which has succeeded in wringing high margins from its handset business. While Google may have given up, those margins are an attractive target for any competitor. Carlo Besenius, chief executive of the independent research firm Creative Global Investments and a persistent skeptic when it comes to Apple, said that Apple was especially vulnerable in price-sensitive emerging markets.Microsoft\u2019s strategy \u201cis much more suited for emerging economies, where there is limited consumer buying power and where smartphones are sold contract-free,\u201d Mr. Besenius said. \u201cWe see Microsoft\u2019s mobile strategy clearly to be more successful than Apple\u2019s\u201d because \u201cit focuses on the low-end to medium-priced segment.\u201d Although starting from a small base, Microsoft has made some progress. According to IDC, Windows Phone was the No. 2 smartphone operating system in nine markets, and shipped more units than Apple in 10 markets in 2013.Although Nokia hasn\u2019t formally announced that it will embrace Android for a line of entry-level handsets aimed at emerging markets, and Microsoft may well reverse that decision once it completes the acquisition, even that strategy may not be as crazy as it sounds. Microsoft would presumably be using a version of Android that places its own apps on top of the operating system, much as Amazon has done with its Kindle. \u201cPlacing Windows services on top of Android for low-end devices is as sensible as doing so for smart devices, \" said Horace Dediu, who worked at Nokia and is the founder of the consulting firm Asymco. \u201cAndroid without Google is just commodity plumbing.\u201dThen, if Microsoft can get entry-level customers to use its apps and services (like its Bing search engine and maps), they\u2019ll eventually move up to Windows smartphones. At least, that\u2019s the theory.\u201cMicrosoft has to learn to operate in a more heterogeneous operating system world,\u201d said Mr. Materne of Evercore, who has an overweight rating on Microsoft. \u201cI think the new chief executive understands that. It\u2019s the apps on top of the device that really matter. The margins on the devices aren\u2019t going to be what moves the needle for Microsoft.\u201dWhatever the outcome for Microsoft, some analysts predict that today\u2019s handset wars may some day be irrelevant. \u201cConsumer wearables are going to make mobile phones and tablets obsolete, and will dominate the entire personal communications market,\u201d Mr. Besenius predicted.So is Nokia \u2014 a part of the company it isn\u2019t selling to Microsoft.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An About-Face for the Stock Market\u2019s 5-Year Return", "Date": "2014-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesTake the long view. That\u2019s standard advice in investing, and it makes sense. After all, if you\u2019ve salted money away for a serious purpose like retiring or buying a house or paying for a child\u2019s education, you really don\u2019t want to focus on how the stock market has done today or on what it might do tomorrow. You need a longer perspective.But there\u2019s a fundamental problem with this otherwise sound guidance: How long is the long view? And what do you do if the basis of your long-term thinking changes radically from year to year? These aren\u2019t just theoretical questions. Because of a quirk in the calendar, such a cognitive shift has happened recently. And it suggests that the long view needs to be much longer than five years.Consider the five-year annualized returns of the stock market, which have undergone an astonishing improvement over the course of just one calendar year, from a net loss in the five years ended in 2012 to a hefty double-digit annualized gain in the five years ended in 2013.These five-year numbers often color the thinking of not just ordinary investors but sophisticated strategists as well. Open a year-end report for your 401(k) or IRA, and you may now see the 2013 numbers for your own investments and for comparable benchmarks. Along with more recent returns, those 2013 five-year returns are appearing on financial websites, and in mutual fund reports and brokerage letters. And they are used by consultants for pension funds and other institutional investors in formulating asset-allocation and risk-management strategies.Yet these five-year perspectives are very changeable. At the end of 2012, stocks\u2019 five-year record was dismal. Now, it looks fabulous. What\u2019s remarkable is that three of the years in each of those five-year records are exactly the same.Before considering what it might mean, let\u2019s look at how such a big change occurred in the five-year data. The numbers tell the story, if you examine them carefully. At the end of 2012, the annualized five-year return of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, without dividends, was a negative 0.6 percent. That means that if your portfolio mirrored the index, you lost some of your money (though, to be sure, dividends would have given you a small annualized gain of 1.7 percent). The main reason for these depressing figures was that the market hadn\u2019t fully recovered from the devastation of 2008 and early 2009. That period was a nightmare for the markets and the economy. In 2008 alone, the S. & P. 500 dropped 38.5 percent, without dividends. After such losses, many investors came to an understandable conclusion: that the market was an inhospitable place. And they walked \u2014 or ran \u2014 away from it.But at the end of 2013, if you relied solely on the five-year trailing numbers, you would have had reason to kick yourself for being out of the stock market. That\u2019s because the annualized five-year return had climbed to 15.4 percent without dividends, and 17.9 percent with them. If you had invested in the index over those five years, you would have more than doubled your money. Why did the five-year return change so much in just one year? First and foremost, on Dec. 31, 2013, the entire ghastly year of 2008 was effectively wiped off the books, from the standpoint of the five-year return. That tally started near a market low in 2009, and the results of 2013 became part of the record, too. And 2013 was spectacular, with a gain of 29.6 percent for the S. & P. 500 without dividends, and 32.4 percent when you include them. In short, the five-year view in 2012 and 2013 produced two very different narratives. The view backward at the end of 2012 was a cautionary tale about the risks of stock investing. The five-year view just one year later was all about the rewards of risk-taking. Which one should you rely upon for guidance?Neither is enough if you\u2019re trying to be a long-term investor. A much longer time period seems in order. For example, the stock market has tended to outperform the bond market in the past. (That\u2019s probably because investors demand a premium for the greater risk involved in stock investing, according to prevailing theory.) This has been true, on average, for many decades \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t true during the financial crisis. In order to count on a long-term trend like this, you may need to stay in the markets for 20 years or more \u2014 maybe for a lifetime, or even several lifetimes. That may not be easy to accept.Five-year returns may tell you what worked in the past, but the conclusions to be drawn from that may be counterintuitive. \u201cSuccess means market prices have already risen,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen prices are high, it may mean that you should be looking for something else.\u201d Professional strategists live in a world where such price distinctions are crucial. But for the long-term investor, basic diversification and asset allocation may be enough, he said. \u201cIf you follow the basics, that\u2019s 80 percent of it,\u201d he said. \u201cGuys like me are trying to improve your returns for what\u2019s left after that.\u201dAt least this much is clear: The long view may need to be very long indeed. Sometimes five years aren\u2019t nearly enough. Advertisement"}

The group accounts for about 85 percent of the global economy.\u201cWe will develop ambitious but realistic policies with the aim to lift our collective G.D.P. by more than 2 percent above the trajectory implied by current policies over the coming 5 years,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 read.Joe Hockey, the Australian treasurer and host for the meeting, described the plan as a new day for cooperation in the G-20.\u201cWe are putting a number to it for the first time \u2014 putting a real number to what we are trying to achieve,\u201d Mr. Hockey told a news conference. \u201cWe want to add over $2 trillion more in economic activity and tens of millions of new jobs.\u201dThe deal was also something of a feather in the cap of Mr. Hockey, who spearheaded the push for growth in the face of some skepticism, notably from Germany.\u201cWhat growth rates can be achieved is a result of a very complicated process,\u201d Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, said after the meeting. \u201cThe results of this process cannot be guaranteed by politicians.\u201dAustralia is president of the G-20 this year, following Russia in 2013 and ahead of Turkey next year.The growth plan borrows wholesale from an International Monetary Fund paper prepared for the Sydney meeting, which estimated that structural overhauls would raise world economic output about 0.5 percent per year over the next five years, increasing global output $2.25 trillion.The I.M.F. has forecast global growth of 3.75 percent for this year and 4 percent in 2015.There was a nod to concerns by emerging nations that the Federal Reserve consider the effects of its policy tapering \u2014 its gradual reduction in economic stimulation efforts \u2014 which has led to some capital flight from more vulnerable markets.\u201cAll our central banks maintain their commitment that monetary policy settings will continue to be carefully calibrated and clearly communicated in the context of ongoing exchange of information and being mindful of impacts on the global economy,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 read.There was never much expectation the Fed would consider actually slowing the pace of tapering, but its emerging peers had at least hoped for more cooperation on policy.Mr. Hockey said that there had been honest discussions among members on the effects of tapering and that Janet L. Yellen, the newly installed Fed chairwoman, had been \u201chugely impressive\u201d when dealing with them.The G-20 also stated that it \u201cdeeply regrets\u201d that progress on giving emerging nations more say in the International Monetary Fund had stalled.Major emerging powers, including India, China, Brazil and Russia, have long lobbied for increased voting power in the I.M.F. to reflect their growing share of the world economy, but the changes agreed to in 2010 have been blocked by the .United States Congress.The G-20 urged the. United States to ratify the overhauls before the next meeting of policy makers in April.The group is also progressing with plans to \u201cmake sure multinational companies pay their fair share,\u201d said Jack Lew, United States Treasury secretary.Big budget deficits and revelations that companies such as Apple and Google use structures that lawmakers have labeled \u201ccontrived\u201d to avoid billions of dollars in taxes, have led to growing calls to close corporate tax loopholes.

{"Headline": "Steel Industry Feeling Stress as Automakers Turn to Aluminum", "Date": "2014-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDEARBORN, Mich. \u2014 For nearly a century, Ford\u2019s River Rouge factory and its neighboring steel mill have worked in close harmony to produce some of America\u2019s most popular vehicles, from the Model A to the F-150 pickup truck.But ever since Ford announced last month that it would make the body of its new F-150 mostly out of aluminum, that steel maker, which was spun off by Ford in 1989, has faced the unsettling prospect that its longtime partner is drifting away.Carmakers\u2019 shift to aluminum has raised apprehension among steel makers, which have been fighting an increasingly uphill battle simply to maintain their business. Now, they are trying to respond, making lighter, stronger steel in a bid to retain one of their most important customers, the automakers.\u201cThe traditional view has been steel or nothing else,\u201d said Saikat Dey, chief executive of Severstal North America, the United States subsidiary of Russia\u2019s Severstal Group, which now owns the Rouge steel operations. \u201cI think we all need to accept the reality that we live in a mixed-material world.\u201dSteel makers, which have been riding a wave of prosperity as the economy has recovered, have a lot to lose. Automakers account for about 20 percent of annual sales overall for American steel makers, the second most important source of revenue after the construction business, according to the Steel Marketing Development Institute.For those companies with historic ties to the auto industry, the loss would be more acute. At Severstal\u2019s Dearborn factory, for example, carmakers including Ford and others account for 70 percent of sales, the company said, though it declined to give specific figures for Ford.The shift to aluminum is gaining momentum. Automakers are under increasing pressure to meet strict new fuel-economy standards by 2025, and their use of lighter aluminum is expected to double between 2008 and 2025, according to Ducker Worldwide, a research firm in Troy, Mich.As a result, Severstal sees little choice but to move toward making advanced \u2014 and lighter \u2014 high-strength steel. \u201cThe F-150 is a big turning point,\u201d said Andrew Lane, a metals analyst with Morningstar. \u201cIt\u2019s a bold effort by Ford.\u201dOther steel makers are changing their ways, too. United States Steel has invested $400 million in a joint venture with Kobe Steel of Japan to make advanced high-strength steel in a Leipsic, Ohio, factory expected to produce 500,000 tons annually.The consideration by carmakers of using more aluminum is actually opening up opportunities for producers of advanced steel, according to Jody Shaw, manager of automotive technical marketing at U.S. Steel. \u201cIt\u2019s those little changes that they\u2019re willing to accept that\u2019s creating an opportunity,\u201d Mr. Shaw said.Inside Severstal\u2019s steel mill on a cold January day, hissing heavy machinery removed oxides from steel sheets, reducing their thickness to the equivalent of five human hairs.\u201cWe\u2019re sold as a raw commodity, but we\u2019re built to specifications,\u201d said Jim Mortensen, Severstal\u2019s director of technical business development. \u201cThese are parts that are customized within one-hundredth of a millimeter.\u201dAs steel becomes more advanced, Mr. Mortensen said, \u201cthe challenge is making it strong and retaining its formability.\u201dThis batch of coils coming off the line is a high-strength, low-alloy blend that will most likely show up in the body structure of a Cadillac CTS sedan. At the coating factory next door, machines dip steel sheets to be used for body panels in molten zinc to protect them. These are headed for Mexico, to Navistar\u2019s stamping plant there.Steel makers argue that they still have advantages in price \u2014 aluminum can cost as much as three times more \u2014 and flexibility, both for the manufacturer and the mechanic who will be fixing the car.\u201cWhen you build a mass-produced vehicle, you really need to think about the consequences of the supply chain and repair and insurance costs,\u201d Mr. Dey said.But despite their confidence in some of their advantages, steel makers face an uncertain future, analysts say.Automakers are scrambling to meet demanding new federal fuel-efficiency standards that will require a fleetwide average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, a significant boost from the roughly 25 m.p.g. that vehicles average today.When four major steel companies had quarterly earnings calls with analysts last month, \u201cthey all said as a constant refrain, \u2018Steel remains the material of choice for now,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lane said.\u201cLooking out over the next five years, that could be a different story,\u201d Mr. Lane said, adding, \u201cAluminum is so much lighter, there\u2019s only so much the steel guys can do.\u201dUntil now, automakers largely have tried to meet the fuel-economy mandates with smaller cars as well as slow-selling hybrid and electric vehicles. The challenge lies in continuing to provide the larger, and more profitable, vehicles that buyers want.Enter the new F-150.\u201cThe heavier the truck, the more lightweighting can be achieved by the switch to aluminum,\u201d Mr. Lane said.This is a battle that has played out before, notably when Audi introduced its mainly aluminum R8 sedan in 2007. Aluminum is also used in smaller quantities by Land Rover, Mercedes, Mazda and Tesla. General Motors uses aluminum in the hoods of its pickup trucks and full-size sport utility vehicles, as well as for components of the Cadillac ATS and CTS and Chevrolet Corvette Stingray. The Detroit automaker said it planned to incorporate more lightweight materials in its next-generation pickup truck.\u201cSometimes there is a push from the aluminum side, and they win over with a particular model, and steel tends to be the comeback kid, with more innovation,\u201d said Felix Schuler, a Munich-based partner in the Boston Consulting Group\u2019s metals and mining practice. Over all, he said, it\u2019s a \u201chealthy race.\u201dFord said its new Mustang would have a hood, fenders and other components made of aluminum to reduce weight and improve fuel economy.\u201cOur approach with any material is that we treat each vehicle on a case-by-case basis, applying the right material at the right time to improve efficiency and performance,\u201d said Said Deep, a Ford spokesman.Even before the recent interest in aluminum, steel makers confronted a threat from the use of plastic in body panels. The ill-fated Pontiac Fiero in the 1980s, for example, had plastic body panels, which helped save on weight but were not strong or rigid enough.What seems certain is that ordinary steel is likelier to lose out to its new and improved cousin than to aluminum, Mr. Schuler said. Advanced steel materials that are lighter, stronger and cheaper represent a middle ground between the metals.\u201cIt could be in absolute terms one of the most winning materials,\u201d Mr. Schuler said of the new steel.But at the same time, demand from automakers for aluminum is soaring, expected to reach one billion pounds this year, up from 200 million in 2012, and to grow by more than 30 percent annually through 2020.Aluminum companies are making expensive bets on this future, building plants and reconfiguring factories to meet anticipated demand. So far, these investments are paying off: They are selling out their automotive capacity as fast as they can build it, according to analysts.Novelis is investing nearly $550 million to upgrade plants in Oswego, N.Y., and Nachterstedt, Germany, and to build a new factory in Changzhou, China, to triple its capacity from a year ago to 900,000 tons annually. It expects the auto industry to account for 25 percent of its business in two years, up from just 6 percent two years ago.Alcoa, the country\u2019s biggest aluminum producer, is investing about $670 million in its Iowa, Tennessee and Saudi Arabia facilities.But all eyes will be on how well the F-150 is embraced and whether a pickup made out of aluminum will be rugged enough in the eyes of consumers. Ford sold 763,402 F-150 pickup trucks last year; it has not given a 2014 sales projection.For Severstal, such competition from aluminum would have been hard to imagine, even 10 years ago. The River Rouge campus was the world\u2019s first experiment in automotive integration, and it provided the roots of just-in-time manufacturing, said Robert Casey, the retired curator of transportation at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn.\u201cHenry Ford was a control freak, and he wanted to control as much of the manufacturing as possible,\u201d Mr. Casey said. \u201cHe made the steel, he made the glass, he made the tires.\u201dWhen Japanese automakers visited after World War II, Mr. Casey said, \u201cthey copied a whole lot of what was going on at the Rouge.\u201dToday, the factory is once again a leader in innovation, but this time, it is to see whether aluminum proves a viable material for body panels, he said.\u201cIf Ford makes this work,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can see the rest of the industry following.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Venezuela, Protest Ranks Grow Broader", "Date": "2014-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAntigovernment protesters in San Crist\u00f3bal and other cities in Venezuela have taken to the streets, an outpouring attributed to a litany of problems that have long bedeviled the country \u2014 high inflation, high crime, chronic shortages of basic goods, like milk and toilet paper, and more recently, a\u00a0 government crackdown on public dissent.SAN CRIST\u00d3BAL, Venezuela \u2014 As dawn broke, the residents of a quiet neighborhood here readied for battle. Some piled rocks to be used as projectiles. Others built barricades. A pair of teenagers made firebombs as the adults looked on.These were not your ordinary urban guerrillas. They included a manicurist, a medical supplies saleswoman, a schoolteacher, a businessman and a hardware store worker.As the National Guard roared around the corner on motorcycles and in an armored riot vehicle, the people in this tightly knit middle-class neighborhood, who on any other Monday morning would have been heading to work or taking their children to school, rushed into the street, hurling rocks and shouting obscenities. The guardsmen responded with tear gas and shotgun fire, leaving a man bleeding in a doorway.\u201cWe\u2019re normal people, but we\u2019re all affected by what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Carlos Alviarez, 39, who seemed vaguely bewildered to find himself in the middle of the street where the whiff of tear gas lingered. \u201cLook. I\u2019ve got a rock in my hand and I\u2019m the distributor for Adidas eyewear in Venezuela.\u201dThe biggest protests since the death of the longtime leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez nearly a year ago are sweeping Venezuela, rapidly expanding from the student protests that began this month on a campus in this western city into a much broader array of people across the country. On Monday, residents in Caracas, the capital, and other Venezuelan cities piled furniture, tree limbs, chain-link fence, sewer grates and washing machines to block roads in a coordinated action against the government.Behind the outpouring is more than the litany of problems that have long bedeviled Venezuela, a country with the world\u2019s largest oil reserves but also one of the highest inflation rates. Adding to the perennial frustrations over violent crime and chronic shortages of basic goods like milk and toilet paper, the outrage is being fueled by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s aggressive response to public dissent, including deploying hundreds of soldiers here and sending fighter jets to make low, threatening passes over the city.On Monday, the state governor, who belongs to Mr. Maduro\u2019s party, broke ranks and challenged the president\u2019s tactics, defending the right of students to protest and criticizing the flyovers, a rare dissent from within the government.Polarization is a touchstone of Venezuelan politics, which was bitterly divided during the 14-year presidency of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, Mr. Maduro\u2019s mentor. But while Mr. Ch\u00e1vez would excoriate and punish opponents, he had keen political instincts and often seemed to know when to back off just enough to keep things from boiling over.Two people were killed on Monday, including a man here in San Crist\u00f3bal who, according to his family, fell from a roof after guardsmen shot tear gas at him. There is disagreement on whether all the deaths nationwide cited by the government are directly associated with the protests, but the death toll is probably at least a dozen.In the neighborhood of Barrio Sucre, residents said they were outraged last week when a guardsman fired a shotgun at a woman and her adult son, sending both to the hospital with serious wounds. In response, the residents built barricades to keep the guardsmen out. On Monday, after guardsmen made an early sortie into the neighborhood, firing tear gas and buckshot at people\u2019s homes, the inflamed and sometimes terrified residents prepared to drive them back.Across town, Isbeth Zambrano, 39, a mother of two, still fumed about the time two days earlier when the National Guard drove onto the street, where children were playing, and fired tear gas at residents. Now she sat in front of her apartment building, casually guarding a beer crate full of firebombs.\u201cWe want this government to go away,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want freedom, no more crime, we want medicine.\u201d Around her neck, like a scarf, she wore a diaper printed with small teddy bears. It was soaked in vinegar, to ward off the effects of tear gas, in case of another attack.Mr. Maduro\u2019s stance is mirrored by the intensity among the protesters. While he has called for a national conference on Wednesday and some opposition politicians have urged dialogue, a majority of protesters here, most of them longtime government opponents, rejected that option.\u201cThey\u2019ve been mocking us for 15 years, sacking the country,\u201d said Ram\u00f3n Arellano, 54, a government worker, while a burning refrigerator in the street behind him blotted out the sky with a cone of black smoke. \u201cA dialogue from one side while the other turns a deaf ear, that\u2019s not fair.\u201dLike most of the protesters here, Mr. Arellano said he wanted a change of government. Protesters say that could be achieved by having Mr. Maduro resign, or be removed through a recall election or changes to the Constitution.Mr. Maduro says he will not leave office, and he continues to have wide support among those loyal to Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s legacy.T\u00e1chira State, and especially San Crist\u00f3bal, the state capital, are longtime opposition strongholds. The opposition presidential candidate, Henrique Capriles, received 73 percent of the vote in San Crist\u00f3bal when he ran against Mr. Maduro last April.A city of 260,000, San Crist\u00f3bal was almost completely shut down on Monday. Residents had set up dozens of barricades all around town. In many areas, residents set out nails or drove pieces of rebar into the pavement, leaving them partly exposed, to puncture tires.In Barrio Sucre, Escarlet Pedraza, 19, showed two motorcycles that she said had been crushed by National Guard troops, who drove armored vehicles over them. She recorded the event on her cellphone camera.Later, residents burned tires and threw rocks at guardsmen, who advanced and entered a side street, firing tear gas and shotguns directly at the houses.The guardsmen broke open a garage door in one house and smashed the windshield of a car inside. The house next door filled with tear gas and the family inside, including two young children, choked in the fumes. \u201cI\u2019m indignant,\u201d said Victoria P\u00e9rez, the mother, weeping. \u201cThis is getting out of hand. It\u2019s arrogance, it\u2019s a desire for power.\u201dA student, his face covered with a cloth, kicked angrily at a house where a pro-government family lives, shouting at them to join the protest. Other residents rushed in to stop him.Nearby, a neighbor, Teresa Contreras, 53, flipped through the channels on her television, showing that there was no coverage of the violence, a sign, she said, of the government control over the news media.Earlier, Andrea Altuve, 38, a teacher, watched the preparations for the coming battle, with people adding to barricades and children pouring gasoline into beer bottles for makeshift bombs.\u201cIt looks like a civil war,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are sending the National Guard into the neighborhoods out of fear.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Crusader on What Ails Artists", "Date": "2014-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPITTSBURGH \u2014 Beer bottles clinked and indie-rock classics played overhead at a gallery opening here on a Friday night recently, as one artist after another chatted with Julie Sokolow, a filmmaker and health care advocate who has documented the Pittsburgh scene in detail.There was Eanna Holton, who makes horror masks and props and recalled spending the last five years paying off a $10,000 surgery bill for her toddler. China Horrell, her co-worker, had a pulmonary embolism that cost more than $100,000 to treat. And Daniel McCloskey, a comic-book artist, told of being uninsured when he smashed his teeth in a bicycle accident last year, at a cost of more than $22,000.\u201cJulie\u2019s work unearthed what was obvious but hidden at the same time,\u201d said Dan Byers, a curator at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh who helped judge a \u201cHealthy Artists\u201d poster competition that is featured in the documentary. \u201cIt brought the more abstract national debate into a very specific, concrete, local context.\u201dMs. Sokolow, who grew up in New Jersey and studied psychology and fiction writing at the University of Pittsburgh, said the origins of her project came through her volunteer work at a nonprofit organization, HealthCare 4 All PA. Assigned to film interviews with people who had dire health care problems, she was troubled by a lack of involvement among 20-somethings.In response, the \u201cHealthy Artists\u201d series was conceived as a kind of \u201cindie \u2018Cribs\u2019 for social justice,\u201d profiling young creatives in brief vignettes and getting them talking in a personal way about medical issues. The pieces were collected online and publicized through social media.The goal, Ms. Sokolow said, was not to dwell on tragedies but to approach the problem with some optimism and use the films to advocate for broad reform through the idea that basic health care is a human right.\u201cI wanted to take a more positive approach, to not just focus on health care horror stories, but the people who would be empowered by a universal health care system,\u201d Ms. Sokolow said. \u201cLook at the work they are able to do without it. Imagine what they\u2019d be able to do if they had a social safety net.\u201dYet part of the power of the vignettes is how they detail the frustrations of freelancers in an economy in which health insurance has historically been tied to employment. In one profile, Jennifer Gooch demonstrated some of her work as a \u201cmusician, artist, crafter, maker, doer,\u201d before tearfully recounting how she had declared bankruptcy after getting an $18,000 medical bill that included a colonoscopy.\u201cJulie\u2019s ability to reach out through social media and connect artists and culture to a critical social policy issue is significant,\u201d said Jim Ferlo, a Pennsylvania state senator who has introduced a single-payer health care bill. \u201cI wish we could multiply her around the country.\u201dA subtext in the \u201cHealthy Artists\u201d films, and in Ms. Sokolow\u2019s wider advocacy, is a challenge to the notion that artists must suffer outside the basic economic protections of society. A single-payer health care system, offering coverage to all, could solve that problem, at least as far as it applies to health. But an important step, Ms. Sokolow said, is persuading artists simply to stand up for themselves and address a problem that is felt by all but rarely talked about.\u201cI would like for artists to be advocates for themselves and their own health and not buy into stereotypes,\u201d Ms. Sokolow said. \u201cThe people I profiled are working hard and trying to be healthy, and working against a society that\u2019s not allowing that for them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Vote No, Hope Yes\u2019 Defines Dysfunction in Congress", "Date": "2014-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 After the shutdown, the filibusters and years of stalled bills, it was the actual passage of legislation this week that revealed the true depth of congressional dysfunction.The House vote to raise the debt limit and stifle the budget wars was remarkable not only for its lack of brinkmanship, but for the vote count itself. The 28 members of the Republican majority who voted for the bill \u2014 a meager 12 percent \u2014 was the lowest percentage for a majority on passage since the House began publishing electronic data on votes in 1991. It has to rank among the lowest ever for a body defined by strict majority rule.Not to be outdone, the Senate on Wednesday flirted with a market crisis as Republicans were initially reluctant to provide a handful of votes to overcome a procedural hurdle before clearing the way for the Senate to send President Obama legislation that takes the debt limit off the table until March 2015.The results in both the Senate and House illustrate the countervailing political forces at work on Capitol Hill and how the current partisan environment makes governing so difficult.For a bill to pass the House with such scant support from the party in control, most members of the Republican majority had to quietly want it to pass to avoid the real-world consequences \u2014 an economy-rattling default \u2014 while being able to vote against it to dodge a backlash from conservative activists threatening repercussions. It was the purest incarnation yet of what has become known as the Vote No, Hope Yes Caucus.The Senate vote was similar. Most Republicans badly wanted the debt limit to be raised \u2014 particularly since the House had already left town and Wall Street was unlikely to look kindly on a potential default. They just did not want their fingerprints on it.The implications for governing are obvious. If many lawmakers are unwilling or refuse to vote for legislation that they understand to be necessary, and even beneficial, out of fear of retribution from an empowered and outspoken wing of their party, reaching agreement on major policy like immigration becomes difficult if not impossible.\u201cThe incentives are not aligned,\u201d one House Republican acknowledged in conceding that the debt limit vote was not exactly what the framers intended when they drew up the plans for how the House would operate.Reinforcing the point about perverse incentives, House Republicans who managed to vote against a debt limit increase that they sincerely wanted to pass could be rewarded by avoiding a primary challenger fueled by the debt issue. They are also likely to earn higher ratings on conservative scorecards that severely penalize lawmakers who back a debt increase.As for Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, no doubt some conservative House members who are eager for another debt limit dust-up are angry with him for allowing the measure to go through without any strings attached. But many others are grateful to the speaker for finding a way to spare them the vote and spare their party another bruising in public opinion polls when Republicans are feeling very good about their midterm election prospects.Mr. Boehner faces an immediate question. Having again shown a willingness to violate the so-called Hastert rule \u2014 the unwritten code that legislation should pass the House only with a majority of the majority \u2014 will he now be willing to take a similar approach on other major issues, namely immigration? After all, he and scores of other House Republicans are interested in overhauling the nation\u2019s immigration policy, and Mr. Boehner could easily shape a significant bipartisan majority if he teamed up Republicans who are willing to act on immigration with Democrats who are clamoring to do so. Democrats have encouraged him to just put a Senate-passed bill on the floor and pass it with mainly Democratic votes, as he did with the debt ceiling increase.But that is unlikely to happen. Mr. Boehner is no fan of the Senate plan, and he would like the House to act on a series of immigration-related proposals rather than one sweeping bill like the Senate did. But another significant reason immigration legislation will not get the same treatment as the debt limit bill is that Republicans see no deadline or looming crisis that will force the issue.If advocates of immigration changes want Mr. Boehner to plunge ahead, they may need to amp up the pressure.For the most part, Mr. Boehner has turned to Democratic votes when he has exhausted other options and faced a potential catastrophe like running off the fiscal cliff. He did allow a renewal of the Violence Against Women Act to pass with predominantly Democratic votes, but House Republicans had earlier advanced their own version. In all previous cases, the number of Republicans joining Democrats was well over 28 \u2014 87 Republicans in the violence against women bill. Recent comparable episodes brought to mind by this week\u2019s House vote were the 2002 vote to overhaul campaign finance laws. Just 41 of Republicans in the majority \u2014 18 percent \u2014 sided with most Democrats to pass that landmark legislation. It was opposed by the House leadership, but enough Republicans joined with Democrats on a petition to force it to the floor, setting off a fevered debate.In the Democratically controlled House in 2007, 41 Democrats \u2014 again, 18 percent \u2014 combined with Republicans in the minority to extend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Democrats argued that the law went too far but agreed to renew it for fear of being portrayed as soft on terrorism.Democrats and their allies saw the Republican capitulation on the debt limit as a victory, since they have taken a stand against Republicans using the legislation as a bargaining chip. But it will remain hard for either party to post legislative victories if lawmakers continue to see it in their interest to oppose measures they really want to pass.Derek Willis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Faster Job Growth in Service Sector ", "Date": "2014-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGrowth picked up in the service sector in January, with steady strength in private sector hiring, suggesting that the severe winter weather over the last several weeks had a limited effect on the economy.The data issued on Wednesday eased some concerns that arose from a recent run of weaker-than-expected reports on sales of durable goods, manufacturing activity and January car sales, which were affected in part by the heavy snow and ice that have hit large parts of the country.Private employers added 175,000 jobs in January, the smallest gain since August, according to the payrolls processor ADP, in part because of the weather. December\u2019s increase in jobs was revised down to 227,000 from the initially reported 238,000, according to the report, produced by ADP and Moody\u2019s Analytics.The overall pace of job growth was not far off ADP\u2019s recent trend. Combined with upturns in service sector indexes from the Institute for Supply Management and the financial data firm Markit, the data raised hopes among economists that the Labor Department\u2019s employment report on Friday would show that hiring rebounded in January after a weak December, which showed a gain of just 74,000 jobs.\u201cADP offset some of the concern from the weak December payrolls report and showed that the labor market is pretty much where it was most of last year,\u201d said Omair Sharif, senior United States economist at RBS Americas.After two months of slower growth, the Institute for Supply Management said its services index rose to 54 last month from 53 in December, and businesses added workers at the fastest clip in more than three years. The 50 level separates expansion from contraction.The ADP report is often viewed as a precursor to the government\u2019s employment report. A Reuters survey of economists showed that on average they estimated that 185,000 jobs were created last month, all of them in the private sector.January was the 49th consecutive month the I.S.M. index was above 50, though the pace of growth has slowed from a more than seven-year high.Subindexes on business activity and new orders also showed improved growth, easing some concern caused by an I.S.M. manufacturing report that showed the new-orders index had its biggest drop in 33 years in January. The employment index rose to 56.4, the highest level since November 2010.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Approves Higher Debt Limit Without Condition", "Date": "2014-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Ending three years of brinkmanship in which the threat of a devastating default on the nation\u2019s debt was used to wring conservative concessions from President Obama, the House on Tuesday voted to raise the government\u2019s borrowing limit until March 2015, without any conditions.Simply by holding the vote, Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio effectively ended a three-year Tea Party-inspired era of budget showdowns that had raised the threat of default and government shutdowns, rattled economic confidence and brought serious scrutiny from other nations questioning Washington\u2019s ability to govern. In the process, though, Mr. Boehner also set off a series of reprisals from fellow Republican congressmen and outside groups that showcased the party\u2019s deep internal divisions.\u201cHe gave the president exactly what he wanted, which is exactly what the Republican Party said we did not want,\u201d said a Republican representative, Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, who last year unsuccessfully tried to rally enough support to derail Mr. Boehner\u2019s re-election as speaker. \u201cIt\u2019s going to really demoralize the base.\u201dThe vote was a victory for President Obama, Democrats and those Senate Republicans who have argued that spending money for previously incurred obligations was essential for the financial standing of the federal government. \u201cTonight\u2019s vote is a positive step in moving away from the political brinkmanship that\u2019s a needless drag on our economy,\u201d Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. But outside Republican groups were sharply critical of the speaker. Both the Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America, for example, had put out a \u201ckey vote\u201d alert urging members to vote against the measure.\u201cA clean debt ceiling is a complete capitulation on the speaker\u2019s part and demonstrates that he has lost the ability to lead the House of Representatives, let alone his own party,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots. \u201cIt is time for him to go.\u201dSenator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, commended the speaker and promised to pass the bill as soon as possible. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to see the House is legislating the way they should have legislated for a long time,\u201d he said.But Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, said Tuesday in a statement that he planned to object to any attempt to raise the debt ceiling with a minimum of 51 votes, instead of requiring 60 votes \u2014 meaning at least five Republicans would have to vote with the full Democratic caucus \u2014 to get to final passage.\u00a0\u201cIf Republicans stand together, we can demand meaningful spending restraint to help pull our nation back from the fiscal and economic cliff,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.\u00a0Mr. Boehner stunned House Republicans on Tuesday morning when he dropped a package that would have tied the debt ceiling increase to a repeal of cuts to military retirement pensions that had been approved in December and announced he would put a \u201cclean\u201d debt ceiling increase up for a vote.Enough Republicans had balked at that package when it was presented Monday night to convince the speaker he had no choice but to turn to the Democratic minority. For Mr. Boehner it was a potentially momentous decision. Conservative activists, including the Tea Party Patriots, FreedomWorks, L. Brent Bozell\u2019s ForAmerica and commentators on the website RedState.com are all circulating petitions to end Mr. Boehner\u2019s speakership.And it was Mr. Boehner who raised such high expectations around the debt limit. In 2011, he established what has become known as the \u201cBoehner Rule\u201d: any debt ceiling increase was supposed to be offset by an equivalent spending cut.\u201cThis is a lost opportunity,\u201d the speaker conceded. \u201cWe could have sat down and worked together in a bipartisan manner to find cuts and reforms that are greater than increasing the debt limit. I am disappointed, to say the least.\u201dThe ramifications for Mr. Boehner are unclear. The speaker\u2019s supporters commended him for shepherding through an increase in the government\u2019s borrowing authority quickly and with as little damage as could be expected for his party, for the economy and the country. They said President Obama left leaders no choice once he dug in and refused to negotiate a deficit reduction deal attached to a debt-ceiling increase. For those few Republicans who supported the speaker, however, there were few good lessons to draw from the vote. \u201cI am disappointed we are not engaged in a more serious debate today,\u201d said Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the only Republican who spoke in favor of the debt limit bill. \u201cBut as disappointed as I am, I cannot in good conscience let the Democrats\u2019 refusal to engage lead to a default\u201d on the nation\u2019s debt.In a closed-door session Monday night, Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, accused the speaker of being in the pockets of the insurance industry, a charge that stirred outrage among many of his colleagues. Representative Tom Cotton, who is seeking a Senate seat in Arkansas, told Republican leaders they had put him into an impossible political position with his state\u2019s conservative voters. He would lose support if he voted for a debt ceiling increase, but he would also lose support if he voted against the military pension restoration then attached to the debt bill.The 28 Republicans who supported the bill were a coalition cobbled together from Republican leadership, moderates, and retiring members. Notably, however, not all of the top Republican leadership team voted for the measure. Representatives Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the No. 4 House Republican, and Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the party\u2019s 2012 vice-presidential nominee, both voted \u201cno.\u201dThat left allies of the speaker fuming that political considerations had left Republicans with no policy cover to accompany the debt ceiling increase.Representative Ted Yoho, a freshman Republican from Florida who voted in his first days in office to depose Mr. Boehner, was in a forgiving mood. \u201cWith that many people and that many personalities in there, it\u2019s hard to bring them all together on a common cause,\u201d he said.Most Republicans appeared content to move beyond the debt ceiling fight, focus on the 2014 campaign.\u201cHopefully we can win the Senate, and we can have a completely different conversation,\u201d said Representative James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican running for the Senate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Meeting With Obama, Governor Goes on the Attack", "Date": "2014-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It is definitely an election year in Washington.The annual meeting of the nation\u2019s governors at the White House tries to be the most bipartisan of affairs: The president praises the governors. The governors talk about solutions. Everyone grins broadly as the cameras click away.But on Monday, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, a Republican, veered off the script while standing on the driveway in front of the West Wing. Moments after leaving a private meeting with Mr. Obama and his fellow governors, Mr. Jindal interrupted a happy-talk news conference with a partisan attack.\u201cThe Obama economy is now the minimum-wage economy,\u201d Mr. Jindal said when it was his time at the microphone. As his colleagues stood, appearing surprised, Mr. Jindal ripped into the president, saying he should approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline and take other steps to improve the economy.He accused Mr. Obama of \u201cwaving the white flag of surrender.\u201dMr. Jindal\u2019s comments prompted an immediate crack in the veneer of cooperative spirit. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, Democrat of Connecticut, erupted, accusing Mr. Jindal of being overtly partisan.\u201cThat\u2019s the most insane statement I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Mr. Malloy said, prompting some immediate partisan arguing from the dozen or so governors assembled just steps from the Oval Office.At the White House press briefing on Monday afternoon, Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said: \u201cThe president is trying to create a national economy where the minimum wage is $10.10 an hour. Perhaps Governor Jindal prefers a Governor Jindal economy at $7.25 an hour, but the president certainly doesn\u2019t.\u201dEarlier in the morning, Mr. Obama had played down the differences he has with some of the nation\u2019s Republican governors. In remarks to the state officials in the State Dining Room, Mr. Obama said that his administration wanted to \u201cwork with you\u201d on the country\u2019s issues.\u201cAt the state level you guys are governed by practical considerations,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cYou want to do right by your people, and you see how good policy impacts your citizens, and you see how bad policy impacts your citizens, and that means that there\u2019s less room for posturing and politics and more room for getting stuff done.\u201dBut the president did not shy away from restating his priorities, many of which are fiercely opposed by Republican officials: an increase in the minimum wage, more money for preschool and continued progress in carrying out the Affordable Care Act.And with midterm elections right around the corner, it was perhaps inevitable that the bipartisan sheen would quickly be washed away. In his opening remarks, Mr. Obama joked about the ever-present politics in the nation\u2019s capital.\u201cI enjoyed watching some of you with your eyes on higher office size up the drapes \u2014 and each other,\u201d the president said, prompting laughter in the room.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Ukraine, Naming of Interim Government Gets Mixed Response", "Date": "2014-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 Standing before a crowd of tens of thousands in Independence Square, the center of the three-month civic uprising that ousted President Viktor F. Yanukovych, the lawmakers temporarily controlling Ukraine announced an interim government on Wednesday night to be led by Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, a veteran public official.The public presentation of Mr. Yatsenyuk, who will serve as acting prime minister, and more than 20 other proposed cabinet members, was a frenetic effort by establishment politicians to win the backing of the street protesters, whose persistence in the face of the deaths of more than 80 people last week in clashes with the police ultimately forced Mr. Yanukovych from power. As the names of the proposed ministers were read from a stage \u2014 with flowers and candles blanketing the square in memory of the dead \u2014 it became clear just how completely the ordinary people on the street had seized control of the direction of Ukraine. Desperate for the crowd\u2019s legitimacy, officials felt compelled to present the slate on stage in the square before putting it up for a vote by Parliament.The reaction from the crowd was decidedly mixed.Jeers and whistles greeted some established politicians, and cheers for some figures with no government experience chosen because of their role in the uprising. But with Ukraine hurtling toward an economic catastrophe, and no time for protracted negotiations, the gesture of deference to the crowd seemed sufficient to move the process forward.\u201cWe need to change these faces,\u201d said Alyona Murashko, a 28-year-old marketing specialist who was carrying groceries and had stopped in the square on her way home from work. Ms. Murashko said that she approved of the choice of Olga Bogomolets, a doctor, singer and activist, as deputy prime minister for humanitarian affairs, and of Tatyana Chornovil, an activist and journalist, to lead Ukraine\u2019s anticorruption bureau.Ms. Murashko, however, said she opposed Mr. Yatsenyuk and many of the other choices. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to see him even temporarily,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one from current political parties.\u201d Ms. Murashko said she was glad that presidential elections would be held in May but wanted parliamentary elections \u201cas soon as possible.\u201dAmong those eliciting loud boos was Oleksandr V. Turchynov, who was elected by colleagues on Saturday as the new speaker of Parliament and who has been authorized to carry out the duties of president, effectively putting him in charge of the country. Mr. Turchynov was not part of the slate announced Wednesday night and will continue in his position even after the interim government is approved.On the whole, the makeup of the interim government suggested that Ukraine would now move more swiftly to improve ties with the West, potentially reviving the sweeping political and trade agreements with the European Union that Mr. Yanukovych scuttled in November, setting off protests in Kiev and other cities.Mr. Yatsenyuk is an ally of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s archrival, the former prime minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko. Ms. Tymoshenko was released from a prison hospital and is expected to run for president in the May elections, although she has received only a lukewarm reception in recent days. Many Ukrainians say they view her as too closely connected to the country\u2019s existing political system, which has been hobbled by corruption and mismanagement for years.Mr. Yatsenyuk, by contrast, is largely viewed as an able technician with a firm grasp of economic policy and foreign affairs. He has served as speaker of Parliament, foreign minister, economics minister and acting head of the central bank. Ukraine\u2019s economy is in tatters, and it is in desperate need of a rescue package from the International Monetary Fund, which has said it will demand painful austerity measures and long-delayed economic changes in return for any assistance.A $15 billion bailout that Mr. Yanukovych had secured from Russia has been suspended as a result of the recent political upheaval, which the Kremlin views with alarm.Mr. Yatsenyuk was one of three opposition leaders in Parliament who were among the chief organizers of the street demonstrations. Another, the former boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, who leads a party called the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform, has already announced his candidacy for president. The third, Oleg Tyagnybok, is the leader of the nationalist Svoboda party, which is popular in Western Ukraine but has limited support elsewhere.Officials in Parliament, led by Mr. Turchynov, had struggled to reach a deal on the interim government in part because of the demands by civic activists that it include a number of people who did not have previous experience in public life.Among the choices in this regard were Dmitro Bulatov, the leader of a group called AutoMaidan, who was designated as minister of youth and sport; and Eugene Nyschuk, an actor who has served as M.C. from the stage in Independence Square throughout the protests and who was selected as culture minister. The crowd, however, was divided even on these choices, underscoring the near-impossible challenge faced by officials hoping to win the approval of the street. Volodymyr Hrysiv, 36, an unemployed martial arts instructor from Kiev, said he had been part of the protests from the very beginning and had booed Mr. Turchynov. \u201cI did not see him here last week when bullets were firing,\u201d Mr. Hrysiv said. \u201cI have not seen him earlier during fights on Hrushevskovo Street. Some people sacrifice their lives, while others are now dividing seats.\u201d Still, many people in the crowd acknowledged that there was no way to please everyone. Officials said that Andrey Dashchitsa, a veteran Ukrainian diplomat, had been chosen as minister of foreign affairs. Andrey Parubiy, a member of Parliament and leader of the protest movement, was chosen as the head of the national security council, while Arsen Avakov, who is already working as interior minister, was chosen to remain in that post. A reporting credit on Thursday with an article about efforts by the new government of Ukraine to win the support of the people who forced President Viktor F. Yanukovych from office misspelled the surname of a contributor and misidentified the city from which she reported.

{"Headline": "Netanyahu Criticizes Kerry Over Boycott Remarks", "Date": "2014-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and some of his senior ministers on Sunday strongly criticized groups who are threatening a boycott of Israel over its policies toward the Palestinians. Their remarks were a sharp retort to Secretary of State John Kerry, who warned a day earlier that the risk of boycotts would intensify should the current Middle East peace effort fail.In a swift response to the Israeli criticism, the State Department said that Mr. Kerry had always opposed calls for boycotts and expected \u201call parties to accurately portray his record and statements.\u201d\u201cAttempts to impose a boycott on the state of Israel are immoral and unjust,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting here. \u201cMoreover,\u201d he continued, \u201cthey will not achieve their goal. First, they cause the Palestinians to adhere to their intransigent positions and thus push peace further away. Second, no pressure will cause me to concede the vital interests of the state of Israel, especially the security of Israel\u2019s citizens. For both of these reasons, threats to boycott the state of Israel will not achieve their goal.\u201dIsrael\u2019s minister of strategic affairs, Yuval Steinitz, was more direct in his criticism of Mr. Kerry. He told Israel Radio on Sunday that Mr. Kerry\u2019s remarks were \u201churtful,\u201d \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cintolerable\u201d and added, \u201cIsrael cannot be expected to negotiate with a gun to its head.\u201dThe dispute clearly touched raw nerves on both sides. Soon after the Israeli remarks were broadcast, Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman, issued an unusually pointed statement.\u201cSecretary Kerry has a proud record of over three decades of steadfast support for Israel\u2019s security and well-being, including staunch opposition to boycotts,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cAt the Munich Security Conference yesterday, he spoke forcefully in defense of Israel\u2019s interests, as he consistently has throughout his public life. In response to a question about the peace process, he also described some well-known and previously stated facts about what is at stake for both sides if this process fails, including the consequences for the Palestinians. His only reference to a boycott was a description of actions undertaken by others that he has always opposed.\u201dThe statement concluded with the admonishment: \u201cSecretary Kerry has always expected opposition and difficult moments in the process, but he also expects all parties to accurately portray his record and statements.\u201dSpeaking on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference about the risks of a failure of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, Mr. Kerry said: \u201cToday\u2019s status quo absolutely, to a certainty, I promise you 100 percent, cannot be maintained. It\u2019s not sustainable. It\u2019s illusionary.\u201dHe added, \u201cYou see for Israel, there\u2019s an increasing delegitimization campaign that has been building up. People are very sensitive to it. There are talks of boycotts and other kinds of things.\u201dConcern is growing in Israel about the growing boycott movement against its companies. Some European supermarket chains are already shunning agricultural produce from Jewish settlements in the West Bank. PGGM, a large Dutch pension fund management company, recently decided to withdraw all its investments from Israel\u2019s five largest banks because they have branches in West Bank settlements or are involved in financing settlement construction.Yair Lapid, Israel\u2019s centrist finance minister, warned last week that Israel\u2019s economy would \u201cretreat\u201d even in the case of \u201ca very partial\u201d European boycott and that every Israeli would feel it \u201cstraight in the pocket.\u201dBut Mr. Netanyahu also faces pressure from the right-wing members of his coalition, including many within his own Likud Party, who oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state and are pushing for continued Israeli settlement construction in the areas that Israel captured in the 1967 war.In response, the State Department spokeswoman, Ms. Psaki, issued a statement saying, \u201cThe remarks of the defense minister, if accurate, are offensive and inappropriate, especially given all that the United States is doing to support Israel\u2019s security needs.\u201d She added, \u201cTo question his motives and distort his proposals is not something we would expect from the defense minister of a close ally.\u201dThe Israeli government has also been at loggerheads with the Obama administration over the Iranian nuclear issue. But Israel\u2019s repeated announcements of new settlement construction in areas the Palestinians view as part of their future state has injected particular tension into the peace process and prompted international condemnation.Late Saturday Mr. Lapid, the Israeli finance minister, ordered a temporary suspension of the transfer of funds to the settlements pending an investigation into how they had been used, according to a statement from his office. The decision followed an Israeli television report about allegations that money meant to compensate the settlers for expenses incurred by a temporary building freeze that expired in 2010 had instead been redirected and used by the settlers\u2019 umbrella council for political purposes, in some cases for antigovernment activities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India\u2019s Growth Rate Signals a Slow Recovery", "Date": "2014-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 India\u2019s economy grew 4.7 percent in the three months ended in December from the same period a year earlier, government data showed Friday, evidence that the economic slump in the country is far from over.Economists said the country\u2019s recovery would be somewhat delayed by the national elections in April and May. In the previous two quarters, the economy expanded 4.8 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively.\u201cIt certainly a little disappointing given that a number of measures had been taken to boost growth, and we were expecting that this quarter would be better than the last,\u201d said Bidisha Ganguly, chief economist at the Confederation of Indian Industry, referring to the figures from the December quarter. \u201cI think the recovery will take a longer while than what was previously anticipated.\u201dShe said that flagging domestic demand was seen as one of the chief reasons for slow growth, with contributing factors of red tape hindering investment projects and high borrowing rates constraining consumption and investment.A 1.9 percent contraction in manufacturing during the quarter was caused by tepid demand and low business investment. The other sectors that performed poorly included construction, which grew 0.6 percent, and mining and quarrying, which fell 1.6 percent.The sector that includes finance, insurance, real estate and business services performed well, increasing 12.5 percent; the sector for community, social and personal services grew 7 percent; and the sector for electricity, gas and water expanded 5 percent.The sector for trade, hotels, transportation and communication rose 4.3 percent, while the sector that includes agriculture, forestry and fishing grew 3.6 percent.In the previous quarter, ended in September, India\u2019s gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 4.8 percent, surpassing the expectations of analysts and suggesting a gradual upturn. The moderate upturn in that quarter was aided by a good monsoon, which drove growth in the agricultural sector.India has seen a dramatic slowing of growth over the past few years because of uncertainty in the business environment, a slump in investor sentiment, heavy bureaucracy and overburdened infrastructure. The economy expanded at a decade-low rate of 4.5 percent in the last fiscal year, which ended in March 2013, compared with decade high of 9.6 percent in 2010.In February, the Central Statistics Office predicted that the economy was likely to grow 4.9 percent in the current fiscal year, which runs through the end of this month.With national elections coming up this spring, investors are likely to await clarity on the economic policies of the next government before committing substantial sums or beginning major projects.\u201cOnce the election uncertainty goes out of the way, you should see actual investments on the ground taking place, and that will have a multiplier impact throughout the economy, which should lead to some incremental form of improvement,\u201d said Kaushik Das, India economist at Deutsche Bank, adding that he expected an uptick in investments would only take place in the latter part of the next fiscal year.Narendra Modi, the candidate for prime minister from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, has run his campaign on the basis of his reputation for being friendly to business.\u201cPeople ask me, \u2018What is your road map?\u2019 Our G.D.P. should grow,\u201d Mr. Modi said at the India Economic Convention in New Delhi on Thursday.He said that when the governing Congress party loses power, G.D.P. is likely to be around 4.8 percent. \u201cSo now we have to start again back from 4.8 percent. But is that so difficult? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said.However, some analysts say a change in leadership will not be enough to resuscitate India\u2019s flagging economy.\u201cThe May elections offer the chance for better governance, especially if the business-friendly Narendra Modi becomes prime minister, but it will be a long road for the economy,\u201d the ratings agency Moody\u2019s said in a report released this past week. The company, which has assigned India the lowest investment grade, cited weakness in the real economy, as opposed to the financial markets, as the cause for concern.\u201cThe economy is now much better placed to weather U.S. Fed tapering and other downside risks in 2014,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. \u201cBut there is no sign of a lift in the real economy.\u201dPersistent inflation has been one of the primary concerns of Raghuram Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, who has increased interest rates three times since he took over in September, in an attempt the stabilize rising prices.While India\u2019s benchmark inflation rate fell to an eight-month low of 5 percent in January, economists said the decline was driven by a drop in food prices and that underlying price pressures in the economy remained strong.But there are positive signs for an economic upturn. The strong monsoon last year helped agricultural output and rural demand, and an improvement in global demand along with a depreciating rupee have aided exports. Over the past two years, the central government has introduced a series of measures to stimulate growth, including easing the restrictions on foreign investment and removing the regulatory bottlenecks for several infrastructure projects.Yet analysts predict that economic growth over the next fiscal year will be gradual, at 5 percent to 5.5 percent.\u201cIn the next financial year, though India is going to show an improvement in growth, the recovery will be very subdued,\u201d said Miguel Chanco, an economist who covers Asia at Capital Economics, a macroeconomic research company based in Singapore. \u201cOver the past few months, the Reserve Bank of India has been quite hawkish in its efforts to curb inflation, and this will harm the economy over the next twelve months with interest rates remaining quite high.\u201dGiven weak domestic demand, growth over the next year must be driven by exports and increased investment, another analyst said. \u201cIf the global recovery gains steam, then India\u2019s exports should also remain healthy, and in that sense net exports would still be a positive factor for growth,\u201d said Mr. Das, the Deutsche Bank economist. \u201cA business environment conducive to investment is also critical for recovery.\u201dEllen Barry contributed reporting from New Delhi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Rate Still at 0.5% As Growth Stays Slow ", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The Bank of England on Thursday decided to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low as Britain\u2019s economic recovery continues at a slow pace.Britain\u2019s central bank said it would keep its key interest rate at 0.5 percent, where it has been since March 2009. The bank also left its bond purchasing program unchanged at 375 billion pounds ($612 billion).Britain\u2019s economy grew 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter after growing 0.8 percent in the third quarter, outpacing much of continental Europe and sending the pound higher against the dollar.\u201cThe British economy looks like it would continue to grow at the same pace it did in the second half of last year,\u201d David Tinsley, an economist at BNP Paribas, said before the announcement. \u201cThere\u2019s no sign of an acceleration, with manufacturing and services sectors remaining soft.\u201dThe Bank of England\u2019s governor, Mark J. Carney, has been under pressure to make some changes to his policy of forward guidance, which is meant to limit uncertainty among investors and consumers about when the central bank will raise rates in the future. Under the current guidance, announced in August, the central bank would consider raising rates only once the unemployment rate falls to 7 percent.But unemployment has been falling faster than economists had anticipated, dropping to 7.1 percent in the three months that ended in November. Some economists said the fall meant that Mr. Carney\u2019s forward guidance policy had failed and needed to be changed.Until last month, Mr. Carney rejected the criticism and reiterated that the 7 percent unemployment rate target was merely a point at which the central bank would start considering a rate increase. Even though unemployment is falling, inflation is at 2 percent, the central bank\u2019s target, and economic data has been mixed. While construction improved with the help of some government programs, production output remains weak.At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, Mr. Carney said Bank of England policy makers would review the forward guidance policy and consider a \u201crange of options.\u201d He is expected to make an announcement on Feb. 12, when the bank is scheduled to publish its next inflation report.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Liquid-Cooled Supercomputers, to Trim the Power Bill", "Date": "2014-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Dropping a home computer into a vat of liquid would wreck it.Yet some operators of supercomputers are submerging their machines in liquids, without causing any apparent damage, to keep them from overheating. Advocates say so-called immersion or submersion cooling could solve one of the biggest challenges of the digital economy: reducing the air-conditioning bills and environmental strains of the power-hungry servers and supercomputers that crunch ever-rising mountains of data.\u201cThe university administration said, \u2018You\u2019re not going to get any more power,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Satoshi Matsuoka, the project leader. \u201cBut we still wanted more performance.\u201dJapan is driven to reduce electricity consumption since the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. The country idled other nuclear facilities across the country, cutting electricity generating capacity sharply.In Hong Kong, a company called Allied Control, which designs cooling systems, used submersion technology for a recently opened data center. The facility is operated by Asicminer, a company that works with the virtual currency Bitcoin, solving the algorithms that create the currency. Unlike water, neither mineral oil nor the liquid fluoroplastics used by Iceotope and Allied Control conduct electricity. Therefore, experts say, there is no risk of short-circuiting the equipment or damaging it in other ways.Peter Hopton, chief executive of Iceotope, said data centers that use air-conditioning could cut their energy bills and infrastructure costs in half by using submersive cooling. Not only do facilities that are cooled this way use less electricity, they also eliminate or reduce the need for costly air-conditioning and filtering equipment.\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about small numbers here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about millions in savings, every year.\u201dSome supercomputers consume tens of millions of dollars worth of energy annually, while the biggest corporate data centers have electricity bills of hundreds of millions of dollars, much of that going for air-conditioning.Water is already used widely as a coolant in data centers and supercomputers, but usually it is piped through the facilities or the machines. Piping water through a supercomputer or a data center is one thing. Submerging the devices in liquid is another.Iceotope and the Hong Kong system use new kinds of fluids, including one from 3M called Novec 1230. 3M says it is not ozone-depleting and has been exempted from the list of volatile organic compounds issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.Mr. Hopton said Novec, which he described as \u201cliquid Teflon,\u201d provided more cooling power than mineral oil, the fluid used by Green Revolution.Christiaan Best, chief executive of Green Revolution, countered that mineral oil was almost as effective and considerably less expensive. Mineral oil costs less than $10 a gallon, while Novec 1230, which is more commonly used in sophisticated fire extinguishing equipment, costs about $70 a gallon, he said.To test the viability of the new system, the Tokyo institute erected a small building, little more than a shed, to house Tsubame KFC just outside a much larger lab that contains an existing supercomputer.Putting it next to a big heat-producing supercomputer gives the academics a chance to determine whether Tsubame KFC can function even when the oil warms up to summertime temperatures of 95 degrees Fahrenheit. They think it might be possible because modern semiconductors can operate at higher temperatures than their forerunners, Professor Matsuoka said.Only a few modifications were necessary to enable Tsubame KFC to be submerged, he said. Moving parts like hard drives and fans had to be removed, for example.Green Revolution\u2019s mineral oil cooling method has already been used at several data centers, including facilities operated by the United States Department of Defense. Intel conducted a one-year study of the system and found that its servers had suffered no adverse effects, and power consumption was cut sharply.Japanese computer experts consider energy efficiency an area in which their country\u2019s supercomputer industry, long a source of national pride, can claim a technological lead. Other countries, like China, have rivaled or surpassed it in sheer computing power.\u201cTwenty or 30 years ago, when I started in this business, it was a race between muscle cars,\u201d said Steve Conway, an analyst at IDC, a research firm. \u201cEveryone wanted to build the biggest, fastest supercomputer. Now, it\u2019s not muscle cars anymore. It\u2019s a family sedan.\u201dSo far, submersive cooling has been used more widely for supercomputers than for data centers. Mr. Best said that so far, academic institutions that operate supercomputers had been more willing to experiment with the technology than the corporations that run data centers.\u201cYou can imagine, if we walk in and say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you take your data center and put it in oil,\u2019 you have to have something pretty solid to point to,\u201d Mr. Best said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Basking in a New Glow", "Date": "2014-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PragmatistIf you haven\u2019t noticed the virtual disappearance of old-school incandescent bulbs from retailers\u2019 shelves, there\u2019s good reason.With the federally mandated phaseout of traditional incandescent bulbs entering its final stage, manufacturers and retailers have done well to make the transition nearly invisible to consumers. As of last month, companies could no longer produce or import 40-watt and 60-watt bulbs, following similar restrictions on 75-watt and 100-watt bulbs over the last two years.Some retailers still have enough 40s and 60s to last a few months, but you may struggle finding them amid the thicket of new lights labeled \u201c40-watt equivalent,\u201d \u201c60-watt equivalent\u201d and the like. While those new bulbs will cost more up front, they can save money in the long term because they require less wattage to produce the same amount of light.That said, prices on newer bulbs are dropping quickly, even as design and performance improve. So if you lack the energy or money to pursue a lighting overhaul in your home now, sit tight. Your patience \u2014 or wariness, or laziness \u2014 shall be rewarded.\u201cWe\u2019re right at the beginning of this,\u201d said Marc Voykovic, national light bulb merchant for Home Depot. \u201cThe technology is changing so rapidly you\u2019ll continue to see improvements in bulbs as manufacturers are able to crack the code.\u201dNot everyone can wait that long. My home\u2019s compact fluorescent lights, or CFLs, have grown so old and dim that I had little choice recently but to jump headlong into the morass of the current light bulb market.Thankfully I had help. In addition to calling Mr. Voykovic, I contacted Cecilia Dupire, principal of Cezign, an architectural and design firm, and Russell Leslie, a founder of the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. Lucas Borntreger, an electrician in Kansas City, Mo., also guided me through a fixture replacement, but more on that later.My panelists said the biggest changes in the lighting market have come in the realm of the light-emitting diode, or LED. A few years ago, LEDs were billed as the next big thing, since they are extremely efficient and durable, to the tune of 25,000 hours of expected life.But the early bulbs came with \u201cyou can\u2019t be serious\u201d price tags (as in $40 for a 60-watt bulb) and gave off light that was as soft and warm as a granite quarry in January. Oh, and you couldn\u2019t dim them.Over the last year, however, manufacturers rolled out dimmable LEDs for less than $10, with light that often rivals the old incandescents.Are they worth it? Probably.A 60-watt equivalent LED needs only 12 watts of power to produce the same light as a traditional incandescent. It consumes less than one-third as much energy as the lowest-price bulbs now manufactured: so-called halogen incandescents.A look at what\u2019s replacing the old incandescent and compact fluorescent bulbs.According to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, based on conservative estimates, consumers who spend $10 on a 60-watt equivalent LED over a 60-watt equivalent halogen incandescent will recoup the difference in about three and a half years, or less if you live in areas like New York, where utility rates are among the nation\u2019s highest. At $5, you recoup your costs in less than 18 months.Some LEDs have more recently breached that $5 barrier, thanks to incentives from electric utilities provided for bulbs that carry the government\u2019s Energy Star rating. Last week in Vermont and Pennsylvania, among other states, retailers carried 40-watt LED bulbs for roughly that price.As newer LEDs gain Energy Star certification this year, $5 could become the new normal for 40-watt and 60-watt bulbs.The big question is whether you can find an LED that gives off your preferred light. I tried eight different 60-watt equivalent LEDs currently on the market from a range of manufacturers, and each of them was rated 2700 Kelvin. On the \u201cLight Appearance\u201d graphic included on the bulbs\u2019 packaging, this was close to the \u201cwarm\u201d end of the spectrum.I expected identical light quality, or close to it, but at least three of the bulbs were noticeably cooler than the others. The warmest, to my eyes, was the Cree, which retails for just under $10. The Philips 11-watt LED bulb, the more expensive of the two Philips 60-watt equivalents, also offered a pleasing amount of warmth. The coolest was the Ikea Ledare E26, which sells for $7.Mr. Leslie said part of my issue could have been the white background of the light, and that one\u2019s reaction to a certain bulb has much to do with its immediate surroundings. \u201cIf you buy an LED in the 2700 to 3000 Kelvin range with an Energy Star label from a manufacturer like Philips, Sylvania, G.E. and Cree, you\u2019ll probably have a satisfactory product,\u201d he said.To avoid buyer\u2019s remorse, my panelists said, ask questions about light quality at the store, check the retailer\u2019s return policies and save receipts.Ms. Dupire said LEDs have improved to the point that they represent 80 percent of the lights in her home. That includes traditional bulbs as well as smaller lights that complement lamps and other fixtures.\u201cWhat\u2019s wonderful about LEDs is that you can be both playful and functional with them,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can do more imaginative stuff, like putting them underneath cabinets or inside closets because they don\u2019t create as much heat.\u201dFollowing her counsel, I tried the battery-operated G.E. Wireless LED Light in a closet that inexplicably lacked a socket, and they instantly turned the most irritating space in my house into something functional.Lamps and old fixtures can also get a playful upgrade with bulbs like the Philips Hue ($60, or $200 for a pack of three) or the Lumen TL800 ($70), which you control with a mobile device. (The Hue works with the iPhone, Androids and Kindles, while the Lumen works with iPhones and certain Android devices. The Hue also includes a BR30 option for recessed lighting fixtures.)Each bulb has a dedicated app that lets you change colors manually or according to predetermined settings, among other feats. This is especially useful if you have trouble waking up or falling asleep and would like ambient colors to help you in either regard.I liked both bulbs very much, but I favored the brightness and versatility of the Hue. The setup is slightly more complicated, however, since you need to plug a base station into your wireless router. The Lumen works with a Bluetooth connection.Outside of LEDs, my panelists said, little has changed in the consumer light bulb market. Manufacturers have tweaked the efficiency of their halogen incandescents to meet the new federal standards, and manufacturers say they expect these bulbs to dominate the market while the LEDs edge their way into the mainstream.Manufacturers said CFL technology has stagnated, and my panelists echoed that sentiment. But I found one exception worth noting. The Plumen 001 ($30) and the Baby Plumen 001 ($29) feature a cool variation of the traditional \u201ctwisty\u201d CFL design. The company also sells single bulbs packaged with a sleek, matching hanging fixture for $65.The light is warm and pleasant by fluorescent standards, but like many other CFLs, the Plumens are not dimmable.I considered installing a set, but the idea of cutting holes in my ceiling and wiring new fixtures was a bit too ambitious. At the same time, I\u2019ve been on the lookout for an electrical project a little more challenging than rewiring a lamp, but preferably in a low-stakes setting.Like my basement.It boasts square, recessed fixtures that were installed 40 years ago, and which we, in recent years, lit with junky CFLs. Sometime last year two of the fixtures simply stopped working. It was almost an improvement.I heard about a new LED product, the Pixi FlatLight luminaire, that\u2019s advertised as an ideal replacement for such Nixon-era fixtures. The Pixi is less than an inch thick \u2014 including the (nonreplaceable) light itself \u2014 and comes in three sizes. I chose the 1-foot square size ($70 each), as it is nearly identical to our existing fixtures.My only remaining task was to figure out how to install it without electrocuting myself or creating a fire hazard in my house. Pixi offers a good how-to video, but it didn\u2019t account for the wiring configuration in my basement. Rather than call an electrician for a visit, I tried a new online service from Google, called Helpouts, in which contractors and other professionals offer advice through video chats.The professionals are reviewed by Google, but as with anyone you might contract for home-repair services, would-be customers should check out the professional\u2019s credentials before going forward.Mr. Borntreger, for instance, is a licensed master electrician with extensive experience. For $15 he offers 30 minutes of advice. After two calls and about an hour of work, I installed four fixtures, and did it with the confidence that I hadn\u2019t ruined the job. Without Mr. Borntreger I would have known to shut off the light circuit at the breaker, and test the fixture with a voltage meter for good measure. But had I not called on him, I most likely would not have looked deeply enough into the junction box to see an additional set of wires that were important.My next time out, I\u2019ll have the same respect for electrical work but much less worry. Of course, I\u2019ll probably rely again on Mr. Borntreger, or someone like him, as my phone-a-friend.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s Culture Wars", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia is not the West; Russians are different. This is not news; it\u2019s been that way for centuries. The news is that the differences are accelerating. Through the past 25 years, the Western world and Russia have been drifting in opposite directions, their hopes and social visions increasingly at cross purposes. Russia today is a country where many people find solace in traditional values that many in the West reject. Moreover, the country\u2019s ruling elite is trying to bend this conservative rebound to its own ends. That is why the Kremlin is waging its own culture war \u2014 stoking the values of religion and nationalism as it rails against \u201cforeigners,\u201d sexual \u201cdeviants\u201d and a \u201cdegenerate\u201d West.The key to understanding this lies in the recent past. The 1990s treated the West well but Russia very badly. What many Western people saw as a time of limitless prosperity at home and unprecedented prospects for democratic freedom abroad, most Russians saw as the darkest nightmare in living memory. The economy crashed, debt piled up and the political system went into meltdown. Most Russians lost all their savings and any sense of security. The failure of Soviet Communism left the country bereft of national purpose, paralyzed by anxiety over what the next chapter of its turbulent history would bring. It was only in 2007 that the Russian economy returned to its pre-collapse levels. As economic growth revived, support for Vladimir Putin peaked. Since then, the economy has crashed, bounced back, and stalled again. But these boom and bust cycles don\u2019t tell the whole story. Social scientists who compare personal well-being in nations around the world say that Russians have lived through the sharpest decline ever recorded. Ronald Inglehart and Eduard Ponarin of the World Values Survey note, for example, that people in the world\u2019s prosperous regions have enjoyed high and stable levels of personal satisfaction \u2014 ranging from 80 to 90 percent of those polled \u2014 throughout the 30-year period from 1981 to 2011. By contrast, Russians went from relative personal harmony in 1981 (76 percent) to acute distress in 1995 (28 percent). A slight recovery began in 2000, jumped to 60 percent in 2005, and then 69 percent in 2011, according to the survey. Though the average Russian is now earning and consuming a lot more than under the Soviet regime, relative prosperity has not seemed to quench a bigger thirst for personal contentment. Russia is a special case in another respect. Poland, Hungary, Latvia, Ukraine and other countries struggling for independence in the late 1980s and early 1990s could blame Moscow for their misery. Liberation brought a new sense of national direction that included running away from Russia. But Russia, the center of the imploded Soviet universe, could not run away from itself. Most Russians found compensation in religion \u2014 another key factor that sets them apart from the West, where religious faith has been fading for decades. (Indeed, according to the World Values Survey, the six countries showing the greatest gains in religious faith are ex-Communist: Russia, China, Belarus, Bulgaria, Serbia and Romania.) In most Western societies, the drift from traditional religious values to secular ones evolved over centuries. But in the Soviet Union, modernization was a top-down project that sought to eradicate religion by force. When Communism collapsed, the quest for God, suppressed for more than 70 years, broke free. The Russian authorities soon realized that they could profit by harnessing this conservative trend. Traditional values, after all, include national pride and respect for authority \u2014 qualities any authoritarian ruler can easily manipulate. Thus the Kremlin touts the virtues of nationalism against the vices of an overly tolerant West. If we forsake our culture, say the ideologues, we will lose out to both the West\u2019s unprincipled atheists and Islamic traditionalists. But the real reason the Kremlin is suspicious of Western values lies in the truth that tolerance of individual difference comes hand in hand with greater freedom of expression and government accountability. This is why Putin is waging an all-out cultural offensive, sponsoring legislation that punishes \u201cgay propaganda,\u201d investing in patriotic movies, micro-managing TV networks. The country\u2019s only independent television channel, TV Dozhd, Russian for TV Rain, is struggling to ward off a Kremlin-generated attack for \u201cunpatriotic\u201d broadcasts. Two weeks ago the station aired a show that questioned the wisdom of defending Leningrad during World War II. The Kremlin responded with orchestrated outrage. All cable networks were pressured to drop the channel, a move that would drive it out of business. Some commentators say that Putin is pushing his country back in time to keep his base from eroding. This is only partly true. The country\u2019s conservative rebound is real. The question is the degree to which he can manipulate social change. Whether Putin will succeed is a big question. Russians are not just tired of blaming themselves for their country\u2019s ills. They are also tired of Putin. Putin knows this. He will respond with more of his familiar tools \u2014 more religion, more nationalism and more pressure against Russia\u2019s neighbors and against his critics at home \u2014 all in the name of Russia\u2019s greatness.

{"Headline": "Senate Seat of Baucus Is Filled in Montana", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDENVER \u2014 The Democratic governor of Montana appointed the lieutenant governor on Friday to fill the Senate seat left open by the departure of Senator Max Baucus, a move Democrats hope will improve their chances of retaining the seat in what is expected to be a fiercely fought election this November.Although the lieutenant governor, John Walsh, had already announced his candidacy for the Senate, Democrats and some political analysts say his new post as a sitting senator \u2014 albeit a temporary, appointed one \u2014 could help raise his profile with voters and give him some of the benefits of incumbency.The race in Montana could be pivotal in determining whether Republicans can gain the six seats they would need to take control of the Senate. It is one of six contested races where Democrats are defending Senate seats in states carried by Mitt Romney in 2012, and Republicans are hoping to capitalize on antipathy toward the health care overhaul and the state of the economy.In Montana, Republican leaders and donors are coalescing around the first-term Representative Steve Daines for the Senate seat. Mr. Daines, who faces two primary challengers, is running an upbeat campaign advertisement portraying himself as a hunter, father and fifth-generation Montanan.Mr. Daines\u2019s campaign had about $1.1 million in cash at the end of September, according to federal campaign disclosures. Mr. Walsh\u2019s campaign had about $435,000 at the end of the year.\u201cWalsh has a lot of stuff to overcome, and he\u2019s a political novice,\u201d said Robert Saldin, director of the Project on American Democracy and Citizenship at the University of Montana. \u201cThis is going to be one of the most-watched Senate elections in the country. There\u2019s not going to be a lot of time to learn the ropes and make some mistakes.\u201dAt a news conference in Helena on Friday, Governor Bullock called Mr. Walsh the \u201cmost effective\u201d candidate for the Senate seat, adding that he had not interviewed Mr. Walsh for the position and had only informed him on Thursday night. Mr. Walsh emphasized his own biography, talking about the 33 years he served with the Montana National Guard, which included a combat tour of Iraq as well as time as the adjutant general.\u201cMy entire adult life has been focused on public service,\u201d said Mr. Walsh, 53.Although Mr. Walsh still faces two Democratic primary challengers, he has the support of leading state and national Democrats, and his appointment is expected to further smooth his path toward winning the nomination.Just minutes after the announcement, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, released a statement praising the appointment, saying, \u201cJohn is the kind of guy who may not agree with the party on every single issue, but he has the selflessness and courage to always do what he thinks is right for Montana.\u201dBut political analysts said many Montana voters still know little about Mr. Walsh\u2019s views or life story. Elected lieutenant governor in 2012, he emerged as a Senate candidate this fall as Democrats scrambled to find a replacement for Mr. Baucus, a fixture of Montana\u2019s political world who, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, helped shape Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law. Mr. Walsh said he would focus on reducing spending and the national debt, creating jobs and veterans\u2019 issues. He is expected to be sworn in on Tuesday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Save on Defense, Hire Rivals", "Date": "2014-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 RECENT proposals to slash the troop levels of the regular Army illustrate how much pressure the United States government is under to shrink its military budget, even as it revamps and re-equips its forces for future conflicts. To meet all of those goals at the same time, we need to turn to one of the commercial world\u2019s most basic cost-control weapons \u2014 competition.That means letting more than one company supply a system or service \u2014 for example, having two suppliers of jet engines for one type of fighter. Or, perhaps, maintaining contractual relationships with several suppliers so they can compete for the next contract. These strategies contain costs in the long run and spur innovation. In the end, the military gets the best equipment at more affordable prices. But recently, the Pentagon appears to have been operating on a different principle \u2014 that the lowest bid is the defining criterion for awarding contracts. For sure, initial cost is important, especially in today\u2019s economy. But making it the most important consideration ends up costing the government and taxpayers more. That\u2019s because the government \u2014 like any other customer \u2014 must balance price against value. And in combat, where performance is critical, value means what a product can do and how dependable it is over time. Eliminating comparisons of capability and performance has the unintended consequence of discouraging competing bids from companies that offer a more capable product at a price they cannot afford to lower. Later, a sole bidder might be unable to deliver at its lowball price, in which case the company could see its choices as eating the extra cost, cheapening the product, or sticking the government with a higher bill. In the past, the resolution has too often been just charging taxpayers a higher-than-promised price for a product that might still be inferior to what another company could have offered. And there is little incentive for the producer to improve the product. I first noticed a trend toward considering price alone several years ago, when the Air Force was acquiring new airborne refueling tankers. After two rounds of a bruising fight against the Airbus planes offered by the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (now the Airbus Group), Boeing won the $35 billion contract in 2011 by offering a very low price. The aftermath was predictable: higher-than-expected costs, with the total still unclear. On two more recent contracts \u2014 for replacing the president\u2019s 40-year-old Marine One aircraft, and for producing the Air Force\u2019s Combat Rescue Helicopter \u2014 the Pentagon has found itself with a single bidder, a Sikorsky-Lockheed team. Other would-be bidders concluded that the Pentagon\u2019s requirements pointed to a smaller, less capable helicopter than the ones they made, which might have cost somewhat more but would have been more useful and more durable. Competition is a driving force in America\u2019s commercial marketplace; we all benefit from it. Some say its rewards are harder to see in the defense industry, where there is one primary American customer \u2014 the Pentagon. But history clearly demonstrates that innovation and cost-restraint follow effective competition.One example was a competition known in the aerospace industry as the \u201cGreat Engine War\u201d of the 1980s. Pratt & Whitney had been the sole provider of engines for the Air Force\u2019s F-15 and F-16 fighter jets. But when the company\u2019s engines began experiencing reliability problems and increasing operating costs, the Air Force opted for a head-to-head competition against Pratt & Whitney\u2019s biggest rival, General Electric. In 1984, the Air Force split the multibillion-dollar contract between the two, with G.E. taking 75 percent of the first order.The result: With both companies simultaneously meeting the continuing demand for more engines, each kept making its products more reliable and capable, even as manufacturing costs fell. Over the next 20 years, the Air Force saved an estimated $3 billion to $4 billion. This continuous competition model was especially useful in the 1990s, when the Cold War had ended and mergers and acquisitions were shrinking the list of top Pentagon contractors \u2014 to eight in 1999 from 36 in 1993. Government officials realized that something had to be done to maintain competition. By splitting production among multiple companies (and awarding the larger share based on a balance between price and previous performance), the services improved long-run cost control and performance in a number of weapons systems, including Tomahawk missiles and Aegis-equipped destroyers. But the pendulum has now swung back, it seems. In 2011, the Pentagon decided it could not afford to fund an alternative engine for its F-35 Joint Strike Fighter \u2014 which, at a potential cost of nearly $400 billion for more than 2,400 fighters, promises to become the largest single weapons program in American history. Rather than keep a team from General Electric and Rolls-Royce involved in the program, it chose to stick with only the engine supplier it already had, Pratt & Whitney, handing that firm a new monopoly. In December, the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported that by 2012, the share of awards made by the Navy without competition had risen to 54 percent, and by the Air Force to 63 percent.To be sure, it can be difficult politically to argue for spending more now to reap larger savings and improvements later, especially when the military must stretch its dollars. But history\u2019s lesson is clear: Continuous competition, over time, lowers costs, boosts performance and yields technological advancement.If monopolies are created in a quest for short-term savings, taxpayers eventually pay more and our country is less safe.Jacques S. Gansler, who teaches at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, was under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics in the Clinton administration. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "David M. Herszenhorn Answers Questions on Ukraine", "Date": "2014-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a previous effort to end the crisis, Mr. Yanukovych fired the prime minister and the government, but opposition leaders refused to accept positions in the government without changes in the Constitution to revoke an expansion in the powers of the presidency approved earlier in Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s term. They said it would be pointless to join a government that in the end remained fully in Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s control.This week\u2019s frightening escalation of violence and deaths began after antigovernment demonstrators marched toward the Parliament building in Kiev, apparently to express their demands about reverting to the previous Constitution. The accord announced by Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s office on Friday apparently includes a deal to carry out these constitutional amendments.The main \u201cfaces\u201d of the opposition have been the leaders in Parliament of the three main opposition parties: Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk of Fatherland; Vitali Klitschko, the former boxing champion and the leader of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform; and Oleg Tyagnibok of the nationalist Svoboda Party. There are also a number of other organized groups, including several right-wing groups that have had a heavy role in the occupation of streets and public buildings and in the clashes with the police. The crowds in Independence Square have included people from the entire spectrum of Ukrainian society, including middle-class professionals, students and retirees who live on small pensions.In general, though, all of the opposition groups share a degree of frustration with the Yanukovych government and more broadly with the corruption and mismanagement that have persisted during his term and left Ukraine continuing to struggle with severe economic problems. The country was hurtling toward bankruptcy, and in desperate need of a bailout package. In choosing a bailout from Russia rather than from the West in November, Mr. Yanukovych effectively set off the protests, breaking an earlier pledge to sign major political and free trade agreements with the European Union.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Also Cheering at the Olympics: Russian Critics", "Date": "2014-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOCHI, Russia \u2014 If anyone has a right to resent the Sochi Olympics, it is Andrei Martynov, whose house was seized by the Russian authorities and then demolished without compensation to clear land near the hockey arena where Russia will play Slovenia on Thursday.Mr. Martynov now lives in a dingy shelter for people dislocated by the reconstruction that transformed Sochi, and he is still angry about losing his house. Yet, far from harboring bitterness, he expressed an emotion that has spread, perhaps unexpectedly, across Russia since the Games began \u2014 unabashed pride in his country.\u201cThis is a unique event, of worldwide interest, and it\u2019s happening in my town,\u201d he said in the communal kitchen of the shelter not far away from the Olympic Park, where tea was served on a rough wooden table and a television with a perpetually yellow screen was tuned, in spite of everything, to the Olympics.The preparations for Sochi were so besieged by controversy here over excessive spending, poor planning and accusations of corruption, labor abuses and ecological calamity, that the Games themselves seemed to many Russians to be preordained for failure. President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s lavishing of state funds to remake this subtropical resort to host the Olympics appeared to many here to embody his increasingly autocratic style, out of touch with the day-to-day struggles of most Russians.For now, however, the focus of attention has shifted to the sports themselves, as Mr. Putin and his senior aides have insisted all along that it should be.In Sochi and other cities where the authorities have erected giant screens for those without tickets, the mood swing in the last few days has been palpable. It has been all but impossible to find anybody who did not express renewed enthusiasm for winter sports and, of course, for the Russian athletes, underscoring how the Olympics anywhere can tap deep reservoirs of patriotism.\u201cWhen our champions are on ice, we will let them know we love them, and we support them,\u201d said Mr. Martynov\u2019s wife, Natalya, who plans to watch figure skating on the shelter\u2019s television.Across Russia, the events have been broadcast by state television channels that have focused immeasurably less than critics at home and journalists from abroad have on the problems that bedeviled the buildup to the Games. That positive, if limited, view is what the overwhelming majority of Russians will have of the Olympics.As with the sweeping, analgesic celebration of Russia\u2019s history and culture in the opening ceremony \u2014 sidestepping darker moments like the Red Terror, the Gulag and even the Soviet collapse \u2014 it appears to have won over even some of the Kremlin\u2019s harshest critics.\u201cIt is so sweet, and so uniting.\u201dIt remains to be seen what the lasting legacy of Sochi will be, of course, but the warming welcome that greeted the Olympics so far has rebounded politically to Mr. Putin, whose personal involvement in the Olympic preparations was arguably greater than that of any other single political leader in decades.The full measure of that has yet to be counted, but Stepan Lvov, an official with the Russian polling agency Vtsiom, said that their initial surveys showed a bounce in Mr. Putin\u2019s personal approval ratings just since last weekend. \u201cThis sort of dynamic happens very rarely,\u201d he said. (The results of the latest polling will be published after the Olympics.)He added, \u201cLooking at websites and social media networks, we can see that the amount of negative expressions has declined significantly from before the beginning of the Games.\u201dThat in itself has infuriated some of Mr. Putin\u2019s critics.After Russia\u2019s gold medal victory in team figure skating, led by the dazzling performance of Yulia Lipnitskaya, a budding 15-year-old star, Viktor Shenderovich, a satirist and opposition commentator, compared the patriotic celebration that followed to those of German athletes in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. He warned that the patriotic fervor would embolden Mr. Putin\u2019s authoritarian policies, prompting a furious backlash.Fireworks followed the torch lighting at the end of the ceremony.One of the country\u2019s most famous writers, Grigory Chkhartishvili, who writes under the pen name Boris Akunin, responded to the avalanche of criticism ahead of the Olympics with a plea for a respite from the \u201cFacebook masochism\u201d of complaints about the preparations, which have included hastily finished hotel rooms, polluted tap water and the fate of Sochi\u2019s stray dogs.He noted that he was not much of a sports fan himself, but that his hopes for Sochi were simple: no terrorist attacks, beautiful sports, records and an event that \u201cwould not be a national disgrace.\u201dReferring to Mr. Putin\u2019s opponents, Mr. Chkhartishvili wrote on Facebook, \u201cI swear to God, I am not ready to live by the principle, \u2018If it\u2019s bad for Putin, it\u2019s good for us.' \u201dThe cost of the Games, financed largely from state coffers, will ultimately affect every Russian taxpayer, especially as officials seek to tighten spending to cope with dwindling revenues. But the most direct burden has been borne by the residents of Sochi.In the last seven years, the city has been a construction site, and a still unfinished one, that caused uncountable delays and disruptions for its 340,000 residents. The simmering anger has now turned more forgiving.\u201cWhen you remodel your house, it\u2019s uncomfortable,\u201d said Alla Guseva, a curator at Sochi\u2019s history museum, \u201cbut when it is done, you are happy you did it. Yes, it was unpleasant, but thank God, it\u2019s done now.\u201dThe Martynovs lost their home nestled in a marshy, rural village in the Adler district, where migrating birds once thrived. Their house stood on a spacious plot near mandarin orange groves. Palms and eucalyptus trees shaded the village. The pebbly beach of the Black Sea was only a few steps away.Although local and federal officials say that all those dislocated have received compensation, Mr. Martynov said they had not, because officials found irregularities in their title to the property. \u201cBefore our eyes, the backhoe drove onto our property and destroyed our home with its shovel,\u201d Mr. Martynov said. \u201cImagine that, watching your home be destroyed before your eyes.\u201dMr. Martynov, 55, is a lifelong hockey fan. He played as a teenager with enough talent to join a national competition called the Golden Puck, before he was sidelined by a knee injury, the scar of which he rolled up his pant leg to display. All his life, he said, he loved hockey, while the sport only tormented him in return \u2014 now by demolishing his home to make way for the two arenas where the Olympic matches will be held.So, how could he tolerate watching hockey on this spot?How could he not, he answered.\u201cIt\u2019s a once in a lifetime occurrence,\u201d he said of the Russian national team, whose prospects for a gold medal are close to a national obsession here. \u201cWhen the Russian team skates out, I will cheer. I have no other team and who else would I cheer for? I will cheer for Russia.\u201dAndrew E. Kramer reported from Sochi, and Steven Lee Myers from Moscow.

{"Headline": "Dispute Over the Future of Basic Research in Canada", "Date": "2014-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational EducationCHARLOTTETOWN, Prince Edward Island \u2014 Canada\u2019s National Research Council is the country\u2019s premier scientific institution, helping to produce such inventions as the pacemaker and the robotic arm used on the American space shuttle. But last year, its mission changed.The Canadian government announced a transformation of the 98-year-old agency, formerly focused largely on basic research, into a one-stop \u201cconcierge service\u201d to bolster technological innovation by industry \u2014 historically weak \u2014 and generate high-quality jobs.This has set off a dispute over the future of Canada\u2019s capacity to carry out fundamental research, with university scientists and academic organizations uncharacteristically vocal about the government\u2019s blunt preference for commercially applicable science.\u201cWe are not sure the government appreciates the role that basic research plays,\u201d said Kenneth Ragan, a McGill University physicist and president of the Canadian Association of Physicists: \u201cThe real question is, How does it view not-directed, nonindustrial, curiosity-driven blue-sky research? I worry the view is that it is irrelevant at best and that in many cases they actually dislike it.\u201dWhile the transformation of the National Research Council has been criticized, the government as well as some science-policy analysts say that better connecting businesses with research is an important step for Canada.Having examined models in other countries, the National Research Council chose to streamline its operations to act as \u201cthe pivot between the two worlds\u201d of industry and academics, with an eye toward new products and innovations, said Charles Drouin, a spokesman for the council. He said the agency had not moved away from support for fundamental research but wanted to focus such efforts better. \u201cThere is basic research, but it is directed, as opposed to undirected as you would find it in universities.\u201dAnother battleground for the future of basic research has been the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, a federal granting agency that serves as the first stop for financing fundamental research by Canadian scientists.In 2011-12, the latest year for which data are available, the council\u2019s \u201cdiscovery\u201d grants for fundamental research accounted for 38.4 percent of its budget, down from 50.1 percent in 2001-2. Its \u201cinnovation\u201d grants, which encourage the transfer of university-developed technology to industry, rose to 31.4 percent in 2011-12, up from 25.3 percent a decade earlier. (The council also directs part of its roughly $1-billion budget to postdoctoral fellowships and other awards for young researchers.)\u201cThe government has invested proportionately more on the innovation side, where it was seen that we had more challenges,\u201d said Pierre J. Charest, vice president of research grants and scholarships at the government agency. He noted that the council was \u201con track\u201d to double the number of scientists forming partnerships with industry.Mr. Charest said criticism about a smaller percentage of funds for discovery grants missed a larger point \u2014 that the budget had grown over the past decade to almost $325 million in 2012-13. However, much of that increase comes from a special supplement for a select group of researchers to explore potentially transformative concepts.One who has felt the pinch is Norman H\u00fcner, an internationally recognized plant biochemist and physiologist at the University of Western Ontario, who holds a prestigious Canada Research Chair in environmental-stress biology. A longtime recipient of discovery grants, he and his research collaborators are exploring a potential breakthrough in the use of photosynthesis to trick plants to grow in suboptimal conditions \u2014 relevant research in Mr. H\u00fcner\u2019s view, given concerns about climate change.But in 2012, after applying for a new grant to continue his research, the professor received $50,000 a year for five years \u2014 a sharp drop from the previous award of $132,000 a year over five years. \u201cI was shocked, absolutely,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI am disillusioned beyond words.\u201dThe cut has led to the departures of some senior scientists from his lab. And save for one new postdoctoral student with her own funds, Mr. H\u00fcner is not replenishing his stable of young researchers. At 67, Mr. H\u00fcner now plans to retire several years ahead of schedule.Even those involved in commercialization efforts question the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council\u2019s new approach.\u201cIf you have ideas that are going to lead to commercialization opportunities, you should absolutely get seed-stage funding,\u201d said James E. Colliander, a mathematician at the University of Toronto. He acknowledged that funding for applied research was \u201ccrucially important\u201d but said he was \u201cnot sure that the principal vehicle for funding basic research should be the path to get those dollars.\u201d Mr. Colliander has received several major discovery grants and is also involved in an effort to bring to market a web application for large-scale academic exam assessment.Beyond the changes in the two councils, some wonder if Canadian industry is prepared to step up its role in research innovation. In Canada\u2019s largely foreign-owned industrial sector, research is often carried out at corporate headquarters abroad, while home-grown businesses lack the appetite or budget.Some liken the federal strategy to pushing on a string.The current policy appears to be trying to \u201cpush\u201d technology from universities to industry, but what is needed to increase the level of innovation is for industry to get better at investing in new ideas and well-qualified researchers, said Arthur Carty, a former science adviser to the prime minister and a former head of the National Research Council. \u201cCompanies have to have innovation in their philosophical strategies, and they don\u2019t have it,\u201d said Mr. Carty, now executive director of the University of Waterloo\u2019s Institute for Nanotechnology.Uncertainty over the response of industry is a common refrain even among those who see merit in the federal strategy.\u201cCanada has had most of its eggs in the basic-research basket for quite a long time,\u201d said Richard W. Hawkins, Canada research chair in science, technology and innovation policy at the University of Calgary. He has also spent years outside Canada as an adviser to governments and international agencies on innovation policy. \u201cGovernments want to invest in science and technology because they think it will lead to growth and innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernments all over the world have the same rationale.\u201dWhat\u2019s missing in Canada, he said, is a deep understanding about how sectors of the economy could exploit knowledge to diversify and create new industries. \u201cIn Canada we know relatively less about our situation than most of our competitor countries,\u201d he said.But some senior scientists warn of risks to Canada\u2019s higher-education system if pure, scholarly research is perceived as unimportant.\u201cOne of the major contradictions of the Conservative government at the moment is that no one in Canada will question the need to have the best universities in the world,\u201d said Daniel E. Guitton, a professor of neuroscience at McGill University. \u201cNow how do you get them? You\u2019re not going to get them by having people focus on an industry-related problem.\u201dScience policy analysts say it is too early to judge the impact of the government\u2019s current strategy. But on one point, there is little debate. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve not seen this level of advocacy from the scientific community before,\u201d said Paul Dufour, a fellow at the University of Ottawa\u2019s Institute for Science, Society, and Policy. \u201cThat\u2019s new in this country, and I think that\u2019s a healthy thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Undeterred, Fed on Track to Temper Its Stimulus", "Date": "2014-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When Federal Reserve officials last met at the end of January, they were surprised by the strength of the economy, cheered by the optimism of consumers and convinced they should continue to dismantle the Fed\u2019s economic stimulus campaign, according to an account the Fed released Wednesday.The account left little doubt Fed officials intend to steadily reduce purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, notwithstanding a recent run of disappointing economic data. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said Wednesday on CNBC that even a third consecutive month of paltry job creation was not likely to deter the Fed from tapering again.\u201cIn my view, the hurdle is pretty high on changing the pace of the step-downs in our purchases that we started back in December,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cI think that, in fact, to my mind, it would take more than just some weak, relatively weak, reports.\u201d And there were no indications from the meeting that the Fed was particularly concerned about the effect its actions might have on emerging markets, some of which were in turmoil at the beginning of the year because of fears that tighter money and higher interest rates might harm their prospects for growth. In contrast to the consensus on continuing to reduce bond purchases, the account showed that officials remain conflicted about the next major step in the Fed\u2019s retreat: What to tell investors about when the Fed plans to start raising short-term interest rates, which it has held near zero since 2008.One leading possibility is that the Fed will choose to obscure its internal divisions for a time by retreating from its recent practice of tying policy to specific economic thresholds, instead substituting a less specific description of its goals.The next meeting of the policy-making committee, scheduled for March 18 and 19, will be the first under the leadership of the new Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.Fed officials cited the resurgence of consumer spending, the main engine of domestic economic growth, as the reason for their growing optimism.Indeed, there was little sign of concern about a string of underwhelming economic reports during the early weeks of 2014, which has checked the optimism of some economic forecasters. Officials, the account said, \u201cgenerally did not expect the recent pace of economic growth to be sustained, but they nonetheless anticipated that the economy would expand at a moderate pace in coming quarters.\u201d\u201cThe economic data released since the Fed\u2019s January 28-29th meeting has been largely disappointing,\u201d James Marple, senior economist at TD Bank, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. \u201cHowever, the bout of unseasonably cold weather has made deciphering weather from weakness in economic data increasingly difficult. Unless the data continues to deteriorate, it is unlikely to change the Fed\u2019s position.\u201dThere were some shadows. Concern about the sluggish pace of inflation remained at a steady simmer. While the account reiterated the Fed\u2019s official expectation that price increases will gradually return to the Fed\u2019s preferred 2 percent annual pace, it noted \u201cseveral factors that cast doubt on this outcome,\u201d including the slow pace of wage growth and the low level of inflation in other developed countries.These concerns did not weigh heavily. The account said that even Fed officials who have strongly supported asset purchases agreed that \u201ca pause in the reduction in purchases was not justified at this stage.\u201d In a further indication of the direction of internal debate, the account said \u201ca few participants\u201d suggested the possibility the Fed would need to start raising interest rates \u201crelatively soon.\u201dThe Fed has said since 2012 that it intended keep short-term rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent. It said in December that it intended to wait well beyond that time, but it did not elaborate. With the unemployment rate at the time of the most recent meeting having fallen to 6.6 percent, the account said that officials agreed that it would \u201csoon be appropriate\u201d to say more.Some officials would like to move the threshold to a lower unemployment rate. Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, has proposed 5.5 percent. Others would prefer to be vague, broadly describing the Fed\u2019s economic goals without providing specific benchmarks. While this would diminish the Fed\u2019s power to shape market expectations, it would accommodate the reality that Fed officials do not agree what the benchmarks should be.In calibrating its efforts, the Fed is trying to assess the health of labor markets.The share of Americans with jobs remains far lower than before the financial crisis. According the account, however, Fed officials are increasingly convinced that monetary policy cannot reverse much of that decline. Work-force participation was falling before the recession, and a growing number of Fed officials think that the long-term trend \u2014 driven by the march of the baby boomers into retirement \u2014 is now close to catching up with the precipitous drop during the recession.The Fed\u2019s staff also reduced its formal estimate of the economy\u2019s potential output, suggesting they believe the economy will not return to the higher growth rates achieved before the Great Recession.The share of younger adults with jobs also declined sharply during the recession, but Fed officials seem increasingly doubtful about reversing that trend, too.The account said only \u201ca few participants judged that the decline in participation for younger and prime-age workers likely reflected the slow recovery in jobs and wages and so might be reversed as labor market conditions strengthened.\u201d Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Thursday with an article about the minutes from the most recent Federal Reserve meeting misstated the role of Narayana Kocherlakota at the Fed. As the article correctly noted, he is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, not a Fed governor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Orders for Durable Goods Rose in January", "Date": "2014-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOrders for long-lasting manufactured goods excluding transportation and a gauge of business spending unexpectedly rose in January, offering hopeful signs for factory activity, which has slowed in recent months. Still, the data on Thursday was not enough to alter views that economic growth hit a soft patch early in the first quarter, with important measures like shipments declining last month.\u201cUpside surprises are welcome news. Underlying strength in the economy, however, remains less than stellar at the start of the year,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.The Commerce Department said durable goods orders excluding transportation rose 1.1 percent, the largest increase since May, after falling 1.9 percent in December. Durable goods are items meant to last three years or more.The increase last month, which beat economists\u2019 expectations for a 0.3 percent fall, reflected a surge in orders for computers and electronic products, fabricated metal products and military capital goods.However, orders declined for machinery, primary metals, electrical equipment, appliances and components, and transportation equipment. Data like industrial production and regional factory surveys have suggested a loss of momentum in manufacturing and the broader economy in recent months.Part of the slowdown reflects unusually cold weather that has disrupted activity. Manufacturing is also cooling as businesses work through a huge stock of unsold goods that was accumulated in the second half of 2013. As a result, they are placing fewer orders with manufacturers, holding back factory production.In January, shipments of durable goods fell for a second consecutive month and inventories rose 0.3 percent after increasing 0.9 percent in December.\u201cWhat we\u2019re not seeing in terms of manufacturing production is a consistent steady demand for products leading to a cumulative growth rate in manufacturing,\u201d said Lance Roberts, chief economist at STA Wealth Management in Houston.A separate report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 348,000. Economists had expected first-time applications to fall to 335,000.While last week\u2019s increase pushed them to the upper end of their range this year, it does not signal labor market weakness, as claims tend to be volatile around federal holidays.The four-week moving average for new claims, considered a better measure of underlying labor market conditions as it irons out week-to-week volatility, was unchanged at 338,250.\u201cOur sense is that there has been no change in the underlying pace of layoffs,\u201d said Guy Berger, an economist at RBS in Stamford, Conn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Emerging Markets Should Look Within", "Date": "2014-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIn recent weeks, Argentina, Turkey, Ukraine and Thailand have endured plunging currencies, capital flight and political disruptions in varying combinations. While they have all been affected by global economic tides, these nations are facing crises because of problems in their national governance. And if we look elsewhere around the world, we find that governance has been re-emerging as a major factor behind success or failure in many emerging nations.It\u2019s not that macroeconomic quandaries have gone away in all of those countries. There are still many such issues: how to deal with current account deficits, for example, or how to face the consequences of tighter monetary policy in the United States. But these concerns were foreseeable, and some countries have been meeting them, if imperfectly, while others are letting these problems push them over the precipice. In this context, good governance means directing political energies at strengthening the economy rather than trying to cement power and keep down the opposition.This new world contrasts with two earlier waves of change. The first started in the 1990s, when a rising China bought and invested in raw materials at an unheard-of pace. That flow of purchasing power was so strong that it brought better times to other emerging nations, including many in South America and Africa, regardless of whether the individual countries had good governance in place.The second major wave was the recent global recession, which damaged the commercial prospects of many nations. For instance, in the first quarter of 2009, the gross domestic product of Singapore fell at an annualized rate of 8.9 percent. That wasn\u2019t because Singapore had bad economic policy, but because exports were hit by a global downturn beyond the country\u2019s control.The two waves have had such noticeable effects that we\u2019ve become unaccustomed to evaluating political fundamentals in individual nations. But these waves, though not quite over, have slowed. Many of the advanced economies have returned to financial normalcy, albeit with stunted employment. And the Chinese growth juggernaut is slowing.Let\u2019s consider the role of governance in four countries facing some of the most pressing crises:What is striking about these stories is how rooted they are in each country\u2019s daily internal struggles. Indonesia, India, South Africa, Brazil and Russia also appear vulnerable \u2014 and, again, it\u2019s largely because of an inability to solve domestic problems. It\u2019s not primarily because they have been whipsawed by unstoppable global trends.It\u2019s not yet clear how to characterize China, as far as governance goes. For all of its economic progress, there are still many signs of dysfunction in political institutions, like corruption among the party elite and an unwillingness to take on state-owned factories and energy companies to fight worsening air pollution. It\u2019s also not clear whether the Chinese are succeeding at rebalancing their economy toward consumption. Most important, we don\u2019t how robust its political system would be in a serious economic downturn. Yet China is important enough globally that if its economy imploded, many other nations would have crises, too, no matter what they did on their own.So we\u2019re now at a point where many global macroeconomic factors have been muted. That means tougher tests, including political ones, for quite a few emerging-market nations. And maybe 20 years from now, we will no longer be calling this entire group of countries \u201cemerging.\u201d It\u2019s not only that many will have emerged \u2014 it\u2019s also that some may fall off the track of progress altogether.TYLER COWEN is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

Last week, the cable giant Comcast announced a deal to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, and last month, Suntory Holdings of Japan announced it was buying Beam, the maker of Jim Beam and Maker\u2019s Mark whiskey, for $13.9 billion.Investors should expect more large deals this year, said Mike Serio, regional chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. \u201cThis has been building up for three or four years now,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies have so much money on their balance sheets and there\u2019s only so much you can do with it.\u201d\u201cYou could increase your dividend. You could buy back stock,\u201d Mr. Serio added, noting that the money could also be used for business investments. \u201cOr you can do deals.\u201dLast week, the S.&P. 500 increased 2.3 percent, and Tuesday\u2019s slim gain means it is down just 0.4 percent so far this year. The Dow is still down 2.7 percent for 2014, while, the Nasdaq is up 2.3 percent.The market\u2019s turnaround last week was especially notable given the rough start to the year. The S.&P. 500 has risen seven of the last eight days.\u201cI would be very surprised if we don\u2019t see the market move back to its highs very soon,\u201d said Randy Frederick, a managing director at Charles Schwab. Two minor economic reports on Tuesday had little impact on the stock market. Both suggested that the bitter winter weather that has enveloped much of the nation the last two months has been holding back the American economy. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s Empire State survey showed that manufacturing slowed in the region in February far more than economists expected. Also, a survey of the housing market showed homebuilder confidence fell sharply in February, because of the severe weather.In the bond market, interest rates eased. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.71 percent from 2.75 percent on Friday, while its price rose 10/32, to 100 12/32. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Announces 7 Regional Climate Hubs", "Date": "2014-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On the heels of the Senate\u2019s passage of a long-awaited farm bill, the Obama administration announced the creation of seven regional \u201cclimate hubs\u201d on Wednesday to help farmers and rural communities respond to the risks of climate change, including drought, invasive pests, fires and floods.White House officials described the move as one of several executive actions that President Obama will take on climate change without action from Congress.In substance, the creation of the climate hubs is a limited step, but it is part of a broader campaign by the administration to advance climate policy wherever possible with executive authority. The action is also part of a push to build political support for the administration\u2019s more divisive moves on climate change \u2014 in particular, the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s regulations on coal-fired power plants.Tom Vilsack, the secretary of agriculture and a former Iowa governor, announced the creation of the climate hubs at a White House briefing.\u201cFor generations, America\u2019s farmers, ranchers and forest landowners have innovated and adapted to challenges,\u201d Mr. Vilsack said, according to prepared remarks. \u201cToday, they face a new and more complex threat in the form of a changing and shifting climate, which impacts both our nation\u2019s forests and our farmers\u2019 bottom lines.\u201dThe hubs will be in Ames, Iowa; Durham, N.H.; Raleigh, N.C.; Fort Collins, Colo.; El Reno, Okla.; Corvallis, Ore.; and Las Cruces, N.M. The hubs will be set up at existing federal facilities and will not receive extra financing.Rural communities in Republican voting districts often have a negative view of the E.P.A., which regulates agricultural activities, like the use of pesticides and water on farms. But farmers are also on the front lines of extreme weather, particularly increased drought, which scientists say is linked to climate change.The farm belt suffered deeply during the record drought of 2012, and the government estimates that the American economy lost $50 billion because of drought from 2011 to 2013, much of that from the agricultural sector.The Obama administration hopes the program will help farmers adapt to climate change while making the case for broader climate regulations.The E.P.A. is now drafting rules that will limit carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants and potentially shutter hundreds of them across the country. The administration anticipates objections from the coal industry and many states when the regulations are completed.Nebraska is already suing the administration over a draft climate change regulation issued in September, which would cut carbon pollution from future coal-fired power plants.An earlier version of this article stated incorrectly one of the Obama administration\u2019s climate hubs to help farmers and rural communities respond to the risks of climate change, including drought, invasive pests, fires and floods. Davis, Calif., is a sub-hub, not a hub.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Senate Leaders Avert Debt Ceiling Crisis", "Date": "2014-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It was a moment of real drama in a chamber known for its somnambulism. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, counted votes on his hand, at one point holding up three fingers as he searched for the remaining votes. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, his No. 2, paced the Senate floor.What happened next would determine whether their party would again be blamed for triggering a crisis. But when it was clear they had no choice, the two Republicans, who face primary challenges in the November midterm elections, stepped forward in tandem on Wednesday to break their party\u2019s filibuster.In a nearby cloakroom, an animated Senator John McCain of Arizona pleaded with fellow Republicans to support their leaders, while others directed ire at Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who prompted the showdown, and at one point stood alone as his colleagues gathered in a tight circle to weigh their options. Eventually, others followed the leaders \u2014 12 Republicans in all \u2014 and the potential catastrophe was no more.It also represented a public rebuke of the Tea Party wing by Republican Party elders in what has been a sometimes fierce intramural struggle.Congress gave final approval on Wednesday to raising the nation\u2019s borrowing authority, the first \u201cclean\u201d increase since 2009. It followed Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio delivering a House vote on Tuesday on the backs of Democratic votes, as Republican leaders stood up to absorb the blows from the Tea Party elements in their party.For Mr. Boehner, the challenge was putting a debt ceiling increase up for a vote, without preconditions. For Senate Republican leaders, it was to actually cast the votes. In both chambers, their actions provided crucial political cover to their colleagues, who then were free to vote against the measure while also escaping blame in the midterm elections for the harm to the economy that a debt default would have wrought.\u201cMcConnell and Cornyn voted in a responsible way under the circumstances, and hopefully people will understand that McConnell, especially, in an incredibly tough race, the toughest Republican race in the country, had the courage to vote the way the vast majority understood needed to occur,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, who voted with his leadership. \u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you I think it shows tremendous courage on his part.\u201dThe Senate voted 67 to 31 to break the filibuster, with 12 Republicans joining all 55 Democrats on the most critical vote of the day. The bill to lift the debt ceiling until March 2015 then passed 55 to 43, in an entirely party-line vote.Republican leaders \u2014 from Mr. Boehner to Mr. McConnell and their lieutenants in both chambers \u2014 collectively decided that they needed to quickly dispose of the debt ceiling fight in order to maintain the political focus on President Obama, his health care law and a souring political atmosphere for the president\u2019s party.The government faced a potentially catastrophic default on Feb. 27, and had Congress headed home for its weeklong Washington\u2019s Birthday break without addressing it, congressional Republicans again would have become the focus of a countdown toward disaster. Having suffered through October\u2019s 16-day government shutdown, Republican leaders understood their party\u2019s fortunes in the coming midterm elections could be determined by how long the debt-ceiling showdown dragged on.\u201cThat\u2019s leadership,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. \u201cSpeaker Boehner made sure his party wasn\u2019t put at risk and the country wasn\u2019t put in peril. By taking the pain himself, there\u2019s a lot of gratitude in the conference.\u201dConservatives were left infuriated by what they saw as an abdication of fiscal responsibility, and began calling for the resignation of top congressional Republicans. Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks, said his group would redouble its efforts to replace the top two Republican leaders.\u201cBetween the grass-roots frustration with Mitch McConnell and with John Boehner, it\u2019s the perfect storm,\u201d Mr. Kibbe said.Mr. Cruz, who had forced the filibuster, seeking deficit reduction talks in exchange for the debt ceiling increase, declared, \u201cToday was a classic victory for Washington establishment interests, and the people who lost were the American people who find the fiscal and economic condition of this nation even worse because of a lack of leadership.\u201dHad Mr. Cruz not mounted the filibuster, the debt-ceiling increase could have passed the Senate with only Democratic votes \u2014 an outcome many Republicans wanted. But he was unapologetic, even as many of his colleagues fumed that he had single-handedly forced his own leaders to take perhaps the most difficult vote of this election season.\u201cIt should have been a very easy vote,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cIn my view, every Senate Republican should have stood together and said what every one of us tells our constituents back home, which is that we will not go along with raising the debt ceiling while doing nothing to address the underlying spending problem.\u201dAfter the vote, Mr. McCain joked that he was only talking about the stormy winter weather.\u201cI\u2019ve never been any good at twisting arms, which is one of the many reasons why I was never president of the United States,\u201d he said. But he added praise for Mr. McConnell: \u201cSeriously, he knows that he\u2019s the leader \u2014 he\u2019s the elected Republican leader \u2014 and that it was up to him to cast the right vote,\u201d Mr. McCain said.President Obama, a winner in the showdown, has promised to sign the debt ceiling increase.\u201cWe welcome the news that Congress has acted to meet its responsibility\u201d by lifting the debt limit, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said in a statement. He said that the action \u201cwill provide certainty and stability to businesses and financial markets.\u201dFor Republican leaders, the debt ceiling showdown gave them a chance to replay the government shutdown \u2014 but with a different ending. Then as now, outside conservative groups and their Tea Party allies in Congress pressed for confrontation, but with no clear path away from political disaster. This time, Republican leaders did not take the bait.\u201cWe can put the country through two weeks of turmoil or we can put this behind us,\u201d Mr. Corker said. \u201cThe fact is, the House could only pass a clean debt ceiling. We knew what the outcome was going to be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case for a Higher Minimum Wage", "Date": "2014-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialNone of that, however, has softened the hearts of opponents, including congressional Republicans and low-wage employers, notably restaurant owners and executives. This is not a new debate. The minimum wage is a battlefield in a larger political fight between Democrats and Republicans \u2014 dating back to the New Deal legislation that instituted the first minimum wage in 1938 \u2014 over government\u2019s role in the economy, over raw versus regulated capitalism, over corporate power versus public needs. But the results of the wage debate are clear. Decades of research, facts and evidence show that increasing the minimum wage is vital to the economic security of tens of millions of Americans, and would be good for the weak economy. As Congress begins its own debate, here are answers to some basic questions about the need for an increase.The peak year for the minimum wage was 1968, when its purchasing power was nearly $9.40 in 2013 dollars, as shown in the accompanying chart. Since then, the erosion caused by inflation has obviously overwhelmed the increases by Congress. Even a boost to $10.10 an hour by 2016 (also adjusted to 2013 dollars) would lift the minimum to just above its real value in 1968. So while it is better than no increase, it is hardly a raise. The situation is worse when the minimum wage is compared with the average wages of typical American workers, the ones with production and nonsupervisory jobs in the private sector. From the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, when one full-time, full-year minimum wage job could keep a family of two above the poverty line, the minimum equaled about half of the average wage. Today, it has fallen to one-third; to restore it to half would require nearly $11 an hour, a better goal than $10.10. More than 4.8 million workers now earn the lowest legal pay. This calculator shows the hard choices that have to be made living on the smallest paychecks.The problem is that the average wage, recently $20.39 an hour, has also stagnated over the past several decades, despite higher overall education levels for typical workers and despite big increases in labor productivity. People are working harder and churning out more goods and services, but there\u2019s no sign of that in their paychecks. If the average wage had kept pace with those productivity gains, it would be about $36 an hour today, and the minimum wage, at half the average, would be about $18. That is not to suggest that the hourly minimum wage could be catapulted from $7.25 to $18. A minimum of $18 would be untenable with the average hovering in the low $20s. But it does confirm that impersonal market forces are not the only, or even the primary, reason for widespread wage stagnation. Flawed policies and changing corporate norms are also to blame, because they have allowed the benefits of productivity gains to flow increasingly to profits, shareholder returns and executive pay, instead of workers\u2019 wages.Evidence, however, does not stop conservatives from making the argument that by raising the cost of labor, a higher minimum wage will hurt businesses, leading them to cut jobs and harming the low-wage workers it is intended to help. Alternatively, they argue it will hurt consumers by pushing up prices precipitously. Those arguments are simplistic. Research and experience show that employers do not automatically cope with a higher minimum wage by laying off workers or not hiring new ones. Instead, they pay up out of savings from reduced labor turnover, by slower wage increases higher up the scale, modest price increases or other adjustments.Which brings the debate over raising the minimum wage full circle. The real argument against it is political, not economic. Republican opposition will likely keep any future increase in the minimum wage below a level that would constitute a firm wage floor, though an increase to $10.10 an hour would help tens of millions of workers. It also would help the economy by supporting consumer spending that in turn supports job growth. It is not a cure-all; it is not bold or innovative. But it is on the legislative agenda, and it deserves to pass. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Court Challenge on Bond Buying Poses Test for Central Bank, and for E.U.", "Date": "2014-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisFRANKFURT \u2014 Courts are normally supposed to resolve disputes. But a decision last week by the Federal Constitutional Court in Germany has raised more questions than it has answered about the legality of a financial weapon that many analysts say saved the euro in its darkest hour \u2014 without even firing a shot.In the view of the German court, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, made a promise he could not legally keep in the summer of 2012, when he resolved to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to preserve the euro currency union.By doing so, the court inadvertently exposed another weakness in the construction of the European Union, which remains a relatively feeble federation compared with its strongest member states. The decision suggests that the European court system suffers from the same kind of turf battles that have often hampered political decision-making in the euro zone and prolonged the crisis.Mr. Draghi stepped in at a critical time for the European Union. During the summer of 2012, the high levels of borrowing costs of some of the euro zone\u2019s weakest members, as measured by the interest rates on their bonds, were unsustainable. The specter of big bailouts for Italy and Spain was looming, and no one believed the euro zone could possibly afford such rescues.The Draghi vow alone helped to start easing the crisis. And soon after, the European Central Bank announced a plan to buy huge quantities of euro zone government bonds, which would ensure enough demand to keep the rates reasonably low.Having brandished the weapon, Mr. Draghi never needed to use it. Market interest rates for Spanish and Italian bonds plummeted and the euro zone crisis receded. That rendered any argument about the legality of the bank\u2019s bond buying to be largely theoretical.Still, thousands of Germans, fearful that they would have to bear the cost of rescuing Italians and Spaniards, petitioned the Constitutional Court to declare the program illegal. After deliberating for seven months, the court, which meets in the southwestern city of Karlsruhe, ruled Friday that purchases of euro zone government bonds would violate a provision in the bank\u2019s charter that prohibits it from financing member governments.But rather than blocking any future bond buying, a move that might have caused havoc in financial markets, the court punted to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.Some analysts saw the decision as little more than a way for the German court to express its disapproval of any bond purchases, without the risk of reigniting the euro zone crisis. The German court even reserved the right to block a higher court decision.\u201cThey want to appear true to their legal principles, but they don\u2019t want to go where that takes them,\u201d said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.Many experts say the muddled decision places no immediate restraint on the European Central Bank, a view expressed Wednesday by Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, a member of the bank\u2019s executive board.\u201cThe status of the O.M.T. is not changed,\u201d Mr. Coeur\u00e9 said in an interview with Reuters, referring to what the bank calls the bond purchases, the outright monetary transactions. \u201cIt is ready to be used, but it is highly unlikely it would have to be used at the moment.\u201dMany outside analysts agree, and there has been little market reaction to the decision.\u201cI don\u2019t think the E.C.B.\u2019s room to maneuver will be limited by this decision,\u201d Michael Heise, chief economist of the German insurer Allianz, told a small group of reporters on Wednesday in Frankfurt. If the central bank had not promised to intervene in bond markets last year, he said, the euro might have collapsed, with grave economic consequences.But the German court decision has been fodder for euro-skeptics, confirming their view that the bank has illegally grabbed power. And the decision highlights a major unresolved question of jurisprudence in the region: Does the European Court of Justice reign over national supreme courts?Mr. Kirkegaard predicted that the European Court of Justice, which could take more than a year to issue a decision, will find language that addresses the concerns of the German court and avoids a crisis.Still, the dispute creates uncertainty.Treaties give the European Court of Justice the final say in matters of European law. But the German Constitutional Court has a history of insisting on its right to decide whether European law violates the German Constitution, according to Franz Mayer, a professor at the University of Bielefeld. In its decision on Friday, the German court reiterated that it had the right to block policies that would expand the powers of the European Union beyond what has been agreed to by treaty.The German court also effectively told the European Court of Justice how it should rule. The bond-buying program would be legal, the German court said, only under certain conditions: if the amounts were limited; if the central bank insisted that bonds it buys be paid in full by the issuing governments; and if the bank did not distort market prices for the bonds. Analysts say that imposing limits on bond buying would encourage speculators to challenge the bank\u2019s resolve.The German decision was controversial within the court, as well. Two of the eight judges who considered the case issued unusually sharp dissenting opinions.\u201cIn an effort to secure the rule of law, a court may happen to exceed judicial competence,\u201d Judge Gertrude L\u00fcbbe-Wolff wrote in dissent. \u201cIn my view, this has occurred here.\u201dMichael Gerhardt, the other judge who dissented, said the complaints against the European Central Bank filed by thousands of individual Germans were inadmissible. It is the responsibility of the elected members of the German Parliament, not ordinary citizens, to challenge the bank\u2019s decisions, Mr. Gerhardt said. Parliament has not tried to block the bank\u2019s policies because most legislators favor them.The German Constitutional Court\u2019s condemnation of bond buying has no legally binding force. But it could act as a constraint on the bank if, as some economists fear might still happen, the euro zone slipped into a broad decline in prices. Such deflation could be ruinous for consumer spending, corporate profits and jobs.One obvious strategy against deflation would be the wholesale purchase of government bonds, the same tool that the Federal Reserve has been using to stimulate the United States economy.Mr. Coeur\u00e9 said on Wednesday that the European Central Bank saw no sign of deflation at the moment, though it was alert to the risks of very low inflation. Bond purchases remain an option as a monetary policy tool, he said.And Mr. Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute said he did not think that Mr. Draghi was worried about the German court. On the contrary, Mr. Draghi, a master of using words and veiled threats to impose discipline on politicians and financial markets, may find the German howling about his policies to be useful. The complaints give Mr. Draghi a counterweight to the majority of members of the bank\u2019s governing council who would like to open the monetary policy floodgates.\u201cIt\u2019s always useful to have a mad dog on your team,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard said. \u201cIt intimidates the opposition.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Second Shot", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere comes a moment in every novelist\u2019s career when she sloughs off the weight of the past \u2014 the conventions and obsessions, the stylistic fallbacks and linguistic tics, the influence of early masters \u2014 and ventures into new territory, breaking free into a marriage of tone and style, of plot and characterization, that\u2019s utterly her own. Anna Quindlen\u2019s marvelous romantic comedy of manners is just such a book. In \u201cStill Life With Bread Crumbs,\u201d Quindlen achieves something distinctive, a feminist novel for a post-feminist age. Here she takes up a subject too rarely seen in contemporary fiction (not to mention contemporary Hollywood): the life of a woman who would once have been characterized as \u201cof a certain age.\u201d At 60, Quindlen\u2019s complicated heroine, Rebecca Winter, is strong of body and mind, much less so of heart and bank account. In her late 30s, Rebecca made her name with a series of photographs chronicling her domestic life, which were taken up as landmarks of feminist art. The most famous image in the series, \u201cStill Life With Bread Crumbs,\u201d featured \u201ca vaguely Flemish composition of dirty wineglasses, stacked plates, the torn ends of two baguettes, and a dish towel singed at one corner by the gas stove.\u201d Reproduced on postcards, T-shirts and posters, it brought Rebecca unexpected fame. \u201cFor years she had lived off it and its satellites, the reprints and licensing, as well as its free-\u00adfloating reputation. . . . It had paid her restaurant bills and her hairdresser tips and she hadn\u2019t even really noticed how much money it brought in until it started to dry up and then disappeared.\u201dNow all Rebecca has to show for that early success \u2014 and the popular work that came afterward, abstract images of her son, Ben \u2014 is the beautiful apartment, overlooking Central Park, that she bought with the proceeds. Her marriage to a caddish academic (at present ensconced with his fourth wife) dissolved long ago in the face of her fame. Her creativity also seems to have fled. \u201cIronically, great success made Rebecca less and less sure of herself, until everything she produced, even the successful things she produced, seemed like something she\u2019d done before.\u201d Her son once jokingly referred to her as \u201cthe artist formerly known as Rebecca Winter.\u201dIn desperation, if not outright panic, she has sublet the apartment \u2014 \u201cher true home, her beloved home, or, as her accountant called it, her greatest illiquid asset\u201d \u2014 at the \u201caccepted exorbitant New York rate\u201d and rented a dilapidated cottage in the countryside far north of Manhattan for a fraction of the price, in the hopes that she can pull herself together, both financially and artistically. But the calm and quiet unnerve rather than settle her: \u201cShe didn\u2019t find it peaceful in the least, more like the TV with the mute button pressed on the remote. Empty.\u201d She finds herself \u201cdoing math in her mind, the math she did almost every day. Fifty-eight hundred for subletting the apartment, minus 1,000 for renting the cottage; 1,400 for the maintenance on the apartment.\u201d At night she lies in her lumpy, rented bed, trying to imagine herself finding a normal job, \u201cmanaging a coffee shop, raising money for a hospital, anything with a regular paycheck. An office. She\u2019d never worked in a real office.\u201d So pervasive is her worry that when she spies a bald eagle in the woods, \u201cthe shock of recognition was powerful; he looked exactly like money.\u201dBut Rebecca\u2019s crisis is, ultimately, more existential than financial. Marriage and motherhood had fueled her work, trained her eye. The power of those early photographs came from rage, rage at her pompous husband, rage at herself for being misled into the sort of conventional marriage that involves staying home and cooking complicated French stews, then falling asleep on the couch, leaving behind a flotilla of dirty dishes. The Kitchen Counter series \u201cwas seen as an iconic moment in women\u2019s art. But in fact at the time she took those photographs Rebecca had just been tired, tired in that way a woman with a child and a husband and a house and a job and a life gets tired, so that it feels like a mild chronic illness.\u201dNow, for the first time, she needs to make her own way, both professionally and personally. She needs to produce art in order to live. That she does so comes as no surprise, but the manifold pleasures of this novel lie less in its turns of plot \u2014 and in the male companionship she may ultimately find \u2014 than in the wit and charm with which the story unfolds. In previous novels, Quindlen has often employed first-\u00adperson narration \u2014 to particularly great effect in her harrowing 1998 best seller, \u201cBlack and Blue,\u201d a pitch-perfect account of a woman\u2019s flight from her brutal, abusive husband \u2014 but here she has wisely adopted a wry, omniscient approach, moving back and forth in time. (\u201c \u2018Peter is so European,\u2019 women would say, and later Rebecca wondered if that was their way of telling her that he slept around. But that was later.\u201d)Quindlen\u2019s previous novels have often taken their subjects from her concerns as a reporter and columnist, for this newspaper and for Newsweek magazine. Her coverage of what can generally be defined as women\u2019s issues was no less trailblazing than Rebecca Winter\u2019s fictional photographs. When Quindlen\u2019s Public and Private appeared in The Times, she became only the third woman to write a regular column for the paper\u2019s Op-Ed page; hers was among the first voices chronicling the everyday challenges of American women. Taken as a whole, Quindlen\u2019s writings represent a generous and moving interrogation of women\u2019s experience across the lines of class and race. But her earlier novels \u2014 earnest and passionate as they are, demonstrating both heart and intellect \u2014 lack the qualities that have defined Quindlen\u2019s columns: humor and economy. Not so \u201cStill Life With Bread Crumbs,\u201d which proves all the more moving because of its light, sophisticated humor. Quindlen\u2019s least overtly political novel, it packs perhaps the most serious punch. In her lovely 1998 book, \u201cHow Reading Changed My Life,\u201d Quindlen recalls reading Mary McCarthy\u2019s \u201cThe Group\u201d for the first time: \u201cKay\u2019s suicide . . . the sad settling that Dorothy makes of her life after her one sexual adventure. . . . the lives of intelligent women had to amount to more than this.\u201d In her new novel \u2014 a comedy in the style of Austen rather than a tragedy in that of McCarthy \u2014 she ultimately offers her heroine a life that amounts to much, a way to save both herself and someone else. In doing so, Quindlen has delivered a novel that will have staying power all its own.STILL LIFE WITH BREAD CRUMBSBy Anna Quindlen252 pp. Random House. $26.Joanna Rakoff is the author of the novel \u201cA Fortunate Age.\u201d Her memoir, \u201cMy Salinger Year,\u201d will be published in June.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With His First Budget, de Blasio Hews to Familiar Campaign Themes", "Date": "2014-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday proposed his first budget for New York City, a $73.7 billion spending plan that gave more palpable, if not practical, shape to the robust liberal platform that carried him into office last year.With a tax on wealthy residents to pay for prekindergarten classes, financing for an inspector general to monitor the Police Department and relief for the Housing Authority of the costs of policing its apartment towers, the preliminary budget was a recapitulation of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign platform and of the recurring themes of his first weeks in office.He said his administration would be financially prudent yet stay true to an agenda that addresses the needs of the city\u2019s most disadvantaged residents. \u201cOurs is a progressive administration,\u201d he said. \u201cOur budget will be a progressive budget.\u201d The budget seemed more political than realistic, though.

Cuomo and some Albany lawmakers have already said they will not approve.Mr. de Blasio, who like Mr. Cuomo is a Democrat, said he was sticking with the tax increase. \u201cWe\u2019ve presented a plan and that\u2019s the only plan that\u2019s on the table,\u201d he said.The preliminary budget will be followed by a more detailed executive budget to be released in May; a final budget must be negotiated with the City Council by the new fiscal year, which begins on July 1.The de Blasio budget also calls for $500 million in state funding \u2014 money the administration believes it is owed as part of a settlement \u2014 for the city\u2019s public schools, whose fate in Albany is\u00a0at best\u00a0uncertain. That\u00a0request appeared again aimed at Mr. Cuomo, who has offered to pay for prekindergarten statewide without a tax.\u00a0On Wednesday, the mayor noted that the city was also under pressure because of a $2.7 billion gap between current state funding and what was agreed upon in that settlement of a lawsuit to obtain more money for students in poor school districts. Presenting his spending plan at a news conference in which he relied on PowerPoint slides \u2014 a favorite device of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s \u2014 Mr. de Blasio nonetheless aimed pointed criticism at the former mayor\u2019s budget practices. \u201cThe murky waters have been created, in part, by the previous administration,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at one point. At another, he said Mr. Bloomberg, a political independent, was given an \u201cartificially high level of credit\u201d for his management skills. \u201cThe way they budgeted was not appropriate,\u201d he said. He added that he would dispense with the \u201cKabuki theater\u201d of proposing cuts in spending that no one believed would survive the negotiating process with the Council, like firehouse closings or the defunding the offices of the borough presidents and the public advocate. Fiscal policy experts agree that Mr. de Blasio inherited a city on a strong financial footing, with a potential surplus that could exceed $3 billion \u2014 before accounting for any retroactive pay increases for city workers.But Mr. de Blasio focused on New York\u2019s structural deficit \u2014 the excess of expected expenses over reliably recurring income \u2014 which requires the city to rely on funds left over from a prior year to balance a current year\u2019s budget.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s strongest complaint about Mr. Bloomberg is that his predecessor bequeathed the city a situation in which all 152 of its labor unions, representing 300,000 employees, have been working without contracts for years. The unions are demanding pay raises and back pay that could amount to as much as $7 billion.Mr. de Blasio said that in order to reach a settlement, the city would have to find savings elsewhere. However, the plan he laid out did not include any broad spending cuts.Mr. Bloomberg left Mr. de Blasio a down payment, at least, on those labor settlements, putting aside $730 million in this year\u2019s and next year\u2019s budgets for that purpose.Mr. de Blasio and his finance director, Dean Fuleihan, said they disagreed with the rosy projections on the surplus, but they did not offer their own.The mayor did place $1 billion into a fund established to pay for the health care of retired city workers. That fund was set up under Mr. Bloomberg, inspiring criticism in 2008 from none other than Mr. de Blasio, then a city councilman.Mayor de Blasio said on Wednesday that he could not recall what he said at the time, but that he was in a different position now with different pressures. \u201cIn 2008, we didn\u2019t have 150 open labor contracts and in 2008 Sandy hadn\u2019t happened,\u201d he said.Mr. de Blasio would not say whether he would tap the fund to pay for retroactive pay raises, but Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, praised what he called a departure from the Bloomberg years.\u201cA budget that recognizes the steady improvement in the city\u2019s economy and sets aside significant reserve funds, and a mayor who wants to conduct labor negotiations in \u2018an atmosphere of partnership,\u2019 are important steps in the right direction,\u201d Mr. Mulgrew said in a statement.Mr. de Blasio also proposed $3 million to pay for an inspector general for the Police Department, a position created last year by Council legislation after the controversy over the stop-and-frisk practices; vowed to pay for the enforcement of an expanded paid sick leave law; pledged to acquire state aid for homelessness prevention programs, the recent loss of which he said had led to record numbers of people in city shelters; and capped rent contributions for people in supported housing who are H.I.V.-positive or have AIDS.He also called for allowing the Housing Authority to stop paying for police services, freeing up $52.5 million for it to use for repairs between now and June.Mr. Brecher also said, however, that Mr. de Blasio\u2019s repeated criticism of Mr. Bloomberg for not resolving the labor contracts was \u201chighly unfair.\u201d\u201cIt takes two to tango, and it takes two to negotiate,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are two parties responsible for this situation we\u2019re in, not just one.\u201dMarc Santora contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America Must Assuage Saudi Anxiety", "Date": "2014-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 At discussions with world leaders during conferences in Davos, Switzerland, and Munich last month, it became clear to me that the most important challenge facing the United States in the Middle East is managing Saudi Arabia\u2019s reaction to the unexpected breakthrough in nuclear talks with Iran. The Saudis are angry; they fear that a nuclear deal would free the United States to put the Middle East on the back burner as it switches its full attention to China and the rest of Asia. That would leave Iran, in the absence of economic sanctions, free to expand its sphere of influence. To be sure, Secretary of State John Kerry argued forcefully, at both the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos and the Munich Security Conference, that America remains fully engaged in the Middle East. But his Arab audience is, instead, taking its cue from President Obama, who has made no secret of his desire to untangle America from the Middle East\u2019s antagonisms. That goal may be understandable, but a careless pivot could make the tangle only worse. America\u2019s challenge, then, is to convincingly divide its attention between these two parts of the world. In either, instability could gravely threaten fundamental American interests. The Middle East is reeling from the chaotic overhang of the Arab Spring. At Davos and Munich, Iranians and Arabs both worried that Syria\u2019s civil war would spill over and tear the region apart along Shiite-Sunni lines. But that has evoked only tepid American concern, and many Arabs blame this disengagement for the survival of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad. That would be bad enough, in the eyes of Sunni Arab leaders, but now it has been compounded by the fear that reducing tension with Iran is America\u2019s last item of business in the region before it turns its attention fully to Asia. The Saudis, in particular, believe it is no longer inconceivable that after Iraq and Afghanistan, a thoroughgoing pullout of forces in the Persian Gulf will become America\u2019s mantra: the \u201czero option.\u201d Follow that thought and there is a paradox: Unless America addresses Saudi concerns, its Iran policy could prove destabilizing to the Middle East, rather than a masterstroke that eases tensions. That would be profoundly counterproductive: The risk of new crises in the oil-rich crossroads of the Persian Gulf would make it much harder for America to focus on Asia.Saudi Arabia and Iran are already engaged in a deadly scramble for spheres of influence. Having turned the Syrian conflict into a proxy war, this competition now threatens to do the same in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain.Only in Bahrain in 2011 did the Saudis succeed in actually thwarting a largely Shiite rising. With that record, they can only fear that their Iran problem will explode if Tehran realizes a rapprochement with the West. So the Saudis are redoubling their effort to stoke Sunni sectarianism as a bulwark against Iran. In this warring by proxy, we are already seeing a dangerous resurgence of Al Qaeda-linked militias in Syria and Iraq. Mr. Obama\u2019s problem is that these treacherous prospects in the Middle East are coinciding with equally worrisome tensions in Asia, to which the administration is anxious to give its full attention. North Korea\u2019s dynastic intrigues have created greater uncertainty over an already volatile and nuclear-armed regime. More disturbing, long dormant nationalist sentiments and territorial disputes have resurfaced to threaten conflict in the South China Sea between China and its neighbors, as well as in the Sea of Japan, which touches China, the Korean Peninsula, Russia and Japan. Rising assertiveness by China and Japan is destabilizing the rest of the region, undermining its economic promise. The original goal of turning to Asia, expressed early in President Obama\u2019s first term, was to protect deep American economic interests. Now Asia is also demanding American diplomacy to avert a crisis that could wreak havoc on the global economy and force the United States to come to the defense of its ally, Japan. A wisecrack often heard among China watchers is that every time China gets into trouble, the Middle East bails it out. If Mr. Kerry\u2019s scant reference to Asia in his speeches is any indication, the pivot skeptics may have a point. Managing Arab anxiety over the Iran nuclear deal, containing the fallout from Syria\u2019s civil war, and simultaneously prodding Israelis and Palestinians toward thinking about peace demand intense American attention. This time around, America can afford neither to double down on the Middle East nor to abandon it. In fact, the two areas of concern are intertwined. Asia\u2019s boundless economic potential needs the Middle East\u2019s bottomless energy reserves. China is Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest oil customer, and Saudi Arabia is China\u2019s largest oil supplier. America needs Asian prosperity, and Asian prosperity demands Middle East stability.In Asia and the Middle East, America faces daunting crises. The key to success is underscoring our commitment to both, rather than complaining of an either-or choice. Nowhere is that imperative more critical than in our dealings with Saudi Arabia. The United States must combine its opening with Iran and its increase in attention to Asia with deeper engagement with issues that matter to the Arab world. Arab leaders need to see that American engagement with Iran will do more than remove that country\u2019s nuclear threat; it must also chart a path to changing Iran\u2019s regional policy, as a condition of allowing Iran to be integrated fully into the region.A good first step would be to bring Saudi Arabia and Iran to the same table to resolve the Syrian crisis. That would be good practice for American crisis management in Asia, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind Retreat on Immigration, a Complicated Political Interplay", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker John A. Boehner would sorely like to help engineer an overhaul of immigration policy to bolster his legacy, help his party politically and address a difficult social and economic problem. He just cannot seem to persuade other Republicans, who see the immigration debate as a major threat to their drive to win the Senate and increase their House majority in November.The tension between Mr. Boehner\u2019s desire to forge ahead on immigration and a Republican sense that staying focused on the new health care law is the path to victory in the midterm elections contributed to the speaker\u2019s sharp retreat on Thursday from his new push for an immigration consensus.Given that Mr. Boehner\u2019s negative comments on the prospects for immigration came on the same day Senate Republicans again blocked an extension of emergency unemployment aid, Republicans risk being portrayed as a force of obstruction if the year becomes one long impasse. After Mr. Boehner\u2019s comments, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, said that if Republicans did not intend to legislate, \u201cwhy don\u2019t we just pack up and go home?\u201dBut Republicans knowledgeable about the issue said immigration was not yet completely off the table. Instead, they said, reaching any agreement has become appreciably harder because of a Republican reluctance to get caught up in an internal feud and stomp on their increasingly bright election prospects.At the same time, Republicans say President Obama\u2019s increasing reliance on executive authority to impose his agenda has stirred real resentment among the rank-and-file. It has also deepened their suspicion that Mr. Obama would not follow through on tough border enforcement and other aspects of immigration policy that Republicans favor \u2014 resulting in the lack of trust that Mr. Boehner cited in his remarks.\u201cHe is running around the country telling everyone he\u2019s going to keep acting on his own,\u201d Mr. Boehner told reporters, accusing the president of \u201cfeeding more distrust about whether he is committed to the rule of law.\u201dMuch more is at work than the question of trust between congressional Republicans and the White House in what is becoming a complicated interplay of issues and politics.Republicans, through Mr. Boehner\u2019s remarks and other channels, are letting the White House know that one way it can begin to win back the confidence of House Republicans is to work with them on issues such as expanded trade authority despite House and Senate Democratic resistance to new trade deals.Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat who has been in quiet talks with top Republicans on immigration, suggested the speaker was also giving himself room to push through an increase in the federal debt limit in coming days.\u201cHe is sending messages; there are so many things going on,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cI believe that there is a good portion of the Republican leadership that wants to do a bill. I believe they know it\u2019s difficult. I believe they know it\u2019s not a straight line process.\u201dAt the White House, officials expressed some disappointment at the speaker\u2019s comments but also said they did not think reaching a deal on immigration was completely out of the question this year. Other Democrats saw the blocking of unemployment aid and the backing off on immigration as part of a familiar pattern: deep Republican refusal to embrace policies that have broad support even among some Republican allies. To them, Mr. Boehner\u2019s remarks were a calculated effort to extricate himself from the immigration debate while turning the blame on the president. It was Mr. Boehner of Ohio and his fellow House leaders who breathed life back into the subject last week by embracing an overhaul that opened the door to millions of illegal immigrants\u2019 gaining legal status, if not citizenship. That underscored Mr. Boehner\u2019s desire for a big legislative accomplishment that could improve the party\u2019s standing with Hispanics while satisfying the demands of business allies for policy that would lift the economy and expand the labor force.But hard-line conservatives remained dug in against any change that could be seen as amnesty. And some Republicans who have been open to a new approach to immigration said the timing seemed wrong, given the political advantage the party seems to be enjoying on the health care issue.If they have Democrats on the run, the argument went, it makes no sense to plunge into a contentious debate that would expose bitter party divisions, potentially spur resentment from Hispanics, lead to primaries for some Republican incumbents and sap voter enthusiasm in the fall, leaving Republicans short in their drive for Senate control.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the man who would like to be the leader of a new Senate Republican majority, said Tuesday that he saw little chance for legislation this year, further dampening its outlook.But Mr. Boehner and other Republicans still see an opening \u2014 though a narrowing one \u2014 to get a deal that could pay political benefits for the party and possibly give them leverage with the White House on trade and economic issues.Other Republicans believe it would be smarter to wait until after the midterms and pursue immigration in 2015 leading up to the presidential election, when Republicans will be more motivated to increase their appeal to Hispanic voters. If the midterm goes their way, they will be strengthened in Congress.But there are no guarantees that making major immigration law changes will get easier. If the effort dies this year, some Republicans may find themselves in 2015 agonizing that they missed a chance to get a difficult subject behind them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Crisis Loomed, Yellen Made Wry and Forceful Calls for Action", "Date": "2014-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the world\u2019s financial system stood on the verge of collapse in October 2008, Janet L. Yellen was not even a full voting member of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy-making committee, but she was not shy about admonishing her colleagues for not acting faster.\u201cWe need to do much more and the sooner the better,\u201d Ms. Yellen said at a two-day meeting in late October, after the Fed had helped bail out the banks. As president of the San Francisco regional Fed bank, Ms. Yellen attended all the meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee that year but had rotated out of the circle that actually voted on its actions. After months in which some members of the Fed committee resisted taking steps to prop up the economy, Ms. Yellen lectured her colleagues: \u201cFrankly, it is time for all hands on deck when it comes to our policy tools.\u201dNew transcripts of the Fed\u2019s meeting in 2008, based on recordings made at the time, provide one of the most revealing views to date of Ms. Yellen, who was sworn in earlier this month as chairwoman of the central bank.But even as she pushed for more aggressive policies to deal with the financial crisis and the economic downturn, Ms. Yellen also displayed an ability to disarm her critics with a sort of gallows humor, even in the darkest days.\u201cIn the run-up to Halloween, we have had a witch\u2019s brew of news,\u201d she said to the laughter of her colleagues, before quickly apologizing for her sarcasm.What the transcripts show is a woman who was constantly pushing her peers \u2014 and also cleverly cajoling them \u2014 to do more to help ordinary households, not just financial institutions. At the same time, she urged her colleagues to look at the flaws in the banks that caused the crisis in the first place. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in gradualism in circumstances like these,\u201d Ms. Yellen said in March 2008, months before the situation came to a boil. In the end, during the most terrifying moments, Ms. Yellen helped persuade even the staunchest opponents of more aggressive actions to go along with the policies that the head of the Fed, Ben S. Bernanke, wanted. At the end of October, the head of the regional Fed bank in Dallas, Richard W. Fisher, a member of the central bank known for his advocacy of higher interest rates, said that for one of the few times, he was following Ms. Yellen\u2019s lead.\u201cI will conclude with actually once again agreeing with President Yellen, as I think I have done twice in history,\u201d Mr. Fisher said.Ms. Yellen was usually squarely in line with Mr. Bernanke and the more activist members of the Federal Open Market Committee. But while Mr. Bernanke, as chairman, played the role of mediator and consensus builder, Ms. Yellen often became the most outspoken defender of the policies, and a reference point for others. The meetings of 2008 are littered with moments where other members of the committee used Ms. Yellen to support their own points, leading to lines like, \u201cas President Yellen pointed out,\u201d and \u201cas President Yellen noted.\u201dBut even as the committee agreed to take ever more extraordinary actions, Ms. Yellen voiced her steady disappointment that her colleagues were not doing more to help the economy.\u201cHistorical precedents, such as the case of Japan, teach us that it is a mistake to act cautiously as the economy unravels,\u201d she said in late October.It has long been known that Ms. Yellen was among the earliest members of the Fed to recognize the severity of the problems hitting the economy in 2007. In January 2008, while Mr. Fisher was pointing to the optimism of chief executives in Texas, Ms. Yellen was not mincing words about her views.\u201cThe severe and prolonged housing downturn and financial shock have put the economy at, if not beyond, the brink of recession,\u201d she said.As a forecaster, Ms. Yellen was at something of an advantage. She was based in California, where some of the earliest signs of distress appeared. In a lighter moment, she joked that the problems were not just in the collapsing housing market.\u201cEast Bay plastic surgeons and dentists note that patients are deferring elective procedures,\u201d she said to laughter, according to a transcript of the meeting on Sept. 16, 2008.\u201cThe Silicon Valley Country Club, with a $250,000 entrance fee and seven- to eight-year waiting list, has seen the number of would-be new members shrink to a mere 13,\u201d she said to more laughter.But she also was looking for clues anywhere she could find them. In June, she told her colleagues about employees at her bank who \u201chad their home equity lines slashed.\u201d\u201cOne has deferred a planned home renovation project as a consequence,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that is happening to them, I can only imagine how hard it must be to get a loan if you have a merely average credit rating.\u201dBy the summer, though, even with some data signaling an improvement, Ms. Yellen showed an unusual degree of skepticism, arguing that \u201cgiven the numerous large and worsening drags on spending, a couple of months of data aren\u2019t enough to convince me that we are on a solid trajectory.\u201dAs the new leader at the Fed, now the nation\u2019s leading bank regulator, the skepticism Ms. Yellen displayed toward Wall Street that is revealed in the transcripts is likely to prove particularly important. Early in 2008, she pointed to a paper by the economist Raghuram Rajan, now the head of India\u2019s central bank, about the danger of the structure of Wall Street bonuses.\u201cIt seems to me that we have had an awful lot of booms and busts in which this type of incentive played a role,\u201d she said.Timothy F. Geithner, the president of the New York Fed at the time, pushed back against Ms. Yellen and the idea that overhauling bonuses was necessary. After the election of Barack Obama in November, Mr. Geithner rose to become secretary of the Treasury, and few changes were made to rules about bonuses.Ms. Yellen might intend to approach the issue differently. Back in 2008 she said that proposals to alter bonuses \u201cwere not popular,\u201d presumably referring to financial circles.That didn\u2019t scare her off.\u201cI think this is worth some thought,\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "Ash Spill Shows How Watchdog Was Defanged", "Date": "2014-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 Last June, state employees in charge of stopping water pollution were given updated marching orders on behalf of North Carolina\u2019s new Republican governor and conservative lawmakers.\u201cThe General Assembly doesn\u2019t like you,\u201d an official in the Department of Environment and Natural Resources told supervisors called to a drab meeting room here. \u201cThey cut your budget, but you didn\u2019t get the message. And they cut your budget again, and you still didn\u2019t get the message.\u201dFrom now on, regulators were told, they must focus on customer service, meaning issuing environmental permits for businesses as quickly as possible. Big changes are coming, the official said, according to three people in the meeting, two of whom took notes. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like change, you\u2019ll be gone.\u201dBut when the nation\u2019s largest utility, Duke Energy, spilled 39,000 tons of coal ash into the Dan River in early February, those big changes were suddenly playing out in a different light. Federal prosecutors have begun a criminal investigation into the spill and the relations between Duke and regulators at the environmental agency.The spill, which coated the river bottom 70 miles downstream and threatened drinking water and aquatic life, drew attention to a deal that the environmental department\u2019s new leadership reached with Duke last year over pollution from coal ash ponds. It included a minimal fine but no order that Duke remove the ash \u2014 the waste from burning coal to generate electricity \u2014 from its leaky, unlined ponds. Environmental groups said the arrangement protected a powerful utility rather than the environment or the public.Facing increasing scrutiny and criticism, the department said late Friday that the company would be cited for two formal notices of violating environmental standards in connection with the spill. It is not clear what fines or other penalties could result. \"These are violations of state and federal law, and we are holding the utility accountable,\u201d said the state environmental secretary, John E. Skvarla III. Asked for comment, a spokeswoman said Duke will respond to the state.Current and former state regulators said the watchdog agency, once among the most aggressive in the Southeast, has been transformed under Gov. Pat McCrory into a weak sentry that plays down science, has abandoned its regulatory role and suffers from politicized decision-making.The episode is a huge embarrassment for Mr. McCrory, who worked at Duke Energy for 28 years and is a former mayor of Charlotte, where the company is based. And it has become another point of contention in North Carolina, where Republicans who took control of the General Assembly in 2011 and the governor\u2019s mansion last year have passed sweeping laws in line with conservative principles. They have affected voting rights and unemployment benefits, as well as what Republicans called \u201cjob-killing\u201d environmental regulations, which have received less notice.Critics say the accident, the third-largest coal ash spill on record, is inextricably linked to the state\u2019s new environmental politics and reflects an enforcement agency led by a secretary who suggested that oil was a renewable resource and an assistant secretary who, as a state lawmaker, drew a bull\u2019s-eye on a window in his office framing the environmental agency\u2019s headquarters.\u201cThey\u2019re terrified,\u201d said John Dorney, a retired supervisor who keeps in touch with many current employees. \u201cNow these people have to take a deep breath and say, \u2018I know what the rules require, but what does the political process want me to do?\u2019\u00a0\u201dDuke has apologized for the spill and says it is now committed to cleaning up some of its 32 coal ash ponds across the state. The company has also been subpoenaed in the federal investigation.A spokesman for Mr. McCrory said the governor had no role in the state\u2019s proposed settlement with Duke. On Tuesday, amid continuing concerns about the threat of future spills, he took a tougher stance than in the past, writing to Duke\u2019s chief executive that he wanted the waste ponds, some sprawling over many acres, to be moved away from the state\u2019s waterways.The environmental agency\u2019s embattled secretary, Mr. Skvarla, a McCrory appointee, pushed back last week on criticism of last year\u2019s deal, under which the $50 billion company was fined only $99,111 for leaks from ponds at two power plants. The accusation that his department \u201cand Duke Energy got together and made some smoky back-room deal with a nominal fine is simply not true,\u201d Mr. Skvarla told reporters.The fine was determined by a formula in the law, he said. The agency reached a settlement that allowed Duke to study its coal ash ponds, rather than immediately remove the slurry of ash and water, because it wanted to avoid being tied up in court for years, he said. \u201cOur goal is to clean up coal ash,\u201d Mr. Skvarla added. \u201cOur goal is to protect the environment.\u201dBut current and former agency employees said the treatment of Duke was typical of the pro-industry bias now in place under Governor McCrory, Mr. Skvarla and the General Assembly.Last year, the environment agency\u2019s budget for water pollution programs was cut by 10.2 percent, a bipartisan commission that approves regulations was reorganized to include only Republican appointees, and the governor vastly expanded the number of agency employees exempt from civil service protections, to 179 from 24.The effect, said midlevel supervisors who now serve at the pleasure of the governor, is that they are hesitant to crack down on polluters who might complain to Mr. Skvarla or a lawmaker, at the risk of their jobs. Several spoke anonymously out of fear of being fired. \u201cThey want to have a hammer to come down on anybody who hinders developers by enforcing regulations,\u201d said a supervisor whose department is supposed to regulate businesses under laws devised to protect water quality. \u201cWe\u2019re scared to death to say no to anyone anymore.\u201dA second supervisor, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: \u201cA lot of us never considered ourselves political creatures. What\u2019s happened here has really blown us out of the water. People speak in hushed tones in the hallway to each other. We go offsite to talk. It\u2019s totally changed the culture of this organization.\u201dMr. Skvarla said in an interview that he was \u201cspeechless\u201d to hear such a sentiment, adding, \u201cI think we have taken politics out of this agency.\u201dHe added: \u201cWhen I was hired by Governor McCrory, he said, \u2018I want you to do two things: I want you to protect the environment, and I want you to help us grow this economy. We have to help people through the regulatory maze.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSusan Wilson, an environmental engineer who inspected storm-water runoff at factories and subdivisions, quit last year after her duties were transferred to another department with little expertise in the subject. She said the bureaucratic shuffle was meant to satisfy developers.\u201cBusiness is important, but there should be a balance between the regulated community and the environment,\u201d Ms. Wilson said. \u201cIt\u2019s all out of balance here.\u201dDespite deep cuts from the state budget, the agency\u2019s new leadership turned back $582,000 in grants from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to monitor wetlands and study the impact of hydraulic fracturing for natural gas on waterways.Amy Adams, a former supervisor who left the agency last year, said that the mantra of the current leadership was about \u201ccustomer service,\u201d but that did not include citizens who might live downstream from a polluter.She and others said they were told to stop writing Notices of Violation to polluters, which can prompt fines, and instead to issue a Notice of Deficiency, which she likened to a state trooper giving a warning instead of a speeding ticket.The agency took action against Duke only after environmental groups filed notice that they intended to sue the utility to clean up the ash waste at power plants near Asheville and Mount Holly, N.C. The longtime practice of dumping ash waste in ponds became a major concern after a catastrophic failure of one in Tennessee in 2008, which is costing $1.2 billion to clean up.Under the federal Clean Water Act, citizen groups may sue polluters if state regulators do not do their job. But the law also allows states to intervene and take over the lawsuits, which is what the Department of Environment and Natural Resources did last year. Environmentalists say the state offered a favorable deal to Duke and blocked their lawsuits, which could have forced Duke to relocate the ash to lined pits away from drinking water.Mr. Skvarla, the agency secretary, said the deal the state reached with Duke in July was a more practical fix to the leaky ash ponds than what environmentalists sought. \u201cTheir only acceptable remedy was, dig \u2019em up, move them to lined landfills and cover them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking 14 facilities and 32 coal ash ponds. I can assure you it\u2019s not that simple.\u201dThe size of the Feb. 2 spill has been revised down from early estimates. As the federal Fish and Wildlife Service monitors the river water for long-term harm to fish and mollusks, attention is turning to a federal court in Raleigh, where employees of Duke and the environmental agency are to appear before a grand jury on March 18.Meanwhile, the agency has reversed its earlier positions on Duke and coal ash cleanup. On Feb. 10, eight days after the spill, the agency withdrew its deal with Duke. This week, it said it might order the remaining ash at the Dan River site, in Eden, N.C., to be moved and stored in a lined landfill \u2014 what environmentalists had sought all along.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stakes High as E.C.B. Tests Banks", "Date": "2014-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyA lot is riding on the cleanup of euro zone banks that is being overseen by the European Central Bank. The progress so far is encouraging. But clarity is needed on a few points to ensure that lenders really do get a good scrubbing and so are able to support the zone\u2019s fragile economic recovery.The E.C.B. is in the midst of a so-called comprehensive assessment of euro zone banks. This has two elements: an \u201casset quality review,\u201d or A.Q.R., to determine whether the loans and other assets held on their balance sheets are valued properly, and a \u201cstress test\u201d to check whether they could withstand a severe economic downturn.To pass the test, banks are supposed to have a \u201ccommon equity tier 1 capital ratio,\u201d a measure of balance sheet strength, of 8 percent in the baseline scenario and 5.5 percent in the adverse scenario. The whole exercise is supposed to be finished by October before the E.C.B. officially takes over from the national authorities in November as the lead supervisor for the zone\u2019s banks.The hope is that investors will at last have confidence that the numbers in bank balance sheets are accurate and will lend to banks more freely. Banks would also lend to each other. With the money markets functioning normally again, banks would have more confidence to lend to companies and consumers, giving a lift to economic activity.That is what happened when the United States and Britain put their banks through severe stress tests five years ago. Unfortunately, the euro zone put its lenders through a series of sham tests. They gave clean bills of health to Irish, Spanish and Cypriot banks, which virtually blew up soon afterward.There are several reasons why things may be different this time.For a start, this is the first stress test the E.C.B. has overseen. It knows that if it flunks this exercise, its own credibility will be shot to bits.What\u2019s more, this is the first time the zone has put banks through an asset quality review. Previous exercises just had a stress test and so did only half the job.Then there\u2019s the fact that the E.C.B. is using multicountry teams to minimize the risk that national supervisors might turn a blind eye to problems at their local champions. It has also employed outside consultants to avoid groupthink.Skeptics still fear the E.C.B. will pull its punches because governments have not yet spelled out what they will do if banks fail the test and need rescuing. Given that, the central bank will not want lots of lenders to fail, as that could set off a panic, or so the argument goes.Although all euro zone countries have promised to provide backstops if needed, many have not given the details. That\u2019s regrettable. But fears that this will undermine the validity of the tests are exaggerated because the amount of money that might need to be provided by governments is probably quite small.Note, first, that banks that fail the stress test will not necessarily have to raise capital, so long as they pass the asset quality review. They may, instead, be able to repair their balance sheets by selling assets and retaining earnings.But even if they do need capital, many banks should be able to sell equity in the markets. Conditions are much improved since the peak of the crisis two years ago. Even Monte dei Paschi, the troubled Italian lender, was able to get an equity issue underwritten last year, although its largest shareholder ultimately vetoed the plan.Of course, some banks may be so weak that they cannot issue equity. But that does not mean governments have to ride to the rescue. They could force banks\u2019 junior bondholders to convert their debt into equity or even close them down.Admittedly, in some cases, shutting banks may be too risky, meaning governments may have to bail them out. But do not expect a flood of rescues. After all, the main problem cases \u2014 Spain, Ireland and Greece \u2014 have all had megabailouts. If recapitalization is needed, the sums will not be as big. What\u2019s more, Greece, perhaps the biggest worry, still has cash in its bank rescue fund that could be used for the job. Meanwhile, other countries where banking problems could be exposed, such as Germany, are mostly rich enough to fend for themselves. Even Italy can borrow money in the market at attractive rates.Still, there are concerns. One is that the adverse scenario against which banks will be tested will be too soft. The details will not be published until late April.Another worry is that banks will respond to the assessment by deleveraging their balance sheets. If many lenders do this simultaneously, that could curtail lending to the real economy and so hold back the recovery.There is evidence that banks did precisely this late last year, knowing that the assessment would be performed on their end-2013 balance sheets.Those that fail the test may continue to deleverage if they decide this is better for shareholders than raising equity.It will be hard for the E.C.B. to handle this risk, because there could be a conflict between what is good for individual banks and what is good for the macro economy. Managing the conflict will require considerable judgment. That\u2019s why the bank that will be undergoing the severest test in the coming months is the central bank itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Prodigal Sons", "Date": "2014-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe take as our text today the parable of the prodigal sons. As I hope you know, the story is about a father with two sons. The younger son took his share of the inheritance early and blew it on prostitutes and riotous living. When the money was gone, he returned home.His father ran out and embraced him. The delighted father offered the boy his finest robe and threw a feast in his honor. The older son, the responsible one, was appalled. He stood outside the feast, crying in effect, \u201cLook! All these years I\u2019ve been working hard and obeying you faithfully, and you never gave me special treatment such as this!\u201dThe father responded, \u201cYou are always with me, and everything I have is yours.\u201d But he had to celebrate the younger one\u2019s return. The boy was lost and now is found.Did the father do the right thing? Is the father the right model for authority today?The father\u2019s critics say he was unjust. People who play by the rules should see the rewards. Those who abandon the community, live according to their own reckless desires should not get to come back and automatically reap the bounty of others\u2019 hard work. If you reward the younger brother, you signal that self-indulgence pays, while hard work gets slighted. The father\u2019s example is especially pernicious now, the critics continue. Jesus preached it at the time of the Pharisees, in an overly rigid and rule-bound society. In those circumstances, a story of radical forgiveness was a useful antidote to the prevailing legalism.But we don\u2019t live in that kind of society. We live in a society in which moral standards are already fuzzy, in which people are already encouraged to do their own thing. We live in a society with advanced social decay \u2014 with teens dropping out of high school, financiers plundering companies and kids being raised without fathers. The father\u2019s example in the parable reinforces loose self-indulgence at a time when we need more rule-following, more social discipline and more accountability, not less.It\u2019s a valid critique, but I\u2019d defend the father\u2019s example, and, informed by a reading of Timothy Keller\u2019s outstanding book \u201cThe Prodigal God,\u201d I\u2019d even apply the father\u2019s wisdom to social policy-making today. We live in a divided society in which many of us in the middle- and upper-middle classes are like the older brother and many of the people who drop out of school, commit crimes and abandon their children are like the younger brother. In many cases, we have a governing class of elder brothers legislating programs on behalf of the younger brothers. The great danger in this situation is that we in the elder brother class will end up self-righteously lecturing the poor: \u201cYou need to be more like us: graduate from school, practice a little sexual discipline, work harder.\u201dBut the father in this parable exposes the truth that people in the elder brother class are stained, too. The elder brother is self-righteous, smug, cold and shrewd. The elder brother wasn\u2019t really working to honor his father; he was working for material reward and out of a fear-based moralism. The father reminds us of the old truth that the line between good and evil doesn\u2019t run between people or classes; it runs straight through every human heart. The father also understands that the younger brothers of the world will not be reformed and re-bound if they feel they are being lectured to by unpleasant people who consider themselves models of rectitude. Imagine if the older brother had gone out to greet the prodigal son instead of the father, giving him some patronizing lecture. Do we think the younger son would have reformed his life to become a productive member of the community? No. He would have gotten back up and found some bad-boy counterculture he could join to reassert his dignity. The father teaches that rebinding and reordering society requires an aggressive assertion: You are accepted; you are accepted. It requires mutual confession and then a mutual turning toward some common project. Why does the father organize a feast? Because a feast is nominally about food, but, in Jewish life, it is really about membership. It reasserts your embedded role in the community project.The father\u2019s lesson for us is that if you live in a society that is coming apart on class lines, the best remedies are oblique. They are projects that bring the elder and younger brothers together for some third goal: national service projects, infrastructure-building, strengthening a company or a congregation.The father offers each boy a precious gift. The younger son gets to dedicate himself to work and self-discipline. The older son gets to surpass the cold calculus of utility and ambition, and experience the warming embrace of solidarity and companionship. Advertisement"}

But because of key disagreements among the parties, few expect the cabinet to address Lebanon\u2019s myriad problems effectively.\u201cThis cabinet is made of shattered glass,\u201d said Hilal Khashan, a professor of political science at the American University of Beirut. \u201cForming a cabinet was a deep necessity to make sure that the country would not slip any further into chaos and insecurity, but I would not read too much into it.\u201dIn a televised address, Mr. Salam called on all parties to work together to save Lebanon.\u201cI extend my hand to all the leaders, and I am relying on their wisdom to reach these goals,\u201d he said. \u201cI call on all of them together to make concessions in the interest of our national project.\u201dBut his task was complicated by strained relations between Lebanon\u2019s two major political coalitions, which back opposite sides in the Syrian civil war.On one side are Hezbollah and its allies, who support President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Hezbollah, which has Lebanon\u2019s strongest military force, has sent fighters to help Mr. Assad\u2019s army.On the other side is a Western-backed coalition, most of whose members sympathize with the Syrian rebels and some of whom have helped fund and arm their movement.But few people expect that the cabinet will have the time or the cohesion to address these issues. It will probably serve for only a few months, and its first priority will be to keep important governmental posts filled.By May 25, it must select a presidential candidate who can be agreed upon by two-thirds of Parliament. It must also pass laws to govern the election of a new Parliament. Reaching agreements on those issues could prove too much for the cabinet to handle, experts said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this will make any difference because this is going to be a caretaker cabinet, and it will probably choke on the first meeting,\u201d said Kamel Wazne, a Lebanese analyst.The Western-backed Future Movement, most of whose members support the Syrian opposition, will lead the Interior and Justice Ministries. Hezbollah holds two posts, for Parliament affairs and industry.The cabinet includes only one woman, the minister of displaced people.Hwaida Saad reported from Beirut, and Ben Hubbard from Kilis, Turkey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pacific Trade Talks End Inconclusively", "Date": "2014-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySINGAPORE \u2014 Ministers in the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks said Tuesday that they had yet to reach agreement on tariffs and other market access issues, with the timing of a completed deal looking increasingly unclear.\u201cMarket access is in some respects the heart and soul of any trade agreement, so until that\u2019s done, we don\u2019t have an agreement,\u201d Tim Groser, New Zealand\u2019s trade minister, told a news conference after the talks.Ministers emphasized that they had made significant progress during four days of meetings in Singapore but said the talks ended with no clear time frame to clinch the agreements. The American-backed deal aims to cut tariffs and set common standards on other trade issues across countries that represent almost 40 percent of the global economy. The countries are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam.Long-running differences on tariffs on imported goods, particularly between the United States and Japan, are proving difficult to overcome. Two sets of meetings between the Japanese and American delegations during the talks produced no breakthrough. Other thorny issues include intellectual property and the rules for state-owned enterprises and government procurement.\u201cIf you ask whether all outstanding issues have been resolved, it is also a common recognition that they still remain,\u201d Akira Amari, Japan\u2019s economics minister, said before the final part of the talks.Mustapa Mohamed, Malaysia\u2019s international trade and industry minister, said that participants were all showing flexibility but that some issues were tough to move on. \u201cThere are things which can be done, there are others which cannot be done, and we\u2019ve been telling our partners what is doable and what is not doable,\u201d he said.There had been expectations that the deal could be concluded in time for President Obama\u2019s visit to Asia in April. It is unclear whether the ministers will meet again before that trip. \u201cWe\u2019ve made no further plans at this point in terms of the next meetings,\u201d said Michael Froman, the United States trade representative.Another issue is whether the United States government will be able to establish so-called trade promotion authority, which would deny the American lawmakers the opportunity to amend the agreement. Mr. Obama has faced opposition from his Democratic Party over the matter, while other participating countries are said to be worried that, without the authority, Congress could make major changes to any deal. Ministers said trade promotion authority had not been discussed during the meeting because it was a domestic American political issue.Expectations that others might soon join the talks \u2014 South Korea and Taiwan have expressed interest \u2014 were also dismissed as premature. \u201cRight now, all of us are focused on closing among the 12 before we consider taking additional members,\u201d Mr. Froman said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Closing In on Basic Mideast Principles", "Date": "2014-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialFor months, Israelis and Palestinians, with American mediation, have been working on a set of principles that would serve as the basis for negotiations on a final peace agreement. By the end of March, the world is likely to know whether they have been successful. If the two sides agree on basic principles \u2014 a framework for further talks \u2014 it will be an important step. But then comes the even tougher task of translating principles into a final deal that would recognize a Palestinian state alongside Israel.The principles that Secretary of State John Kerry has been working on are often seen as American ideas. But rather than being impossible demands imposed by Washington, they will reflect what the administration thinks is possible \u2014 its best judgment on where the two parties are on the major issues and what they might be able to agree to in a final deal. Even so, this does not guarantee acceptance; the political pressures on both sides are immense, especially within Israel.Some mostly predictable details have leaked out. The framework is expected to call for an end to the conflict and all claims, following a phased Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank (based on the 1967 lines), with unprecedented security arrangements in the strategic Jordan Valley. Israel will retain certain settlement blocs and the Palestinians will be compensated with Israeli territory; the American special envoy, Martin Indyk, has reportedly told Jewish leaders that up to 80 percent of the Jewish settlers will be annexed to Israel. Mr. Kerry, to his credit, has been publicly forcing both sides to confront the consequences they face if the process fails. At recent international conferences, he has spoken about the stakes, including the potential for a new, more virulent cycle of violence; the potential loss of Israel\u2019s identity as a democratic state; and the peril from a growing international boycott against Israel that could result in diplomatic isolation as well as economic losses.The framework is still a work in progress. There is a lot riding on Mr. Kerry\u2019s ability to guide a process that will lead to negotiations on a final deal, presuming Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas have the courage to follow through.

{"Headline": "Russians Return to Cyprus, a Favorite Tax Haven ", "Date": "2014-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly a year ago, European authorities sought to drive a stake into the heart of this country\u2019s role as an offshore tax haven, when Cyprus briefly became the newest epicenter of the euro zone\u2019s debt crisis.NICOSIA, Cyprus \u2014 When the Cypriot government forced bank depositors \u2014 many of them Russian \u2014 to pay their share of an international bailout last spring, Vasilis Zertalis\u2019s phone started ringing.The companies his consultancy helps incorporate on this breezy Mediterranean island \u2014 many of them Russian, too \u2014 wanted to know how quickly they should get out.These days, the calls are coming for another reason: Businesses are eager to get in.\u201cWe are registering twice as many companies than when after the crisis hit,\u201d Mr. Zertalis, the head of a big registrar, Prospectacy Limited, said as the sun set over palm trees near his office one recent weekday. \u201cRussians, Germans, Latin Americans, Canadians \u2014 they\u2019re all coming,\u201d he said.Especially the Russians. And that is even though they were the category of foreign investors that the Cypriot government and its international bailout creditors seemed to single out for punishment last spring, when officials tried to turn the economy here into something more than an offshore tax haven whose banks looked the other way as money of questionable provenance rolled in from abroad.The banking system has been drastically overhauled. But the tax haven part less so.\u201cPeople are still interested because the legal and tax system remains much more stable than in Russia, and they think that the threat of another haircut is remote,\u201d said Costas Erotocritou, the vice president of the Russian Business Association here, and a lawyer whose firm specializes in setting up offshore accounts.The haircut he referred to was the Cypriot government\u2019s move last spring to seize vast sums, much of it deposits from wealthy Russians, at the nation\u2019s biggest banks. (Because part of the money seized was converted into bank shares, one other anomaly of the bailout was that it turned wealthy Russians into some of the biggest shareholders in Cypriot banks.)A year after the bailout, Cyprus\u2019s economy is still in deep trouble and its banking sector is half its former size. With bank tellers, construction workers and retail employees caught in the fallout, unemployment has jumped to 17.5 percent from 14 percent a year earlier; youth unemployment is above 40 percent.Banks sharply curbed lending as the level of deposits shrank, and nearly half their outstanding loans are in arrears or default. Private debt has surged to around 300 percent of Cyprus\u2019s 17 billion euro economy.But the one rebounding business is foreign incorporation. Cyprus is once again a favorite tax haven, even after international bailout officials forced the government to nudge the corporate tax rate up to 12.5 percent, from 10 percent. That is still the lowest in the euro zone, on par with Ireland and well below Germany\u2019s 29.5 percent and France\u2019s 33.3 percent.The registration of what are mostly shell companies created to shelter income was 1,454 in January alone. That is more than double the nadir of last spring, after the bailout, and even slightly more than were registered in December 2012, before the collapse.As a result, there are now about 273,000 companies on Cyprus\u2019s corporate registry, a staggering figure in a country whose population is only 839,000. \u201cThis is not an industry that has died,\u201d said Yiorgos Lakkotrypis, Cyprus\u2019s commerce and energy minister.And the Russians have dug in.\u201cThe Russians won\u2019t leave because they really don\u2019t have any other option,\u201d Mr. Zertalis said. \u201cSure they lost money in the haircut, but when it comes to business they will continue to use the island because returning to Russia is not a better solution for them.\u201dBut there is one place where neither the Russians nor any other foreign investors are putting much money: Cypriot banks.After deposits were seized, \u201ccompanies generally won\u2019t hold more than 100,000 euros in a Cypriot bank now,\u201d said Mr. Erotocritou.He was referring to the radical move by officials who, for the first time in a euro zone bailout, forced some depositors to take a loss. The authorities last spring liquidated Laiki Bank, Cyprus\u2019s second-biggest financial institution, and folded its remains into the largest one, Bank of Cyprus, where the government then confiscated 60 percent of deposits above \u20ac100,000 to recapitalize the lender.Total deposits in Cypriot banks, which were \u20ac57 billion last April, dropped to \u20ac47 billion by November. They might have fallen further and faster if the government had not tightly controlled withdrawals and foreign transfers at the height of the crisis.By now those controls have been relaxed to the extent that they hardly affect business operations anymore, enabling companies that are still comfortable keeping their money in a Cypriot bank account to conduct transactions more easily than they did six months ago.Some controls remain in place for individual accounts, including a \u20ac300 daily withdrawal limit and central bank vetting of large cash transfers. But last week the finance ministry said further loosening of the rules was in the offing. That was in response to a review by the International Monetary Fund, which found that Cyprus was fulfilling the fiscal promises it made as part of the bailout.Even so, many businesses are taking no chances. They are setting up bank accounts entirely outside of the euro zone on the concern that, as in Cyprus, their assets could be seized to pay for banking crises that might blow open in other European countries, Mr. Zertalis, the consultant, said.\u201cNo matter what European leaders say now, all of our clients are saying, \u2018Let\u2019s split our accounts among as many different countries and banks as we can,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Zertalis said. \u201cThey say \u2018We won\u2019t keep our money in Cyprus, but we don\u2019t feel secure about Europe anymore, either.\u2019 \u201d He said many had turned to financial institutions in Canada, Switzerland and Asian countries.Yet while financial agents like Mr. Zertalis are enjoying a bounce-back \u2014 he doubled the size of his small staff in the last six months and plans to double it again this year \u2014 many other people across the island are casualties of the banking collapse.Thousands of small and midsize businesses have been hobbled by the dearth of bank lending, said George Pamboridis, a senior partner at the law firm Pamboridis.On Nicosia\u2019s main shopping street, storefronts once adorned with mannequins, shoes and electronics now sit empty. In Nicosia\u2019s main square, retail space formerly occupied by a Laiki Bank branch is vacant, with debris strewn where teller windows once stood.Outside Nicosia, at a hulking warehouse near green meadows and olive trees, volunteers at the Alkyonides charity rushed on a recent weekday to prepare for the 50 families who had trekked there to receive handouts of food, diapers and used clothing.Two years ago, the charity typically served around 15 families a month. Today, it is overwhelmed with as many as 1,000 families in need, mostly people who used to work in banking, construction or retailing, said Koulla Demetriou, a volunteer.\u201cMany people can\u2019t find jobs, and every month it gets worse,\u201d Ms. Demetriou said, as she typed up a food ticket for Angeliki, 42, a mother of three who recently lost her job working in security for a bank.\u201cThe main hope now is that the people of Cyprus will care for each other.\u201dIn the meantime, the gap between Cypriots out of luck and foreigners with money \u2014 especially the Russians \u2014 has never been starker.\u201cRich Russians love this country,\u201d Mr. Erotocritou said. \u201cThey will keep coming back.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He has also presided over a government that has tightened control over the news media and Internet microblogs.The Obama administration has strongly challenged China over the past few years to curb what it contends are Chinese cyberattacks on Americans and American companies doing business in China. Among the concerns is that Chinese hackers, possibly state sponsored, have been stealing corporate and national secrets.Beijing has responded that it, too, has been a frequent victim of cyberattacks, many originating in the United States. The Chinese government has also insisted that it opposes hacking in any form.Experts say the issue has major implications for large corporations in the United States and China, which could find themselves blocked from doing business in the other country in areas like telecommunications or Internet security.China now has the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after the United States, and the largest number of Internet users, more than 600 million. But Chinese authorities complain that the country\u2019s science and technology abilities lag far behind those of more developed countries.The government announcement on Thursday did not offer details about what cybersecurity and informatization would cover, but the government made clear that it was determined to strengthen its abilities.\u201cNo Internet safety means no national security,\u201d Mr. Xi said Thursday. \u201cNo informatization means no modernization.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Setbacks, Municipal Bond Sector Is Looking Up", "Date": "2014-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE municipal bond market has been judged lately more by its failures than its successes, and the judgment has been harsh.A similarly sharp rise in yields on long-term Treasury bonds played a big role in the poor performance of municipal issues, analysts say, but so did some civic bankruptcies. The California cities of Stockton and San Bernardino filed for protection from creditors in 2012, and Detroit did the same last summer in the largest case of its kind ever.Investors\u2019 faith was shaken further when prices plunged on bonds issued by Puerto Rico. The American territory has $70 billion in debt, a prodigious amount relative to the size of its economy, which has been inundated with difficulties.Interest on Puerto Rican munis is exempt from federal and state income tax, no matter where a bondholder lives. That has made them popular with well-off investors nationwide, especially in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey, who otherwise receive the state tax deduction only on bonds issued in their home state. But Puerto Rican issues became far less popular last year, with some yields doubling to about 10 percent in the face of concern that the island\u2019s credit rating would fall to junk status. It fell to that level last week when two ratings agencies downgraded it.Developments on Wall Street and in Puerto Rico and Detroit have depressed municipal bonds, but their tax advantages and safety, compared with stocks or some other assets, almost always make them suitable holdings for investors of a certain age and a certain income, whatever the short-term outlook, financial advisers say. And the market is expected to improve in 2014 as fundamental financial conditions that influence it become more favorable.What investors are facing right now, he noted, are tax increases that went into effect a year ago but are likely to become palpable only in April, when the first returns are due that take the increases into account. Among the changes are a jump in the top federal income tax rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent and a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income for high earners that was included in the Affordable Care Act. The increases will make well-off taxpayers \u201crealize how valuable the tax-free status of municipal bond income is,\u201d Mr. Schankel said.At the same time, state and local governments have adjusted to their straitened circumstances since the financial crisis by curbing spending, he said. That helps munis in two ways, by improving their ability to meet bond payments and by limiting their need to float new issues. Add it all up, he said, and \u201cthe supply-demand dynamics are a little more favorable for municipals.\u201dStrategists at Citigroup also anticipate a healthier market. \u201cWe remain cautiously positive on our outlook for municipal credit over the next year, though some issuers will face their share of challenges,\u201d they wrote in a recent note to clients. \u201cMost state and local governments will continue to take the steps needed to balance available revenues with needed expenditures, minimizing the magnitude of actual payment defaults.\u201d They also highlighted the prospect of increased tax receipts as the economy recovered. States are also addressing more effectively one of the biggest threats to financial stability that they and their cities face: runaway pension obligations. A report by Evercore Wealth Management noted that several states passed laws to limit their liability for retirement benefits to government employees. California is expected to go further and place an initiative on the November ballot to amend the state Constitution to \u201cenable cities to modify their existing pension programs, preserving only the vested earnings for existing employees,\u201d the report states. \u201cFrom the investor\u2019s point of view, it would at last tackle what has become a major \u2014 and increasingly detrimental \u2014 factor in the long-term credit viability of municipal bond issuers.\u201dWhatever developments may affect the market, financial advisers recommend a healthy allocation to municipal bonds for almost anyone with a moderate to high tax liability.\u201cIf you\u2019re paying 40 percent federal and state combined, at least half of your bond allocation should be in munis,\u201d said David Molnar, a partner at HighTower San Diego, part of the HighTower nationwide advisory firm. \u201cIf you\u2019re in higher tax brackets, then I would go higher, even to 85 percent.\u201dElizabeth Ruch, a financial planner at Waddell & Reed in San Diego, counsels anyone middle-age or older and in higher tax brackets to keep about 20 percent of total investment assets in bonds, with all or nearly all of it in munis. Most investors should own funds rather than single bonds in the interest of creating a broad mix of issues, she added, and because professionals have better knowledge of what can be an opaque market with limited information available to novices.Ms. Ruch finds municipal bonds especially good for well-off people past 70 1/2, who are required under federal law to take minimum distributions from their retirement plans. She contends, though, that most young investors should emphasize capital growth over the tax-free income of munis. \u201cNo one under 30 needs munis unless they\u2019re as rich as Bill Gates,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can take the risk of the stock market.\u201dAs municipal bonds demonstrated last year, owning them can be risky too, but not as much as some think, Mr. Molnar said. \u201cEverything we\u2019re hearing from Wall Street in the past six months is that bonds are bad,\u201d he said. \u201cOur view is that that\u2019s overdone. You should own stocks, too, but munis and other bonds provide steady, consistent income and diversification.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shares Rally to Give Indexes Their Best Day of the Year", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a rocky start to the week, the stock market roared back on Thursday, giving major indexes their biggest gains of the year.The rally continued a gradual comeback since a plunge of more than 2 percent on Monday.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 188.30 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 15,628.53. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 21.79 points, also 1.2 percent, to 1,773.43. These were the largest single-day gains for the two indexes since Dec. 18. Still, both indexes were down about half a percent for the week after the steep drop on Monday.The Nasdaq composite index gained 45.57 points, or 1.1 percent, to 4,057.12.Thursday\u2019s surge began overseas, where the European Central Bank decided not to cut interest rates. The move propelled major European stock indexes sharply higher.Then the markets got a dose of good news on the domestic job market. The Labor Department reported that fewer people applied for unemployment benefits last week.All week, investors have been looking ahead to the employment report and what it will mean for the economy.Evidence of healthy job growth would suggest that the American economy is still expanding at a solid pace. That would comfort investors, many of whom became uneasy in recent weeks after signs of weaker global growth emerged.Those concerns were seen by some other investors as a buying opportunity. \u201cThe fear in the markets has subsided some,\u201d said Marc Doss, regional chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank.Thursday\u2019s gains were broad. All 10 of the S.&P. 500\u2019s sectors rose. Three stocks rose for every one that fell.Akamai Technologies led the gainers in the S.&P. 500 index after the online content delivery company allayed fears that it had lost Apple as a customer. Akamai soared $9.76, or 20.6 percent, to $57.18. Among the other big gainers were Vulcan Materials, which rose $5.47, or 9.1 percent, to $65.66, and O\u2019Reilly Automotive, which climbed $12.16, or 9 percent, to $146.72.The Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group rose $1.59, or 3.4 percent, to $48.89 after it reported that more people visited stores owned by the chain restaurant in the last quarter and spent more there once they got inside. On the downside, Twitter dropped $15.94, or 24.2 percent, to $50.03 after its first earnings report since becoming a public company stirred concerns that its growth was slowing. In the bond market, interest rates moved higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 2.70 percent from 2.67 percent late Wednesday, while its price fell 9/32 to 100 13/32.

{"Headline": "A Luxury-Class Metal Is Asked to Do Farm Chores", "Date": "2014-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMotoringIn the hotly contested part of the vehicle market where bragging rights go to the vehicle that has the engine with the most pulling power or the cargo bed that hauls the heaviest payload, Ford is testing its owners\u2019 loyalty by building pickup bodies from a lightweight material more commonly used for luxury cars.\u201cThey are taking a stab at doing something that no one else has really had the guts to do, and yet they are changing the very virtue of what the pickup is perceived to be,\u201d said Paul Lacy, a director at IHS Automotive in Detroit. Until now, steel has been the material of choice for hard-working pickups, but Ford\u2019s new half-ton truck for 2015, which goes on sale this year, will feature an aluminum cab, front end and cargo box mounted on a high-strength steel frame. Together, the use of these materials will help the truck shed up to 700 pounds, enabling it to burn less fuel and do more work, the company says. Ford sold 760,000 F-Series trucks last year, and it has been America\u2019s best-selling vehicle for 32 years running. If the pickup meets the company\u2019s calculation of \u201cclose to\u201d 30 miles per gallon on the highway with the new 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6 engine, Ford\u2019s position of sales leadership ought to be even more secure.While few owners would argue with the fuel-economy advantage that comes with the reduced weight of an aluminum-intensive truck, some buyers may question the material\u2019s toughness. \u201cIf it can hold up under the stress, that would be the deal for me,\u201d said Bob Renner, a farmer in Cunningham, Kan., and owner of five Ford F-150 and Super Duty pickups. \u201cIf a farmer got one out here, absolutely loved it and didn\u2019t have any problems with it, I\u2019d be really interested.\u201dThe body, which will be formed and joined into panels at Ford\u2019s Dearborn, Mich., and Buffalo stamping plants, will resist dings and dents more than traditional steel, Ford says, by using special aluminum alloys that are made tougher by a heat-treating process. The company also promises that the truck will be able to haul more, accelerate faster and stop shorter than the outgoing model, though it has not yet disclosed details, including prices.\u201cYou can take advantage of the lighter weight, shrink the displacement of the engines, reduce power a little bit but still maintain the same power-to-weight ratio as you had before,\u201d explained Mike Levine, a Ford truck spokesman. The panels will be thicker \u2014 but lighter over all \u2014 than steel, he added.Federal fuel-economy standards call for automakers to reach a fleet average of 54.5 m.p.g. by 2025 across their product lines, but Ford says its decision to switch to lightweight aluminum is not just about saving gas.\u201cIf I can take 500 pounds off that truck, then I can give weight back to the trailer,\u201d Mr. Levine said. \u201cThe less weight gives you the opportunity to accelerate faster, stop sooner, haul more and tow more.\u201d Ford has used an aluminum hood on the F-150 since 1997, he noted.Not only has aluminum been used for production models by luxury brands like Audi, Jaguar, Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz, it is also a vital material for makers of large trucks like Peterbilt and Kenworth. And producers of toolboxes, utility bodies and other work-truck accessories have long preferred aluminum for its ability to save weight, which increases payload capacity. Rust also is a factor. In the 1980s, manufacturers of tire service vehicles \u2014 essential workhorses used to change the bulky tires on large trucks and heavy equipment \u2014 began switching to aluminum bodies to repel the highly corrosive calcium chloride solution used by farmers as a form of ballast in their tractor tires. Early models of tire service trucks were riveted together almost exclusively but were later accompanied by welds, structural adhesives and other joining methods.\u201cIt took a little bit of a learning curve because aluminum doesn\u2019t like to be welded together,\u201d said Tim Davison, a product manager for Stellar Industries, a maker of service trucks in Garner, Iowa. \u201cWe still do a lot of rivets, but we\u2019ve kind of perfected our ability to weld them as well.\u201dRepairing aluminum can be a challenge for shops that work mostly with traditional materials like steel. How easily the body panels of a 2015 Ford F-150 will be fixed in a body shop is still a question \u2014 as are the repair costs and insurance rates assigned to the new F-150 \u2014 but Ford says it has redesigned the truck\u2019s connection points so labor time will be reduced to less than what the steel-body trucks require. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just collision repairs,\u201d Mr. Levine said. \u201cWe looked at this and said, \u2018How can we make all repairs and maintenance easier?\u2019\u00a0\u201dStill, body shops will need to make significant upgrades if they plan to make repair of the new F-150 part of their income. Recognizing this, Ford is offering dealers a 20 percent rebate, up to a maximum of $10,000, on purchases of special equipment needed to repair aluminum. According to dealers, the tools are expected to cost from $30,000 to $50,000 per shop.\u201cThis is a much bigger scale than anything we have ever dealt with before,\u201d Becky Taylor, body shop manager of Laird Noller Automotive, a Ford and Lincoln dealer in Lawrence, Kan., said. Ford is also offering to pay for one dealership service technician per shop to attend aluminum-repair classes.Because fewer than half of new-vehicle dealerships have body shops, many F-150s are likely to be repaired at independent collision centers. Only a small number of those shops are qualified to repair bodies on aluminum cars like Audis, according to Darrell Amberson, chairman of the Automotive Service Association and vice president for operations at LaMettry\u2019s Collision in Minneapolis.\u201cAssuming the Ford platform is similar to these others, it means that most shops, less than 10 percent and probably more like 5 percent, are ready to repair them now,\u201d Mr. Amberson said. Of the roughly 35,000 repair shops in the United States, fewer than 3,000 have achieved the level of certification necessary to repair aluminum, he said. Most programs require a curtained work area and tools that do not come into contact with steel \u2014 doing so would increase the potential for corrosion problems, paint flaws and premature wear.Mr. Levine said that the majority of cosmetic repairs \u2014 bumpers, grilles and the like \u2014 could be fixed today in most shops. \u201cFor major repairs, we\u2019re recommending that they should be performed by an aluminum capable body shop,\u201d he said.Later this year, Ford plans to introduce aluminum training courses through the Inter-Industry Conference of Auto Collision Repair.Until then, truck owners like Jay Prybil, fleet maintenance supervisor for construction company Las Vegas Paving, say they are preparing for a future where more auto bodies are made of aluminum and more repairs involve replacing whole panels rather than trying to drill and pull dents, which is trickier with aluminum. \u201cThe days of straightening something out, using a little Bondo to make it look nice and shooting it with a little paint is out of the window,\u201d Mr. Prybil said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Capitalism for the Masses", "Date": "2014-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Arthur Brooks was 24, he was playing the French horn in a chamber music concert in Dijon, France. He noticed a beautiful woman smiling at him from the front row, so, after the recital, he made a beeline for her and introduced himself.Within seven seconds he came to two realizations. First, he was going to marry this woman. Second, she didn\u2019t speak a word of English, and he didn\u2019t speak a word of Spanish or Catalan, which were her languages. When he got home, he realized that if he was going to have a chance with Ester he was going to have to show some commitment. So he quit his job in America, moved to Barcelona and went to work with the Barcelona orchestra. Over the next few years, he learned Spanish and Catalan and Ester learned English. They have been happily married for 22 years. \u201cSometimes you just have to be all in,\u201d says Brooks (who is no relation). \u201cYou have to go beyond cold utilitarian analysis.\u201dBrooks later became a social scientist and is now president of the American Enterprise Institute, probably the most important think tank on the American right. He has emerged as one of the most ardent defenders of the free enterprise system. But the humanist that he is, he has primarily defended capitalism on moral terms. He\u2019s criticized Republicans for defending capitalism on materialistic grounds \u2014 because it makes some people rich. Republicans, Brooks says, have an overly small-business focus. They talk as if everybody should become an entrepreneur.The real moral health of an economic system, he argues, can be measured by how well it helps all people make an enterprise of their life. Whether they work at odd jobs or at a nongovernmental organization or at a big company, do they get to experience the joy of achievement? Do they know that their work amounts to something?He\u2019s pointed out that the percentage of people in the world living on $1 a day has declined by 80 percent since 1970s, adjusting for inflation. That\u2019s the greatest increase in human possibility in human history. The primary cause is globalized capitalism. But now capitalism faces its greatest moral crisis since the Great Depression. The nature of that crisis can be captured in two statistics. When Facebook entered a deal to buy WhatsApp this week, it agreed to pay a price equal to $345 million per WhatsApp employee. Meanwhile, the share of the economic pie for the middle 60 percent of earners nationally has fallen from 53 percent to 45 percent since 1970.This economy produces very valuable companies with very few employees. Meanwhile, the majority of workers are not seeing income gains commensurate with their productivity levels.To his great credit, Brooks is responding aggressively to this moral challenge, in a way that is providing a needed jolt to Republican circles. Over the last two days, for example, he had the Dalai Lama, a self-described Marxist, over at the American Enterprise Institute to discuss the morality of capitalism. Jonathan Haidt, of the Stern School of Business at New York University, challenged the mostly Republican audience to invent a new capitalist narrative, going beyond the simple demonization and celebration narratives. He pointed out that conservatives love to talk about private charity, but, if you took the entire $40 billion that Americans donate to human service organizations annually, it would be enough money to give each person who receives federal food assistance only $847 per year. Instead, Republicans need to declare a truce on the social safety net. They need to assure the country that the net will always be there for the truly needy. Then they need to point out that it is the web of middle-class entitlements, even the home mortgage deduction, that really threaten benefits to the poor.The big new problem, Brooks writes, is that labor markets are sick. Fewer people are working and enjoying the sense of reward that is a key to happiness. Democrats embrace a raise in the minimum wage that could drive another half-million workers out of the labor market.Much better, he says, would be to expand the earned-income tax credit or maybe use direct payments or loans to help people move to opportunity.The big story here is that a major pillar of the American right is leading his institution to fully embrace capitalism, but also fully embrace government policies that will help the broadest number of people earn their own success. In this era, the invisible hand may not be enough. Sometimes you have to go all in. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Way to Rein In Fat Cats", "Date": "2014-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorUNION VALE, N.Y. \u2014 PRESIDENT OBAMA\u2019S planned directive to increase the minimum wage for employees of federal government contractors has prompted the usual tiresome reactions in Washington and the media echo chamber we euphemistically call \u201cdebate.\u201d But the national discourse continues to sleepwalk past this out-of-the-box question: How about setting a maximum wage for government officials and top-paid government contractors?Here\u2019s how it would work:If the minimum wage for employees of federal contractors rose to $10.10 an hour from $7.25, the president\u2019s $400,000 salary would move to 20 times that of the lowest-paid worker, from roughly 27 times. We should then enact laws to ensure that top-paid federal executives \u2014 and, critically, top-paid executives of companies that do business with the federal government \u2014 are never paid in excess of 20-to-1 (or perhaps even 27-to-1) compared with their lowest-paid workers.Perhaps we could start with companies that bid on contracts (or receive no-bid contracts) above some threshold. Here are some recent top federal contractors and what Bloomberg News estimates as the ratio of top pay to the average worker\u2019s: Oracle, 1,287-to-1; General Electric, 491-to-1; AT&T, 339-to-1; and Lockheed Martin, 315-to-1.Common sense and tradition point to limits for those in government. It is our money, after all. Mary Todd Lincoln stirred resentment when she overspent the White House budget. The citizens of Bell, Calif., rightly went nuts when they learned their city manager and other top officials were pulling down high six-figure salaries. Even Mitt Romney promised to \u201cstop the unfairness of government workers getting better pay and benefits than the taxpayers they serve.\u201dSadly, Mr. Romney\u2019s target was hard-working midlevel government servants who, thanks to prudence and public-sector unions, have not seen their pay rates deteriorate as much as private-sector employees trying to survive globalization, privatization, deregulation, worldwide economic slowdowns and austerity. My maximum-wage proposal, though, aims at the ratio of top-to-bottom pay levels \u2014 not midlevel to bottom-level pay. You can also argue that raising midlevel pay for federal workers is as critical as lifting the federal minimum wage if the government is to attract and retain better-motivated, higher-performing employees. Not to mention the challenge of linking better pay to a more robust recovery in an economy more than two-thirds dependent on consumer spending.Applying a maximum-wage limit to government contractors not only would result in smaller taxpayer subsidies for the top 1 percent but would also lead to more efficient and effective pricing and services from companies truly interested in serving the public instead of soaking the taxpayer. Companies that put service above executive compensation would also pay employees much better.Any executives getting, say, $25 million per year could continue to do so. It\u2019s just that they would need to decide this: Do they continue serving the public either by compensating their lowest-paid employee many hundreds of thousands of dollars more or cutting the compensation of their top executives? Or a blend of both: moderating top pay while raising that of the lowest-paid employees? Or do they quit feeding at the public trough? Some chief executives of companies with monopoly-like power might say: \u201cWe\u2019re walking. And good luck finding qualified bidders.\u201d Fine. I believe in the power of market competition to serve the nation. Other companies would answer the call, and their top executives would not be hindered because they could earn only 20 (or even 27) times more than their lowest-paid people.Boeing did about $7 billion in business with the federal government in 2013. If it had been subject to maximum-wage laws \u2014 and its 314-to-1 top-pay ratio were reduced to the proposed lower range, its executives might have shown more concern for the living standards of employees in recent union negotiations. Instead of near-zero wage increases through 2023, reductions on health insurance and a pension freeze (and an announced $10 billion stock buyback), management\u2019s priorities \u2014 and the resulting exacerbation of income and wealth inequality \u2014 would have been reversed.Boeing\u2019s chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., was paid over $20 million in 2012. Americans would find it outrageous if Mr. Obama were compensated so extravagantly. In our new age of wealth, though, we cannot assure that public service will remain focused on the public if we target pay only at the bottom. Yes, we need a higher minimum wage. But we also need a maximum wage for our government, and those who do business with it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Whatever Happened to \u2018Every Man a King\u2019?", "Date": "2014-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLong, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee from 1966 to 1981, inherited a populist commitment from his father, Huey Long, the Louisiana governor who famously campaigned on the slogan \u201cEvery Man a King.\u201dIn 1973, Long became intrigued by the idea of granting corporations generous tax incentives to distribute stock to employees through Employee Stock Ownership Plans, or ESOPs.In \u201cThe Citizen\u2019s Share,\u201d Blasi, Freeman and Kruse make a broad, ideologically cross-cutting case on behalf of profit sharing and employee ownership:\u201cIt offers a new way to address the concentration of both economic and political power that many citizens believe is distorting the country. It offers a new perspective on how to fight the links between the Washington politicians, K Street lobbyists, big corporations, and political donors that fuel many Tea Party members\u2019 opposition to government. It offers a new perspective on how to resolve the huge disparities in wealth and income.\u201dThey make the following specific arguments.First, they contend that policies promoting employee ownership have strong public support and that these policies reflect the convictions of the founders, including Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.Politicans on both sides of the partisan divide support ESOP proposals.\u201cIncome, you know, results from only two things. It can result from capital or it can result from labor. If the worker begins getting his income from both sources at once, he has a real stake in increasing production and increasing output. One such plan is based on financing future expansion in such a way as to create stock ownership for employees. It does not reduce the holdings of the present owners, nor does it require the employees to divert their own savings into stock purchases.\u201dSecond, Blasi, Freeman and Kruse point out that there are already extensive mechanisms in place for employee ownership, not only formal ESOPs but also a variety of profit-sharing plans. Because of this, they argue, major innovations are unlikely to be needed; improvements in existing laws and practices should suffice.Third, and most important, is the authors\u2019 claim that it is economically advantageous to give employees an ownership stake in the firm for which they work. Blasi, Freeman and Kruse provide evidence that employees with some form of worker ownership accumulate more savings than employees in nonparticipating firms and that firms with some form of capital sharing perform better in the competitive marketplace than those that do not.They write that \u201cworkers with profit sharing or employee stock ownership are higher paid and have more benefits than other workers. This means that the substantial profit sharing and gain sharing and ownership stakes for the typical worker in these plans tend to come on top of, not in place of, fair fixed wages and benefits.\u201dIn addition, the authors cite studies showing sharp increases in productivity, higher employee morale, lessened turnover and fewer bankruptcies in corporations that adopt ESOPs.These findings raise a series of questions.If the various forms of worker capitalism or profit sharing produce such benefits, why hasn\u2019t the free market itself forced every company to adopt similar plans?\u201cIt would enjoy a prodigious competitive advantage. Since wages account for about 70 percent of a typical firm\u2019s total cost, increasing productivity by 15 percent would reduce total cost by more than 10 percent. The firm could cut its prices by almost that amount and still remain profitable, which would enable it to peel off most of its rivals\u2019 customers.\u201dFrank pointed out that \u201cany firm that enjoyed these advantages should sweep the market like a prairie fire, reaping enormous profits in the process.\u201dFreeman addressed this question in a series of email exchanges with me. He began by noting that there is management opposition to profit sharing with rank and file employees \u201cbecause the people who control the firm may have to take lower profits \u2014 if I am in charge of the firm and sharing profits with you raises productivity, but it means that I take less in profits, I will not favor going to a more shared system.\u201dIn addition, Freeman argued, \u201cmagnitudes are important.\u201d The gains from employee share programs are modest, a \u201cproductivity edge of about 2 percent or so on average,\u201d which may be trumped by other marketplace factors, including \u201csome small monopoly advantage\u201d held by competitors.Freeman emphasized that many liberal-left economists and policy makers are locked into the view that labor and capital are intractably adversarial. Consequently they \u201cfavor a European style big government/strong union solution to inequality\u201d rather than solutions of a more cooperative nature such as ESOPs.Blasi, in a more detailed response, emailed that \u201cboth Democrats and Republicans until recently really believed that inflation-adjusted wage income growth or lowering taxes alone could maintain and grow the middle class.\u201d In fact, Blasi argues, changing economic conditions dictate that \u201cthe sustaining of a middle class and mobility requires a capital ownership and a capital income policy.\u201dIn addition, Blasi writes, the \u201ceconomic share policy tradition in American history has been sidelined by scholars in the modern and post-modern era. Until now, if you argued for ESOPs you were using \u2018small ball\u2019 ideas.\u201dBlasi, Freeman and Kruse acknowledge that some critics see ESOPs as pioneering \u201ca form of special-interest tax incentives from the Treasury.\u201d Their counterargument: \u201cWe see the ESOP as the continuation of the Founders\u2019 desire to reduce inequality and preserve democratic practices by extending property ownership to more Americans.\u201dThe Blasi-Freeman-Kruse proposal has the crucial political advantage of appealing to some on the political right because it would, in fact, make employee share programs more attractive by boosting tax subsidies \u2014 a form of cutting taxes.Most significantly, the Blasi-Freeman-Kruse proposal stands apart from alternate policy initiatives designed to address growing inequality because it directly addresses the concentration of wealth and political power at the top.For that reason alone, the idea of expanding employee ownership deserves serious consideration. The proposal does not resolve the question of how to give workers a sufficiently large share of capital to materially impact their economic status. Still, there are not that many viable options available to those who are committed to improving the disadvantaged position of labor versus capital. Politicians and policy makers cannot afford to disregard a proposal with demonstrable potential.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Signs of Winter Slump\u2019s End Lift Shares ", "Date": "2014-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market got a lift on Thursday from a couple of encouraging reports that suggested the economy could pick up after a winter slump. In one report, United States manufacturing expanded in February at its fastest pace in almost four years, according to a private survey by Markit. The Conference Board said in another report that its index of leading indicators posted a moderate gain in January, suggesting that the economy will continue to expand in the first half of the year.\u201cToday\u2019s market is reflecting the fact that the economy has gone through the doldrums due to the weather and we should now see a substantial pickup,\u201d said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 11.03 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,839.78. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 92.67 points, or 0.6 percent, to 16,133.23. The day before, the Dow fell 89 points the after minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest meeting showed that a few policy makers raised the possibility that an increase in interest rates should come \u201crelatively soon.\u201dAnd the Nasdaq composite on Thursday climbed 29.59 points, or 0.7 percent, to 4,267.55. The stock market is now close to erasing all of its losses after a rough start to the year. Concerns about slowing growth in China and other emerging markets, as well as worries about the health of the American economy, had pushed the S.&P. 500 down almost 6 percent for the year by the start of February.After a surge of almost 30 percent in the S.&P. 500 in 2013, market volatility has risen. Given those strong gains, the market will struggle to climb much further this year, said Tom Karsten, an investment adviser at Karsten Advisors. \u201cWhile we may see continued economic growth, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s powerful enough to justify that there would really be much upward possibility for equity prices,\u201d Mr. Karsten said.In government bond trading, the yield on the 10-year note rose to 2.75 percent from 2.74 percent on Wednesday.

{"Headline": "Cold Weather and Light Inventory Reduce House Sales", "Date": "2014-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySevere cold weather and a shortage of houses on the market pushed home resales to an 18-month low in January, the latest indication that economic activity has hit a soft patch.The group said unseasonably cold weather was partly to blame, but it also acknowledged some fundamental weakness in the market, with higher mortgage rates and prices and fewer homes for sale.Lawrence Yun, the group\u2019s chief economist, said, \u201cWe cannot ignore the ongoing headwinds of tight credit, limited inventory, higher prices and higher mortgage interest rates.\u201dThe 30-year fixed mortgage rate is about a full percentage point higher than it was a year ago, even though rates have come down a bit since hitting a two-year high in September.Sales tumbled in the Northeast, South and Midwest, which were hit by snow storms and ice last month. And they were down 7.3 percent in the West, an indication that other factors apart from the weather also weighed on sales.Home resales, which peaked in July, have declined in five of the last six months, and in January were down 5.1 percent from a year ago.In January, the inventory of unsold homes on the market rose 2.2 percent from December, pushing the supply to 4.9 months. While that was up from December\u2019s 4.6 months, it remained below the 6.0 months that analysts consider a healthy balance between supply and demand. The median price for a previously owned home rose 10.7 percent from a year ago.First-time buyers accounted for 26 percent of the transactions, the smallest share since the group started tracking the series in October 2008. A market share of 40 to 45 percent is considered ideal by economists and real estate professionals.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leaving Work Behind", "Date": "2014-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen economists look ahead to the possibilities awaiting our grandchildren, they often see this divide widening even further, as the digital economy delivers rich rewards to certain kinds of highly educated talent, while revolutions in robotics eliminate many of today\u2019s low-skilled, low-wage jobs.That big number prompted Republicans to recycle their predictions that the health care law would be a \u201cjob killer.\u201d As liberals retorted, this is not exactly right: These would be working hours freely given up, not jobs lost in huge Obamacare-induced layoffs. Any health care reform worthy of the name would have some version of this effect: If you weaken the link between insurance and employment, workers will have one less reason to stay at a job they dislike. And it\u2019s easy to envision cases where the ability to reduce one\u2019s working hours would be an unmitigated good \u2014 for ailing near-retirees, for parents of young children.And this is where liberalism has a very important choice to make. It\u2019s possible to defend Obamacare\u2019s overall goals while also recognizing its potentially perverse effects, and conceding that we should try to minimize the number of low-skilled workers exiting the labor market.But it\u2019s also possible to argue that as a rich, post-scarcity society, we shouldn\u2019t really care that much about whether the poor choose to work. The important thing is just making sure they have a decent standard of living, full stop, and if they choose Keynesian leisure over a low-paying job, that\u2019s their business.There are hints of a division within the liberal mind on this issue. Across the left and center-left, there\u2019s agreement that an unequal society requires a thicker social safety net, and that as technological changes undercut low-wage work, government should help those left behind.On the conservative side, things are somewhat clearer. There are libertarians who like the basic income idea, but only as a substitute for the existing welfare state, not as a new expansion. Both \u201crugged individualist\u201d right-wingers and more communitarian conservatives tend to see work as essential to dignity, mobility and social equality, and see its decline as something to be fiercely resisted.The question is whether tomorrow\u2019s liberals will be our allies in that fight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Silver Lining to Euro-Skepticism", "Date": "2014-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyMany euro-skeptic treatises, like the report last week saying the Netherlands would be better off quitting the European Union, are exaggerated and unconvincing. But mounting euro-skepticism could still have a silver lining, if it helps those wishing to reform the bloc advance their agenda.Few people think the Netherlands is close to quitting the Union. In this way, it is different from Britain, where an exit is a genuine possibility.That said, euro-skepticism is on the rise after years of economic stagnation. The Party for Freedom, led by the anti-Islam Dutch politician Geert Wilders, is leading in the opinion polls and is likely to be the largest party in the European Parliament elections in May. Other euro-skeptic and nationalist parties, such as the National Front in France and the U.K. Independence Party in Britain, are also likely to perform well.To see what is wrong with the euro-skeptics\u2019 arguments, look no further than the report commissioned by Mr. Wilders and written by Capital Economics, a London consulting firm, on the possibility that the Netherlands might leave the Union. Although the case for such a departure has been dressed up about as well as possible, it is still full of holes.Such a move would have two elements: quitting the European Union and quitting the euro currency. It would, therefore, be a combination of what Britain is contemplating (departure from the Union) and what Greece has considered (leaving the common currency). According to Capital Economics, leaving both the euro and the Union would be beneficial for the Dutch.Look first at leaving the currency. The study reports this could be achieved relatively painlessly. The advantages would be that the Netherlands would not have to risk bailing out other euro countries and that it would be free to run much looser monetary and fiscal policies to bolster its economy.There are several things wrong with this argument. First, there is the implausible assumption that the core euro countries like the Netherlands will pay to write down government debt in all peripheral economies, including Italy, to 90 percent of gross domestic product.Then there is the view that the solution to the Netherlands\u2019 economic problems is loose monetary and fiscal policy. Its stagnation is mostly the result of home-grown problems \u2014 like high household debt after a credit-fueled housing bubble and the high taxes needed to finance its generous welfare state \u2014 rather than its euro membership. If Capital Economics\u2019 proposals had been followed, the Netherlands would have had lower interest rates during the upswing, fueling an even bigger bubble. And its independent central bank would now, astonishingly, be setting interest rates at minus 13 percent.One problem with running such loose macro policies is that it would divert the Netherlands from addressing deeper structural weaknesses. It also might make both local and foreign investors wary of holding new Dutch guilders.This means any exit from the euro could be traumatic. Depositors might take their money abroad, fearing that they would be repaid in devalued guilders if the government really were intent on loose macro policies. And that could cause trouble for the Dutch banking system, given that it depends heavily on foreign funding to plug the gap between its loans and deposits.Given that a decision to quit the European Union would presumably only take place after a referendum, or at least a general election campaign fought on that issue, there would be plenty of time for capital flight.Capital Economics\u2019 case for quitting the Union is as unpersuasive as its case for leaving the euro. Here, the main argument is that the Dutch could gain full access to the bloc\u2019s single market without paying for membership or being tied up in Brussels\u2019 red tape. It could also drastically increase its trade with the faster-growing BRICS countries \u2014 Brazil, Russia. India, China and South Africa. It is true that the Netherlands would cut its net contribution to the European Union budget of 4 billion euros, or about $5.5 billion, a year, 0.7 percent of G.D.P., if it quit. But it would then struggle to retain full access to the single market. Losing that would be damaging, given that more than 70 percent of its exports are to the Union.The Dutch could keep full access to the single market if they followed Norway and joined the European Economic Area. But they would still have to follow the bulk of the bloc\u2019s regulations, without having a vote in drafting those rules.It is also not clear that the Netherlands would do better exporting to the BRICS if it left the Union. True, it would have flexibility to cut trade deals with China on its own. But its small size would mean it would lack clout in negotiating those deals. In any case, Capital Economics\u2019 \u201cconservative\u201d estimate that exports to the BRICS countries would more than double over a decade looks anything but conservative.So the case for leaving is unconvincing. But this is not the same as saying the Union should not be reformed. Rather, governments need to redouble their efforts to make Europe more competitive \u2014 for example by addressing their home-grown structural problems, while completing the bloc\u2019s single market in services and negotiating free trade deals with America and China.Reformers should use the rise of euro-skepticism to persuade more complacent politicians of the need for change. Like jujitsu experts, they should take the momentum from Mr. Wilders and his ilk, and divert it to better ends.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Welcome Relief for Homeowners, Until the Tax Bill Arrives", "Date": "2014-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCome tax time, JPMorgan Chase will be able to write off the $1.5 billion in debt relief it must give homeowners to satisfy the terms of a recent settlement.But the homeowners who receive the help will have to treat it as taxable income, resulting in whopping tax bills for many families who have just lost their homes or only narrowly managed to keep them.They are not alone. A tax exemption for mortgage debt forgiveness, put in place when the economy began to falter in 2007, was allowed to expire on Dec. 31, leaving hundreds of thousands of struggling homeowners in financial limbo even as the Obama administration has tried to encourage such debt write-downs.Congress routinely allows tax breaks to expire and then reinstates them, usually retroactively, as it did last year. But the stakes are high for families dealing with large declines in their home values, and reinstatement of the tax breaks is more uncertain because of a movement in Congress to broadly overhaul the tax code, which, despite its long-shot prospects in an election year, could end up eclipsing smaller tax issues.\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m worried because this should have gotten done before the end of the year and we\u2019ve got families that have to make decisions now,\u201d said Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, who is the sponsor of a bill that would extend the mortgage tax break.The tax exemption was intended to help homeowners who are underwater \u2014 that is, who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. According to the real estate data service CoreLogic, there are still more than 6.4 million households underwater.Typically, if someone lends you money and later says you do not have to pay it back, the I.R.S. counts the amount forgiven as income, except in cases of bankruptcy or insolvency.Short sales, in which a bank agrees to let homeowners sell their homes for less than they owe (a common way of avoiding outright foreclosure), are a form of canceled debt, as are loan modifications that reduce the amount owed.Loss of the exemption is a financial body blow to homeowners already struggling to make ends meet. \u201cI\u2019m in a hole here \u2014 I\u2019m trying to work my way out,'\u201d said Eric Heil, 50, a hospital imaging technician who said a divorce and reduced income were forcing him to sell the house he has owned for 18 years in Parma, Ohio. \u201cAnd the government\u2019s going to say you have to pay taxes on it?\u201dMr. Heil owes $250,000 on his mortgage, and has found a buyer willing to take the house for $150,000. The bank has agreed. But if Congress does not extend the exemption, he will be forced to count the $100,000 difference as income. That would mean a $28,000 tax bill, and Mr. Heil has no idea how he would afford it.The number of people using the mortgage debt relief exemption has increased every year, reaching almost 100,000 in 2011, the most recent year for which the I.R.S. has figures. That number could be far greater in 2013, when there were more than a quarter-million short sales, according to Daren Blomquist of RealtyTrac, who estimates that those families received an average debt reduction of roughly $37,000. If the exemption had not been in place, that would have translated to an extra $9,250 tax bill for those in the 25 percent bracket.Many homeowners are so deeply underwater that they require much more help. Under a separate mortgage settlement involving the five largest lenders, more than 90,000 homeowners received debt relief averaging $109,000 each.Debt reduction was slow to take off as a tool for preventing foreclosure, but as it has proved to be among the most effective types of loan modification, loan servicers have grown more open to using it. Moreover, while the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Administration forbade the use of principal reduction on mortgages overseen by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, even though it would have saved those entities money, the recent appointment of a permanent director, Mel Watt, has raised the possibility that the ban will be lifted.Officials in many states have been urging Congress to reinstate the exemption. \u201cIt is inherently unfair for the big banks to be allowed to write off these payments while struggling homeowners are hit with new tax bills they can\u2019t afford,\u201d said Attorney General Martha Coakley of Massachusetts.There is already an exception for California homeowners who do short sales, according to a November 2013 letter from the Internal Revenue Service to Senator Barbara Boxer, who requested the clarification. Under state law, homeowners are not personally liable for the unpaid balance on their loans after a short sale, so the I.R.S. determined that it should not count as taxable income. A spokesman for the I.R.S. declined to comment beyond the text of the letter or to say whether other states had requested similar exceptions.A bill in the Senate to extend the exemption has 19 co-sponsors, including two Republicans from states hit hard by foreclosures, Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Dean Heller of Nevada. In the House, Joe Heck, Republican of Nevada, is the bill\u2019s sponsor. His three co-sponsors are Democrats.In an interview, Senator Isakson said that forgiven debt was nothing more than \u201cphantom income\u201d and should not be taxed. He said it would be unfair to end the exemption for those families who have managed to hold on to their homes.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a giveaway to anybody, it\u2019s not going to grow into some kind of entitlement \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s going to shrink as time goes by,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the people who have tried the hardest to hang on to their homes and keep the economy strong.\u201dThe bill may suffer from a general fatigue over homeowner issues or a belief that the Treasury cannot afford to forgo the revenue. (The provision is estimated to cost the government $1.3 billion a year in tax revenues; by comparison, the mortgage interest deduction for homeowners is worth $70 billion a year.) There may also be a sense that the exemption is no longer urgent because the economy, and the housing market, are improving.Her agency runs a program that keeps families in their homes by buying them in short sales and selling them back to the occupants at a reduced price. \u201cI keep talking about this in terms of the tale of two recoveries,\u201d Ms. Cherry said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in middle-class or upper-middle-class areas, things are coming back. When you look at urban and lower-income areas, they\u2019re not at all.\u201d\u201cIf the problem\u2019s over,\u201d she added, \u201cthen put the exemption back into place and it won\u2019t get used much. And to the extent the problem is not over, then the people getting whacked with this tax are the people least able to afford it.\u201dAn article on Feb. 5 about the expiration of a tax break for homeowners who received mortgage debt relief or went through a short sale, in which the house is sold for less than the mortgage balance, omitted an exception for some California homeowners. Because under state law borrowers are not personally liable for the unpaid balance on their loans in the event of a short sale, the Internal Revenue Service determined that homeowners in California would not have to count the difference as taxable income. The I.R.S. guidance applies only to California, and does not apply to principle reduction, which is taxable as income.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Ultimate Sales Job: Finding Buyers to Save Pakistan", "Date": "2014-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISLAMABAD \u2014 Mohammad Zubair was on a dinner cruise in Thailand with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan when he was offered the hardest job of his life: privatizing a huge chunk of the economy while fighting resistance from the opposition and trade unions.When the prime minister left the table, a colleague of Mr. Zubair, a former IBM executive, rushed to his side.\u201cAre you mad?\u201d he said. \u201cThree privatization ministers have gone to jail and most have corruption cases hanging over their heads. Don\u2019t take this job.\u201dBut Pakistan\u2019s new privatization minister is determined to find buyers for 68 public companies, most of them loss-making, including two gas companies, an oil company, about 10 banks, the national airline and power distribution companies \u2014 all within the next two years.The government sees the sell-offs as a lifesaver for Pakistan\u2019s $225 billion economy, which has been crippled by power shortages, corruption and militant violence. Successful privatization is Mr. Sharif\u2019s top political and economic goal.\u201cWe lose 500 billion rupees annually because of failing enterprises,\u201d Mr. Zubair said. \u201cEvery day a file lands on a bureaucrat\u2019s desk, and he has to take a decision he isn\u2019t qualified to. This can\u2019t go on, no matter what.\u201dPakistan can raise up to that amount, the equivalent of about $5 billion, in privatization revenue in the next two years to ease pressure on strained public finance, Mr. Zubair said.In September, the International Monetary Fund saved Pakistan from a possible default by agreeing to lend it $6.7 billion over three years. In return, Pakistan must make good on a longstanding promise to privatize loss-making state companies.But for Mr. Zubair, a former IBM chief financial officer for the Middle East and Africa, the real challenge is overcoming resistance from thousands of workers who will have to be laid off and from opposition parties that are against the plan.Once a source of pride, Pakistan International Airlines is struggling to stay aloft, having accumulated losses of more than 250 billion rupees. A quarter of its 40 aircraft are grounded. Flights are regularly canceled, and engineers say they have to cannibalize some planes to keep others flying.Unions strongly oppose the privatization. The I.M.F. wants the airline partly privatized by December.Another asset is Pakistan Steel Mills, which has accumulated losses of more than 100 billion rupees. Overstaffed by at least three times, employees have not been paid since October.An attempt to privatize the mill in 2006 was blocked by the chief justice. Foreign investment dwindled as deals got caught up in court. Now, under a new Supreme Court chief, officials say, the prospects of an overhaul have improved.Under I.M.F. conditions, financial advisers must be hired to evaluate the assets and examine accounts by June.Mr. Zubair\u2019s daily work includes visits to opposition lawmakers, parliamentary committees and unions to convince them of his plan. But he has few takers.\u201cThe answer to our current economic malaise lies not in hawking of state-owned institutions but in restructuring these industries,\u201d Bilawal Bhutto, chief of the former governing Pakistan Peoples Party, wrote in a commentary.Asad Umar, an opposition lawmaker and former chief executive of one of Pakistan\u2019s largest conglomerates, said privatization was being pursued on an unrealistic time frame and that the criteria for identifying entities were inconsistent.For Mr. Umar, it makes no sense that two companies with zero debt are on the list with a bleeding airline; Oil and Gas Development Company made a profit of 91 billion rupees in 2013, and Pakistan Petroleum earned 42 billion rupees in profit last year.Not all sell-offs are expected to go smoothly.A nine-year dispute between the government and Etisalat, the largest telecommunications firm in the United Arab Emirates \u2014 over payments from the privatization of Pakistan Telecommunication Company \u2014 is seen as a discouragement for investors.But Mr. Zubair says no plan is without risk.\u201cThere is no magic wand to ensure that all these ventures will be successful,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the bottom line is that I\u2019m not going to hold off privatization for anyone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Retail Sales Fall, and Economists Blame the Weather", "Date": "2014-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Retail sales unexpectedly fell last month and more Americans filed for jobless benefits last week in the latest signs that the economy started the year on a softer footing as unseasonably cold weather took its toll.Large parts of the country have been gripped by freezing temperatures and snowstorms, which have been blamed for weak hiring in the last two months. Economists, however, are not worried yet and are looking for a rebound in the second quarter.\u201cToday\u2019s data unequivocally show that the unusually cold winter weather is weighing on economic activity,\u201d said Harm Bandholz, chief economist at UniCredit Research. \u201cConsumer spending has literally frozen.\u201d Retail sales fell 0.4 percent in January, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday, led by a drop in automobile sales and in categories like clothing, furniture stores and restaurants, which depend on foot traffic. Economists had expected retail sales to hold steady.Adding to the report\u2019s weak tone, December sales were revised to show a 0.1 percent dip, a reversal of a previously estimated increase of 0.2 percent.Stripping out automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, so-called core sales fell 0.3 percent. Core sales for December were revised to only a 0.3 percent rise from a previously reported 0.7 percent advance.

{"Headline": "Get Your $50,000 Hatchback Here", "Date": "2014-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAround the BlockBMW has been splitting its lineup like so many atoms, smashing particles of models together to create new and potentially lucrative forms of automobiles. As with many experiments, the results range from breathtaking to bewildering. The 1 Series coupe (now rechristened the 2 Series) gave the Bavarian brand a toehold in the booming compact luxury market. The spunky X1 is a nanoscale outgrowth of the X3 and X5 crossover utilities. The 6 Series Gran Coupe is an especially lovely entry in the hot \u201cfour-door coupe\u201d class. And BMW just spun a 4 Series coupe and convertible out of the 3 Series lineup. But the experiments also unleashed the 5 Series Gran Turismo, the most unsightly interspecies mash-up since Jeff Goldblum merged with a winged pest in \u201cThe Fly.\u201d Now, ignoring venomous critical disdain for the 5 GT\u2019s styling \u2014 which suggests either visionary courage or hubris, both associated with mad scientists \u2014 BMW has subjected the smaller 3 Series to the same hatchback-crossover mutation. Go ahead and peek through your fingers: The 3 Series GT is less disturbing to behold than the 5 GT. Yet it still looks like a half-blown-up balloon, a turnip, an Olympic speedskater or any other object that starts small and expands at the rear. Yes, BMW already has a new 3 Series Sports Wagon, but Americans buy wagons as often as they attend cricket matches. And not everyone is comfortable with the more traditional S.U.V. body style of the X3 and X5. So BMW has conjured a tweener \u2014 a roomier hatchback on platform shoes, with standard all-wheel drive \u2014 to attract customers who crave the 3 Series\u2019 performance but need more utility to close the deal.That is surely a crumb-sized sales niche, but BMW is willing to bake a cake to fill it.The project began by bloating a 3 Series like a foie gras goose, with a stretched platform created mainly for China. The GT adds 7.9 inches to the wagon\u2019s length, 4.3 inches to the wheelbase and 3 inches in height.As with the 5 GT, once you\u2019re inside, the cabin is a good place to be. Compared with the 3 sedan, the GT has 2.8 inches more rear legroom, totaling more than the larger 5 Series sedan. The 18.3-cubic-foot cargo hold is one cube roomier than the much smaller Sports Wagon\u2019s. Fold the split rear seat and there is 56.5 cubic feet of storage, negligibly more than the wagon\u2019s. The Comfort Access option, copying a feature pioneered by Ford, opens the tailgate with a waggle of a foot below the bumper. At 68 m.p.h., an active spoiler \u2014 the first on any BMW \u2014 rises to cut aerodynamic lift, then slips discreetly into the tailgate below 43 m.p.h. As usual, BMW\u2019s chassis and powertrains are beyond reproach, whether the strong, efficient 240-horsepower TwinPower turbo 4 or the fierce 300-horse in-line turbo 6 in the 335i version that I tested. Either model comes only with a beautifully adept 8-speed automatic gearbox.So equipped, the 335i GT romps to 60 m.p.h. in 5.2 seconds.But turning a compact, muscled athlete into a pear-shaped family car is bound to have repercussions.To wit, the GT is the first 3 Series to top two tons on the scales. The 335i GT\u2019s claimed 4,010 pounds is 600 more than the lightest 328i sedan. And while the 3 GT acquits itself bravely at speed, aside from some unwanted body roll, I felt those pounds when I started chucking this Bavarian cow through the curves.The GT\u2019s seats are also perched 2.3 inches higher than the sedan\u2019s. The idea is to let people slide right in without bending their knees. But my knees still have enough cartilage to enter and exit a normal car.

The four-bedroom home, in a district with landmark protection, has the limestone walls and stone arches typical of historic Maltese architecture.Above a trio of arched double windows, and beneath a wrought-iron balcony, carved stone corbels stretch along the facade. Double doors open onto a long reception hall with a fireplace and a barrel-vault stone ceiling. Flanked by the living and dining rooms, each with a highly polished mosaic tile floor, the reception hall extends to an interior courtyard and a large elevated patio at the far end of the palazzo. The ground floor is also home to the kitchen, a powder room and a bedroom. The main staircase off the reception hall opens onto the \u201cpiano nobile,\u201d or \u201cnoble level,\u201d as the second floor is known. Flanked by elaborately carved limestone sculptures,\u00a0it is one of three staircases, adjoining a banquet-size entertaining hall with a beamed ceiling flanked by decorative corbels. Also on this floor are three master-size bedrooms, a library and two rustic red-and-beige-tiled bathrooms, each with a tub and a hand-held shower. Birkirkara has close to 26,000 residents. One of Malta\u2019s oldest towns, it has narrow streets and alleys lined with restored period houses favored by professionals and expatriates, said Raymond Young, a senior property consultant for Frank Salt Real Estate, the listing agency. Some have been converted to social gathering spots known as band clubs. A few yards from the palazzo is St. Helen\u2019s Basilica, the parish church famous for its large bell; the village square is the site of a weekly open-air market. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a simple life,\u201d Mr. Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sweet walk around.\u201d MARKET OVERVIEWSince the start of the year there has been renewed interest among local and foreign buyers alike, said Joseph Lupi, a managing director of Frank Salt.

WHO BUYS IN MALTABecause English is spoken (from 1800 to 1964 the island was a British colony), Malta is a perennial favorite among buyers from Britain, Mr. Lupi said. The mild Mediterranean climate, the island lifestyle and financial opportunities have also helped draw West Europeans, Russians, Scandinavians and Americans. Benjamin Grech, the chief operating officer of Engel & Voelkers Sara Grech Malta, says 40 percent of buyers over the last four years have been foreigners relocating to Malta. BUYING BASICSTo attract more residents from abroad, the government recently introduced the Individual Investor Program, said Dr. Ann Bugeja, a lawyer for the CSB Group, describing the initiative as \u201callowing the naturalization as a citizen for foreign nationals who buy property for a minimum of \u20ac350,000, and keep it for five years, or lease property for \u20ac16,000 a year and keep it for five years.\u201d The deal also requires an investment of \u20ac150,000 in stocks and bonds, a \u201ccontribution\u201d from the main applicant of \u20ac650,000 \u201cto the economy\u201d plus an additional \u20ac5,000 for the spouse, \u20ac25,000 per child, and \u20ac50,000 for each dependent parent above the age of 55.

{"Headline": "Turks Are Glued to a Sensational Drama, This One Political", "Date": "2014-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From IstanbulISTANBUL \u2014 Turks have always loved a good soap opera. Years ago the fixation was \u201cDallas,\u201d and Turks of a certain age still refer to a woman who drinks too much as Sue Ellen, the boozy character on that show. More recently, the Turkish drama \u201cThe Magnificent Century,\u201d about palace intrigue and romance in an Ottoman sultan\u2019s harem, became an obsession here and in the Middle East.Currently, though, the show to watch is Turkey\u2019s own political crisis, set off by a corruption scandal that has played out like a serial drama through the steady flow of leaked telephone conversations. The most sensational one was released Monday night, an apparently wiretapped conversation in which Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, worried about an investigation closing in, is heard telling his son to get tens of millions of dollars out of the house.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s office has dismissed this latest bombshell disclosure as a fabrication. But it has inevitably heightened the sense of crisis that has enveloped Turkey since the corruption scandal burst into public view in mid-December with a series of dawn raids on the homes and offices of associates of Mr. Erdogan.The crisis has damaged Turkey\u2019s already troubled economy. The currency tumbled again on Tuesday while opposition lawmakers called \u2014 and not for the first time \u2014 for the government to step down, with one official saying Mr. Erdogan should either resign or flee the country \u201cby helicopter.\u201dFor many Turks, the disclosures represented just the latest episode of a continuing, and opaque, national obsession, one that played out Monday night in predictable fashion. Social media went into overdrive \u2014 along with government censors, apparently, as the original leak suddenly became unavailable to many Internet users here \u2014 while the mainstream Turkish news media stayed largely silent.Mr. Erdogan did not stay silent, though. His office quickly released a statement saying, \u201cPhone recordings published on the Internet that are alleged to be between Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his son are a product of an immoral montage that is completely false.\u201dThe statement promised that legal action would be taken. \u201cThose who framed this dirty plot against the prime minister of the Turkish Republic will be held responsible within the law,\u201d it said. Adding to the suspense, Mr. Erdogan went on to hold a late-night meeting with his spy chief and his interior minister.However, most analysts say his adherents are entrenched within the Turkish state, where they are in a position to do a great deal of damage if they so choose. The crisis actually stems, many say, from a fallout between Mr. Gulen and Mr. Erdogan, who were once allies in the current Islamist governing coalition.Now that they are warring, many Turks say they are caught in the middle of a power struggle.\u201cThere is no way of knowing whether the tapes are real or fake,\u201d said Ince Unaldi, who works in a women\u2019s clothing boutique in the affluent Etiler district of Istanbul, after listening to the latest leak. \u201cWe are being dragged into a war of two very dark forces.\u201dIn a statement, the Rumi Forum, a Washington-based center for interfaith cooperation of which Mr. Gulen is honorary chairman, said on Tuesday night that \u201cMr. Gulen has no connection whatsoever with any phone tapping, including that of the prime minister and his son that was revealed\u00a0yesterday.\u201d For many Turks the scandal, and the manner in which it has unfolded, have become something of a preoccupation. On Tuesday, after spending Monday night riveted by the latest leak, Kaya Genc, a novelist and essayist who lives in Istanbul, was up against a deadline for an essay he is writing for the Paris Review. But he was glued to his television set, watching Mr. Erdogan speak to lawmakers from his Justice and Development Party in Ankara, the Turkish capital.For Mr. Genc, the situation, and his inability to focus on his work amid the drumbeat of scandal, brought to mind a quote from the famous Turkish novelist Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar, whose 1960s-era comic novel \u201cThe Time Regulation Institute\u201d was recently published in English: \u201cTurkey does not allow its children to care for anything besides its own problems.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s like a TV series they watch after hours. In the morning, they come to their senses and say, \u2018What was that all about?\u2019 But in the evening it is entertainment. \u2018The Magnificent Century\u2019 is the only thing that rivals these things.\u201dOn Monday night Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the director of the Ankara office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research organization, was reading a book and trying to unplug from social media for one evening. But the electricity went out, and with nothing else to do he got on Twitter and saw the uproar over the latest leak.\u201cI was shocked, like everyone else,\u201d he said. \u201cMy first reaction was I was scared about the repercussions this will have.\u201dHe added, \u201cIf this is real, this will lead to even more decreased trust in Turkish society,\u201d particularly in the judicial system.With several elections on the horizon, beginning with a vote for municipal leaders in March, most Turks are bracing for even more startling revelations.Everyone, it seems, is waiting for compromising sex tapes to emerge, a tawdry phenomenon with a history in Turkish politics, especially at election time. Already, sex tapes supposedly involving high-level officials have been delivered to some news organizations, which, for now, have shown restraint. It is probably only a matter of time before they begin showing up on social media. On Tuesday night, thousands of protesters gathered in the Istanbul neighborhood of Kadikoy, on the Asian side of the city, chanting for the government to resign. They were dispersed with tear gas and water cannon.After weeks of scandal, however, many here say they have simply become desensitized.\u201cI was not even surprised when I heard the conversation between Erdogan and his son,\u201d said Aziz Burak Kanduz, 25, who works in the film industry in Istanbul. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a state of numbness. As a society, we are going backwards, big time.\u201dSebnem Arsu and Ceylan Yeginsu contributed reporting from Istanbul, and Brian Knowlton from Washington.Advertisement"}

He found it slushy and unpleasant to pick his way through.But this winter, it cannot snow enough for him.Mr. Colon, now 36 and unemployed, earns $12 an hour \u2014 $4 more than the state\u2019s minimum wage \u2014 to shovel snow in his Bronx neighborhood through a seasonal labor program run by the city\u2019s Sanitation Department. The program, called Emergency Snow Laborers, has recruited more than 1,800 New Yorkers to do their small part in an expansive snow-clearing operation along 6,300 miles of streets in the five boroughs. By noon Thursday, Mr. Colon and four other snow laborers, bundled in heavy jackets, knit caps, gloves and neon orange vests, had dug away ice and hardened snow from eight bus stops, eight fire hydrants and 14 crosswalks. They still had five hours to go.\u201cI wish it could keep snowing every day so I don\u2019t have to look for another job,\u201d said Mr. Colon, who previously worked as a barber, as he expertly handled an ice pick. The overabundance of snow that has shuttered schools, snarled mass transit and drained salt supplies has also turned into an unexpected boon for many of the city\u2019s poor and unemployed. On Thursday, the Sanitation Department hired 518 snow laborers for the day, including 230 laborers in just the Bronx, which has an unemployment rate of 10.6 percent, the highest in the city. It was the 10th day this year the department had called out the laborers.The snow laborers program, which was started in the 1990s, is financed through the department\u2019s $57.3 million annual budget for snow operations. Keith Mellis, a spokesman, said that it was intended to supplement the efforts of 4,600 city sanitation employees during periods of particularly heavy snowfall or cleanup. \u201cWe look at it as an extension of the department,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the front lines, but the residents who make up this city are just as responsible as we are. We\u2019re one big team.\u201dThe jobs are open to any city resident 18 and over who has a valid identification and Social Security card, and does not require a physical fitness test (though sanitation workers will ask applicants if they can perform physical labor). Mr. Mellis said that he was not aware of any laborer who incurred a major injury on the job, though some have slipped or fallen on the ice. The department supplies the shovels, picks, orange vests and gloves.Rosario Polanco, 26, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic, and two other women worked alongside nine men on the Grand Concourse. Ms. Polanco, who lost her waitressing job eight months ago, said she needed the money to support herself and her 4-year-old son. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard for me,\u201d she said. \u201cHard is when you\u2019re looking for a job and you\u2019re not finding it.\u201dMr. Colon\u2019s group of five hauled shovels and picks along the street, stopping from time to time to work a stubborn patch of ice. At a bus stop, they cleared away a mound of snow for Maria Soto, 82, who was pushing a stroller.In return, Ms. Soto later treated all five of them to coffee at a bodega. She thanked one of the laborers, Marcus Velasquez, in Spanish, saying: \u201cI wish that you could always be here to help and clean up.\u201dMr. Velasquez, 50, a married father of two, said he tried to shovel snow whenever he could to help out his neighbors as well as his family. He works part-time for a building maintenance company, earning $35,000 to $40,000 annually, because he cannot find a full-time job. \u201cRight now with this economy, you need a little extra thing coming to you,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes your paycheck is not enough.\u201dMr. Velasquez added that he was looking forward to the coming weekend, when more snow was predicted. \u201cI\u2019m going to put more money in my pocket,\u201d he said.Still, the snow is not for everyone. Mr. Colon said he had invited his friends to join him. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018No way,\u2019 because it\u2019s hard work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s cold out here.\u201dMr. Colon had no such hesitation. He estimated that he had already earned about $350 from his first stint shoveling snow two weeks ago that would go toward paying his family\u2019s rent, cable and phone bills. He and his wife, a hospital billing clerk who earns about $35,000 annually, have two young boys. They rely on $189 a month in food stamps to eat.\u201cWhen you have a house to support and you need to make money, you got to do what you got to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have no choice. When you\u2019re looking for a job and it appears, you\u2019ve just got to take it.\u201dAs Mr. Colon pulled his hood up, he added, \u201cAs long as it keeps snowing, we keep working.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Build a Perfect Refugee Camp", "Date": "2014-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom the outside, the temporary shelter for Syrian civilians in Kilis, Turkey, doesn\u2019t look like an inviting place to live. It looks like a prison. All around are olive groves, but here, Turkey suddenly runs out. A metal archway announces the customs gate to Syria. To its right stands what is more formally known as the Republic of Turkey Prime Ministry Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency\u2019s Kilis Oncupinar Accommodation Facility. High gates bar entry, and barbed wire tops the walls. Police officers and private security mill about.Many of the world\u2019s displaced live in conditions striking for their wretchedness, but what is startling about Kilis is how little it resembles the refugee camp of our imagination. It is orderly, incongruously so. Residents scan a card with their fingerprints for entry, before they pass through metal detectors and run whatever items they\u2019re carrying through an X-ray machine. Inside, it\u2019s stark: 2,053 identical containers spread out in neat rows. No tents. None of the smells \u2014 rotting garbage, raw sewage \u2014 usually associated with human crush and lack of infrastructure.On April 29, 2011, 263 Syrians crossed into Turkey, fleeing civil war at home. Within 24 hours, the Turkish government set up an emergency tent camp for them in southern Hatay Province. In less than three years, it was operating 22 camps serving 210,000 refugees, mostly in provinces along its roughly 500-mile-long border with Syria. Kilis, opened in 2012, was one of six container camps meant to offer a better standard of shelter to incoming refugees. When I visited last October, the camp was full, and a group of squatters outside waited for placement.There were other luxuries. Power lines, and at least as many streetlights as you would find in a nice suburban neighborhood. Multiple playgrounds that look like McDonald\u2019s PlayPlaces. Containers housing maintenance men who can fix electric or plumbing problems. Fire hydrants.Several large structures housed the camp\u2019s schools. The first was the Olive Preschool and Kindergarten. The children weren\u2019t yet in class, and as we walked on the gleaming tiles, the spacious hallway echoed. Big cutouts of Snow White and the dwarfs decorated the walls, along with Turkish flags. A sign read, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dThe principal, Gulcin Dogan, a 26-year-old Turk with long light hair and glossy red lipstick, met us in front of one classroom. There are two floors, she explained, one for each grade, about 450 kids in each. Dogan, a psychologist by training, does double duty counseling children in need of it. Which is many of them.At the next school over, class was in session. You could hear children reciting and clapping; from the window, several waved. Two thousand two hundred and twenty-five students attend school here, in sex-segregated classes per the Syrians\u2019 request. One Syrian teacher admitted that this refugee-camp school is nicer than the public schools at home.\u201cIt\u2019s the nicest refugee camp in the world!\u201d a Polish diplomat staying at my hotel crowed when I mentioned the place to him the next day. Standing with him was an Italian official; he nodded vehemently in agreement. No one I spoke to \u2014 not the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, not academics, not even the refugees \u2014 denies that the standard of living here is exceptionally high. When I later listed the amenities to a refugee expert, she replied, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of such a thing.\u201dBut the fact is, it isn\u2019t \u2014 not just because the camps are unusually well equipped but also because Turkey long ago exempted itself from any obligation to respond at all. Technically, the 14,000 residents at Kilis are not refugees but \u201cguests\u201d of Turkey. This is not just semantics. The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees prohibits states from forcing them back over borders into danger and guarantees their right to work, shelter, travel and public assistance. Turkey signed the agreement but did so with a \u201cgeographical limitation\u201d: Its mandate applies only to refugees from Europe.Initially refusing Syrian refugees entry might have been difficult, given the already open border between the two countries and the gaps between checkpoints and a war close enough to bring in stray fire. The Syrians are also mostly Sunni Muslims, and Turkey has a record of embracing refugees with ethnic and cultural ties; it absorbed more than 300,000 from Bulgaria in 1989 and 25,000 from Bosnia in the early \u201890s. Whatever the reason, Turkey decided to open its arms to its war-ravaged Syrian neighbors. Except for intermittent closures, when fighting is too intense or fears of terrorist activity at the border arise, any Syrians with passports can cross through checkpoints. They come and go all day, some of them driving in, others on foot, carrying their belongings in big bundles or wearing dress slacks and trailing roller suitcases. Turkey is building walls along small sections of its border where the Syrian-side clashes involve Kurds, and it sometimes closes the border to those without passports pending security clearance, as happened recently when large numbers of Syrians fled intensive bombing in Aleppo. But when I was at Kilis, even those without passports could move unimpeded around the checkpoint. They streamed steadily in and out of the olive groves, appearing or disappearing among the trees.Why would Turkey be so willing to house refugees \u2014 and to house them so well at its own expense? Unlike almost all other refugee camps in the world, Kilis is not run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Rather, Turkey\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD, asked the U.N.H.C.R. for its camp guidelines \u2014 minimum distance between tents, and so on \u2014 and then designed its own. It staffed the camps with Turkish government employees, allowing in few NGOs and giving those only supporting roles. Except for some relatively minor international donations, the financial responsibility, and all the administrative responsibility, has been Turkey\u2019s alone.This approach, while costly, has given the Turks a measure of control over every detail \u2014 including who is working in their country. Typically, camps are serviced by a number of NGOs, and there can be overlap \u2014 or gaps \u2014 in the services they provide. The agencies may fight among themselves or clash with local leaders; each has its own hierarchies and staff members, drawn from an unlimited number of nations. Running a camp that way, the Turkish government official speculated, would be complicated: \u201cThere\u2019s too many people coming and going. It\u2019s not secure. And it\u2019s distracting.\u201dBut some also think that the Turks were making a savvy bet. Many thought the fighting in Syria wouldn\u2019t last very long. That\u2019s one reason, says Kemal Kirisci, director of the Turkey Project at the Brookings Institution, that the Turks may have invested in such elaborate camps. \u201cIt needs to be seen in the context of Turkey\u2019s policy to create one integrated market in the Middle East. The Syrians were going to come, and they were going to stay in these camps, and every single one was going to go home and become grand ambassadors of Turkey.\u201d As Turkey\u2019s economy has grown, so has its hope of being a significant actor on the geopolitical stage. \u201cThe Turks have a burning desire to show the external world how great they\u2019re doing. These camps are a very visible way of doing it. With the assumption that it wouldn\u2019t last long, the cost was worth the benefit.\u201dWhich is, of course, what everyone always thinks: Refugees are supposed to be in their host countries only temporarily. But of the 15.4 million refugees globally, most have been in camps for at least five years. Since Turkey established its first container camp, Syria\u2019s civil war has only escalated. There are projected to be 1.5 million Syrian refugees in Turkey by year\u2019s end.The Turks may have built as good a refugee camp as it is possible to build. But a camp is still a camp. And if a camp becomes a shelter not just for a few months but for years, a substitute \u2014 even a deterrent \u2014 to a real solution, how much does it matter how nice it is?One thing you notice, entering Kilis for the first time, is how many of the containers have satellite dishes.Twelve people live in Bakri\u2019s container. Her husband, her husband\u2019s parents, her three children, her husband\u2019s three brothers, one of whom has a son, and a nephew. And 15 canaries in three cages that Bakri brought from Syria. They survived the mortar attack that destroyed her home, but they don\u2019t sing anymore. Or lay eggs.Like many of the refugees at Kilis, Bakri fled heavy shelling in northern Syria, where government forces have long been in pitched battle with rebel groups, and rebel groups often battle each other. And like many of the refugees, she often finds herself at loose ends. In a camp, no matter how large the family, boredom prevails. Aside from cooking and cleaning, there is little to do. Errands are within a five-minute walk; there is no livestock to tend or garden to hoe. To keep busy, Bakri works as the unpaid manager of the camp\u2019s laundry centers. Each camp section has one; families can drop off laundry twice a week and pick it up soon after, cleaned, free of charge. \u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d said a 44-year-old Syrian volunteer named Malak Jamal, who works in the laundry of Section C, where she lives. \u201cThere are no problems.\u201d Then she added, \u201cThe whole camp is good.\u201d Behind the laundry room is an activities center. One room has 10 enormous looms; the Turks provide cotton and weaving lessons. Another houses a sewing workshop \u2014 it was packed when I visited \u2014 and yet another functions as a beauty salon.\u201cThose Syrians who say the Turkish government is bad are liars and dogs,\u201d Bakri\u2019s father-in-law exclaimed, between drags on a cigarette. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get what you want, people complain.\u201d He could easily be one of those complainers, crammed as his family is into one trailer. But the camp is full. \u201cI know the situation,\u201d the old man said. He came, he continued, with this one purple-pinstriped shirt on his back, the one he was wearing, because he intended to stay 10 days, not two and a half years. He had no money or food. \u201cSo if I\u2019m a good man, I must be grateful to them. They don\u2019t have to do this, after all.\u201dGratitude for the host country pervades the camp. When I sat down with Basheer Alito, the leader of Bakri\u2019s section, he told me several times to write that he wished to thank the Turkish government, that the camp is very good and that the government is very good. Each of the camp\u2019s sections has a leader, and Alito is the leader of the leaders (he was elected a year ago). He meets with his constituents when they have problems: fixing a damaged trailer or getting a pregnant woman to the hospital. The camp has a simple clinic staffed by Turkish doctors \u2014 and their translators \u2014 with free treatment and medicine; transport is arranged to nearby hospitals when serious health issues arise. As the refugees\u2019 liaison with the camp administrator, Alito \u201cof course\u201d hears complaints, but it\u2019s only from people who \u201cdon\u2019t understand the situation.\u201d He wanted to thank the Turkish government for treating the Syrians like brothers, he said, though the Turks aren\u2019t even Arabs. Would that the Arab governments in countries like Jordan were doing such a good job helping their fellow Arabs, he went on, instead of sticking them in camps overflowing with trash and crime.It is true that conditions for refugees in Jordan had become synonymous with violence and suffering. Still, I found Alito so adamant in his appreciation as to make me suspicious. But two other section leaders I talked to expressed the same feeling. One of these, Ibrahim Harmoush, seemed much less the politician than Alito. Broad-shouldered with salt-and-pepper hair, he had the posture of a man who doesn\u2019t pull punches. Harmoush, it turned out, was the brother of a high-level officer in the Syrian Army, Lt. Col. Hussein Harmoush, who defected to Turkey a few months into the war and became an instant hero of the revolution. Later he ended up back in the regime\u2019s hands, then disappeared.\u201cTurkish officers betrayed him and gave him to the Syrian regime,\u201d Ibrahim said. Since a televised confession more than two years ago, he hasn\u2019t been heard from. Last October, several Turks, including a former intelligence official, were sentenced for their role in the abduction of Ibrahim\u2019s brother.Even so, when I asked Ibrahim if he had any complaints about the camp, he struggled to come up with one. Finally, he said that sometimes a new administrator is appointed head of the camp, and he\u2019ll have slightly different rules from the last one, and there\u2019s the inconvenience of building a new relationship. But over all, he wanted to thank the Turkish government for the good work they do at Kilis.Perhaps nothing encapsulates that work so well as the way the Turks supply refugees with food. At Kilis, there are three grocery stores, side by side like a mini strip mall. Every family is given a debit card when they register, and every month, they get a balance of 80 Turkish lira, close to $40, per person for food and $10 per person for sundries. Inside the grocery stores are undulating produce sections, meat counters, dry-goods shelves and refrigerated dairy cases. At the checkout, refugees swipe their cards and show their IDs.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I asked Ajouz, my translator, as we toured the markets.\u201cIt\u2019s better than a grocery store in Syria,\u201d he mumbled.Nesrin Semen, a senior program assistant for the World Food Programme, which is helping run the project, told me that this is \u201ca new modality of providing food assistance.\u201d The W.F.P. doesn\u2019t have an office here, as it does in other countries\u2019 refugee camps, but the government invited it in for this pilot program. Semen was here with a team to check on how it was going \u2014 well, seemed to be the assessment. \u201cIt\u2019s effective,\u201d she began, \u201cit\u2019s cost-effective, it\u2019s faster\u201d \u2014 more so than, say, shipping food to storage centers, transporting it to camp distribution centers and having people wait in line to pick up bland rations, as the W.F.P. does in some other countries. \u201cThere are no delays; it\u2019s logistically simple,\u201d she continued, adding that \u201cit supports the local economy.\u201d In a survey, the refugees reported that they liked the grocery-store/debit-card system. It requires infrastructure, like electricity and an Internet connection, that not all refugee-camp locations have. But \u201cin the future,\u201d Semen said, \u201canywhere we can do this, we will.\u201dAccording to Semen, Jordan and Lebanon are implementing the same system. Posters I saw on the grocery-store windows announced that the United States Agency for International Development, the British, the Swiss, the French, the Japanese, the U.N.H.C.R. and the Danes are all contributing money for the food debit cards. (Since then, other countries have joined the program.) For Turkey, the grocery stores are proving comparatively inexpensive. Before the stores opened in October 2012, the Turkish government was spending nearly four times as much on food. Because before that, it was serving the refugees three hot meals a day. Catered.In the Turkish camps, says Carol Batchelor, the U.N.H.C.R.'s representative in Turkey, \u201cTurkey has taken the primary role, and they\u2019re very consistent.\u201d The Turkish government ministries appoint staff members \u2014 the Ministry of Family and Social Policy appointed Kilis\u2019s kindergarten principal, Dogan \u2014 and all of them report to the camp administrator, who is also appointed. The camp administrator reports directly to the governor of the region. With its model, Turkey has cut down on some of the major hazards associated with refugee camps: vandalism, theft, sexual assault, diverted supplies. \u201cAny place you have 14,000 people living, and living in that proximity, there are challenges,\u201d Batchelor continued. \u201cBut these problems that exist in other camps are much less prevalent there.\u201dTake crime. I asked almost every one of the dozens of Syrians I interviewed during the four days that I spent in the camp about crime. All reported that other than the occasional fight, they were not aware of any. This was true not just in Kilis but in Nizip I, a tent camp that was founded after Turkey realized it couldn\u2019t build enough container camps to house all the Syrian refugees. Because there are no doors to lock, and bathrooms are located in blocks, security is always more lax in tent camps. But even here, the residents\u2019 assessments didn\u2019t differ. \u201cIt\u2019s fully safe!\u201d a bubbly 38-year-old named Warda Aboud assured me, throwing her arms out in front of her, palms down. While rape is an epidemic in many camps, at Nizip I, Aboud said, she didn\u2019t worry about it: \u201cThere\u2019s guards everywhere. At night, the lights are like daylight. I can go out alone at 4 a.m., 3 a.m.\u201dBoth Kilis and Nizip I appear to lack the black markets found in camps around the world, where donated supplies are stolen and sold back to refugees. This has been widely reported as a plague at the Za\u2019atari camp in Jordan, where the practice consolidates wealth and power among gangs that form there and leaves some refugees lacking food and even shelter. In Kilis, each of the three grocery stores is run by a different private company to prevent price gouging. Competition, the theory goes, will keep prices reasonable.But operating camps this way is expensive. \u201cThis has cost them,\u201d Batchelor says. Expenditures at the Kilis camp run to at least $2 million a month. By the end of 2013, the Turkish government had spent $2.5 billion on its Syrian guests, primarily in camps \u2014 a figure that has created resentment among Turks. The Turkish official I spoke to acknowledged that there were widespread rumors that the Syrian refugees were given gifts of a million dollars each.Such rumors are clearly outlandish, but for Turks struggling to make ends meet, the services extended to Syrian refugees might well seem extraordinary. At Nizip II, a container camp that opened 10 months after Kilis, I walked into the beauty salon as a woman was getting a blowout. Free. When I asked the administrator why the camp took the amenities this far, he said: \u201cWe just put ourselves in the Syrians\u2019 shoes. We need Internet. We need barbershops. We need workshops. We need art. What we need as Turks, we give them.\u201d He shrugged as though this were totally obvious. \u201cWe\u2019re humans.\u201dLast October, the U.N.H.C.R. had a high-level meeting to discuss how to help the vast number of Syrians who continue to pour into neighboring countries. The first of three standard solutions, voluntary repatriation, was off the table, as it is for millions of refugees. The second, incorporating them fully into the citizenry of their countries of refuge, was, too: For one thing, politicians in Jordan and Lebanon, where Syrian refugees are now estimated to make up about 10 and 20 percent of the populations, respectively, have been complaining about the burden on schools and job markets. That left just a single option: third-country resettlement. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for solidarity in every form, in every measure, and certainly any new forms of solidarity,\u201d says Batchelor, who attended the meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re asking states to be extremely flexible\u201d about not holding Syrians to the sometimes yearslong process of resettlement or sticking to low resettlement quotas. When I asked her if that request was being granted, she paused a bit before saying: \u201cThere was a robust interest and expression of solidarity. We\u2019d like to see that expression of solidarity materialized in more practical terms.\u201d (According to Amnesty International, only 55,000 Syrian refugees have claimed asylum in the European Union.)In Turkey, Syrian refugees come on top of an already significant refugee influx. Last year, Batchelor processed applications from more than 60 different countries. Many have been there for at least six years. These refugees do not live in camps. None were built for them. Like more than half the world\u2019s refugees, they are \u201curban refugees,\u201d or \u201cself settled\u201d refugees, semi-integrated into the population.Sources of aid exist, but as Kamyar Jarahzadeh, the American representative for the Coordination Group of Afghan Refugees in Turkey, pointed out, it\u2019s \u201cpiecemeal and hard to get.\u201d (Afghanistan is currently one of the largest countries of origin for Turkey\u2019s refugees \u2014 and indeed the largest source of refugees worldwide for the last 32 years.) \u201cMost people we see are getting nothing. There\u2019s no centralized effort, and at the end of the day, even if everyone knew about aid, there wouldn\u2019t be enough to go around.\u201dUrban refugees don\u2019t always have the right to work and can be detained or fined for trying. It can be difficult for them to get health care or schooling for their children. In many ways, they may find themselves living like illegal immigrants, lost between the cracks of refugee policy \u2014 and absent from our consciousness. Some 400,000 Syrian refugees in Turkey live outside the camps. Those with means settle in apartments; the less fortunate camp in parks and empty lots. Many Syrians fled with more savings than the average refugee, but the length of the conflict would exhaust even large reserves. And from an aid standpoint, being from Syria, a fresher and more visible conflict, doesn\u2019t make being an urban refugee any easier. Louis Belanger, then the humanitarian-media officer for Oxfam, told me the organization was struggling to get people to respond to the message that most Syrian refugees were outside camps but equally in need of aid. People somehow saw them as less deserving. \u201cIt is difficult to raise the funds for them,\u201d he said.\u201cMore and more refugees in the world in camps are in camps that have been there for a really, really long time,\u201d says Fabos, who now teaches in the International Development and Social Change program at Clark University in Massachusetts. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the original model. Our model was that camps were there just to hold people temporarily until one of these \u2018durable solutions\u2019: sending them back home, allowing them to settle where they are \u2014 with legal rights \u2014 or settle them in a third place.\u201d Almost all the post-World War II displaced-person, or D.P., camps were closed and their residents resettled by 1952. But three years ago, the largest refugee camp in the world, Kenya\u2019s Dadaab, turned 20. It was built for 90,000 refugees. It holds more than 420,000.\u201cCamps are places where it\u2019s quite straightforward to provide services for people,\u201d Fabos says. \u201cThe U.N. and humanitarian agencies are so good at providing resources.\u201d Every day, the World Food Programme alone operates an average of 5,000 trucks, 50 aircraft and 30 ships, as well as trains, river barges, mules, yaks, camels and donkeys. \u201cThe problem is when people start living in those situations more than the presumable amount of time that people should be living in those situations. To the U.N.H.C.R., if they live in camp for more than five years, they become an acronym: P.R.S.\u201d \u2014 protracted refugee situation \u2014 \u201cthe majority of encamped refugees are in protracted refugee situations. The state system is more and more unable to accommodate what\u2019s happening on the ground.\u201dBy global standards, the Syrian refugees, who have been in camps for up to three years, are new arrivals. Even so, they know what it means to put their lives on hold. \u201cNinety percent of the guys here are delaying marriage,\u201d Muhammad Deeb, 21, told me. He has set up a clothing shop in a small tent, stocked with merchandise his uncle gave him the money to buy. Other refugees in Kilis, who are not allowed to work outside the camp, have also started businesses of some kind. There are canary stores, falafel stands, bicycle-repair shops and tea shops. There is a tent-size department store selling clothes, glasses and rugs; a coat shop; a jeans shop; a general store; a little joint with two slushy machines churning in two colors (red and orange); a tiny gaming cafe with three computers where a 15- and a 16-year-old sell access to playing Counter-Strike. But these typically offer little if any extra income. At one barbershop, I stopped to ask for a price list, and the proprietor said it was free.Deeb keeps prices as low as possible as \u201ca service to my people\u201d \u2014 a children\u2019s Adidas tracksuit is $5. So while he can supplement his refugee allowance, it\u2019s not enough for a family. He is tall, lanky and single. In Syria, he says, in a village of 5,000, there would normally be two weddings a month. Here among Kilis\u2019s 14,000, there\u2019s one wedding a month. \u201cWe have no respectable jobs, no house, so no girlfriend,\u201d he said. For now, that\u2019s fine with him. He still expects that the revolution will triumph, and he won\u2019t live here long.If the Syrians end up in the camp for the statistically typical amount of time, her guess was probably the closest. Currently, the number of years a refugee lives in a refugee camp is, on average, 12. And many think that the conflict in Syria is likely to drag on for years. Even as militant groups have proliferated, and sectarian fighting has turned the country into a collection of warring factions, President Bashar al-Assad has announced he is considering running for re-election.\u201cWe hoped it was one month or two months,\u201d one family told me, as we sat in their trailer. \u201cWe wake up, we sleep, we wake up, we sleep, we eat food, we always watch TV to see what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re all very bored. There\u2019s no purpose in a life like this. One day is like another.\u201d The eight of them, from the Idlib countryside, a center of opposition in the north of the country, squirmed to make room for each other as we talked. As dark as their sentiments were, they smiled and gestured cheerfully.\u201cOur relatives are here,\u201d one of them explained when I commented on their composure. \u201cLife goes on. Maybe we cried for one day, two days, a week; you remember Syria sometimes and cry for it, but after that, what do you do? Life goes on.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard for us,\u201d said Basheer Alito, the section leader who was so effusive in his praise for the camp and the Turks. \u201cInside, we\u2019re unhappy. In my heart, it\u2019s temporary, not permanent.\u201d\u201cWhat if it was permanent?\u201d I asked him.Quickly, he answered, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to accept this.\u201dRouba Bakri, who told me Kilis was a perfect camp, acknowledged that keeping her spirits up was difficult. \u201cWe\u2019re trying our best,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re visiting relatives, volunteering, trying to keep busy. But it is nothing like a home.\u201dAnother Kilis resident, Mahmoud Joundah, agreed. \u201cThis is a five-star hotel,\u201d he said. Then with his next breath, \u201cWe\u2019re not happy here.\u201dThe U.N.H.C.R.'s Batchelor acknowledges that despite the high level of assistance in the camps, \u201cthe emotional protection has become quite a challenge.\u201cIn a noncamp setting,\u201d Batchelor went on to say, \u201cif people are able to keep themselves engaged, that provides a healthy outlook, helps establish local integration, keeps alive their skill sets if they repatriate.\u201d The longer a refugee resides in a camp, the harder it can become to sustain psychological well-being. But camps remain the default solution.\u201cRefugee camps have become the mechanism to try to control people,\u201d Fabos says. \u201cThey prevent them from interacting with your citizenry. There certainly have been cases where refugee camps are places where exiled political movements will train and collect arms and plan attacks. But it\u2019s also the case that refugee camps don\u2019t provide opportunities for livelihood. The aid is very small compared to the actual needs.\u201dThere are rumors, according to the Turkish official \u2014 that the government is considering blanket citizenship for the Syrians, who are politically aligned with and likely to vote for the ruling party. (Syrians can apply for citizenship but aren\u2019t given any special treatment; fewer than 800 were granted it last year.) Kirisci, of the Brookings Institution, dismissed the idea. \u201cNo one is going to naturalize one million people.\u201dWhen it comes to refugees in camps like Kilis, their relatively comfortable existence might make finding meaningful solutions for them less urgent. \u201cRefugees are not useful if they\u2019re not suffering,\u201d Fabos says. Manuel Herz, a professor of architecture in Switzerland who studies refugee-camp structure, knows well the dangers of building nice camps. Since 1975, Morocco has been occupying a small North African territory called Western Sahara, forcing half its Sahrawi population to flee to camps in Algeria. There they remain. Unlike almost all other host countries, Algeria gave its refugees the right to govern themselves. \u201cThere, camp is not a place of suffering and hunger,\u201d Herz says. But the flip side is that \u201cthere\u2019s very little pressure for Morocco to withdraw because people are not dying anymore.\u201dThough Syrians can now spend long periods massed on the border awaiting entry, in October the Turkish official assured me that regardless of the number of Syrians who arrive, they will be welcome. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to kick them out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a global responsibility. Even if the war ends tomorrow, they\u2019ll stay two or three more years because there\u2019s no infrastructure at home. We\u2019re prepared for them to stay for a long time.\u201dKirisci, who co-wrote a report on the camps late last year, agrees that it\u2019s unlikely the Turks will eject the Syrians or start treating them less hospitably. The Istanbul governor was trying to move urban refugees into camps. But even in the winter cold, they didn\u2019t want to go. After they were forced into one, they kept returning to their spots on the streets. \u201cThe refugees are recognizing that they are there to stay and don\u2019t want to risk living open-ended in camp,\u201d Kirisci says. \u201cThey\u2019d rather risk living in the wild.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Setting Aside Revealed Truth", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The journalist is a stranger who moves in the opposite direction from the crowd, toward danger, leaving the settled majority perplexed. Why, they ask, are you going over the lines? Why do you choose such a lonely existence? In search of a fair understanding, you say, and they shake their heads. There is nothing to understand, they insist, just write the truth!But truths are many and that is the problem. Memory is treacherous, as distinct from history as emotion from form. Every war is fought over memory. Violent nationalism is revived memory manipulated as revealed truth.Conflict is incubated in the contested \u201ctruths\u201d the past bequeaths. Questions swirl: Who came first to the land, who planted the millennial olive trees, who killed whom first, whether the church predates the mosque, and what of the synagogue that may precede them both?Identities are assembled piece by piece. Each drop of blood shed, each shrapnel scar on a wall, is annotated in the Book of Unforgiving. In the Balkans and the Middle East the events of a thousand years past can seem as vivid as yesterday\u2019s. The enemy imperatives of Serb and Kosovar, of Arab and Jew, can demand that memory, like the fuse for a bomb, be shaped for maximum explosive effect. Truces last no longer than a cheap umbrella in a storm.I first came face to face with the power of myth to generate war in the Balkans, at Kosovo Polje, or \u201cThe Field of Blackbirds,\u201d where the Serbs were routed by the Ottoman Turks in 1389. The battle has since become the lodestone of Serbian nationalism, a defeat transformed into a symbol of Serbian heroism and selfless sacrifice.Here, a quarter-century ago, as the Cold War order in Europe cracked, the Serbian nationalist leader, Slobodan Milosevic, declared: \u201cFor six centuries now, the heroism of Kosovo has inspired our creativity, fed our pride, and not allowed us to forget that once we were an army great, brave and proud, one of the few that in defeat stayed undefeated. Six centuries later, today, we are again in battles and facing battles. They are not armed, although such battles cannot be excluded yet.\u201dThe rest is now history: a decade of war; the dismemberment of Yugoslavia; the ethnic cleansing of wide swathes of Bosnia as its Muslims (often called \u201cTurks\u201d by the marauding Serbs) were processed through Serb concentration camps; more than 100,000 dead; Sarajevo and Srebrenica; the NATO intervention in Kosovo; and the contentious emergence of several newly independent European states, the last of them Kosovo in 2008. For Serbia, the adrenaline of nationalist frenzy turned into the slow drip of loss, none more painful than Kosovo, whose overwhelming majority is Albanian but whose landscape is dotted with sites sacred to Serbs.So, after all this, I had to rub my eyes at the Munich Security Conference, where the most extraordinary sight was that of Ivica Dacic, the Serbian prime minister, and Hashim Thaci, the prime minister of Kosovo, sitting together on the same stage, all smiles, talking about how they had reconciled and how, in the words of Thaci, \u201cthe greatest single difficulty was to liberate ourselves from the past.\u201dIsraelis and Palestinians, take note.Between the two Balkan leaders sat Catherine Ashton, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief and the world\u2019s most underrated diplomat. Her appointment in 2009 and the creation of the European External Action Service were much derided. But her successful mediation of Serb-Kosovar talks that began in 2011 and her contribution to securing an interim nuclear deal with Iran constitute major achievements. In the Balkans the \u201cpull factor\u201d of the European Union \u2014 its magnetic attraction to nations craving stability and freedom \u2014 has again been demonstrated. Serbia and Kosovo had to sort out their differences to stand a chance of getting in, and so they have. The maligned European Union is still a peacemaking machine.Normalization was not easy. Dacic was born in Kosovo. His people\u2019s feelings about the cradle of their civilization are passionate. He put the issue bluntly: Serbia believes Kosovo is part of Serbia. Kosovo does not. Kosovo is 90 percent Albanian. The Serbian economy has languished. \u201cWho can be in favor of such policies? It is up to us to decide if we move forward or stick to the past.\u201dSerbs and Kosovars have decided. They found an agreed degree of autonomy for the tens of thousands of Serbs in northern Kosovo. They opened for trade. They held free elections. They circumvented outstanding differences. They put themselves on the road to the European Union.Above all they set aside the potent symbolism of The Field of Blackbirds in favor of progress, discarded myth to discover commerce, and reasoned their way out of the prison of passionate certainties and revealed \u201ctruth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Let Putin Grab Ukraine", "Date": "2014-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIf the present crisis ends with the fragmentation of the Ukrainian state, the result will be disastrous for all concerned, including Russia. The risk is that, in conditions of chaos and in the absence of a decisive Western stance, Russia could follow the logic of its current commitments to a very dangerous conclusion.Unlike Europe and the United States, Russia has a clear stance on Ukraine. Vladimir Putin\u2019s hope for the future is his Eurasian Union, to be established next January as a rival to the European Union. Belarusian and Kazakh strongmen are game to join his dictators\u2019 club. But since the idea has little popular support anywhere, Eurasian integration can take place only in conditions of Russian domination and local dictatorship. For Mr. Putin, the Eurasian Union would be meaningless without Ukraine. Eurasian ideology is the brainchild of Alexander Dugin, who has never disguised his admiration of fascism. His website publishes Russian strategists who claim that Ukraine is not a sovereign state.The current crisis in Ukraine began because of Russian foreign policy. The Ukrainian government, led by Viktor Yanukovych, seemed poised to sign a popular association agreement with the European Union. Mr. Putin jumped in quickly with cash and low gas prices for Mr. Yanukovych, who then abruptly changed course, refusing to sign it. Because Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s family has amassed unbelievable wealth during his presidency, he might also have been concerned about the possibility that the European Union would bring the rule of law. This would not be a risk in the Eurasian Union.Since late November, millions of Ukrainians have campaigned for a pro-European course, only to find themselves branded extremists, foreign agents and criminals. With the Russian money came the Russian model of rule. Yanukovych had the Parliament illegally \u201cpass\u201d legislation that made Ukraine a dictatorship on Jan. 16.The new laws were imitations of Russian ones. But Ukraine is not Russia. Too many Ukrainians have tasted too much freedom for too long. The people resisted this sudden attempt at tyranny. Mr. Yanukovych lost control over local institutions of power, and last week made gestures toward the opposition by accepting the resignation of an unpopular prime minister and reversing some dictatorial laws. But grotesque repression continues under a ministry of internal affairs with close ties to Russia, and the military\u2019s leadership is making noises about \u201cstability.\u201dIf Russia does intervene again, the next stage might be an internal coup, where pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians take power, perhaps retaining Mr. Yanukovych as a figurehead. The Ukrainian politicians responsible for the violence depend on Russian intervention for their political survival. If Russia supports an internal coup in Ukraine, resistance will only increase.Russia could engineer a coup in Ukraine out of sheer nervousness and lack of better ideas, in the vague hope that the Eurasian dream can somehow be rescued for Mr. Putin. But if and when the Russian puppets fail, Mr. Putin would face a choice between armed intervention and loss of face. The use of Russian arms in Ukraine would probably lead to massive bloodshed, but not to a favorable outcome for Moscow. Even if Russia could win a quick war, which is unlikely, underground resistance would continue.The European Union and the present Ukrainian leadership must strike a deal \u2014 and quickly. The remaining dictatorship laws must be repealed and a full amnesty granted to opposition activists. International organizations such as Doctors Without Borders should be given a list of those arrested and allowed to visit the wounded. Parliamentary democracy should be restored on the model of the 2004 Ukrainian Constitution, and new presidential and parliamentary elections must be held. The way out of the crisis is a return to Ukrainian democracy. Mr. Yanukovych was elected, but has since illegally changed the system in ways that undermine its legitimacy.With a fresh start and new elections, Ukrainians could decide for themselves whether they prefer Europe or Eurasia. From its side, the European Union could renew talks over an association agreement, and offer some immediate loans. If democracy is restored in Ukraine, the Ukrainian economy would no doubt be hurt by the end of Russian loans and by Russian trade boycotts. But European countries can buy whatever products Russia boycotts and, in the long run, trade with Europe is more important than trade with Russia.This is a test for the European Union. The Ukrainian leaders who organize violence and keep close ties with Russia are already in Europe \u2014 with their diplomatic passports, bank accounts, front companies, residences and lobbyists. The real question is whether oligarchy or inclusion is the future of Europe.If the European Union does not act and there is a Russian-backed internal coup in Ukraine, the likely consequences are military disaster for Russia and political crisis in the European Union. If European diplomats can broker a solution, Russian diplomats and pundits will protest that Ukrainian democracy is nothing but Western meddling. But in their hearts, most Russians, if perhaps not quite all, will be relieved.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Buffalo Banks on a Hockey-Centered Development to Boost Civic Rebirth", "Date": "2014-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUFFALO \u2014 Amid the maze of scaffolding and the diesel-engine rumble of construction taking place immediately outside the Buffalo Sabres\u2019 downtown arena, Dave Ogrean didn\u2019t need to see the finished product to envision HarborCenter\u2019s transformational potential for the city and for hockey.To Ogrean, the executive director for USA Hockey, the Sabres-backed facility represents the future of the sport that he oversees.\u201cThis is going to become a mecca of sorts,\u201d Ogrean said during a recent visit to Buffalo. \u201cI don\u2019t even think they know yet everything that they might do. But the potential is enormous.\u201dIn a rust belt city renowned for chicken wings and harsh winters, Buffalo is poised to add something more substantial to its reputation by branding itself as a hockey destination.HarborCenter, so named because of its proximity to Buffalo\u2019s redeveloping harbor front overlooking Lake Erie, is a $172 million hockey and entertainment complex being privately funded by the Sabres\u2019 owner, Terry Pegula, a natural gas magnate from Pennsylvania.It is Pegula\u2019s gift to the city he adopted since buying the Sabres three years ago, and it is a project that falls in line with his objective of raising hockey\u2019s profile across the United States.Once completed in the spring of 2015, HarborCenter will feature two rinks taking up much of the sixth and seventh floors of the building; 11 locker rooms; a state-of-the-art, 3,200-square-foot training facility; a hockey academy that will include classroom and meeting spaces; and a 200-room hotel \u2014 all of which will be connected to the Sabres\u2019 home, First Niagara Center.Having three N.H.L.-size rinks linked together, along with a training center, leads Ogrean to call HarborCenter a first-of-its-kind hockey facility in the United States and has prompted him to strengthen USA Hockey\u2019s ties with the Sabres.\u201cThis is going to be a complex unlike any other,\u201d Ogrean said. \u201cI think this is a city where we are going to be coming back more and more frequently.\u201dUSA Hockey has already pegged Buffalo to host its annual All-American Prospects game in each of the next two years. Ogrean also indicated Buffalo would be a prime contender to host numerous other events, including the 2018 World Junior Championships.The city had already been on USA Hockey\u2019s radar after the 2011 world juniors in Buffalo drew more than 330,000 fans, the tournament\u2019s largest turnout on American soil.The N.H.L. has also taken notice.Last month, Commissioner Gary Bettman said that because of HarborCenter, the league is seriously considering the Sabres\u2019 pitch to relocate the N.H.L.\u2019s annual predraft scouting combine from Toronto to Buffalo.\u201cListen, it\u2019s an extraordinary investment in both Buffalo and hockey,\u201d Bettman said. \u201cWe have been extraordinarily fortunate to have Terry Pegula come in because not only is he investing in the Sabres, he\u2019s investing in hockey and he\u2019s investing in the community with HarborCenter.\u201dThough Detroit bills itself as Hockeytown, Buffalo continues to hold firm as one of America\u2019s hockey hotbeds.Buffalo has traditionally ranked as one of the nation\u2019s top-five TV hockey-viewing markets.The city\u2019s proximity to Canada also serves as an ideal bridge to hockey. That was particularly evident three years ago, when tens of thousands of Canadians flocked to Buffalo to attend the 11-day world junior tournament.HarborCenter has the potential to further capitalize on that connection by luring teams from across the border to play, something not lost on Buffalo\u2019s business community.\u201cWe really are hitching our wagon to the powerhouse economy that is the Canadian market in Toronto, and hockey is one of these commonalities,\u201d the Buffalo-Niagara Partnership\u2019s president and chief executive, Dottie Gallagher-Cohen, said. \u201cOther than beer, one of the big things that joins us is hockey. So anything that positions Buffalo as America\u2019s hockey capital reinforces the relationship we want to build with Canada.\u201dThat is certainly the intention of John Koelmel, HarborCenter\u2019s president.Aside from HarborCenter serving as the new home of Canisius College\u2019s Division I hockey program, Koelmel expects that the facility will host events \u2014 tournaments, seminars and clinics \u2014 on a year-round basis.\u201cThe destination itself will have a tremendous impact,\u201d Koelmel said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to get people to come and stay, spend their money and spend their time. We\u2019re building this so they\u2019ll do more than drive by.\u201dHarborCenter\u2019s construction comes at a time when Buffalo is showing signs of a turnaround. The city is turning into a medical hub, with a large research campus being built at the north end of downtown. And HarborCenter is going up in an area where work is already being done to restore parts of Erie Canal as a tourist attraction.Now comes hockey.\u201cI don\u2019t have a catchphrase for it yet, but that\u2019s where I use \u2018All hockey paths will lead through Buffalo,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Koelmel said. \u201cI really think we have a chance to establish ourselves as a real hub in the hub-and-spokes world of hockey.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Newcomers in Bidding Fight for Catskills Casino Weigh Site Closer to New York City", "Date": "2014-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe battle to build a potentially lucrative $500 million casino resort amid the wooded hills and craggy economy of the Catskills has been a gentlemanly affair, with a half-dozen rivals gently competing for one, if not two state licenses for the region.But the comity is cracking under the threat of interlopers.In a surprising move, three newcomers to the competition are now considering building casinos on the Catskills\u2019 southern flank, at a location that is far closer to what all the operators believe would be their lifeblood: densely packed New York City, with its 8.3 million residents and 52 million tourists a year.Indeed, one newcomer, a partnership of Cordish Companies, Hard Rock and Simon Property Group, is looking at a site near Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, a sprawling mall in Orange County. It attracts over 11 million visitors a year, making it one of the state\u2019s biggest tourist attractions. A casino there would be a mere 49 miles from Times Square, compared with the 90-mile trek to possible casino sites in Sullivan and Ulster Counties.Developers and gambling companies with proposals for casino-resorts in Ellenville, Liberty and Monticello are attacking the prospect of a casino in Orange County, saying it would severely hurt their ability to finance construction of major resorts in less economically prosperous areas.\u201cIt would dramatically affect, if not eliminate, the Nevele project,\u201d said Michael R. Treanor, who has proposed building a $500 million casino resort at the former Nevele hotel in Ulster County. \u201cWhy would anyone feel the need to go further? It would take southern Ulster County and Sullivan County out of contention.\u201dAt the same time, the developers said, a casino would undermine Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s stated goal of using gambling to bring economic development and tourism to upstate counties with high unemployment and few job prospects, like Sullivan County.\u201cIt would be a devastating blow to everyone who\u2019s been trying to revive Sullivan County for the past 40 years,\u201d said Louis Cappelli, a developer who is seeking to build a $550 million casino resort in Monticello, at the former site of a borscht belt hotel, the Concord. \u201cIt would cut us off from the supply of patrons.\u201dDevelopers, gambling companies and elected officials have sought to lure a commercial or Indian casino to Sullivan County since the 1970s. The area, where 500 hotels and bungalow colonies once served visitors from New York City, had fallen on hard times after vacation habits changed.Next month, the State Gaming Commission is expected to officially begin soliciting proposals for up to four full-scale casinos north of Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties. The casinos would be for three regions: the Catskills and the Hudson Valley; the Saratoga region; and a narrow strip in western New York running from Binghamton north to the Canadian border.Mr. Cuomo has promised that the gambling resorts would attract tourists to upstate New York, generating economic activity and jobs \u201cwhere we need it most.\u201dAsked whether Orange County needed the economic activity, Lee Park, a spokesman for the Gaming Commission, said only that the process of selecting sites for casinos would be competitive.The Catskills area, which is expected to get two of the four licenses, has attracted the greatest attention from developers and gambling companies because of the region\u2019s proximity to New York City. And with the review process about to begin, the competition and tension are mounting.\u201cAs it moves forward, there\u2019ll be no shortage of bad blood, sniping and hired guns,\u201d said John D. Sabini, a gambling consultant and former chairman of the State Racing and Wagering Board. \u201cIt\u2019ll get ugly because the stakes are so high. People have already spent millions of their own money.\u201dCordish and Hard Rock built the Maryland Live Casino at Simon Property\u2019s Arundel Mills Mall in Hanover, Md., and are proposing a similar project in New York.Mr. Neuhaus did not dispute that his county was in far better economic condition than Sullivan, where the unemployment rate is almost 8 percent, and that his northern neighbor should get a casino. But, he added, Orange remains a better location.\u201cAt the end of the day, the government isn\u2019t doing this to make an Indian tribe happy or anything else,\u201d Mr. Neuhaus said. \u201cIt\u2019s about maximizing economic development.\u201dEric Schippers, a spokesman for Penn National Gaming, which operates more than 20 casinos nationally, confirmed on Monday that his company was looking at sites in Orange County, as well as in other regions.But elected officials and gambling executives to the north are irate. \u201cI understand why developers want it,\u201d said Scott B. Samuelson, the Sullivan County executive. \u201cBut I think it goes against the legislation and the governor\u2019s intent.\u201dThey suggest that Orange County is not really part of the Catskills. Several developers insist that they have the necessary public approvals that would allow them to meet the state\u2019s desire to have the casinos up and running within two years. Orange County projects, they say, would have to wend their way through the review process and contend with opposition from religious groups and environmentalists.\u201cThe goal is not to build an economic dam between downstate and upstate, which is basically what a casino in Orange County would do,\u201d said Charles Degliomini, a spokesman for Empire Resorts, which is proposing to build a $600 million complex on 1,700 acres near Monticello. \u201cWe are the only resort and casino property that already cleared most of the permit requirements, has secured community support and promises to bring economic development to what is widely recognized as upstate New York.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a man who proposed building a casino resort in Ulster County. He is Michael R. Treanor, not Trainor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Innovation, Optimism and Jobs", "Date": "2014-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIs digital technology destroying middle-class jobs? Does it exacerbate income inequality? Does it boost economic growth and productivity \u2014 without creating the jobs that ought to come with economic growth?In some ways, \u201cThe Second Machine Age\u201d is an odd book. For the most part, its tone is one of sunny optimism about all the wonderful things technology will soon bring us, from driverless cars to more powerful forms of artificial intelligence. \u201cInnovation,\u201d they write, is the \u201cmost important force that makes our society wealthier.\u201d The authors believe that we are at a moment when technological innovation is about to accelerate, and make the world much wealthier, just as the Industrial Revolution did 250 years ago.Yet buried in their sunny prose is a darker forecast: that while this digital revolution will be great for innovators, entrepreneurs and other creative people, not everyone will participate \u2014 especially those who do jobs that software can do better. The authors label the good that technology will do \u201cthe bounty.\u201d The downside they call \u201cthe spread.\u201dNot everybody buys the technology-is-going-to-change-everything mantra espoused by Brynjolfsson and McAfee. Robert J. Gordon, a macroeconomist at Northwestern University, calls them \u201ctechno-optimists.\u201d In his view, the next 40 years of innovation is not going to look much different from the past 40 years, which he believes haven\u2019t been nearly as transformative or wealth-creating as the discovery of electricity and the invention of the light bulb.Unlike Brynjolfsson and McAfee, Gordon believes that economic growth is going to be anemic for years to come, and that, he says, has nothing to do with the rate of technological innovation. Rather, he describes a series of \u201cheadwinds\u201d facing the American economy: a stagnant educational system and income inequality, for starters. When I asked him whether future innovation would cost jobs, he said he thought it would, but no more or less than has always been the case. In truth, it is probably too early to know whether this round of technological innovation will ultimately cost or create jobs. The history of innovation has also been a history of job creation \u2014 though not necessarily right away. After people figured out how to harness electricity, it took decades before businessmen figured out how to maximize its use in factories. It also required both behavioral and governmental change. People had to abandon farms, move to cities and undertake very different kinds of lives. Factories used children as workers, until governments passed child labor laws.In America, as the country became industrialized, free education became the law of the land. It was one of the greatest policy decisions ever. The authors of \u201cThe Second Machine Age\u201d contend that we don\u2019t have to be \u201ctech determinists,\u201d as Brynjolfsson put it when we spoke; we also have the ability to take control of our destiny rather than letting technology take control of us. On Friday, I called Tyler Cowen, the George Mason University economist (and a contributor to The New York Times) to ask what he thought about the relationship between technological innovation and jobs. He told me that he mostly agreed with Brynjolfsson and McAfee about the future, though he disagreed with their assessment of the past. (One of his recent books is titled \u201cThe Great Stagnation.\u201d) Yes, he said, technology would replace humans for certain kinds of jobs, but he could also envision growth in the service sector. \u201cThe jobs will be better than they sound,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of them will require skill and training, and will also pay well. I think we\u2019ll get to driverless cars and much better versions of Siri fairly soon,\u201d he added. \u201cThat will make the rate of labor force participation go down.\u201dThen he chuckled. He had recently been in a meeting with someone, explaining his views. \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying,\u201d the man concluded, \u201cis that the pessimists are right. But it\u2019s going to be much better than they think.\u201d Charles M. Blow and Gail Collins are off today. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. and Europe Work on Aid Package for Ukraine", "Date": "2014-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Looking to defuse Ukraine\u2019s crisis, the United States and Europe are trying to assemble a financial package that could ease the path for a new government there to guide the country out of its current impasse between Europe and Russia, American and European officials say.With the start of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, this week, European and American officials say they may have a window of opportunity and some breathing space through the end of February to play a defining role in Ukraine while President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is engaged in ensuring the success of an event that will draw global attention.On Monday, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive body, said that the bloc was trying to help Ukraine, but denied that there was any direct competition with Russia.\u201cWe are not going to a bidding competition of who pays more for a signature from Ukraine, because we believe that this is the path that most Ukrainians prefer,\u201d Mr. Barroso said in Brussels. \u201cThey want to come closer to the European Union, and certainly we are ready to support that.\u201dSenior American and European officials, speaking in Berlin and on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference last weekend, said they would try to assemble a financial package to help a new government, though one led by an opposition leader or a technocrat.The diplomatic effort appears aimed to help the Ukrainian leader and his opponents reach an agreement in their negotiations that would give Ukraine a government of experts, possibly led by an opposition leader, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, as well as a leadership that would be acceptable to protesters who have been on the streets for more than two months.At the same time, the negotiations appear intended to allow Mr. Yanukovych to serve out his term, which ends in the spring next year, albeit with reduced constitutional powers.As part of the inducements, the financial package by the Western officials, if a new government is approved, would be intended to get the highly indebted country through a transition period and allow it to carry out an economic overhaul that is a prerequisite for receiving a long-delayed loan from the International Monetary Fund.All involved emphasized that given the volatility of Ukraine\u2019s politics since the country gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, there is no guarantee of success. Moscow remains an important player, bound by centuries of history to Kiev, and is Ukraine\u2019s chief energy provider.Those laws were overturned by a parliamentary vote last week, but progress on an amnesty law for jailed protesters was then stymied by Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s suddenly taking a sick leave. He returned to work on Monday.A stream of Western officials have visited Kiev or made their concern known to Ukrainian and Russian officials. Catherine Ashton, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, was scheduled to return there on Tuesday, while Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, will visit the Ukrainian capital on Thursday.Any aid package \u201cis very much a work in progress,\u201d Maja Kocijancic, a spokeswoman for Ms. Ashton, said on Monday.During the Munich conference, Secretary of State John Kerry and senior aides met with the Ukrainian opposition figures Vitali Klitschko, Petro Poroshenko and Mr. Yatsenyuk, as did the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier.Late last month, Mr. Yatsenyuk turned down an offer from the Ukrainian president to serve as prime minister, citing the need for real power over the flailing national economy.In the carousel that has been Ukrainian politics, Mr. Yatsenyuk has already served as foreign and economy minister and governor of the central bank. In an interview in December, he made plain that 12 years of dealing with Mr. Yanukovych had convinced him that the president was a tactician who would never voluntarily relinquish power, and would say or promise anything in maneuvering to keep it.However, the president\u2019s room for such moves has narrowed, and it is in that space that foreign officials and the forces in Ukraine are seeking a solution to stave off more violence and economic pain in the country of 46 million people.Any financial package would be crucial, given Moscow\u2019s offer of a sizable sum to Kiev after its rejection of the agreement with Europe. \u201cThese discussions are just at the beginning,\u201d one European official said in Munich, adding that Mr. Yanukovych was \u201cstill playing for time,\u201d despite last week\u2019s blunt demand from the German foreign minister to stop moving so slowly.An article on Tuesday about efforts by the United States and Europe to assemble an aid package for Ukraine misstated the middle initial of the Russian foreign minister in some editions. He is Sergey V. Lavrov, not Sergey P.Alison Smale reported from Berlin, and Steven Erlanger from Munich and London. David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Meeting, Republicans Seem Unsure of Way Forward", "Date": "2014-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAMBRIDGE, Md. \u2014 House Republicans ended a three-day retreat here united in their division. They agreed they wanted to \u201cgo big\u201d with a midterm election agenda that would give voters a clear choice, and not simply be a campaign focused on their criticism of President Obama.\u201cHow else do you project a bold alternative option for the country?\u201d asked Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, an influential conservative.At that point, things became less clear. They could not coalesce around their approach on overhauling the immigration laws, increasing the nation\u2019s borrowing limit, providing an alternative to the Affordable Care Act or whether to press forward with a rewrite of the tax code.House Republican leaders had cautioned that final decisions were not likely to be made at the conference, and they were right. One House Republican conceded ideas were \u201call over the map.\u201d\u201cStill some work to do here,\u201d said Representative Reid Ribble, Republican of Wisconsin, after a lengthy discussion of the impending debt-ceiling showdown.Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, did promise a vote on a health care alternative this year, the closest thing to a decision. Yet House members say he left it unclear whether the vote would be on a full-scale replacement for the health care law, or a less comprehensive measure.On the debt ceiling, there was movement even if it stopped short of a decision, as some of the House\u2019s most ardent conservatives signaled they were ready go along with their leadership and avoid a default. This represents a change of position for many Republicans who, since 2011, have maintained that freezing the debt limit would not bring the economic disaster most economists foresee. Doug Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist and a former Congressional Budget Office director, opened the session with an explanation of why Congress must raise the borrowing threshold.If Republicans want to extract even minor concessions, they will have to move soon, within the next seven to 10 days, aides said, because attaching any conditions will precipitate a fight with the Senate with fewer than 28 days until default. But no deadline was set. Democrats, led by Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, have held firm that they will not accept any concessions attached to a debt-limit increase.\u201cThe more time Republicans spend dreaming up their latest debt limit wish list, the closer they are pushing workers and the economy toward another completely unnecessary crisis,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. \u201cThe American people are sick and tired of Republicans playing games with our economic recovery, and Democrats have made it clear that Republicans don\u2019t get to demand a ransom simply for allowing Congress to do its job.\u201dRepublicans do appear ready to coalesce around legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a Republican alternative, despite concerns that such legislation will give Democrats a chance to go on the offensive over health care.Senators Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Orrin Hatch of Utah and Richard Burr of North Carolina released their alternative framework on Monday, which emphasizes having patients assume more out-of-pocket costs to encourage more cautious health care consumption, allows businesses to band together to bargain for lower-cost insurance, caps the employer tax deduction for health care and relaxes coverage requirements in the president\u2019s law.Democrats immediately attacked the plan for allowing substandard insurance policies and leaving many people with pre-existing conditions unprotected.Mr. Burr stood by the effort in the face of some Republican criticism that the party should focus on criticizing the president\u2019s law, not diluting the line of attack by producing an alternative.\u201cThere are many Republican members that felt just having a target was a pretty good election year issue,\u201d Mr. Burr said. \u201cFor Orrin and Tom and I, we\u2019re policy wonks. We believe that if you wait another year to start this debate about alternatives, you\u2019ve done so much damage, some of it will be irreparable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hitler\u2019s Germany, Seen Through Young Eyes", "Date": "2014-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesIn 1936, Joachim Fest, 10 at the time, was summoned by his father, Johannes, to come with his older brother for a heart-to-heart talk in the study of their house in Berlin. Johannes Fest, an active member of the Zentrum, a conservative Roman Catholic party, had been removed from his post as an elementary school headmaster almost immediately after Hitler came to power in 1933. The family had struggled with social isolation and economic hardship ever since. Explaining his position, he instructed his sons to write down a Latin phrase: \u201cEtiam si omnes \u2014 ego non\u201d (\u201cEven if all the others do \u2014 I will not\u201d). The words, he told them, came from an episode in the Gospel of St. Matthew, in which Peter assures Jesus, in the Garden of Olives, that he will never renounce him. The quotation put a biblical stamp on the family\u2019s policy toward the regime and provided Joachim Fest, later an eminent historian of the Third Reich and a Hitler biographer, with the title of his quietly compelling, elegantly expressed memoir, \u201cNot I\u201d (in German, \u201cIch Nicht\u201d). The betrayal of this touching faith helps account for Mr. Fest\u2019s bitter undertone, leavened by the biting humor that his father regarded as an important component of the Prussian character, just as important as the renowned sense of duty. \u201cJust don\u2019t forget irony,\u201d he was fond of telling his children. \u201cIt\u2019s the entry ticket to humanity.\u201d Another bit of fatherly advice was \u201cEndure the clowns!\u201d \u201cNot I\u201d shrinks the Wagnerian scale of German history in the 1930s and 1940s to chamber music dimensions. It is intensely personal, cleareyed and absolutely riveting, partly because the author, thrust into an outsider\u2019s position, developed a keen appreciation of Germany\u2019s contradictions and paradoxes. Mr. Fest registers, in a few deft strokes, the changing mood in the streets around the family home in the well-to-do neighborhood of Karlshorst. His antenna began to quiver with the collapse of the Weimar Republic, when frantic comings and goings at home and snatches of worried conversations made a confused but vivid impression on him and his older brother. \u201cHowever little we understood of what we overheard, we nevertheless felt the atmosphere of embittered passion that was not only spreading in the streets but also surrounded every visitor to the apartment,\u201d he writes. Former acquaintances and shopkeepers began pointedly turning their backs on the Fests, and the regime\u2019s long reach began to be felt. The family learned to put up with Block Warden Fengler, a pest who turned up on random Sundays to peek at the stove and make sure that dinner was the no-frills hot pot required by Nazi austerity regulations. Mr. Fest\u2019s mother began calling him \u201cthe little man with the big mouth.\u201d Mr. Fest\u2019s parents did their best to maintain a normal family life for the sake of the children, although dinner had to be organized in two seatings, one for the three boys, judged old enough to hear talk of politics and current events, and another for their two young sisters. Mr. Fest\u2019s mother tried to put on a brave face. \u201c\u00a0\u2018The situation has one advantage,\u2019 she would remark to us,\u201d Mr. Fest writes. \u201c\u00a0\u2018You can never be spoiled!\u2019\u00a0\u201d In private, she begged her husband to keep his views to himself and go through the formality of joining the Nazi Party, pleading that white lies had always been the weapon used by the \u201clittle people\u201d against the powerful. \u201cWe are not little people,\u201d her husband answered. \u201cNot when it comes to such questions!\u201d Normal life pokes through. Long sections of the book describe the pleasures that even totalitarian societies cannot poison. Mr. Fest writes of summer vacations on his uncle\u2019s farm, childhood friendships and his passionate engagement with the poets, painters and composers who nourished the soul in an era of spiritual poverty.They provide a happy counterpoint to the gripping pages in which the author recounts his brief but harrowing combat experience, his capture by American forces and his sojourn in a prisoner-of-war camp, from which he tries to make a daring escape.Mr. Fest\u2019s style, as rendered by the translator Martin Chalmers, is understated and urbane. Herbert A. Arnold, an emeritus professor at Wesleyan University, provides an informative introduction that explains the sociopolitical status of the Fests, as well as the author\u2019s postwar career, which gets underway after the memoir draws to a close in the late 1940s.Professor Arnold also writes most of the book\u2019s many footnotes. Some are helpful when it comes to topical references and the myriad minor poets Mr. Fest mentions along the way, but others are oddly placed or intrusively judgmental. Definitions for Bildungsb\u00fcrger and Reichsbanner, a paramilitary force supported by the Zentrum party, show up pages after their first appearance, and Mr. Fest gets an unexpected scolding, in one note, for criticizing left-wing Germans like G\u00fcnter Grass as moral grandstanders. Mr. Fest saves one of his choicest morsels for the end. After the war, his father ran into Block Warden Fengler. A strange conversation ensued in which the warden admitted that it was he who had called anonymously one day to warn of an impending visit by the Gestapo. Asked for an explanation, he replied, \u201cPerhaps because it was the decent thing to do.\u201d\nNOT I\n\nMemoirs of a German Childhood\n\nBy Joachim Fest\nTranslated by Martin Chalmers.

The crowds in Tripoli, the capital, appeared undaunted even when a small car bomb exploded just yards from Martyrs\u2019 Square. The front seats of the car were damaged, but no one was wounded.\u201cIt means everything to me and to the Libyans,\u201d said Abdul Hedi al-Kikli, 58, who took his family three years ago and went to join rebels in the mountains. \u201cWe may have some negativity now, but it will not last,\u201d Mr. Kikli said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the situation now. What we have done is lay the foundations for change. It is for the next generation, even if our generation might not know democracy.\u201dIn Tajura, an area on the outskirts of Tripoli that was one of the first around the capital where citizens protested against the Qaddafi government, the mood remains wholeheartedly in support of the revolution. Amid the bunting on the main square, organizers posted images of 60 men and women who died in the uprising.The authorities chose Feb. 17, when the first demonstrations were planned in 2011, to commemorate the uprising, though they could have chosen one of a number of days. For example, protesters in the eastern town of Benghazi came out on Feb. 15 and began clashing with the police.Three days later, in Tajura, young people began milling around outside the small, glass-fronted Morning Light Cafe. \u201cIt began here, yes,\u201d said Saleh al-Turki, 33, who was among the protesters. \u201cPeople were talking about demonstrating in support of the people of Benghazi.\u201d As men emerged from the mosques after evening prayers, the crowd swelled and began marching.\u201cWe began chanting, \u2018With our blood, our souls, we sacrifice ourselves, Benghazi!\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Turki recalled. \u201cBy the time we got to the roundabout we were chanting, \u2018No more fear, Tajura, real men died in Benghazi.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe first casualty in the district was a person shot by the police on Feb. 19, and a larger crowd turned out for the funeral the next day. On Feb. 25, protesters were in the streets for four hours and marched to the neighboring Souk al-Juma district. \u201cIt was a peaceful protest, but they were shooting at us,\u201d Mr. Turki said.The police crackdown that followed was harsh. The marchers were dispersed with live gunfire, and hundreds were arrested as tanks and police vehicles blockaded the area. Six months of underground operations followed as protesters tried covert resistance, knocking out street lamps and going out at night to put up graffiti and revolutionary flags. \u201cWe would freeze flags into a ball and put them up,\u201d Ahmed Tantoush, 38, a former rebel, said with a grin. \u201cWhen they melted, they would unfurl.\u201d The protesters also threw small bombs at police patrols, he said.After several months, some weapons were smuggled into Tajura, but the protesters say they never had the strength to attack the security forces. It was only when rebels reached the capital, six months after the uprising began, that Colonel Qaddafi and his supporters were forced out. That day, the people of Tajura came out and took control of their district.Not everyone was celebrating on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m going back home. I don\u2019t like the government,\u201d Mr. Turki said. \u201cThe economy is asleep. There are no companies working.\u201dHis friend Tareq al-Swaie, 23, added: \u201cThe first two years we were hoping for things to get better, but now we are disappointed. Maybe they should be bringing in foreign companies. But if you are afraid in your own country, how can you expect foreigners to come in?\u201dAlmost everyone agrees that the greatest gains from the revolution are freedom from tyranny and freedom of speech. \u201cFirst of all, we can speak freely,\u201d said one woman, Amna Ali, a teacher who came to Tripoli from western Libya for the celebrations. \u201cWe are not afraid to speak our minds.\u201dBefore the uprising, \u201cyou could not say anything,\u201d said Adel Lootfi, 34, a military policeman. \u201cIf you did, you might disappear.\u201d Now, though, he is quick with a list of complaints about the country\u2019s current leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s been three years, and they have not done anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need infrastructure, better jobs. We don\u2019t have good airports.\u201dLike several of those interviewed who had fought against Colonel Qaddafi, Mr. Lootfi said he wanted a strong ruler, instead of the exiles who returned to serve in the government. \u201cWe need someone who is not from abroad, someone who understands Libyans,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people need someone who is tough.\u201dOmar Saleh, 35, a former revolutionary from the district of Feshloom, said: \u201cChange is not easy. It takes time to change the mentality.\u201d \u201cFor me,\u201d Mr. Saleh said, \u201cthe most important thing is to build the human being to respect the law and institutions, and then you will have people able to live in a democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "France and the Fate of the European Welfare State", "Date": "2014-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From EuropeLONDON \u2014 During a recent dinner, the Nobel laureate economist Christopher Pissarides proposed in jest that the euro area stamp half its bank notes with the word \u201csouth\u201d and run two parallel currencies: one for the prudent northern half of the bloc, the other for the Latin south. \u201cFrance,\u201d he asserted, \u201cbelongs to the south.\u201dMr. Pissarides, a professor at the London School of Economics, was not referring to the fact that the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, had just been caught having a rather Latin love affair with an actress. Rather, he was talking about unit labor costs in France rising faster than those in Greece; a ratio of debt to gross domestic product above Spain\u2019s; and youth unemployment levels in some of France\u2019s ethnically mixed suburbs looking almost Italian.One question focusing European minds in 2014 is this: Will France arrest its slide into the Continent\u2019s second division?Mr. Hollande\u2019s finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, insists that the president is aware of the urgency.\u201cAt the end of last year, he realized he had a clear choice,\u201d Mr. Moscovici recalled in a recent interview. \u201cEither we continue as before or we make the historic changes to bring our social system into the 21st century.\u201dUntil recently, France often appeared to be moving backward. Mr. Hollande lowered the minimum retirement age to 60. Germany and Greece have raised it to 67. But the tone in Paris has changed. Last month, the president announced a \u201cresponsibility pact,\u201d promising to reduce labor costs by 30 billion euros, or $41 billion. In return, companies have to commit to step up hiring.\u201cThe most ambitious labor market reform in 40 years,\u201d as Mr. Moscovici calls it, comes on top of an earlier promise to cut public spending by \u20ac50 billion and reduce the public deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2015.Business has started to listen.\u201cThere is a new determination,\u201d said Virginie Morgon, chief operating officer at Eurazeo, a private equity company. Even Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy and fond of calling France \u201cthe sick man of Europe,\u201d said Mr. Hollande \u201cis talking the talk in a rather unusual manner for a Socialist government.\u201dMost observers agree: It will take a Socialist to change the French welfare state. But Mr. Schr\u00f6der reformed during a boom. Mr. Hollande is dealing with the fallout from the Great Recession.\u201cStructural reforms,\u201d Mr. Spiro said, \u201care that much harder when the French economy is on its knees.\u201dCutting costs for companies is not enough, he said. Raising the retirement age and challenging the notion of highly protected permanent work contracts would go some way toward that sweet spot of Scandinavian-style flexibility-cum-solidarity France claims it wants to emulate.Making it easier to fire people?\u201cSome people dream of France becoming an Anglo-Saxon country,\u201d Mr. Moscovici said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we are, and that\u2019s not what we want to be.\u201dMs. Morgon, the private equity executive, had a different take: \u201cWe have to change the system precisely so we can preserve it and stay true to what we are.\u201dFrance has a lot going for it, not least birthrates near replacement level, impressive infrastructure, good engineers, and social mobility that while declining is still higher than in the United States or Britain. Joking aside, it is also the only country in Europe that straddles the butter-eating, beer-drinking north and the olive-oil-guzzling, wine-sipping south of the Continent.When Mr. Hollande was photographed riding a scooter to the apartment of the actress Julie Gayet last month, his helmet\u2019s visor was apparently down. His \u201csensible\u201d shoes gave him away.As one French official put it: \u201cGoing forward, we want to focus less on the actress and more on the sensible shoes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Manufacturing Activity Contracts Again in China", "Date": "2014-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Activity in China\u2019s factories shrank again in February, a preliminary private survey found on Thursday, reinforcing concerns about a minor slowdown in the economy and unsettling markets across the region.The flash Markit/HSBC purchasing managers\u2019 index fell to a seven-month low of 48.3 in February from January\u2019s final reading of 49.5. A reading below 50 indicates contraction while one above shows expansion.The Lunar New Year festival, which began on Jan. 31 and continued into early February, is likely to have affected factory output as manufacturers shut up shop for the holiday.The Shanghai Composite share index gave up early gains on the news, ending the day 0.2 percent lower.Some analysts cautioned against reading too much into the report, noting that it was a snapshot of activity in a shorter-than-usual period because of the holiday, and that other indicators have been stronger.\u201cMacro numbers from national statistics agencies so far painted a mixed picture, with trade growth and credit expansion above market estimates,\u201d two economists, Ting Lu and Xiaojia Zhi, based in Hong Kong for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a note. \u201cAt the moment, visibility of short-term growth momentum is quite low.\u201dThe report\u2019s employment subindex fell for a fourth consecutive month, to 46.9, its lowest point since February 2009, during the global financial crisis. The jobs subindex is one of the few indicators that measures the health of China\u2019s labor market, an area of priority for Beijing, which wants to keep unemployment low to maintain social stability.Other analysts said the weak numbers would encourage the government to loosen monetary policy to keep the economy growing at 7.5 percent, a level many in the market believe China will try to achieve this year.The economist Zhiwei Zhang at the Hong Kong office of Nomura said that he expected a lowering of the required reserve ratio, which sets how much cash a bank must hold against loans, by half a percentage point in the second quarter.The preliminary February index, which shrank in every category except suppliers\u2019 delivery times, showed the new orders subindex had fallen below 50 for the first time in seven months, while new export orders had been higher than in January, but remained below 50. The index is seasonally adjusted.Aside from seasonal factors, the government\u2019s continuing attempt to restructure the economy away from exports and toward domestic consumption has cooled investment growth \u2014 a main engine of China\u2019s economy \u2014 to its lowest rate in at least a decade.The data on Thursday was the latest sign of difficulty in China\u2019s factories. Indexes in January showed growth in China\u2019s manufacturing and services sectors at multimonth or multiyear lows.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Factory Report May Not Be as Dire as It Looks", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsWORLD markets, already nervous over possibly fragile emerging-market economies, tumbled early this week after a survey of manufacturers in the United States showed a surprising drop in the proportion of companies saying their business was improving. On Monday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell more than 2 percent, suffering its worst day since last June.But that may have been an overreaction. A competing survey of American manufacturers showed a much smaller decline, and surveys of manufacturers in many other countries showed better results.The negative news came from the Institute for Supply Management, which has gained a reputation for spotting turnarounds in economic activity. While that was still a sign of growth \u2014 any number over 50 indicates that more companies said orders were rising than falling \u2014 it was also the largest drop in a single month in the new-orders index since December 1980, when the figure also fell to 51.2. That drop was followed by a plunge in economic activity after the short-lived recovery from a recession that had officially ended the previous July. The next recession officially began in July 1981, and proved to be a severe one.It is worth noting what the surveys are intended to show \u2014 and what they are not. A figure of 60 rather than 55 indicates that more companies are reporting increases in business, but it says nothing about the magnitude of those increases. Moreover, the figures have nothing to say about whether business is good. A company recovering from a severe downturn would answer the survey the same way as one that was showing a small increase in an already excellent business climate.Even so, it is interesting and encouraging that manufacturers in many European countries are finally reporting increases in new orders. In Greece, new orders were reported as declining in 59 of 61 months through last October. But the index rose to the break-even point of 50 in November and was above that level in December and January. In Spain and Italy, where orders were falling early in 2013, the trend has turned positive.A plurality of companies in most emerging markets are also reporting growing orders, something that was not true as recently as last summer.None of that proves that the January I.S.M. report will turn out to have been a false warning, but it does give reason to hope that it will.

{"Headline": "The End of Snow?", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionOVER the next two weeks, hundreds of millions of people will watch Americans like Ted Ligety and Mikaela Shiffrin ski for gold on the downhill alpine course. Television crews will pan across epic vistas of the rugged Caucasus Mountains, draped with brilliant white ski slopes. What viewers might not see is the 16 million cubic feet of snow that was stored under insulated blankets last year to make sure those slopes remained white, or the hundreds of snow-making guns that have been running around the clock to keep them that way.The planet has warmed 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since the 1800s, and as a result, snow is melting. In the last 47 years, a million square miles of spring snow cover has disappeared from the Northern Hemisphere. Europe has lost half of its Alpine glacial ice since the 1850s, and if climate change is not reined in, two-thirds of European ski resorts will be likely to close by 2100.The same could happen in the United States, where in the Northeast, more than half of the 103 ski resorts may no longer be viable in 30 years because of warmer winters. As far for the Western part of the country, it will lose an estimated 25 to 100 percent of its snowpack by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not curtailed \u2014 reducing the snowpack in Park City, Utah, to zero and relegating skiing to the top quarter of Ajax Mountain in Aspen.The facts are straightforward: The planet is getting hotter. Snow melts above 32 degrees Fahrenheit. The Alps are warming two to three times faster than the worldwide average, possibly because of global circulation patterns. Since 1970, the rate of winter warming per decade in the United States has been triple the rate of the previous 75 years, with the strongest trends in the Northern regions of the country. Nine of the 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 2000, and this winter is already looking to be one of the driest on record \u2014 with California at just 12 percent of its average snowpack in January, and the Pacific Northwest at around 50 percent.To a skier, snowboarder or anyone who has spent time in the mountains, the idea of brown peaks in midwinter is surreal. Poets write of the grace and beauty by which snowflakes descend and transform a landscape. Powder hounds follow the 100-odd storms that track across the United States every winter, then drive for hours to float down a mountainside in the waist-deep \u201ccold smoke\u201d that the storms leave behind.The snow I learned to ski on in northern Maine was more blue than white, and usually spewed from snow-making guns instead of the sky. I didn\u2019t like skiing at first. It was cold. And uncomfortable.Then, when I was 12, the mystical confluence of vectors that constitute a ski turn aligned, and I was hooked. I scrubbed toilets at my father\u2019s boatyard on Mount Desert Island in high school so I could afford a ski pass and sold season passes in college at Mad River Glen in Vermont to get a free pass for myself. After graduating, I moved to Jackson Hole, Wyo., for the skiing. Four years later, Powder magazine hired me, and I\u2019ve been an editor there ever since.My bosses were generous enough to send me to five continents over the last 15 years, with skis in tow. I\u2019ve skied the lightest snow on earth on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, where icy fronts spin off the Siberian plains and dump 10 feet of powder in a matter of days. In the high peaks of Bulgaria and Morocco, I slid through snow stained pink by grains of Saharan sand that the crystals formed around.In Baja, Mexico, I skied a sliver of hardpack snow at 10,000 feet on Picacho del Diablo, sandwiched between the Sea of Cortez and the Pacific Ocean. A few years later, a crew of skiers and I journeyed to the whipsaw Taurus Mountains in southern Turkey to ski steep couloirs alongside caves where troglodytes lived thousands of years ago.At every range I traveled to, I noticed a brotherhood among mountain folk: Say you\u2019re headed into the hills, and the doors open. So it has been a surprise to see the winter sports community, as one of the first populations to witness effects of climate change in its own backyard, not reacting more vigorously and swiftly to reverse the fate we are writing for ourselves.It\u2019s easy to blame the big oil companies and the billions of dollars they spend on influencing the media and popular opinion. But the real reason is a lack of knowledge. I know, because I, too, was ignorant until I began researching the issue for a book on the future of snow.I was floored by how much snow had already disappeared from the planet, not to mention how much was predicted to melt in my lifetime. The ski season in parts of British Columbia is four to five weeks shorter than it was 50 years ago, and in eastern Canada, the season is predicted to drop to less than two months by midcentury. At Lake Tahoe, spring now arrives two and a half weeks earlier, and some computer models predict that the Pacific Northwest will receive 40 to 70 percent less snow by 2050. If greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise \u2014 they grew 41 percent between 1990 and 2008 \u2014 then snowfall, winter and skiing will no longer exist as we know them by the end of the century.The effect on the ski industry has already been significant. Between 1999 and 2010, low snowfall years cost the industry $1 billion and up to 27,000 jobs. Oregon took the biggest hit out West, with 31 percent fewer skier visits during low snow years. Next was Washington at 28 percent, Utah at 14 percent and Colorado at 7.7 percent.The winter sports industry contributes $66 billion annually to the nation\u2019s economy, and supports more than 960,000 jobs across 38 states, according to the Outdoor Industry Association. A surprisingly large sector of the United States economy appears to be teetering on the brink.Climate studies predict changes if emissions, and temperatures, continue to rise through the end of this century.The truth is, it is too late for all of that. Greening the ski industry is commendable, but it isn\u2019t nearly enough. Nothing besides a national policy shift on how we create and consume energy will keep our mountains white in the winter \u2014 and slow global warming to a safe level.This is no longer a scientific debate. It is scientific fact. The greatest fear of most climate scientists is continued complacency that leads to a series of natural climatic feedbacks \u2014 like the melting of the methane-rich permafrost of Arctic Canada.Artificial snow-making now helps to cover 88 percent of American ski resorts, and has become the stopgap measure to defend against the early effects of climate change. Snow-making requires a tremendous amount of electricity and water, though, so it\u2019s unlikely that snow guns will be our savior. In the Alps, snow-making uses more water in the winter than the entire city of Vienna, about 500,000 gallons of water per acre. Ski areas like Vail, Keystone, Breckenridge and Arapahoe Basin seed clouds with silver iodide to make it snow, but that won\u2019t help much when it gets warmer. When it does, whatever the clouds bring will fall as rain.It was a big step forward for skiers and the country. And it led people to ask me, \u201cWhy save skiing when there are more pressing consequences of climate change to worry about?\u201d The answer is, this is not about skiing. It is about snow, a vital component of earth\u2019s climate system and water cycle. When it disappears, what follows is a dangerous chain reaction of catastrophes like forest fires, drought, mountain pine beetle infestation, degraded river habitat, loss of hydroelectric power, dried-up aquifers and shifting weather patterns. Not to mention that more than a billion people around the world \u2014 including about 70 million in the western United States \u2014 rely on snowmelt for their fresh water supply.I remember watching my first Winter Olympics in 1980. We were on a family ski trip at Copper Mountain in Colorado, where my brother and I skied the first powder run of our lives. It was on a gentle slope just off one of the main trails. We wiggled down the hill in chaotic rapture then skied the run again and again. The snow was soft and the turns effortless. You don\u2019t have to be a skier to feel nostalgia for those whitewashed days \u2014 or to see the writing on the wall.The features editor at Powder magazine and the author of \u201cDeep: The Story of Skiing and the Future of Snow.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeing the Show With Their Ears", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdmit One\u201cI DON\u2019T know why you people have to go to the movies,\u201d the man had barked. \u201cYou won\u2019t get anything out of it anyway.\u201d The \u201cyou people\u201d was the blind in general and Vicky Winslow in particular. The man at the cinema some time ago hadn\u2019t cared for her way of watching: with her ears, and a friend\u2019s whispered puffs of description.On a recent evening at a Broadway theater, she had a different approach. She was swathed in a brooch-fastened cape, sitting above her trusty German shepherd, Jet, ready to take in \u201cThe Lion King\u201d \u2014 and etching a mental picture of Simba and his savanna with the help of a single foam-wrapped earpiece that made a noisy whisper buddy unnecessary.It was several minutes before 8, and the audience was chattering and waiting. But for Ms. Winslow, 51, the show had already begun. Her ear was filling with advance word of what others would learn only later: the color of Zazu\u2019s feathers, the bounce in Simba\u2019s dreadlocks. It was important to stock up on character descriptions now, to permit a focus on plot later. She savored each description the way some people sip wine, holding it for a time, swirling it in consideration.The voice\u2019s description of Simba\u2019s golden belt made her laugh. When it mentioned a wooden lion head in the theater, she said, \u201cOh, I\u2019d like to see that!\u201dThe theater can feel forbidding and overwhelming even to those with five senses. But in recent years an experiment on Broadway started testing whether theater\u2019s thrills can be extended to patrons who see with their ears. A service called D-Scriptive translates the visual language of raised eyebrows, waist-high leg kicks and soft kisses into the language of sound. An evening with Ms. Winslow suggested that a show digested this way isn\u2019t without its pleasures. Fostering that pleasure takes technological trickery. Because every live performance is slightly different, playing a single audio track wouldn\u2019t work: before long, the action would outrun or lag the description on the tape. D-Scriptive solved the problem by dicing up its narration \u2014 into more than 600 audio files in the case of \u201cThe Lion King.\u201d An individual file, or cluster of them, is assigned to a particular cue given by the theater\u2019s stage manager. After an actor utters a certain line, for example, the manager speaks the next cue into the microphone, which in turn tips off D-Scriptive\u2019s computer to broadcast the corresponding bit of explanation to its patrons\u2019 earpieces: \u201cOn the left are two giraffes and a cheetah\u201d; \u201cRafiki holds the cub up to the bright light once more.\u201dD-Scriptive, initiated in 2006 with \u201cWicked,\u201d is now available at six shows on Broadway, with more in the pipeline. Theatergoers used the service 2,717 times last year, 541 of those for \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d according to Carl Anthony Tramon, director of special services for Sound Associates, the company behind D-Scriptive. Leased by the theaters, the service is free for users.The first time Ms. Winslow tried the system, to take in \u201cJersey Boys,\u201d she was hooked. \u201cThe details that they gave were things that no one else \u2014 not even people who know me and describe things to me \u2014 would think to tell me,\u201d she said. And, she noted, causing a disturbance on Broadway is even worse than at the cinema: \u201cRemember, unlike the movies, you\u2019ve paid an awful lot for your seat and you can\u2019t just go look for another one.\u201dA few seats down from her, Kirk Brouwer, 15, a sophomore at St. Joseph Regional High School in Montvale, N.J., had his own reasons for loving the service. He had his first eye surgery at one week old and has had 300 or so operations since then; today his left eye has no vision and his right eye has 20/100 vision with glasses (enough to gaze into his cellphone from up close and to pursue his passion for shooting and editing videos). It used to be that whenever he went to a show with his family, he said, his three younger brothers would discuss it on the ride home and he would remain silent. Sitting beside his mother on this night, he said the descriptions helped him socially by giving him something to toss into conversations with family and friends. For his mother, Eileen, it was a short break from her usual habit of describing every last thing around them, \u201cto be sure Kirk doesn\u2019t miss any details in life,\u201d she said.As \u201cThe Lion King\u201d began, Mr. Brouwer and Ms. Winslow were already full of information. The challenge facing them was to hold these descriptions in their heads, listening to D-Scriptive\u2019s account of the action in one ear and following the music and dialogue heard by everyone with the other ear.If the sighted theatergoer has the luxury of being in the moment during a show, the partly or fully blind patron must enjoy it differently. The descriptions preload in the brain before the show begins, the progressive narration of dance kicks and kisses tends to come several seconds before the actual deeds, and the dialogue arrives last. Assembling a mental picture of a scene often requires that information heard at several different moments be merged. Sometimes Ms. Winslow laughed in sync with the crowd; sometimes the D-Scriptive failed to relay a funny bit and the crowd laughed without her; sometimes the audio description was funnier than the visual action, and she laughed all by herself. She was more sensitive to wordplay than most, chuckling alone when Pumbaa the warthog spoke of a sandwich \u201cwith a side of flies.\u201d That\u2019s easy enough compared to what she used to do as a social worker in a homeless shelter, using her ears to sense when tears had rimmed a client\u2019s eyes and a tissue box needed extending.\u201cThere are some things that eyesight would give me,\u201d said Ms. Winslow, who was born blind. \u201cBut I hear things that other people don\u2019t because they\u2019re not focused on hearing.\u201dThere was too much to hear at times. The words and images beamed through the earpiece sometimes came at her like digital machine-gun fire. A song about not being able to wait to be king was especially overloaded, with seemingly every dance step and twirl itemized. So it goes when a thronging boulevard of a performance must be jammed into the single lane of auditory perception.Ms. Winslow, though, has ways of coping. \u201cMy mind sort of censors for what I\u2019m interested in,\u201d she said.It was another story with her immediate neighbor to the right \u2014 me. Just as the houselights went down, she leaned over and issued a gentle order: \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d It was an invitation to try to know something of her experience that night, and for that I had also secured one of the devices.At first, I found myself cheating without intending to, keeping eyes closed during run-of-the-mill descriptions but opening them when something sounded especially beautiful. Later I lasted through full scenes in the way that Ms. Winslow had asked. To try to process it all was to understand that a Broadway show is, in the end, a giant information ball, a dense nugget made of millions of disparate kinds of facts.

{"Headline": "A New Light on Regulators in the Dark", "Date": "2014-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameIn the five years that have elapsed since the direst days of the financial crisis, we\u2019ve learned much about how the nation\u2019s high-level banking regulators worked to keep the debacle from turning into a full-blown economic Depression. Tales of these herculean efforts have emerged in books by some of the major players, and in the exhaustive testimony they\u2019ve presented before congressional inquisitors and others trying to determine what went wrong and why. Still, there is more to learn. That\u2019s the message in the transcripts released last Friday by the Federal Reserve Board, detailing the 2008 meetings of its powerful Federal Open Market Committee. This treasure trove \u2014 almost 2,000 pages of conversation and dialogue by the committee members and other Fed officials \u2014 sheds light on the rescue of Bear Stearns, the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers and the bailout of the American International Group. My initial takeaway from these voluminous transcripts is that they paint a disturbing picture of a central bank that was in the dark about each looming disaster throughout 2008. That meant that the nation\u2019s top bank regulators were unprepared to deal with the consequences of each new event. Consider comments about the strength of the United States banking system made at the meeting on March 18, 2008. This sit-down occurred just days after the collapse of Bear Stearns and the sale of its assets to JPMorgan Chase, in a deal brokered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.While most of the discussion at this meeting covered the possibility that the country had already slipped into a recession and that inflation might rear its head, the topic of whether the nation\u2019s banks were adequately capitalized did come up. That these institutions were inadequately capitalized was already obvious to some regulators, but that was not the view of Timothy F. Geithner, who was then the president of the New York Fed and vice chairman of the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors. \u201cIt is very hard to make the judgment now that the financial system as a whole or the banking system as a whole is undercapitalized,\u201d Mr. Geithner said, adding that \u201csome people are out there saying that.\u201dHe continued: \u201cBased on everything we know today, if you look at very pessimistic estimates of the scale of losses across the financial system, on average relative to capital, they do not justify that concern.\u201dTo Mr. Geithner, the nattering naysayers raising alarms about the financial system\u2019s soundness were a bigger problem than the one that they were trying to draw attention to. \u201cThere is nothing more dangerous in what we\u2019re facing now,\u201d he said, \u201cthan for people who are knowledgeable about this stuff to feed these broad concerns about our credibility and about the basic core strength of the financial system.\u201d On Friday, Mr. Geithner did not return an email requesting comment.To be sure, Mr. Geithner was not alone in this view. Just two weeks earlier Donald L. Kohn, another Fed vice chairman, told the Senate Banking Committee: \u201cThe problems in the mortgage and housing markets have been highly unusual and clearly some banking organizations have failed to manage their exposures well and have suffered losses as a result. But in general these losses should not threaten their viability.\u201dWanna bet?Equally distressing, as the credit storm gathered strength after the Bear Stearns collapse, the minutes show little comprehension of the perils posed by two other teetering financial giants: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This is odd, given that the declining financial position of these mortgage finance heavyweights \u2014 they guaranteed or issued $5 trillion in mortgages \u2014 was known at the time. Yet the companies were barely mentioned at the meetings before the one that occurred on Aug. 5. Just a month later, the companies had to be taken over by taxpayers. Also missing from much of the discussion early in 2008 was the recognition that government rescues of reckless financial firms created moral hazard. The March 18 meeting came just two days after the Bear Stearns rescue. But almost no concerns were raised at the meeting that by aiding this brokerage firm, other firms would assume that the government would also come to their rescue. The Bear Stearns rescue, after all, cemented the notion that the taxpayer would be there to bail out aggressive financiers. And yet there was only one passing reference to this policy peril. It came from Frederic S. Mishkin, a governor who left the Fed later that year. Outlining his bearish views on the economy and deteriorating credit markets, Mr. Mishkin noted another cost associated with the deepening financial problems. \u201cOne result,\u201d he said, \u201cis that we\u2019ve just expanded the safety net to a much wider set of institutions, and we are in a brave new world here, and it is very disturbing.\u201dAnd that was it. Nothing more about this crucial issue was said at that meeting.Six months later, amid Lehman\u2019s failure, they did start to talk about moral hazard.In public statements since that time, the Fed has maintained that the government didn\u2019t have the tools to save Lehman. These documents appear to tell a different story.Some comments made at the Sept. 16 meeting, directly after Lehman filed for bankruptcy, indicate that letting Lehman fail was more of a policy decision than a passive one. For example, James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, noted the positive message that the decision sent to the market. \u201cBy denying funding to Lehman suitors,\u201d Mr. Bullard said, \u201cthe Fed has begun to re-establish the idea that markets should not expect help at each difficult juncture.\u201d Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed, echoed this view. \u201cWhat we did with Lehman I obviously think is good,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has had an effect on market participants\u2019 assessment of the likelihood of other firms getting support.\u201d But he added that the Fed\u2019s public stance on Lehman\u2019s failure was confusing the markets.\u201cAll the language around not supporting Lehman was of a one-off nature,\u201d he said. \u201c So I\u2019m not sure about the extent to which we\u2019ve diminished uncertainty about the likelihood of support going forward, and I think that such uncertainty is likely to exacerbate financial volatility in the months ahead until we can make more progress on articulating a reasonably principled policy on when we\u2019re going to intervene and when we\u2019re not, or at least enhancing clarity about that.\u201dMr. Lacker was right to wonder. Later that day, the government rescued the American International Group, the beleaguered insurance company, and its big-bank counterparties. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will Saving on Health Care Hurt the Economy?", "Date": "2014-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 LOST in all the debate last week about whether or not the Affordable Care Act will hurt the economy is the fact that health care is already imposing a drag on growth.The health care sector has repeatedly helped to pull the economy from recession in recent decades, but this time around it is lagging behind the recovery.Health care spending grew more slowly than the economy in 2011 and 2012 and will probably be found to have done so again in 2013. Meanwhile, health care employment also expanded more slowly than overall employment last year \u2014 and the government estimates that in January employment actually shrank for only the second time since 1990.The reasons for this slowdown are not well understood. The Great Recession is clearly part of the story. Experts also point to changes in technology and in the way care is delivered and paid for. It seems likely that the landmark 2010 legislation is playing at least a small part, but the magnitude of its impact is hotly disputed. The consequences are easier to see, though: Lower health care spending isn\u2019t helping the economy to heal.But in the nation\u2019s current economic malaise, idled resources are not being put to better use. Workers, companies and the federal government are all paying down debt rather than spending and investing. Fewer homes are being bought; companies are building few factories. The government has been cutting back at a pace exceeded in modern times only during the military demobilizations after the Vietnam War and the Cold War.In the past, the health care industry leaned against the wind during downturns. The industry added jobs in every month from January 1990 through December 2013, save for a month in the summer of 2003. In 2001, a recession year that saw total employment shrink 1.3 percent, health care jobs rose 3.5 percent.But the expansion of health care employment has slowed sharply over the past five years. Last year industry payrolls grew just 1.4 percent \u2014 almost a percentage point below the average annual increase in the decade before the 2007-9 recession. Health care prices are also rising more slowly. The 1.4 percent increase in 2013 was the slowest pace of health care inflation in at least half a century, and it was a key contributor to the sluggish 1.1 percent annual pace of overall inflation. And sluggish inflation can be self-perpetuating. Inflation is rising slowly because the economy is weak, and slow inflation is restraining faster growth.Some economists see the slowdown in health care spending as a straightforward consequence of our broader economic problems: We\u2019re spending less on health care because we\u2019re spending less on everything. The implication is that the trend is temporary.But that does not explain why health care spending has been recovering more slowly than spending on everything else. The most recent data, for 2012, show that health care spending grew 3.7 percent while the economy grew 4.6 percent. The rest, he said, is harder to explain \u2014 but also more likely to endure. Expensive innovations like new drugs are arriving at a slower pace. A new focus on efficiency appears to be reducing costs. And changes that require patients to pay for a larger share of the care they receive may be inducing more second thoughts. The impact of these changes might have been less painful in good times. But Professor Cutler said it would have been ridiculous to argue for the preservation of the existing system, even temporarily, as a kind of economic stimulus program.\u201cIf you take an industry that\u2019s countercyclical and you make it grow slower, then that\u2019s going to hurt you in a recession,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely true. But I\u2019m not sure the right answer is to say, \u2018Let\u2019s take one sector that\u2019s clearly bloated and imposing a horrible tax on the economy and make that sector stay bloated.\u2019\u00a0\u201dKatherine Baicker, a professor of health economics at the Harvard School of Public Health, said it was a mistake to focus on the pain caused to workers in the health care industry rather than the benefits to everyone else.The cost of health care, she noted, is broadly distributed. Everyone pays for the industry\u2019s prosperity, either directly or in the form of insurance premiums.\u201cDo you really want to pay for surgeons\u2019 salaries by having low-income people not be able to afford health insurance?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the world\u2019s least efficient jobs program. No one is suggesting that spending money on health care is bad. It\u2019s just that for a given outcome, if you could get it with fewer resources, that would be better for everyone. You could get more health. You could get more other stuff.\u201dA correspondent for The New York Times. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Air France-KLM Swings Back to Underlying Profit", "Date": "2014-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 After more than 18 months of painful cost-cutting and staff reductions, Air France-KLM reported its first underlying profit in three years on Thursday, and confirmed that it was making steady progress toward reducing debt even as it steps up investment in premium-class service and new international partnerships.Air France-KLM, Europe\u2019s third-largest airline by number of passengers, swung to an operating profit of 130 million euros, or $178 million in 2013, compared with a loss of \u20ac336 million a year earlier as it reduced expenses by around 3.8 percent per seat, thanks to lower fuel bills and shrinking staffing costs. Revenue for the year grew just 0.4 percent, to \u20ac25.5 billion, while net debt declined to \u20ac5.3 billion, from \u20ac6 billion in 2012.\u201cWe are clearly benefiting from the successful implementation of new working conditions and of the industrial plans adopted in all of our businesses,\u201d Alexandre de Juniac, chief executive of the French-Dutch carrier, said in a statement. \u201cI am confident we will return to the path of profitable growth in 2014 and beyond.\u201dIn the fourth quarter, however, Air France-KLM\u2019s net loss widened to nearly \u20ac1.2 billion from \u20ac244 million a year earlier, primarily as a result of a one-time charge of \u20ac937 million linked to asset disposals and the payment of deferred jet fuel taxes accrued during the depths of the financial crisis. For the full year, the group\u2019s net loss came to \u20ac1.8 billion, compared with \u20ac1.2 billion in 2012.The company\u2019s shares had fallen less than 1 percent in afternoon trading in Paris on Thursday.Air France-KLM\u2019s recovery has been led by its passenger business, particularly its long-haul operations, while its cargo activity continues to struggle in a sluggish global economy. Passenger operations swung to a profit of \u20ac174 million in 2013 from a loss of \u20ac260 million the year before, despite a relatively modest 2.4 percent increase in traffic. An 11.5 percent reduction in dedicated cargo capacity helped to narrow losses on freight shipments to \u20ac202 million from \u20ac230 million in 2012 amid a nearly 8 percent decline in revenues.Since June 2012, the group\u2019s Air France unit has announced the elimination almost 8,000 jobs as part of broad plan to reduce debt and shave more than \u20ac2 billion from operating costs, with an eye to restoring the airline itself to profit by 2015. The group confirmed Thursday that it was on target to reach earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization this year of \u20ac2.5 billion, while reducing debt to \u20ac4.5 billion in 2015.\u201cYou can see the cost initiatives are having some effect, and from that perspective the message is quite positive,\u201d said Stephen Furlong, an airline analyst at Davy, a brokerage in Dublin. \u201cThey are on the right path.\u201dLabor costs have been a major drain on profit at Air France-KLM for years. Despite a 2.4 percent reduction in employee costs last year, they still stood at nearly \u20ac7.5 billion, roughly 30 percent of total expenses and surpassing a fuel bill of just under \u20ac7 billion.By contrast, labor costs as a share of revenue are less than 10 percent at its low-cost rival, Ryanair, and around 12 percent at EasyJet, according to the Center for Aviation in Brussels.Despite its aggressive staff reductions, Air France-KLM does not expect to be able to match the wage bills of its low-cost rivals, given the high payroll taxes in France, where the bulk of the group\u2019s staff is based. The airline has therefore set its sights on raising the quality of its service, particularly on long-distance routes where it competes increasingly with deep-pocketed Middle Eastern carriers.\u201cWe cannot always compete on price because of our cost structure,\u201d Mr. de Juniac told journalists this month. \u201cSo we have to be top in class in service in order to justify a higher price.\u201dTo that end, Air France-KLM recently announced plans to invest \u20ac500 million over the next year to upgrade the seats, catering and other amenities in the first- and business-class cabins of all Boeing 777 wide-body jets that ply its busiest routes to Asia and North America. The changes include the introduction of berths in business class that recline to full-flat beds \u2014 a feature that has been common for years on a number of rival carriers.The group has also begun to seek out new commercial partnerships to strengthen its position in markets outside Europe, where passenger traffic growth continues to lag other regions and where competition from low-cost rivals remains fierce.On Wednesday, Air France-KLM announced a $100 million strategic partnership with Brazil\u2019s flagship airline, Gol, in a bid to capture a larger share of trans-Atlantic traffic to the South American nation.The new partnership with Gol, which has a 40 percent market share in Brazil, comes in anticipation of a surge in travel over the coming years to Brazil, which will host the World Cup soccer tournament in June, as well as the 2016 summer Olympic Games.Under the terms of the agreement, which must still obtain regulatory approval, Air France-KLM said it would invest a total of $100 million in Gol, including an equity investment worth $52 million. The deal expands a five-year-old shared-ticketing agreement and would give the two carriers exclusive code-sharing rights in on their respective European and Brazilian routes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saving Ukraine", "Date": "2014-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialDetails of the aid package are still under negotiation in Europe and the United States, but there should be little doubt about the need. Ukraine\u2019s economy is on the brink of failure and its politics has been in turmoil since the president, Viktor Yanukovych, rejected an economic pact with Europe in favor of an offer from Russia for $15 billion in assistance. Russia, playing hardball after Mr. Yanukovych announced plans to replace his cabinet to appease protesters, last week suspended a portion of the aid and thus left an opening for the Americans and Europeans to make their own offer.The Western package is mainly intended as bridge financing to get a new Ukrainian government, if one is formed, through a transition period so it can make the sufficient reforms needed to qualify for a long-delayed loan from the International Monetary Fund. The West is looking for a government of experts, possibly led by an opposition leader.There is undoubtedly risk because it is not at all clear that Mr. Yanukovych and the opposition can find any basis for real compromise, or, if they do, make it work over the long term. But the West needs to be even more committed than Russia in offering Ukraine a compelling path forward. And it needs to move quickly. Catherine Ashton, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, told The Wall Street Journal over the weekend that the package could include not just money but loan guarantees, investment and currency stabilization. In the past two weeks, Vice President Joseph Biden Jr.; Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany; and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive body, have been in daily and rotating contact with Mr. Yanukovych. It was reassuring to hear Secretary of State John Kerry tell a security conference in Munich over the weekend that \u201cnowhere is the fight for a democratic, European future more important today than in Ukraine\u201d and to affirm that the United States and Europe \u201cstand with the people of Ukraine in that fight.\u201d That will mean providing the parties in Ukraine with whatever mediation and support might be useful. Ukraine, one of the most important countries to emerge from the former Soviet Union, is at a critical point. Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s grip on power is slipping, yet, even after offering the opposition some concessions, he is still playing for time under the sway of Russian and Ukrainian hard-liners. The opposition also needs to negotiate seriously on a way out of the current turmoil. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Moderate Islam? Look to Central Asia", "Date": "2014-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 For more than a decade, the United States has been reaching out to the Muslim world, courting Islamic moderates even as it wages war with religious extremists. Washington\u2019s efforts have been concentrated mostly on the Middle East, with little success. The Americans might do better to focus on another region that has an equal claim to being Islam\u2019s true heartland \u2014 the new nations along the old Silk Road through Central Asia.While violence rages on in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, the predominantly Muslim countries of the former Soviet Union \u2014 Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan \u2014 are experimenting with secular governments and free markets. Their efforts have had many fits and starts, but the West should recognize that their struggle to come to terms with modernity holds huge potential for the Muslim world as a whole, and may someday serve as a template for promoting peace among warring nations. Yet Washington continues to underestimate their cultural importance and potential impact. In the tumultuous years after 9/11, America\u2019s concentration on the Arab world seemed to make sense. After all, the Middle East was a source of Islam\u2019s most virulent strains. Moreover, the importance of Mecca, Medina, Cairo and Jerusalem seemed to justify the assumption that the battle to win Muslim hearts and minds must be waged in that region. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both spoke glowingly of the Arab world\u2019s spiritual and scientific contributions to humanity. Both men counseled the Arab people to embrace a \u201ctrue Islam\u201d that champions intellectual tolerance and embraces secular learning. But against their wishful words lay the reality that fewer foreign books were being translated and published in the entire Middle East than in Spain. Nor did either president seem to realize that, though many of the greatest geniuses of the centuries between the fall of Rome and the European Renaissance wrote in Arabic, most of them were not, in fact, Arabs.For nearly a thousand years, Central Asia was the one point where the trade-based economies and great cultures of the Middle East, Europe, India and China all met. No one was better positioned than the people who lived along the great Silk Road to study and improve on ideas, inventions and manufacturing techniques from across Eurasia. Thus, for many centuries, Central Asia \u2014 not the Arab Middle East \u2014 was the intellectual and political center of the Muslim world. The second holiest book of Islam, \u201cSayings of the Prophet,\u201d was assembled by a scholar from Bukhara, in present-day Uzbekistan. It was in places like Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan that Islam\u2019s powerful mystical movement, Sufism, found its greatest exponents, and it was from there that Sufism spread across the Muslim world. And among medieval theologians, few thinkers stood higher than Abu Hamid al-Ghazali, from the city of Tus on the borderland between Iran, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan, who exerted a profound influence on St. Thomas Aquinas.Central Asia can also claim a lion\u2019s share of the greatest names in Islamic science and philosophy. The codifier of algebra, to whom Mr. Obama referred his \u201cnew beginning\u201d speech at Cairo University in 2009, was also from Khwarazm, in what is now Uzbekistan. Called Al-Khwarazmi in Arabic, he gave his name to algorithms, which lie at the heart of modern computer science. Also from Uzbekistan was Ibn Sina, known as Avicenna to the West, whose great \u201cCanon of Medicine\u201d gave rise to the medical sciences in the Middle East, Europe and India. Another great intellectual, Al-Farabi, who revived and greatly added to Aristotle\u2019s logic and who wrote the greatest medieval study of music, was from what is now Kazakhstan. And the pioneering astronomer Abu-Mahmud Khojandi was from Khujand, now in Tajikistan. True, all these people wrote in Arabic. But a Japanese who writes in English is not an Englishman. All of them \u2014 and scores of other innovators from the Muslim world whom we are accustomed to think of as Arabs \u2014 belonged to various Central Asian branches of the Persian peoples, or were Turks, not Arabs.Today, the countries that are heirs to the old Silk Road are struggling to reclaim their heritage. The task is not easy. Many of their leaders are attracted to the authoritarianism that has brought relative stability to Russia and tremendous prosperity to China. The people of Central Asia have no prior experience with democracy, ethnic tensions persist, and many of their leaders rule with a heavy hand. Yet these countries remain secular states and are more tolerant of other religions than most of their counterparts in the Middle East. Their economies have grown steadily and they have embraced modern secular education, sending tens of thousands of youths to study abroad. They are developing new universities of their own, largely on the American pattern. Many use English as the language of instruction. And all can boast a rising generation of men and women drawn to the ideals of an open society. Unfortunately, in the eyes of many Central Asians, America\u2019s interest does not extend beyond gas and oil. Washington\u2019s decision to pull back from Afghanistan in 2014 will likely erode American influence at the very moment when it could do the most good \u2014 especially as rising prosperity increases pressure for governments to loosen their grip. Greater freedom presents great dangers, as the disillusions of the Arab Spring have so sadly demonstrated.Yet it may be in Central Asia, rather than the Middle East, Pakistan or Indonesia, where the ideals that both Presidents Bush and Obama have espoused will be most actively pursued in coming years. This is not to suggest that Washington pay less attention to the Arab world, but perhaps it is time for us to listen to our own lectures on the possibilities of a peaceful and intellectually open version of Islam, and to back those societies that are trying most successfully to advance it today.

{"Headline": "Tentatively, European Union Weighs Its Options on Support for a New Ukraine", "Date": "2014-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 The European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, spent two days here promising unspecific support for a new Ukrainian government but urging it not to break close trading and cultural links with Russia. Ms. Ashton\u2019s deft dance was inevitable \u2014 the European Union and the West are not willing or capable of bailing out Ukraine\u2019s economy, especially if Moscow retaliates with new punitive tariffs, higher prices for natural gas and a cutoff of significant ties to Ukrainian factories and businesses.As Ukraine on Tuesday delayed naming a new interim government until at least Thursday, Ms. Ashton said at a news conference that Europe would offer \u201csupport, not interference,\u201d and urged Ukrainians to maintain good ties with Russia.The European Union is considered to have driven too hard a bargain with Ukraine, with little obvious payoff, late last year, when Viktor F.

His choice created a popular, pro-European reaction that led to his downfall, but it has not made choices any easier for Europe or for Ukraine.Last year, Europe underestimated Russia\u2019s displeasure and retaliation, gave no prospect of eventual European Union membership to Ukraine and focused too much on what Ukraine needed to do to satisfy European demands rather than helping it prepare for economic change, a senior European official said.\u201cThere was no real consensus among European member states to sign the deal with Ukraine, and it was all about what the E.U. states needed Ukraine to do to sign the deal,\u201d said the official, who requested anonymity because of the diplomatic nature of the negotiations. \u201cWe were too preoccupied with what we needed to sign the deal, and not with what they needed to do.\u201dNor does the European Union have a consensus policy on Russia, and it was late to see the effect of Russian economic and political pressure on the indecisive Mr. Yanukovych, the official said.Now, given the revolution in Kiev, which was made to some extent under the flag of the European Union, Brussels and Washington have another chance, which Ms. Ashton means to seize. But it will be very difficult for the European Union and member states to come up with the money to bail out Ukraine when they have refused to cut easy deals for their own members, like Spain, Portugal and Greece.Ukraine says it needs $35 billion in aid and loans over the next two years, including some money needed urgently to pay outstanding debts and salaries. Some bankers, noting capital flight, say the country\u2019s foreign-currency reserves have been reduced to about $12 billion. The value of the hryvnia, the currency, is plummeting, and the country is effectively shut out of the bond markets.European nations and the United States have said that Ukraine must look to the International Monetary Fund for most of what it needs, even though any renewed deal with the fund would come with difficult and politically painful conditions, principally the slashing of large state subsidies for energy.Ms. Ashton, as ever, was careful with what she said in public here on Tuesday. She praised Ukraine and urged reconciliation and inclusion, but did not mention specific amounts of cash. \u201cWe offer support, not interference, for the future,\u201d Ms. Ashton told reporters, rejecting Russian claims that the West was trying to pull Ukraine away from Moscow. She emphasized \u201cthe importance of the strong links between Ukraine and Russia and the importance of having them maintained.\u201dAs for aid, she was not specific but also pointed to officials at the fund. \u201cThey will make their own decision; they have their own rules,\u201d she said, but called them \u201can important part of the jigsaw puzzle of trying to offer support.\u201dBut the European Union\u2019s economics commissioner, Olli Rehn, a Finn, who is perhaps more inclined to confront Russia, came out Tuesday in favor of calls for a donors\u2019 conference on Ukraine. Speaking at a news conference at the European Parliament, Mr. Rehn said the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, \u201cstands ready to provide substantial financial assistance\u201d alongside the International Monetary Fund, \u201conce a political solution is in place\u201d and a new government presents a \u201cconvincing\u201d economic plan.The European Investment Bank can also help with quick money but, Mr. Rehn noted, \u201cE.U. resources lie predominantly with member states\u201d \u2014 hence the idea of a donors\u2019 conference. But there is little obvious enthusiasm among member states, many of them still in recession or just emerging from it, to pump large amounts of money into an unreformed Ukraine that has been famous for crony capitalism and corruption.Poland, for example, which has been a key interlocutor on Ukraine, has said that it wants to see significant structural change in the country first. On Monday, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that a stable Ukraine was in Poland\u2019s interest. As for foreign aid, he said, \u201cPoland will not sweat its guts out.\u201dUkraine needs to show that it can absorb foreign aid and not waste it, Mr. Tusk said. \u201cIt cannot be that we will organize huge funds for Ukraine and Ukraine will continue to waste this money by, for example, corrupt governments or oligarchs,\u201d he said.One European and American idea, before the unrest here, had been to create a technocratic government under Mr. Yanukovych and prop up Ukraine with a bridge loan while lawmakers worked to pass the difficult legislation required to secure a new loan from the I.M.F.Ukraine\u2019s money problems could worsen even faster if Russia chooses to retaliate economically to weaken any new government or to promote eastern separatism, while insisting that its existing loans to Kiev be repaid in full, on time.There is considerable pressure on the new leaders to name a new government that is reasonably inclusive, to soothe both the country\u2019s significant ethnic Russian minority and a shaken Moscow. At the same time, as Andrew Wilson, a Ukraine expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations noted, the Orange Revolution in 2004 is thought to have failed because it neither dismantled the old, thuggish, kleptocratic government nor built bridges to Russian-dominated eastern Ukraine.The mood in the still-occupied Independence Square on Tuesday was triumphant, with the economic crisis an unwelcome topic of discussion amid the smell of burning wood and rubber that recalls the long siege there.Nataliya, who came to help the protesters with food and medicine, said that Ukrainians were ready for further sacrifice. \u201cWe need an independent state,\u201d she said. \u201cEither someone comes to save us or it will be total bankruptcy.\u201dMaryna Hresko, 18, a student, said, \u201cIt\u2019s better to sacrifice once to live better afterward,\u201d while Konstantyn, a nationalist priest, said, \u201cAt the price of the gulag, we don\u2019t need Russian welfare.\u201dVolodymyr Dudych, the mayor of a small town near Lviv, in western Ukraine, expressed confidence in Europe. \u201cAs our friends and neighbors, they don\u2019t really have an option,\u201d he said. As for further sacrifices, he said, \u201cit won\u2019t be so painful, because it can\u2019t be worse.\u201dMateusz Zurawik contributed reporting from Warsaw, and Daniel Bilefsky from Paris.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "France Tries to Tempt In More Foreign Investment", "Date": "2014-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France has begun a major charm offensive to convince the world that France is open for business in a bid to lure back investments, which have slumped since he took office.Armed with pledges not to be overly taxing, he gathered nearly 40 chiefs of some of the world\u2019s biggest multinational companies and investment funds on Monday under the gilded eaves of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace and told them that their money was not only welcome \u2014 it was sorely needed.Mr. Hollande reiterated his pledge from last month to reduce by 30 billion euros, or $41 billion, the social charges that companies pay on their employees. But he went further on Monday, announcing plans to stabilize corporate tax rules, simplify customs procedures for imports and exports and introduce a tax break for foreign start-ups.\u201cI know that France is seen as a more complicated country than others,\u201d Mr. Hollande told the leaders of General Electric, Volvo, Nestl\u00e9, Mars and others, as well as representatives of BlackRock and the sovereign investment funds of China, Qatar and Kuwait. The message, he added, is that \u201cwe aren\u2019t afraid of opening ourselves up to the world.\u201dDespite his new business-friendly promises, he still faces the hurdle of getting policy changes enacted into law over opposition from his fellow Socialists and other left-leaning politicians, who have successfully cowed him into retreat in the past. He must also persuade investors and multinational companies that France really is determined to change, after years of employers judging France to be an expensive and inflexible place to do business.France \u201chas everything it needs to succeed,\u201d said Ernst Lemberger, an Austrian industrial investor who participated in the Monday meeting. \u201cBut still it\u2019s been behind neighboring countries in taking the necessary economic reforms.\u201dOn Monday, he said he also wanted to include \u20ac25,000 grants for foreign start-ups, access to low-cost financing for subsidiaries of foreign companies setting up in France and a \u201ctalent visa\u201d providing a hassle-free work permit that would be valid for four years.He also pledged that the French tax code, which can change frequently, would remain stable, and that corporate and social taxes would not rise above their current levels.Yet even as he talked to business leaders, the French Parliament began considering a law that would steeply fine companies trying to close operations the government deems economically viable.Mr. Hollande said he wanted more of the huge amounts of capital being invested in emerging markets to flow France\u2019s way. Last year, France drew only about 10 percent of all global foreign capital investment, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s far too little.\u201d\u201cThere is a threat hanging over France\u2019s ability to attract foreign investment,\u201d wrote officials from Microsoft, American Express, Xerox, Siemens, Unilever and others, which jointly employ about 150,000 workers in France. They cited the \u201cpenalizing\u201d complexity and instability of the legislative and regulatory environment; a lack of flexibility in labor laws; high employer costs; and an overall \u201ccultural mistrust\u201d of the market economy.\u201cWe have to give them confidence. We know the battle is hard,\u201d Nicole Bricq, the foreign trade minister, said Sunday.Added Pierre Moscovici, the economy minister: \u201cWe must convince them that France is a country where they can invest \u2014 where they must invest.\u201dEven Mr. Hollande\u2019s \u201cindustrial renewal\u201d minister, Arnaud Montebourg, has been singing from the same hymn sheet. In 2012, Mr. Montebourg created a furor by threatening to nationalize an ailing steel plant run by Arcelor Mittal. Last year, he bragged about preventing Yahoo from taking a majority stake in a successful French company, Dailymotion.On Monday, as the 37 business chiefs sat with Mr. Hollande, Mr. Montebourg spoke in more conciliatory language in a Twitter post: \u201cShowing big international companies 34 plans designed to create a new industrial France,\u201d he wrote.A week earlier, it was Mr. Hollande who offered a gesture of reconciliation to French entrepreneurs, thousands of whom have left France for Silicon Valley, London, Hong Kong and other dynamic destinations.After spending time in Washington, Mr. Hollande visited Silicon Valley. While there, he gave an American-style bear hug to the entrepreneur Carlos Diaz, who founded a group called \u201cles Pigeons,\u201d or the suckers, in 2012 to protest what they called Mr. Hollande\u2019s \u201cbusiness-crushing\u201d tax policies, including now-shelved proposals to double the capital gains tax for people selling their companies.High taxes have generally been the sorest point for businesses. Ian Cheshire, the group chief executive of Kingfisher, a British do-it-yourself retail conglomerate, said on Monday that he would be ready to open 50 stores in France within five years, creating thousands of jobs, if he could be assured the tax regime would remain stable.\u201cThere is a great fear about taxes,\u201d he said before the gathering. Last year, Kingfisher paid \u20ac216 million in payroll tax on about 11,500 French workers. \u201cThat\u2019s almost twice the amount we paid in Britain for the same number of employees,\u201d he said.Mr. Hollande sought to assuage those fears. \u201cA business, whether French or foreign, that wants to invest will have a commitment from the administration that the tax rules will remain the same, and that will be a guarantee,\u201d he said.\u201cGrowth will return if the confidence is there,\u201d Mr. Hollande added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Target Vows to Speed Anti-Fraud Technology", "Date": "2014-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A top executive of Target told a Senate committee on Tuesday that the company was accelerating plans to adopt a technology widely used in Europe but rare in the United States that reduces potential for credit card fraud, and lawmakers from both parties called on other businesses to do the same.The session, a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on privacy in the digital age, was the first time that executives from Target and Neiman Marcus had been subject to detailed public questioning about the detection and handling of the recent data security breaches that exposed the data of millions of customers.John J. Mulligan, Target\u2019s chief financial officer, confirmed that the data thieves gained entry to the company\u2019s computer system by stealing an outside vendor\u2019s credentials, and he disclosed for the first time that Target found malware on 25 registers three days after the company thought it had expunged it from its system.Michael R. Kingston, chief information officer of the Neiman Marcus Group, spent much of his testimony going over the time frame that led to public disclosure of his company\u2019s breach on Jan. 10, some six months after it began last July. He said the malware that infiltrated the company\u2019s system was \u201cexceedingly sophisticated,\u201d that it had a \u201czero percent detection rate\u201d by antivirus software, and that the company had first learned of a possible breach when MasterCard contacted it on Dec. 17 to say that 122 of its cards that had been used fraudulently had also been used at one Neiman Marcus store.The breaches have unsettled consumers, and left many angry and uncertain about the safety of their personal information. The cases have reignited calls for federal legislation setting database security standards and consumer notification requirements. (Currently federal law requires banks to notify customers of data breaches but retailers have no such requirement and are subject to a patchwork of state laws instead.)\u201cThese stores are a major part of our economy,\u201d said the committee chairman, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. If consumers cannot trust businesses to keep their data secure, he said, \u201cour economic recovery is going to falter.\u201dThe Target episode alone is believed to have exposed personal data of as many as 110 million customers, more than a third of the population of the United States. About 40 million of them were shoppers during much of the peak holiday season, from Nov. 27 through Dec. 18. (The phone numbers, email and mailing addresses may have been taken from as many as 70 million more customers, the company said last month.)The Neiman Marcus breach, though affecting far fewer people \u2014 an estimated 1.1 million \u2014 went on much longer, from July 16 to Oct. 30 of last year, the company said. In testimony on Tuesday, Mr. Kingston said no online transactions were affected.Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, noted that she was a Neiman Marcus shopper \u2014 including during the period when data was compromised \u2014 but had not been personally notified by the company that her personal data may have been jeopardized. She said public disclosures through the media were \u201ctoo vague.\u201dMr. Kingston insisted that all shoppers during that time had been notified directly, including online shoppers who weren\u2019t affected. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll go home and look for my notice,\u201d she replied.Reports of smaller breaches as well have emerged recently (including data skimming devices found on registers at a Nordstrom in Miami and the theft of data of about 6,000 online shoppers at Easton-Bell Sports). Recently Michaels Stores, the arts and craft retailer, disclosed that it was investigating a possible breach that could have exposed consumer data as well.Much of the discussion focused on a technology widely used in Europe called EMV that basically amounts to a small chip embedded in each card (rather than a magnetic stripe) that creates a new code for each transaction. This makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit cards, which often happens with stolen data, though the card data itself can still be taken and used for online purchases.The United States has been far slower to adopt the technology than the rest of the world in part because retailers have been reluctant to spend the money to replace current card-processing machines. But senator after senator, as well as witnesses ranging from a security expert at Symantec Corporation and the policy counsel at the Consumers Union, called on companies to institute the new technology \u2014 and to require PINs with the use of chip cards.\u201cWhen this technology has been adopted in Europe, it has significantly decreased fraud,\u201d said Delara Derakhshani of the Consumers Union. \u201cWe need a strong commitment for all stakeholders to adopt this technology sooner rather than later.\u201dThe major credit card companies have already been stepping up the pressure, saying they will require all American retailers to install hardware that can read EMV chips by October 2015 or be liable for the costs of any fraud resulting from stolen data.On Tuesday, Mr. Mulligan said Target would beat that timetable by at least six months. He said the company was aiming to have devices in its stores that can read the cards with chips by the fourth quarter of this year and to issue its own branded RED cards in early 2015.\u201cWe need to move together collectively so the whole system is employing chip and PIN technology,\u201d he said.Though members called for bipartisan cooperation in addressing the data security threat \u2014 Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, the panel\u2019s ranking Republican, said that \u201cthis isn\u2019t a case where we\u2019ve got business on one side and government on the other side\u201d \u2014 there clearly were differing opinions on how far to go. Mr. Grassley said he wanted to avoid a government decree that all companies must do the same thing. Mr. Kingston of Neiman Marcus argued that once standards were made public, criminals would figure out how to get around them.With much focus on prevention, the session shed little light on the hackers behind the breaches. Investigators have said that they are an amorphous band of Russian-speaking cybercriminals who operate in various locations in Eastern Europe. The Secret Service and the Justice Department have been the lead investigators in the cases, and during Tuesday\u2019s hearing William Noonan, the deputy special agent in charge of the Secret Service\u2019s cyberoperations branch, talked about the increasing sophistication, collaboration and specialization among the individuals involved.He detailed division of labor where one person looks for access in a company system and others work on extracting information from the network. Then there are wholesalers and vendors, those who make the counterfeit cards and those \u201con the street\u201d who buy goods with the fraudulent cards. He spoke of a marketplace where criminals buy and sell access to networks, as well as card data, bank and brokerage account information and hacking services. Some of the \u201cillicit digital marketplaces,\u201d he said, have websites with 80,000 users.\u201cThese specialties raise both the complexity of investigating these cases, as well as the level of potential harm to companies and individuals,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Political Star Rises on Vow to Upend Italy\u2019s Old Order", "Date": "2014-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileROME \u2014 HE sometimes wears a leather bomber jacket, embracing the iconography of the rebel. He has rocketed through Italian politics by taking on the establishment, especially in his own left-leaning party. He is media savvy, evoking comparisons to Tony Blair, and he has tapped into a national yearning for change by cultivating a persona as a political wrecking ball with an Everyman appeal.And now, in swift and stunning fashion, Matteo Renzi, only 39, a former Boy Scout and \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d winner, has arrived as the central figure in Italian politics \u2014 and a new force in Europe \u2014 with an agenda that seems as much psychological as political: to shake Italy out of its malaise, push through major changes and shatter the entrenched old guard that dominates politics but has failed to reverse Italy\u2019s painful decline.\u201cThe odds are against Renzi,\u201d said Sergio Fabbrini, director of the Luiss School of Government in Rome. \u201cBut against these odds is a young politician with a significant personality. I just don\u2019t know if that personality is enough.\u201dWithin days, Mr. Renzi, who has been a rising national star since he became mayor of Florence in 2009, is likely to be installed as Italy\u2019s next and youngest prime minister. On Friday, Mr. Letta handed in his resignation to Italy\u2019s president, Giorgio Napolitano, and by next week Parliament could be asked to complete the transition in a confidence vote that Mr. Renzi is expected to win.Mr. Renzi has drawn comparisons to Mr. Blair, the former British prime minister, not only because of his style and generational appeal but also because he has confronted the leftist ideology of his party and embraced a more business-friendly approach, promising to cut corporate taxes and overhaul labor laws.Mr. Renzi\u2019s rise also speaks to Italy\u2019s predicament in a Europe still convulsing from the aftermath of the economic crisis. Southern tier countries like Greece, Portugal and Spain have had to push through painful economic changes or risk losing the financial lifeline provided by the so-called troika of international lenders.Italy has avoided an outside bailout, and as a result it has been spared the extreme shock therapy endured by its southern neighbors. But this has allowed the political establishment to remain largely intact, without making major changes, even as the economy remains stagnant.\u201cRenzi is proof that the Democratic Party has undergone a genetic mutation,\u201d said Angelo D\u2019Orsi, a professor of political theory at the University of Turin, noting that the party\u2019s historic links to Italy\u2019s old Communist Party are now severed.MR. RENZI first captured national attention four years ago when he spoke openly about the need to dump Italy\u2019s political class by using a colloquial verb, rottamare, which roughly translates as junking an old car or appliance in a scrapyard. The expression took off, fueled by the Internet and social media, and Mr. Renzi has used the hashtag #rottamare on Twitter.In a country where much of the younger generation feels alienated and struggles to find work, Mr. Renzi\u2019s youth and open-collar, sleeves-rolled-up style have resonated. Born in Florence to parents who now own an advertising agency, Mr. Renzi was a class officer in high school, a longtime Boy Scout and an altar boy at his Roman Catholic parish. As a teenager, he even won thousands of dollars on Italy\u2019s version of the television game show \u201cWheel of Fortune.\u201d\u201cHe was always organizing something, always arranging things,\u201d said Don Giovanni Sassolini, the priest who celebrated Mr. Renzi\u2019s communion and confirmation, recalling that on the soccer field, the young Matteo \u201calways wanted to be the striker.\u201dMr. Renzi married (he and his wife, Agnese, now a high school teacher in Florence, have three children), and then he decided, at age 29, to run for the presidency of Florence\u2019s provincial council, a relatively minor body. By 2009, Mr. Renzi bucked the local Democratic Party establishment and challenged the party\u2019s entrenched incumbent in the mayoral race. He won.His theme was established: Change is what Florence needs, what Italy needs, and he is the agent of change. He later met President Obama during a visit to Washington and has proudly shown a photograph of the two men to visitors.But Mr. Renzi\u2019s relentless politicking and his telegenic sheen have brought criticism that he is more style than substance. In Florence, he claimed full credit for the creation of a pedestrian zone in the city\u2019s main tourist area, surrounding the Duomo, even though the project was set in motion before he took office. More recently, some Florentines have grumbled that his focus has been elsewhere as he has positioned himself for national office.\u201cThere is no substance to back it up,\u201d said Mr. D\u2019Orsi, the academic, speaking of Mr. Renzi\u2019s public campaigning.Alberto Ferrarese, a journalist and co-author of a political biography of Mr. Renzi, said that Florence had improved under his mayoralty, especially the city center, but that his impact was less significant on major infrastructure issues. Mr. Ferrarese said Mr. Renzi had changed the political culture, bicycling around the ancient city, meeting with citizens on the street and cultivating an Ordinary Joe persona.Antonio Salvi, a Florentine barber, said Mr. Renzi comes by every week or 10 days to maintain his short hairstyle, and sometimes steps into the suntan bed as he talks politics with his aides.\u201cHe sits for two or three minutes in the sun bed,\u201d Mr. Salvi said. \u201cThey talk, but I don\u2019t listen. It\u2019s their private time.\u201dMr. Renzi made his big national move in 2012, when he sought the leadership of the Democratic Party in a nationwide primary that preceded parliamentary races. Pier Luigi Bersani, the embodiment of the old guard, defeated him, but Mr. Bersani then performed badly in inconclusive parliamentary elections in February 2013.Mr. Napolitano, the president, had to form a wobbly coalition of left and right parties, naming Mr. Letta as prime minister. Nine months later, Mr. Renzi again ran in a primary to become leader of the Democratic Party and won in a landslide.NOW, Mr. Renzi faces an array of challenges. Italy\u2019s electoral politics have been frozen since the country\u2019s highest court declared the voting law to be largely unconstitutional. Analysts say that one reason Mr. Renzi decided to push out Mr. Letta as prime minister was that his administration was moving too slowly to pass a new election law, creating the possibility that the government could be frozen in place for an indefinite period.Ever the maverick, Mr. Renzi now must also prove he can build a team and demonstrate the administrative skill to bring to heel Italy\u2019s notorious bureaucracy. He also inherits the same unwieldy coalition that often made it difficult for Mr. Letta to achieve big economic and political changes. Analysts say he is taking a huge risk, one that could doom his political career \u2014 or define it.In his speech before party leaders on Thursday, in which he called for Mr. Letta\u2019s ouster, Mr. Renzi acknowledged the risk with a typical rhetorical flourish, comparing it to the risks taken by mothers, small business owners and others confronted daily with the obstacles presented by government in Italian life.\u201cThis road is more difficult, rather than waiting for a slow attrition,\u201d he said \u201cbecause putting myself on the line now has an element of personal risk.\u201dElisabetta Povoledo and Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Waiting for Thaw to Show Economy\u2019s Health", "Date": "2014-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Thursday that the Fed was looking closely at a recent run of disappointing economic data as it considers how quickly to retreat from its economic stimulus campaign.Ms. Yellen said that cold weather had contributed to the slowdown, but that the Fed had not been able to determine whether the harsh winter across the eastern half of the nation was a complete explanation.\u201cWhat we need to do and will be doing in the weeks ahead is trying to get a firmer handle on exactly how much of that soft data can be explained by weather and what portion, if any, is due to a softer outlook,\u201d she told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.The comments were a shift from Ms. Yellen\u2019s testimony two weeks ago before the House Financial Services Committee. But she did not change her description of the Fed\u2019s plans, saying it probably would keep reducing its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.\u201cIf there\u2019s a significant change in the outlook, certainly we would be open to reconsidering it,\u201d Ms. Yellen said in response to a question from Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t want to jump to conclusions.\u201dMs. Yellen also said that Fed officials remained divided about the best way to describe their plans for managing short-term interest rates, the centerpiece of the central bank\u2019s economic stimulus campaign. The Fed has said it will hold rates near zero well after the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent. Ms. Yellen said officials increasingly were focused on a broader range of labor market indicators, but were looking for ways to provide \u201cas much of an indication of how we expect to conduct policy as we can.\u201d Investors appeared to take some encouragement from Ms. Yellen\u2019s comments. Stocks drifted up during her testimony, continuing a recent trend, and a benchmark interest rate, on 10-year Treasury bonds, drifted down despite the affirmation of the Fed\u2019s plans.\u201cHer testimony suggests to us that the Fed has a high bar for altering its taper plans, and we continue to expect that the committee will reduce the monthly pace of purchases by $10 billion per month and complete the tapering process in October,\u201d wrote Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital.The Fed is reducing its monthly bond purchases because it has concluded that job growth is increasing and that the economy is improving. After expanding its holdings by $85 billion each month last year, it cut back to $75 billion in January and $65 billion in February, on course to end the purchases in the fall.Ms. Yellen\u2019s remarks were the first public hint from a Fed official of any misgivings about that trajectory. Several other officials have suggested in recent weeks that they remained comfortable with cutting another $10 billion when the Fed meets in March.Ms. Yellen said that severe cold and snowstorms had clearly disrupted economic activity, contributing to the low level of estimated job growth in December and January, signs that the recovery in the housing market has faltered somewhat, and disappointing data on retail sales and industrial production in January.\u201cPart of that softness may reflect adverse weather conditions,\u201d she told the committee. \u201cBut at this point, it\u2019s difficult to discern exactly how much.\u201dThe hearing itself was affected by the weather. Ms. Yellen was originally scheduled to appear two weeks ago, on the day a snowstorm hit Washington.Senators asked Ms. Yellen about a wide range of regulatory issues, including the persistent question of whether some financial firms are \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d She was asked to respond to comments Tuesday by Daniel K. Tarullo, the Fed governor most focused on regulatory issues, who said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at, or even really close to, the point at which we can say, \u2018O.K., now we can be pretty comfortable.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMs. Yellen, who has had a tense relationship with Mr. Tarullo, responded, \u201cI\u2019m slightly surprised that he said we are \u2018nowhere close\u2019 because I personally think we\u2019ve made quite a lot of progress in putting in place regulations that will make a huge differences to this.\u201d She added, however, that the issue would not be put to rest until a large financial institution was actually allowed to fail.Ms. Yellen also weighed in on the impact of a proposed increase in the federal minimum wage. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that such an increase would raise the wages of millions of employees, but also could reduce overall employment by about 500,000 jobs. The White House has disputed that conclusion. But Ms. Yellen said \u201calmost all economists\u201d agree with the basic thrust of the budget office report, which said the job losses could range from practically nothing to as many as one million. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to argue with their assessment,\u201d she said.Stanley Fischer, President Obama\u2019s nominee to become Ms. Yellen\u2019s vice chairman, received an important endorsement during the hearing. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, described Mr. Fischer as \u201ca very impressive person\u201d and added, \u201cI look forward to him being confirmed.\u201dThe banking committee has scheduled a confirmation hearing Tuesday for Mr. Fischer, the former head of the Bank of Israel, and two other nominees to the Fed\u2019s board, Lael Brainard, most recently a Treasury official, and Jerome H. Powell, who is up for reappointment. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Philippine Leader Sounds Alarm on China", "Date": "2014-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANILA \u2014 President Benigno S. Aquino III called on Tuesday for nations around the world to do more to support the Philippines in resisting China\u2019s assertive claims to the seas near his country, drawing a comparison to the West\u2019s failure to support Czechoslovakia against Hitler\u2019s demands for Czech land in 1938.Like Czechoslovakia, the Philippines faces demands to surrender territory piecemeal to a much stronger foreign power and needs more robust foreign support for the rule of international law if it is to resist, President Aquino said in a 90-minute interview in the wood-paneled music room of the presidential palace. \u201cIf we say yes to something we believe is wrong now, what guarantee is there that the wrong will not be further exacerbated down the line?\u201d he said. He later added, \u201cAt what point do you say, \u2018Enough is enough\u2019? Well, the world has to say it \u2014 remember that the Sudetenland was given in an attempt to appease Hitler to prevent World War II.\u201dMr. Aquino\u2019s remarks are among the strongest indications yet of alarm among Asian heads of state about China\u2019s military buildup and territorial ambitions, and the second time in recent weeks that an Asian leader has volunteered a comparison to the prelude to world wars.The Philippines already appears to have lost effective control of one of the best-known places of contention, a reef called Scarborough Shoal, after Philippine forces withdrew during a standoff with China in 2012. The Philippine forces left as part of an American-mediated deal in which both sides were to pull back while the dispute was negotiated. Chinese forces remained, however, and gained control.In his nearly four years as president, Mr. Aquino, 53, has exceeded expectations in his country and the region for what he would be able to accomplish in a nation once known as the \u201csick man of Asia.\u201d He was a fairly low-key senator when he was propelled into the presidency in 2010 by a wave of national sympathy after his mother, former President Corazon C. Aquino, died the year before.Political analysts say that his administration has fought and reduced the corruption that played a role in holding the Philippines back. In one practical measure of that change, the country has been able to pave more roads per 100 million pesos in spending (about $2.2 million) than before \u2014 when funds were lost to corrupt officials and incompetence \u2014 finally addressing an impediment to commerce.All of the major credit rating agencies now give the Philippines an investment grade rating, though the recent downturn in share prices and currencies here and in other emerging markets, on fears of further slowing of the Chinese economy, poses an immediate challenge.In another accomplishment, Mr. Aquino\u2019s negotiators concluded a major peace agreement last month with the main resistance group on Mindanao, the heavily Muslim southern island. Still, the deal remains something of a gamble; it is based in good part on the Muslim group\u2019s ability to hold in check smaller resistance groups, which criticized the pact almost immediately.Despite those successes, Mr. Aquino was criticized for the country\u2019s slow initial response to last year\u2019s devastating typhoon. He said the storm was so powerful that it overwhelmed the Philippines\u2019 many preparations. He has also been less aggressive on land reform \u2014 the Aquinos are among the country\u2019s biggest landowning families \u2014 and he has preferred to shift more of the government\u2019s social spending to poor villages instead. Walden Bello, although a congressman in the president\u2019s governing coalition, said he was one of many who believe that \u201cthe lack of real progress on land reform is a real reason why poverty rates have remained\u201d at high levels.Analysts say the almost feudal power of some entrenched families, including some with militias, is a further obstacle to growth. But Mr. Aquino said he was trying to convince the families that becoming less insular would foster greater prosperity. Mr. Aquino is prevented by law from seeking re-election when his six-year term expires in 2016, raising uncertainty about whether his changes will continue.In the wide-ranging interview on Tuesday, Mr. Aquino said he thought the Philippines and the United States were close to a long-delayed deal that would allow more American troops to rotate through the Philippines, enhancing his country\u2019s security. But the subject remains controversial among the political elite in the Philippines, with memories of the country\u2019s past as an American possession making them wary of closer military ties. The United States is pushing for the deal to aid in its rebalance to Asia, where it hopes to retain a strong influence despite China\u2019s rise.Speaking of the Philippines\u2019 own tensions with the Chinese, Mr. Aquino said his country would not renounce any of its possessions in the sea between it and China. China contends that centuries-old maps show that it had an early claim to the South China Sea almost to Borneo. It is trying to use its large and growing fleet to exercise effective control over reefs and islands in the sea, a strategy that could strengthen its legal position.At the same time, China has strongly resisted applying the procedures and numerical formulas of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to the many reefs and islands that lie much closer to countries like the Philippines than to China. Officials in Beijing also oppose multilateral discussions, preferring bilateral talks with individual countries in Southeast Asia, an approach that allows Chinese leaders to apply greater pressure.While China has been improving its military, Mr. Aquino noted that the last flight by a Philippine fighter jet was in 2005 and that the plane dated from before the Vietnam War. Most of the country\u2019s tiny naval and coast guard fleet dates from World War II.The difficulties with China extend beyond the arguments over the South China Sea. The Hong Kong government, with enthusiastic backing from the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing, plans to stop allowing 14-day visa-free visits by Filipino diplomats and officials starting Wednesday. The sanctions are part of a long-running demand by Hong Kong that the national government of the Philippines apologize over a violent episode in 2010 in which a hostage rescue attempt in Manila failed, leaving eight Hong Kong citizens dead.In his first public response to the sanctions, Mr. Aquino said he had no plans to apologize, saying that doing so could create a legal liability and noting that China had not paid compensation to the families of Filipinos who have died in episodes there.Mr. Aquino, who is not married, lives in a small cottage behind the presidential palace instead of in the luxurious palace itself. He said he tries to relax before going to sleep each night either by listening to music \u2014 often jazz \u2014 or pursuing his passion as an amateur historian, reading military journals, some about World War II.While recently reading about the predicament of Czechoslovakia\u2019s leaders in the late 1930s, he said, he saw a parallel \u201cin a sense\u201d to his own problems now in facing challenges from China. Appeasement did not work in 1938, he noted; within six months of the surrender of the Sudetenland, Germany occupied most of the rest of Czechoslovakia. The Philippines, he said, is determined not to make similar concessions. \u201cYou may have the might,\u201d he said of China, \u201cbut that does not necessarily make you right.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canadian Firm Buys Tower on Park Avenue", "Date": "2014-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Canadian investment firm has agreed to pay $575 million for a 33-story office tower at Park Avenue and 57th Street in the latest indication of a soaring real estate market spurred by foreign investment.The tower, 450 Park Avenue, is in Midtown East, a neighborhood where chic retailers pay some of the highest rents in the world and developers are now erecting tall, slim buildings with $95 million condominiums. The sale price for 450 Park, whose tenants include hedge funds, private equity companies and law firms, represents a remarkable comeback for a building that last sold for a record $509 million in 2007, a year before the market collapsed after a debt-fueled real estate boom.It will be one of the highest prices ever paid for a Manhattan office building, over $1,700 per square foot. But Oxford is betting that the property will become more valuable when the developer Harry B. Macklowe completes the tallest residential tower in the Western Hemisphere, a 1,398-foot skyscraper next door at 432 Park Avenue.\u201cIt\u2019s one of those irreplaceable locations,\u201d Dan Fasulo, a managing director of Real Capital Analytics, said. \u201cThis could be a unique deal where both the seller and the buyer end up winning.\u201dThe sale of the trophy tower at 450 Park follows other high-profile deals last year that attracted bidders from around the world, including the $1.1 billion sale of the Sony Building on Madison Avenue, the $1.36 billion sale of 650 Madison Avenue and the $1.54 billion sale of 7 Times Square.\u201cA lot of pension funds, Asian companies, sovereign funds and other investors are increasing their allocations for real estate,\u201d said Douglas L. Harmon of Eastdil Secured, the broker on the Park Avenue deal. \u201cIf you do that, the first place you want to be is Manhattan.\u201d Oxford has been an active investor in New York. The company is a partner with Related Companies in a $15 billion commercial and residential development over the rail yards on the West Side of Manhattan.Chinese companies, like Fosun International, which bought Chase Manhattan Plaza last year for $725 million, have gotten a lot of attention. But Canadian companies, Mr. Fasulo said, are by far the most active foreign buyers in the city. The fate of 450 Park did not always look so good. Somerset and Mr. Tabor set a record \u2014 the highest price on a square-foot basis \u2014 in summer 2007 when they paid $509 million for the 334,404-square-foot building. Over the next year, the economy collapsed, severely wounding most investors who had bought buildings with mostly borrowed money at the height of the real estate boom.But unlike other buyers, Keith Rubenstein, a principal at Somerset, said his company had borrowed only 30 percent of the purchase price for the deal. They had poured most of their profits from the 2007 sale of 85 10th Avenue for $425 million, $136 million more than they had paid in 2005, into the purchase of 450 Park.Mr. Rubenstein said the company then bought out the leases of its small retail tenants and then signed a lucrative deal with the auction house Phillips de Pury & Company to lease all of the ground floor space.More recently, Somerset brought in Mr. Harmon, Adam Spies and Kevin Donner from Eastdil to handle the sale of the property. Mr. Harmon\u2019s team is on a roll, having sold the Sony Building, 650 Madison and the office space at Time Warner Center. Ultimately, more than a half-dozen finalists bid for 450 Park.\u201cWe survived because we only had 30 percent leverage,\u201d Mr. Rubenstein said. \u201cIt turned out to be one of the best investments we ever made.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Politics to Shadow Obama\u2019s Trade Talks in Mexico", "Date": "2014-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOLUCA, Mexico \u2014 President Obama traveled to Mexico on Wednesday for a brief but politically fraught visit aimed at forging closer trade ties with America\u2019s two closest neighbors even as his party\u2019s leaders back home have vowed to undercut his efforts.Mr. Obama will meet with the leaders of Mexico and Canada in this rapidly growing city, to the west of Mexico City, the capital, at what his advisers consider a critical juncture in his efforts to negotiate a broad Asian-Pacific trade pact that would encompass roughly 40 percent of the global economy across a dozen nations. Both Mexico and Canada have joined the negotiations in the last two years.The whirlwind visit \u2014 he will return to Washington on Wednesday evening without staying the night \u2014 will offer Mr. Obama a chance to reassure his counterparts about his capacity to deliver at a time when he faces significant hurdles at home. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leaders in Congress, oppose legislation giving him authority similar to that of his predecessors to negotiate trade deals.Michael B. Froman, the president\u2019s trade representative, tried to reassure Democrats on Tuesday that the administration would be sensitive to their concerns about workplace and environmental standards in putting together the new trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. He noted that as a candidate, Mr. Obama promised to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as Nafta.\u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing in TPP, upgrading our trading relationships not only with Mexico and Canada but with nine other countries as well,\u201d Mr. Froman said in a speech at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group in Washington.That assertion drew scorn from critics. \u201cI don\u2019t think that expanding on the Nafta model and extending it to nine more nations was what the unions, environmental groups or Democratic Party activists had in mind when Obama said he would renegotiate Nafta,\u201d said Lori Wallach, a trade expert at Public Citizen, a liberal advocacy group.President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico, who will host Mr. Obama and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada, will want to use the summit meeting to gauge Mr. Obama\u2019s commitment to the negotiations.\u201cHe wants the idea of North America to be relaunched,\u201d said Gustavo Vega, an expert on United States-Mexican relations at the Colegio de M\u00e9xico in Mexico City. He pointed to a sense among Mexican officials that the country\u2019s importance to the United States economy had been forgotten since Nafta went into effect two decades ago and had been overshadowed by China. \u201cThey are trying to say to Obama and to Harper, \u2018We are important.\u2019\u00a0\u201dTrade advocates cited their own statistics to defend the treaty. In testimony to Congress last month, Carla A. Hills, who was the elder President George Bush\u2019s trade representative and helped put together Nafta, said all sides had gained through the increased flow of goods and investment. \u201cAs a result of the market openings created by the Nafta, economic activity among the three nations exploded,\u201d she said.Mr. Obama\u2019s trip comes at a complex time for Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, whose star is shining brighter abroad than it is at home. Legislators recently have approved broad changes to Mexico\u2019s education system, tax system and antitrust regulation. Most important, they agreed to open up the country\u2019s closed energy industry, raising the prospect of foreign investment in Mexican oil and gas for the first time in 75 years. But ordinary Mexicans have yet to see many benefits. The economy grew only an estimated 1.3 percent last year.On security, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has pulled back from his predecessor\u2019s close cooperation with the United States, but the emergence of powerful vigilante groups battling a drug cartel in Michoac\u00e1n State forced him to address security problems, and he sent soldiers and the police there last month to restore order.Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts to pass immigration changes will also come up. While he had hopes for a bipartisan compromise, Republicans recently said they doubted legislation would pass this year.Ms. Hills said Tuesday that the Toluca meeting \u201cprovides an outstanding opportunity\u201d for the three leaders to agree \u201con concrete actions like collaborating on trade positions in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and moving forward on regulatory compatibility\u201d to make North America more competitive.But Peter Hakim, president emeritus of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington research group, said that \u201cthe significance of the visit has fallen precipitously\u201d with Mr. Obama\u2019s fading hopes for immigration legislation or trade authority. \u201cIf no progress can be made on either, what\u2019s the point?\u201d he asked. \u201cThings now look like the tripartite meeting will be reduced to a celebration of Mexico progress on reforms plus a lot of what-ifs.\u201dPeter Baker reported from Washington, and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Just Like His Power, Ukrainian Ex-Leader Vanishes Into Thin Air", "Date": "2014-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDONETSK, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s acting government on Monday declared the former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, a fugitive sought for mass murder, but it seemed at a loss to find the man whose authority had crumbled over the weekend.Accompanied only by one of his oldest and toughest partners in business and politics, a handful of loyal guards and perhaps his girlfriend, Mr. Yanukovych vanished late Sunday night, driving off in a three-car convoy and severing all communication.The new government, notably scorned by neighboring Russia, faces an array of enormous tasks: how to guarantee law and order in a country where discredited police and politicians of all stripes command no loyalty; a crumbling economy veering on bankruptcy; a yawning cultural gap between east and west. But perhaps no immediate priority ranks quite as high as finding the man now universally blamed \u2014 even by his recent political allies \u2014 for the carnage last week in Kiev and for the corrupt and decrepit conditions in this former Soviet republic of 46 million.The government made its chief appeal on Monday through the Facebook account of the interim interior minister, Arsen Avakov, who apparently decided to publicize his quest for Mr. Yanukovych in hopes that Ukrainians, and border guards in particular, would prevent him from fleeing.As Mr. Avakov told it, the flight of Ukraine\u2019s most important fugitive was an escape odyssey worthy of James Bond.It began on Friday, with the signing of a compromise accord brokered by the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Poland. At the ceremony, Mr. Yanukovych, a tall, usually blustery 63-year-old, was still Ukraine\u2019s president, but uncharacteristically grim and taciturn.He apparently never returned to his official residence \u2014 the sumptuous spread ogled by his stunned citizens after it was handed over to opposition forces early Saturday. By then, the president was on the run, maybe with his girlfriend, 24 years his junior, clinging to the dwindling spoils of his evaporating presidency in a dash by helicopter and road.Eventually, his entourage bolted into the night late Sunday in the region of Crimea, riding in a three-car cavalcade and cutting, as Mr. Avakov wrote Monday, \u201call forms of communication.\u201dMr. Avakov was hoping that someone would find the fugitive, much as Iraqis and American forces hunted for Saddam Hussein, or Libyans for Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.Apparently fearing their fate \u2014 Hussein was hanged after a peremptory trial, Colonel Qaddafi shot by opponents while on the run \u2014 Mr. Yanukovych fled.He headed by helicopter for his political base in eastern Ukraine, but found no comfort. First, he failed to join allies gathering in Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second city. Next, moving again by helicopter, Mr. Yanukovych found the authorities blocking takeoff of two private Falcon jets awaiting him at the airport in his hometown, Donetsk. He fled again, this time by car, headed for the Crimean Peninsula, a stronghold of his Russian allies where the Kremlin\u2019s Black Sea fleet is based at the port of Sevastopol.Once there, Mr. Avakov said, the fugitive holed up in a private sanitarium before heading for Belbek Airport, in the south of the peninsula. Apparently alerted to waiting authorities there, Mr. Yanukovych assembled his security detail, asked who would remain with him and who would quit, and then fled anew with Andriy Klyuyev, most recently head of his administration and a partner in business and politics since their rise together in Donetsk, a tough coal-mining town.The town, apparently, was also the birthplace of 39-year-old Lyubov Polezhay, who was identified by Dmitry Gnap, author of a blog on the site of the newspaper Ukrainskaya Pravda, as the president\u2019s girlfriend.According to the website, documents and photographs found in Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s sprawling residence just outside Kiev pointed to Ms. Polezhay, not his wife of over 40 years, Ludmila, as his live-in companion. Ms. Polezhay\u2019s daughter, Maria, 12, apparently lived in the presidential residence, too, and attended a select private school with the children of foreign residents of Kiev, the blog suggested.Mrs. Yanukovych is said to have retreated to Donetsk, where local journalists working for Donskiye Novosti said she and the president\u2019s son, Oleksandr, who is said to have amassed a fortune during his father\u2019s rule, had been among the residents of a complex surrounded by a 12-foot wall on the city outskirts.That complex appeared deserted on Monday. At the main entrance, a guardhouse was empty, except for a disconnected computer monitor and keyboard. Doorbells rung at neighboring houses went unanswered. However, steam rose from one large wing of the main residence, and ventilators were running.The Yanukovych clan apparently always planned on a longer stay in this complex of perhaps a dozen homes adjacent to an iced-over lake. Both inside and outside the forbidding walls, dozens of young trees have been planted, some coniferous, others starkly bare on a wintry day.Equally bleak was the description given by the governor of the Donetsk region \u2014 with 4.7 million inhabitants, the country\u2019s most populous \u2014 of his last contacts with Mr. Yanukovych, the man who had plucked him from a factory directorship to politics in 2010.\u201cIn the last three months,\u201d the governor, Andrei V. Shishatsky, said at a news conference, \u201cI did not have a personal meeting with Yanukovych \u2014 only phone calls.\u201d\u201cI think the recordings will be found by the new powers,\u201d he said, referring to the acting government. \u201cAnd that will show \u2014 I listened.\u201dWhile speculation persisted that Mr. Yanukovych and his dwindling entourage might seek sanctuary in Russia, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Yuriy A. Sergeyev, who joined the chorus of Ukrainians denouncing the ousted president, cast doubt on whether he would be welcomed in Russia, or anywhere else.\u00a0\u201cWho will host these crooks?\u201d Mr. Sergeyev asked reporters at the United Nations.\u00a0Reporting was contributed by Andrew E. Kramer and Oksana Lyachynska from Kiev, Ukraine; Andrew Roth from Moscow; and Somini Sengupta from the United Nations.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Young Laotians Learn Chinese to Improve Job Prospects", "Date": "2014-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational EducationVIENTIANE, Laos \u2014 On alternate mornings, in a sparsely furnished classroom at a private school in the Laotian capital, Liphakone Ratthida and a dozen of his classmates converse in Chinese and study China\u2019s history and culture.Though he goes by the Chinese name Li Panda, Mr. Ratthida is not of Chinese ancestry, nor has he been to China. His experience of China is limited to Chinese period dramas on Laotian television and stories from cousins who have studied there. \u201cWhat I know about China is that it has many luxurious buildings,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in China, the universities are better, and the jobs pay better.\u201d Like many other young Laotians taking Chinese classes, Mr. Ratthida, 19, is learning the language in the hope of working for Chinese companies, which are investing heavily in Laos, an underdeveloped country of 6.5 million people. The recent influx of Chinese companies has brought jobs and the promise of higher salaries.\u201cIn future, there will be a lot of Chinese companies coming to Laos,\u201d said Mr. Ratthida, who is studying international economics and trade at Soochow University in Laos, which is mainland China\u2019s first university campus abroad. \u201cIt is easier to find work at a Chinese company if I can speak the language.\u201d Many Chinese schools have sprung up in towns along the Laos-China border, while Chinese schools in Vientiane are gaining popularity and Laotian schools are starting to offer Chinese classes. Laotian government officials are among the parents choosing to put their children in such schools.\u201cWe have many government officials who send their kids to our school,\u201d said Lin Junxiong, director and principal of the Lieu Tou Chinese School, which opened in 1937 and is Vientiane\u2019s oldest Chinese school. \u201cIt is a common sight to see police cars waiting outside the school gate. These parents want their children to study Chinese because the Chinese economy is booming and it is an advantage if they know the language.\u201d Lieu Tou has seen a spike in enrollment over the past few years. It now has about 2,400 students from kindergarten through high school, a 10 percent increase from a year ago. \u201cIn the past, we have 30 students in a class \u2014 now we have 40 to 50 students per class,\u201d Mr. Lin said. \u201cMany good students cannot enroll into this school because we have limited classrooms and teachers.\u201d The school has 160 teachers, 29 of them from China on two-year stints paid for by the Chinese government. Students learn Lao and Chinese from kindergarten, with English introduced in primary school. Although 10 percent of the students are of Chinese ancestry \u2014 Laos has an ethnic Chinese population estimated at 1 to 2 percent \u2014 most speak no Chinese when they start, Mr. Lin said.Xaynousone Oudomsap, an 18-year-old high school student at Lieu Tou, has been learning Chinese for 13 years and has two younger sisters in the same school.\u201cAt first, it was difficult learning Chinese because of the complex characters and the different tones,\u201d she said. \u201cNowadays, there are more international companies in Laos, and it would be easier to find a job if you know more than one language.\u201dChina\u2019s economic influence can be felt throughout Laos, a landlocked country. Chinese companies are building factories and constructing dams on the Mekong River and will soon begin an ambitious high-speed rail project to link Vientiane with Kunming, the capital of the southern Chinese province of Yunnan.Special economic zones have also emerged along the border to encourage Chinese businesses to invest. Near Wattay International Airport, hundreds of Chinese vendors ply their wares at the San Jiang International Market, which is owned by Chinese and known as the Chinese Market.\u201cIt is like stepping into China,\u201d said Nina Phanouvong, an 18-year-old student at Lieu Tou. \u201cThey sell everything Chinese, such as food, clothes and furniture. They even have fake iPhones.\u201d Soochow University, which opened its Vientiane branch last year, is also trying to find a market for its degrees in Laos at a time when top Western universities are looking to enter China. Another mainland Chinese university, Xiamen University, is planning a campus in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\u201cOnly by going out can we close in on the top Chinese universities, and we think Laos is a suitable location to begin,\u201d said Wang Jiexian, vice president of Soochow\u2019s Vientiane campus. Soochow is the first foreign university to receive approval from the Laotian government to provide degree programs. The campus offers courses in Laotian law, Chinese literature, economics and trade, as well as Chinese.\u201cBy the time they graduate, all our students will be able to speak Chinese,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cThey can speak at least two languages, understand the cultures of the two countries and work well in a Chinese company here.\u201d The campus now operates from temporary premises in suburban Vientiane, pending development of a 57-acre permanent site on former village land on the fringes of the city. The permanent campus has been designed to house 5,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students, but its completion date is uncertain because of a land dispute. This year, Soochow has 50 students enrolled in undergraduate programs and 100 registered in evening classes. Undergraduates will spend a year attending classes in Laos before continuing three years of their education on the main campus, which is in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou and has a student population of over 41,000.The fees are not low by local standards.

{"Headline": "Bank of England Shifts on Factors That Could Prompt a Rate Increase", "Date": "2014-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The Bank of England on Wednesday abandoned its six-month-old strategy of pledging to consider raising interest rates only when unemployment falls to 7 percent, saying it would now take a number of factors into account.Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, also stressed that higher interest rates were still some way off and that any increase would be gradual. The central bank also raised its growth forecast for 2014 again, to 3.4 percent from 2.8 percent which it had forecast in November.Overhauling his forward guidance strategy, Mr. Carney said that decisions on a rate increase would now be linked to a broader range of factors, including spare capacity in the economy, labor productivity and wage growth.\u201cAs yet the recovery is neither balanced nor sustainable,\u201d Mr. Carney told a news conference, adding that the central bank would take no risks with the fragile economic rebound.Securing the recovery could be achieved by \u201cwaiting to raise the bank rate until spare capacity has been absorbed further and then eventually through gradual and limited rate increases. Bank rates may need to stay at low levels for some time to come,\u201d Mr. Carney said.As in Britain, the economic outlook has improved in the United States, where the Federal Reserve has cut back on the bond-buying part of its stimulus effort. When it comes to interest rates, and linking them to the unemployment rate, the Fed has also made adjustments in its guidance.In 2012, the Fed said that it planned to keep short-term interest rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent. The Fed revised that in December, saying it was likely to maintain that policy well past that threshold. Some Fed officials have said there is a need now for greater clarity about their plans because the jobless rate has since fallen to 6.6 percent.Overtaken by events, the British central bank has had little alternative but to review its August pledge to start considering raising interest rates, from a current record low of 0.5 percent, only when the unemployment rate falls to 7 percent.Years of record low interest rates and other government stimulus measures have helped revive the economy and push unemployment close to that 7 percent threshold years earlier than the central bank had anticipated.However, Mr. Carney argued that his policy \u201cis working\u201d and had instilled business confidence by giving more certainty, helping growth prospects. Even critics of forward guidance had not predicted such a sharp fall in unemployment, he said, while admitting that the central bank had learned from its experience.The speed with which the central bank has had to change strategy raises some awkward questions about its credibility nonetheless. The policy was introduced with much fanfare by Mr. Carney as he took over as Bank of England governor in the summer, when the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent and Britain\u2019s economy was in much need of support.Some economists have said the policy lacked credibility from the start because the unemployment rate threshold was too high, leaving investors and consumers wondering about how soon interest rates would rise again.Robert Wood, an economist at Berenberg bank in London, welcomed Wednesday\u2019s move, which he said was \u201can abrupt U-turn\u201d and marked a return to \u201cinflation targeting, with a few bells and whistles attached.\u201d The bank said inflation had returned to its 2 percent target and suggested it would remain under control during the next three years.The pound jumped on Wednesday, suggesting that financial markets were factoring in a rate increase in 2015 despite Mr. Carney\u2019s comments. Brian Hilliard, chief economist for Britain at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in London, said the Bank of England might see the positive side of a rise in the value of sterling, which would help reduce inflation.But he added that the bank would be disappointed that the markets had not believed that interest rates would stay low for some time. Mr. Carney\u2019s updated forward guidance gave \u201cno firm message,\u201d Mr. Hilliard said.\u201cHis guidance today was no surprise but the strength of the growth forecast was,\u201d Mr. Hilliard said, adding that this suggested that spare capacity in the economy might be absorbed relatively quickly, leading to higher interest rates.Mr. Carney\u2019s comments about the unbalanced nature of the recovery highlight the difficult juggling act he faces. While growth in Britain is impressive by European standards, much of it appears driven by consumer demand. Productivity growth has been disappointing and there is a risk of a property bubble developing in the southeast of England.A rise in interest rates might choke off recovery and push up the value of the pound sterling, which has appreciated against the euro in recent months.In a sign that the economic recovery in Britain is gaining momentum, the unemployment rate fell to 7.1 percent in the three months through November from 7.8 percent in the summer, when the Bank of England announced its forward guidance strategy. At the time, the bank did not expect unemployment to fall that low until 2016. Now it expects to have data by the spring showing that the rate reached 7 percent in January.As the economic outlook improved, more economists started to expect the Bank of England to start raising rates earlier than 2016.Britain\u2019s main business lobby group, the Confederation of British Industry, welcomed Mr. Carney\u2019s policy shift. \u201cThe bank\u2019s new guidance will give businesses further peace of mind that interest rates will stay low for some time, until investment and incomes are growing at sustainable rates,\u201d said Katja Hall, the body\u2019s chief policy director. \u201cThe bank has made clear that even when the economy is operating at more normal levels, rates will only increase gradually.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the Bank of England\u2019s November forecast for 2014 economic growth. It was 2.8 percent, not 2.9 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Signs of Progress, Security Issues Rise in Tunisia", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTUNIS \u2014 At the end of a 20-hour gun battle with the police in a northern borough here, a bearded man emerged from the besieged house, his rifle above his head. Residents watching from a street corner saw him kneel, lay down the weapon and reach for his vest. Then a government sniper shot him dead.Seven gunmen and one member of the National Guard were killed in the firefight, the most serious clash with armed insurgents in the Tunisian capital since a popular uprising began three years ago. It also stood as a security alert for the new government as it welcomed the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and other foreign dignitaries on Friday to celebrate the adoption of a new Constitution.Security has become the most pressing issue in Tunisia as the country tries to move forward with its democratic transition and rescue its still declining economy, which depends heavily on tourism and foreign investment. Both have fallen since the revolution of 2011 that overthrew the country\u2019s longtime dictator, President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali.Yet few Tunisians feel comforted. Residents of Raoued said there was little sympathy for terrorists, but also little confidence in the police who, despite new training and equipment, are still tarnished by a reputation for cruelty and injustice from the years of dictatorship. And while the Tunisian government has announced the successful defeat of various terrorist cells, young men continue to voice support for Ansar al-Shariah and are traveling to Libya for jihadi training.\u201cWe will never abandon the movement or change the name of the movement,\u201d said one member of the group, who asked that his named not be published for fear of police surveillance but was keen to show his defiance.Tunisia \u2014 the smallest country of North Africa by land mass, and with a population of 11 million \u2014 failed to contain the spread of violence in the months after its revolution. But it is also being buffeted by the growth of extremism regionally, fueled by the newfound freedoms created by the Arab Spring, a return of jihadi leaders from abroad or from jail and the near-collapse of the Libyan state after the fall of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.There are training camps specifically for Tunisian militants in western Libya, 15 to 20 miles from the Tunisian border, Hamadi Jebali, the former prime minister and secretary general of the Islamist party Ennahda, said at a news conference Wednesday.Groups of Islamist fighters have also set up bases in the Chaambi mountains in western Tunisia bordering Algeria with the aim of creating a haven along the border, where the insurgents can cross the border at will and evade military operations against them. From their bases they move down into the villages and towns to find recruits, Mr. Jebali said.To date, the militants have limited their attacks mostly to the security forces, primarily in the small towns and villages of central Tunisia. The area that stretches from the capital to the western border with Algeria is impoverished, dotted with olive groves but little else.In October a small group of gunmen ambushed a National Guard vehicle on the edge of the town of Sidi Ali Ben Aoun, killing six guardsmen. Two of the insurgents were killed in the ensuing gunfight, one of them an Algerian, according to the government. Others escaped, forcing the army to mount a large operation to go after them with helicopters and armored vehicles in the scrubby hills behind the town.Just days earlier, another group of young men were killed in a clash with the National Guard near the town of Goubellat, roughly halfway between the capital and the Algerian border. Two guardsmen were gunned down when they checked on a farmhouse on the edge of town. The police pursued the rest of the group into a forest behind the farmhouse, killing six and capturing one who was wounded.It is not clear who opened fire on the guardsmen, but those killed at Goubellat were by no means hardened jihadi. They were former school friends from the borough of Kram in central Tunis who, their families insisted, had no previous involvement with weapons or violence.\u201cThey were friends \u2014 they did martial arts together,\u201d said Munir Khazri, the brother of one of those killed.Another of the dead, Yasin Hedi, 21, was to be married in February and talked constantly of his wedding plans and the type of cake he would offer his wife, said his father, Hassan Hedi. His son, who was overweight and had a disability, was no radical, nor was he capable of fighting jihad, Mr. Hedi said.He accused the police of killing his son rather than arresting him, and of mutilating his body. \u201cThe police are the terrorists,\u201d Mr. Hedi said. \u201cHe was not a terrorist.\u201dTwo of the six killed were Salafis, however, members of the Sunni fundamentalist movement that has won adherents among the young and unemployed across North Africa. Their families insist that their activities were peaceful. One, Hamdi Khazri, was an imam at 23 and knew the Quran by heart. \u201cThose guys were really innocent,\u201d said a 27-year-old Salafi named Muhammad, who knew them and who declined to give his full name to avoid police attention. \u201cThey never did anything nor caused any problems,\u201d he said, adding that he would not say the same of himself.Therein lies the essential problem facing the Tunisian government. The Salafi movement, although dented by the police actions against Ansar al-Shariah, remains popular among the youth in many impoverished neighborhoods across Tunisia.Many of the young men of Kram, a lower middle-class, mostly rural neighborhood of recent immigrants to the city, find themselves drawn to the movement and attend prayers at a Salafi-run mosque in the neighborhood. By outlawing Salafism, the fastest-growing Islamist movement in North Africa, the government has alienated a large following.Muhammad described the Salafi movement and Ansar al-Shariah as one and the same thing. Ansar means \u201chelpers\u201d in Arabic, and their followers were missionaries, intent on spreading God\u2019s word through peaceful means, he said.He complained of police injustice, a news media that unfairly branded all Salafis as terrorists and a government that cared little for the poor. But he said the only way he was seeking change was through prayer.\u201cI do not have the power to fight them with violence,\u201d he said, \u201cand God will be powerful enough to do it.\u201dAn article on Feb. 8 about the persistence of extremist violence in Tunisia that for many Tunisians has cast into doubt the government\u2019s pledges to bolster the weak economy and fledgling democracy referred imprecisely to a distinction held by the country. While it is considered the smallest country of North Africa, that distinction is based on its land mass. (Others are smaller in population.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thailand\u2019s Democratic Way Out", "Date": "2014-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBANGKOK \u2014 The Thai people will go to the ballot box on Sunday, but there is little chance that the voting will break the political deadlock that is crippling the country.Bangkok has been at an uneasy standstill for almost three months, tugged at by different parties in different directions. On one side are the caretaker government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and the ruling Pheu Thai Party, which was elected in July 2011 on promises to redistribute wealth to the lower-middle classes and the poor. Opposite them are the protesters who have rallied around the People\u2019s Democratic Reform Committee, a Bangkok-based movement that wants to topple the government, which it sees as hopelessly corrupt. Somewhere in between are the Thais who want to see democratic rule upheld at all cost, even if in the near term that position indirectly benefits the current regime.The reset options that have worked in past times of crisis \u2014 a royal intervention or a military coup \u2014 do not appear to be in the offing. And Sunday\u2019s election won\u2019t solve the fundamental problem, which is that Thai democracy is thin. It places too much emphasis on the legitimizing veneer of elections and not enough on mechanisms to protect the interests of the political minority. King Bhumibol Adulyadej has acted as arbiter during other stalemates: In May 1992, he famously persuaded two battling politicians responsible for clashes in the streets of Bangkok to step back from the brink. His moral authority remains unrivaled today, but he is 86 and there have been no signs so far that he might intervene.The military, which has staged many coups since 1932, when the country\u2019s first constitution was proclaimed, is reluctant to step in again, despite the exhortations of the P.D.R.C. leader Suthep Thaugsuban, a veteran of the opposition Democrat Party until he resigned to head the protest movement. The last putsch, in 2006, yielded mixed results, including an election that brought to power a controversial party controlled by Ms. Yingluck\u2019s older brother, Thaksin, whose legacy of corruption is one cause of the ongoing protests. And whatever one thinks of Ms. Yingluck\u2019s regime, she was elected democratically. Were the military to carry out a coup against her, the top brass would risk international condemnation, in addition to a backlash from the so-called Red Shirts, pro-government supporters largely from the north and northeast of the country.And so all eyes are on the early election Ms. Yingluck called for Feb. 2. The anti-government camp has opposed holding the vote before political reforms to clean up the government are implemented. Yet putting it off would outrage pro-government supporters, who decry the protesters\u2019 tactics as a form of undemocratic blackmail.Advance voting started on Jan. 26 amid growing street violence, including several grenade attacks. Meanwhile, the Democrat Party \u2014 whose members resigned from Parliament to join the protest movement \u2014 announced that it would boycott polling on Sunday. In some constituencies in the south, the opposition\u2019s heartland, supporters of the Democrat Party have pressured candidates from other parties into not registering. In those areas, as well as anywhere advance voting was incomplete or where intimidation or violence disrupts voting on Sunday, additional elections will have to be held over the next several months \u2014 a recipe for more political instability.The only way forward for Thailand is to hold reforms in order to strike a more viable balance between the majority and the minority. The Yingluck administration has deployed its unassailable parliamentary majority to ram through disastrous policies, such as an amnesty bill that would have absolved Thaksin of corruption charges. But electoral winners cannot do as they please after scoring at the ballot box; they must accommodate the interests of the losers more openly and more systematically.On the other hand, the electoral minority should not hold the country hostage to get its way. Mr. Suthep\u2019s camp has blocked parts of central Bangkok, obstructed advance voting and called for overthrowing Ms. Yingluck \u2014 all in the name of creating a \u201cpeople\u2019s council\u201d to spearhead reforms. His attempt at such a citizens\u2019 coup has polarized Thailand and put off foreign investors, diplomats and tourists.Rather than trying to seize power without regard for the will of the majority of Thai people who elected Ms. Yingluck, Mr. Suthep and the P.D.R.C. must make concrete demands and propose an actionable agenda on good governance that is acceptable to other parties. And the Yingluck government must address those grievances, by making political reforms a top national priority.A timetable should be set, and the reform process should be supervised by a nonpartisan third party. Watchdog bodies like the Constitutional Court and the National Anti-Corruption Commission have important roles to play, so long as they refrain from partisanship.In return for concrete steps toward greater transparency and accountability in government, the P.D.R.C. should disband and the Democrat Party should re-enter the electoral fray. Thailand\u2019s political system is broken, but it must be fixed from within, and in keeping with the rules of electoral democracy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Religious Right in Arizona Cheers Bill Allowing Businesses to Refuse to Serve Gays", "Date": "2014-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe business owners cited religious beliefs in declining to provide services celebrating same-sex relationships. And in each case, they were sued. But civil libertarians and gay rights advocates say there is a difference between protections for clergy and houses of worship that do not want to participate in same-sex marriage and the obligations of business owners that serve the general public.Last year she vetoed a similar religious freedom bill, arguing that it was a distraction from priorities lawmakers had yet to address, including the state budget. And there are similar circumstances this year, as legislators have yet to act on a package of proposed changes to the state\u2019s child welfare system, which has been plagued by a slow response to complaints of abuse and neglect.Chuck Coughlin, a public affairs consultant who led Ms. Brewer\u2019s transition team after she was elected governor in 2009 and has remained a close ally, said he was doubtful that she would sign the bill into law, saying, \u201cWe already have laws to sufficiently protect people\u2019s religion freedoms in this country, and this bill could actually empower people to discriminate.\u201dThe bill comes at an awkward time for Ms. Brewer, who has been eager to move beyond controversy in her last year in office (term limits prevent her from running for re-election.)In a letter to Ms. Brewer on Friday, Gonzalo A. de la Melena Jr., president and chief executive of the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said the bill, if it becomes law, would \u201cultimately have the effect of casting Arizona in a negative light that stands to damage our reputation nationwide and globally, and significantly harm our fiscal future.\u201dIt was just one in a chorus of pleas that the governor to veto the legislation.\u201cI make dinner for a living \u2014 I\u2019m not a social activist,\u201d Mr. DiGrazia said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut I do have a lot of gay customers and employees, and why are you trying to alienate these people?\u201dBut supporters of the legislation said they would also work hard to persuade Ms. Brewer to sign the measure, in part by disputing much of the criticism it has faced.Supporters and opponents of the Arizona legislation do not agree on its potential impact. The supporters say it would simply tweak an existing religious freedom law in Arizona to make it clear that private individuals can use religious freedom as a defense in civil litigation; the opponents say it would allow business owners to discriminate against anyone they do not like, citing religious freedom. \u201cArizona should be known as a state that welcomes people of faith and protects them,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are intentional, purposeful distractions to try to kill this bill.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Fed Learned to Talk", "Date": "2014-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionBINGHAMTON, N.Y. \u2014 IN his nearly 19 years as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan was notorious for speaking in an elliptical, oracular, even mystifying style. Mindful that a single errant syllable might cause markets to soar \u2014 or tumble \u2014 Mr. Greenspan mastered a language, \u201cFed-speak,\u201d so turgid that it made economics textbooks seem like children\u2019s literature by comparison.\u201cSince I\u2019ve become a central banker, I\u2019ve learned to mumble with great incoherence,\u201d Mr. Greenspan once boasted. \u201cIf I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.\u201dMr. Greenspan deliberately cultivated a reputation as an inscrutable \u201cmaestro,\u201d who used his mastery of reams of financial and economic data to pull the levers of monetary policy, keeping inflation in check but without stifling economic growth. Like the Wizard of Oz, he acted from behind a thick curtain.Those days are long gone. Partly but not only because of the global financial crisis \u2014 which caused the Fed to take unprecedented steps to stabilize the financial system, prevent big banks from going bust and keep interest rates low to stimulate the economy \u2014 the Fed communicates more than ever before. Once strong and silent, the central bank is now positively gushy. The change is not one of style, but of substance: For the Fed to be effective, it needs the public (and the markets) to listen clearly to what it says, and to act accordingly.Ms. Yellen, who led a Fed subcommittee on communication while serving under Mr. Bernanke, said that what happens to the federal funds rate (the Fed\u2019s core instrument of monetary policy) today, or in the next few weeks, is \u201crelatively unimportant.\u201d Instead, what matters is the public\u2019s expectation of how the Fed will use that rate to shape economic conditions over the next few years.That\u2019s because, she said, \u201csignificant spending decisions \u2014 expanding a business, buying a house or choosing how much to spend on consumer goods over the year \u2014 depend on expectations of income, employment and other economic conditions over the longer term, as well as longer-term interest rates.\u201dThe changes Ms. Yellen described have been a long time coming but have accelerated in recent years. It wasn\u2019t until 1994, about halfway through Mr. Greenspan\u2019s tenure, that the Fed\u2019s policy committee started to announce, after each meeting, any actions it had taken. Even more significantly, in 2003, as the economy still struggled to recover from the 2001 recession, the committee said its low interest rate policy would be \u201cmaintained for a considerable period.\u201d This was a big moment: \u201cFor the first time,\u201d Ms. Yellen said, \u201cthe committee was using communication \u2014 mere words \u2014 as its primary monetary policy tool.\u201dFor the last decade I\u2019ve studied the behavior of policy makers at the Fed, the European Central Bank and the central banks of England, Germany, New Zealand and Sweden. Their leaders have for decades searched for a new conceptual anchor for monetary affairs \u2014 no longer gold or fixed exchange rates, but an evolving relationship with the public. Communication has become a fulcrum of policy. Policy makers shape expectations and, thus, economic behavior.By the late 1990s a vast majority of the central banks had begun to incorporate elements of inflation targeting. The aim is to shape the expectations around the most fundamental dynamic of market economies: the evolution of prices. The experiments relied on theories going back decades. As far back as the 1930s, the economists Knut Wicksell, Irving Fisher and John Maynard Keynes proposed that price behavior was based in large part on expectations.The pronouncements by central banks, through statements, testimony and news conferences, endow the future with discernible features that we can reflect and act upon, animating or curtailing our propensities to produce, consume, borrow, lend and so on. Markets are, after all, a function of language.Ms. Yellen faces immense challenges: The most immediate is the gradual slowing of the policy of \u201cquantitative easing\u201d that the Fed has used to hold down interest rates, through large-scale purchase of bonds. Ms. Yellen has to continue to articulate the Fed\u2019s dual mandate \u2014 maximum employment and stable prices \u2014 to the markets, to consumers and to government officials. She will have to orchestrate and communicate decision making within the Fed, so that disagreements can enhance rather than diminish confidence in monetary policy. She also has the added burden, which the Fed has shouldered since the financial crisis, of ensuring the stability of the American financial system.Ms. Yellen is likely to continue the policies of Mr. Bernanke, who helped make Fed policy much more transparent. Like him, she will have to communicate to multiple audiences \u2014 members of Congress, the financial markets and consumers \u2014 who have come to expect clear and precise messages from the central bank.The incremental experiments with language and explanation pursued by the Fed over the last decade are setting a new relationship with the public, one in which ordinary people\u2019s predicaments are recognized and have come to serve as a fulcrum of policy. The days in which the leader of the Fed could mumble incoherently, obscuring his true intentions behind a cloud of verbiage, are gone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scots Can\u2019t Completely Sever Their Ties With Britain", "Date": "2014-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyOne can understand why Edinburgh is keen to keep the pound. If Scotland had its own free-floating currency, economic integration with the rest of Britain would partly become undone. Given that 60 percent of its exports and 70 percent of its imports are with the rest of Britain, such an unraveling would hit hard.Scotland would also be unable to support its outsize banking industry if it had its own currency. The Scottish banking industry is more than 12 times its gross domestic product \u2014 nearly double the ratio for Iceland, Ireland and Cyprus before their banking industries blew up. The Scottish people might also worry that a Scottish currency might fall in value, devaluing their savings.Joining the euro might not be any better. It would break up economic integration with the rest of Britain, while the euro zone might not be happy to support Scotland\u2019s giant banking industry. Added to that, the euro has suffered years of terrible publicity, so promising to join it would not be a vote-winner.No wonder Alex Salmond, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is promising a currency union with the rest of Britain. The snag is that such an arrangement would be virtually impossible to negotiate.Mark Carney, the Bank of England\u2019s governor, gave some of the background thinking in a speech in Edinburgh last week. He pointed out the dangers of having a currency union without the necessary institutional framework, using the euro crisis as a cautionary tale. For a start, there would have to be a so-called banking union \u2014 with common supervisory standards, access to central bank liquidity, common \u201cresolution\u201d mechanisms and a credible deposit guarantee scheme. He also said there would need to be \u201ctight fiscal rules, to enforce prudent behavior for all in the union.\u201dMr. Carney pulled his punches. A currency union would require far more than this. It would need a mechanism to prevent the union from breaking apart in response to destabilizing speculation. The euro zone struggled for nearly three years until Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, pledged to \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d to keep the currency together. Would the rest of Britain be prepared to do whatever it takes to keep Scotland in the sterling area, after its people had decided they did not want to be part of Britain?The Scottish government has made the task harder by saying that it might not want to keep the pound in the long run anyway. That lack of commitment could attract speculators. Then there\u2019s banking supervision. Common supervisory standards would not be enough. If the Bank of England was going to act as a lender of last resort to Scottish banks, it would presumably want to supervise them too. Another problem surrounds unorthodox monetary policy like quantitative easing. One of the reasons Britain and the United States are growing faster than the euro zone is that their central banks have been free to pursue such policies. The European Central Bank has found it hard to engage in quantitative easing because it is banned from bailing out individual governments.It\u2019s hard to see Britain giving up such useful tools. But it is equally hard to see why it would accept the possibility that it might have to bail out an independent Scotland. But the Scots would also feel they weren\u2019t being treaty fairly if quantitative easing could be used in the rest of Britain but not in Scotland.A similar thought applies to budgetary rules. While the rest of Britain would want to put Scotland in a fiscal straitjacket, it wouldn\u2019t want to limit its own freedom. The Scots would feel snubbed by such an asymmetrical deal.Then there\u2019s the question of how the Bank of England would be governed. Given that Scotland\u2019s economy and population are about 10 percent of all of Britain, one option would be to give it one member on the bank\u2019s monetary and financial policy committees for every nine from the rest of Britain. The hitch is it could then always be outvoted.An alternative would be to copy the euro zone, where every country \u2014 whether as big as Germany or as small as Malta \u2014 gets the same vote. But why would the rest of Britain agree to that?Mr. Salmond has threatened not to take on Scotland\u2019s share of Britain\u2019s debts if it is not allowed to join a currency union. But playing tough with a country that is nearly 10 times its size doesn\u2019t seem sensible.If it comes to tit-for-tat, the rest of Britain can hit Scotland much harder than Scotland can hit it. London could, for example, stop Edinburgh from joining the European Union. The only currency union to which it would be rational for the rest of Britain to agree would be a lopsided one in which Scotland\u2019s subservient role was glaringly apparent. Given that, one wonders whether the Scots wouldn\u2019t be better off just staying in Britain.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m reminded of those hikes today as the government works to ease the burden of the \u201cnational stretcher\u201d on Israeli society, in which fewer and fewer citizens are carrying an ever-heavier load.With extremely low labor participation, ultra-Orthodox Jews and Israeli-Arab women have unfortunately slipped into a situation of welfare and poverty. For ultra-Orthodox men, it stems from a refusal to serve in the military and instead to sign up for religious study in yeshivas. For Arab women, it has been the lack of education and a culture in which they are expected to stay at home. Already, just over a quarter of first graders in Israel are ultra-Orthodox. Israel will not be able to sustain itself if these children are not integrated into society and the labor market. Meanwhile, the secular and national religious camps \u2014 the backbone of the middle class \u2014 serve in the Israel Defense Forces, work and pay exorbitant taxes, reaching up to 50 percent of their income. This situation must end.My goal is to get ultra-Orthodox men and Arab women into the work force, to free them from the clutches of poverty, and to get the ultra-Orthodox to enlist in the I.D.F. It\u2019s true that Israel has a growing economy and impressive high-tech innovation. But it is time to recognize the mistakes that have led to the creation of two different economies and to take decisive action.The Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, is currently debating whether to take a historic step by passing legislation that would pave the way for ultra-Orthodox men to join the work force and serve in the Israel Defense Forces. I am aware of the political obstacles. Ultra-Orthodox politicians and rabbis are opposed to the implementation of this plan and are using all of their political influence to prevent us from succeeding.I have also paid a personal price. Historically, the National Religious Party, which my party \u2014 Jewish Home \u2014 is built upon, has aligned itself in consecutive Israeli governments with the ultra-Orthodox factions. By joining a government without ultra-Orthodox representation, we have become the target for their ongoing attacks, with some of my fellow party members having been heckled and harassed at public events.Under the bill, all ultra-Orthodox men would eventually be put on the same path as secular and national religious men \u2014 one of military service and employment. Over the next four years, they would be granted a grace period to pursue their personal ambitions. They would be allowed to continue studying in a yeshiva if they wished or to enlist in the military and join the work force. I expect they will choose the latter since they have the best incentive: avoiding poverty.This could do wonders for the economy. After receiving vocational training and education, this new source of talent would flow into Israel\u2019s work force in a way that has not been seen since the huge post-Soviet immigration of the 1990s, when some one million people immigrated to Israel. Like the integration of the ultra-Orthodox, bringing Israeli-Arab women into the labor market is also a major priority.The employment rate for Arab women in Israel is currently extremely low: just over 25 percent. My goal is to double it within the next five years.We are establishing 21 one-stop employment shops where Arab women from over 60 towns will be able to receive vocational training, small business loans and general business guidance.We are subsidizing day care so young mothers can go to work and we are, in some cases, even helping companies that hire Arab women by subsidizing up to 37 percent of the women\u2019s salaries for over two years. This will allow employers, who until now were reluctant to hire Arab women, to provide these women with the opportunity to work and support their families. The Israeli government has already established a fund to encourage young Arab women, specifically from the Bedouin community, to study engineering. We are funding their university studies and providing them with mentors who assist them with their studies and the job placement process. Transforming the labor market will not be easy. There is prejudice against both the ultra-Orthodox and the Arab community. Many of the Arab women live far away from main cities where the jobs are; and, in many cases, husbands prefer that their wives stay at home.But the Israeli economy belongs to both its Jewish and Arab citizens and the status quo simply cannot continue.Beyond easing the burden and spreading prosperity, these new initiatives will have a greater and more profound impact on Israel\u2019s national identity.In my previous career as a chief executive of high-tech companies, I experienced firsthand the endless possibilities when people from diverse backgrounds work together. They get to know one another and quickly learn that they share more in common than they originally thought. Just imagine the new Israeli workplace: Arab men and women sitting together with secular, ultra-Orthodox and national-religious Jewish men and women all focused on the same objective \u2014 advancing our economy and our country.Differences, which until then seemed insurmountable, would gradually disappear. In the army, the one thing that kept us going during those long \u201cstretcher hikes\u201d was the knowledge that, while they might be hard, we would eventually reach our destination.The Israeli economy is embarking on an uphill journey. And if all sectors of society pull together, we will succeed.Advertisement"}

Mr. Faulconer, 47, a former public relations executive, won with 55 percent of the vote, compared with 45 percent for his Democratic opponent, David Alvarez.The special election came nearly six months after Bob Filner, the city\u2019s first Democratic mayor in decades, resigned amid allegations that he had sexually harassed dozens of women, including many local leaders.\u201cTogether, we sent a very strong message tonight: that this city needs to have an independent leader, and that the city will stand up and work together,\u201d Mr. Faulconer told supporters in downtown San Diego. \u201cEvery San Diegan has a chance at success and has a seat at the table.\u201dMr. Faulconer said he would emphasize the \u201ctheme of inclusion,\u201d hoping to unify residents of a city worn down by the scandals of his predecessor. \u201cWe know that this city has gone through a lot in the last year, but we knew that as San Diegans that we were better than that,\u201d he said.Mr. Alvarez, also a councilman, tried to ride a wave of liberal populism, focusing on issues like raising the minimum wage and providing new city services in struggling neighborhoods. Mr. Faulconer emphasized his stances on fiscal issues, like his support of overhauling pensions and contracting out city services, saying such efforts would enable the city to pay for other improvements.In California, Democrats hold a supermajority in the state Legislature and all statewide elected offices. Though he has yet to announce his candidacy, the Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, is widely expected to run for re-election and to face two relatively unknown Republican challengers, which is likely to leave the balance of power in the state unchanged.Jim Brulte, chairman of the California Republican Party, exulted in Mr. Faulconer\u2019s win, saying in a statement, \u201cThis was a crucial step forward in our continuing efforts to rebuild the Republican Party from ground up.\u201dA day after his victory, Mr. Faulconer said in a telephone interview that he would immediately to turn his attention to bread-and-butter municipal issues that have broad support across the city\u2019s political spectrum: hiring a diverse staff, recruiting police officers and spending more on street repairs. \u201cI think you\u2019re successful when you focus on the big issues that bring everyone together,\u201d he said.The race, in the United States\u2019 eighth-largest city, attracted national attention, with Mr. Alvarez receiving an endorsement from President Obama in the campaign\u2019s final days. National and local labor unions gave more than $4 million to support Mr. Alvarez\u2019s campaign, which Mr. Faulconer repeatedly attacked as evidence that unions would have an outsize influence at City Hall.The two candidates had battled over how to best improve the city\u2019s economy. Mr. Alvarez called for a minimum-wage increase, while Mr. Faulconer said it was more important to encourage new businesses to open in the city. Mr. Faulconer had received crucial backing from the city\u2019s developers and business leaders, as well as from former Mayor Jerry Sanders, a Republican who now leads the local Chamber of Commerce and remains one of the most popular politicians in the city.Liam Dillon reported from San Diego, and Jennifer Medina from Fresno, Calif.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Winter\u2019s Not Just Cold and Snowy. It\u2019s Expensive.", "Date": "2014-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe mighty $16 trillion American economy can easily shrug off a snowstorm or two, even in regions unaccustomed to wintry snow and ice. But a prolonged bout of unusual weather is taking a toll, especially on small businesses like Abbadabba\u2019s, a shoe store chain in Atlanta, which has weathered two major storms this year.\u201cIt\u2019s been bad, but it goes back even further than just this winter,\u201d said Kristen Dellaporta, the chief financial officer, explaining that two years of mild winters had prompted the store to cut back on cold-weather gear, and an exceptionally rainy summer had helped to squelch profits in 2013.This year, the company has lost business not only because it had to shut down during the storms but also because it couldn\u2019t meet customer demand. \u201cLast year we had boots and no winter, this year we had winter but no boots,\u201d Ms. Dellaporta said. \u201cWe all need to start buying the Farmer\u2019s Almanac, I guess.\u201dAbbadabba\u2019s, where a wall of spring flip-flops is on display, generally places orders six months in advance and cannot restock on short notice. \u201cWhen you\u2019re small retail, your real business is inventory management, just having the right things at the right time,\u201d Ms. Dellaporta said. \u201cI would have loved to have been stocked up on nothing but rain boots, but that wouldn\u2019t be practical.\u201dEconomists have placed much of the blame for a recent spate of weak economic data on the effects of the unseasonable cold in the Northeast, Midwest and South, which they project will shave a few tenths of a percent off the growth of gross domestic product in the first quarter.But much of the sudden slowdown in hiring, industrial production and retail sales, they hope, will be shrugged off come spring. Consumers seem to believe this, too. The Thompson Reuters University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment for February, released on Friday, showed that a slight drop in satisfaction with current economic conditions was offset by an uptick in optimism for the future.Many weather effects are either transient (a snowstorm may keep you from the car dealership for a day or two, but it probably won\u2019t cancel your plans to buy a car) or self-balancing (a hardware store may sell less paint and drywall but more shovels and salt). If a factory shuts down for a couple of days, chances are it will simply fill its orders a little later.But in some industries, losses cannot be made up so easily. A restaurant forced to shutter on a Tuesday is not going to sell twice as many burgers on Wednesday. At London Grill, a restaurant in the Fairmount section of Philadelphia, revenue is down 10 percent more than in the usual January slump, said Terry Berch McNally, a co-owner. But weather can also be fickle: On Thursday, just as Ms. McNally was fretting about whether her Valentine\u2019s Day bookings would fall through, the afternoon brought twice as many drinkers as usual because local employers had closed early.When weather strikes repeatedly, losses can build up. Valentine\u2019s Day was blissfully sunny, putting an end to the immediate worries of both Ms. McNally, who got a flurry of last-minute reservations, and Susan McKee, at Old City Flowers in Philadelphia. Thankfully, Ms. McKee said, the biggest day of the year for florists would not be a bust. But her revenue for 2014 is down about half from what it would usually be. Inventory has been hard to get because of grounded planes. Walk-in sales have been slow.\u201cIt\u2019s crushing me,\u201d she said on Thursday, when Philly was blanketed by snow and ice. \u201cI have thousands of dollars invested in perishable gorgeous flowers that I can\u2019t get anywhere. I have three trucks parked outside the store, and I can\u2019t move the trucks. This day is lost. There was no revenue today.\u201dNonstop Couriers, a same-day delivery company that operates within 100 miles of the Philadelphia, has lost about $20,000, or around 3 percent of annual revenue, since this winter\u2019s snow storms began in December, said Rick Slowicki, the president. The storms have also pushed back Mr. Slowicki\u2019s plans to hire two new drivers and kept him from expanding his customer base because he doesn\u2019t want to risk providing a late delivery for a new client.His drivers have been affected, too \u2014 as have millions of other hourly workers, who make up about 60 percent of the work force. Rich Ludwig, a Nonstop employee, said the storms had cost him $800 in lost wages. He has pulled back on socializing and groceries, cutting spending to \u201cthe bare necessities,\u201d he said.It is not yet clear how much of the poor showing in recent data is the result of bad weather, and how much the bad weather may simply be masking softer demand. On the one hand, said Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Economics, weather \u201caffects pretty much everyone all the way up the supply chain.\u201d On the other hand, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s completely impossible to disentangle weather effects from everything else.\u201dThe effects can be tricky to nail down. In one analysis, economists at Capital Economics, a research firm, noted that through a series of complex chain reactions, a heavy blanket of snow might drive gold prices up and wheat prices down.Speaking to Congress earlier this week, Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, said that weather might have been a factor in the weak jobs reports in December and January, but warned the public not to jump to conclusions. In a report this week, retail sales made a poor showing as well, decreasing 0.4 percent last month from December, and spending in December was revised downward to make the 2013 holiday shopping season the weakest since 2009.Manufacturing also declined in January, despite a large jump in output from utilities because of the cold, with many economists concluding that the weather was not causing the retreat but making it look worse.Mr. Shepherdson ticked off indications that some of the growth in the latter half of last year would not be sustainable: Manufacturing output was fed by a buildup in inventory, not demand, and increased spending by consumers was fed by a decline in the savings rate.The construction industry, which is particularly sensitive to weather, added jobs in January, which some economists said was evidence that the weather was not the problem.Jed Kolko, the chief economist for Trulia, agreed. \u201cThere are plenty of other factors that have held back sales in recent months,\u201d including low inventory and pullback by investors, he said.Jon Hurdle, in Philadelphia, and Alan Blinder, in Atlanta, contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Growing Crisis in Its Backyard Snares Russia", "Date": "2014-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Despite repeated vows not to interfere or intervene, President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia has now found itself more deeply ensnared than ever in Ukraine\u2019s worsening political crisis, facing appeals to support the country\u2019s ethnic Russians, provide haven for its deposed president and perhaps even undertake a military response. The question is whether he intended it that way.Mr. Putin\u2019s silence has resulted in confusion over Russia\u2019s policy, even as the crisis in Ukraine has moved closer to Russia\u2019s own border and raised concerns about Ukraine\u2019s geopolitical and economic impact on its neighbor. Russia could stand to lose what it considers a place that is not only within its sphere of influence but part of its political, social and historical identity. For now, Mr. Putin\u2019s strategy for retaining Russia\u2019s influence in a country where the Kremlin has profound interests, from its largest foreign military base to gas pipelines that fuel its economy, remains unknown and full of risks. Even so, events are subtly forcing Moscow\u2019s hand.Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s appeal for Russia \u201cto secure my personal safety,\u201d and reports that he will hold a news conference in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don on Friday, have made it clear that the Kremlin has quietly provided at least tacit assistance to a humiliated leader who has been abandoned even by his own political supporters.Russian officials have dismissed such fears as absurd, but at the same time, Mr. Putin ordered a surprise military exercise involving 150,000 troops on Ukraine\u2019s doorstep that was clearly intended as a palpable warning about Russia\u2019s preparedness. It prompted warnings in return from NATO and the United States that Russia should do nothing provocative and respect Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity.Outwardly, Russia continues to insist that the turmoil in Ukraine is an internal affair and that neither it nor the United States and Europe should meddle. Events, however, are quickly overtaking that position.Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s flight \u2014 apparently to Russia, though his location remained unknown Thursday \u2014 has made it more difficult for the Kremlin to sustain the detached response it has sought to maintain, despite deep reservations among Russian officials over Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s handling of the crisis and the collapse of his authority last weekend.That ambivalence was clear on Thursday when Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, declined to confirm or deny that Russia had extended protection to Mr. Yanukovych and refused to discuss the matter of his whereabouts at all, even when pressed in a telephone interview.\u201cI think Putin hates Yanukovych,\u201d said Sergei A. Markov, a political strategist who advises the Kremlin, \u201cbut what should he do for a legally elected president who asks to come to Russia?\u201dWith Mr. Yanukovych declaring that he is still the lawfully elected leader of Ukraine and with Parliament approving a new interim government, Russia now faces the prospect of being the host of a president in exile. Mr. Markov said that Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s presence in Russia, which is still unverified, would amount to \u201casylum by fact,\u201d adding that he thought Mr. Yanukovych should have stayed in Ukraine and called on the military and security forces to rally behind him in defiance of the new leaders in Kiev.\u201cWe are convinced that only such a constitutional framework can ensure the interests of all political forces and all regions of Ukraine,\u201d the ministry\u2019s statement said.In essence, the statement suggested that Russia still recognized Mr. Yanukovych as the country\u2019s leader, though no officials have explicitly said so, even though they have denounced the new interim leaders as radicals riding to power in an armed fascist coup.In the absence of a clear statement of Russia\u2019s intent, the perception of its strategy has been shaped by rumors, by strident coverage on state news media and by statements of Russian lawmakers vowing solidarity with Ukraine\u2019s ethnic Russians and questioning whether Crimea, which the Soviet Union ceded to Ukraine in 1954, should rightfully be Russia\u2019s.Three high-profile members of Russia\u2019s lower house of Parliament arrived in Crimea on Thursday, visiting the city that is home to Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet. \u201cI arrived in Sevastopol to support residents of Crimea,\u201d Nikolai Valuev, a former boxing champion who was elected to the Parliament in 2011, wrote on Twitter. \u201cFriends, Russia is with you.\u201dHe was joined by the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova, and a former Olympic figure skater, Irina Rodnina, who carried the Olympic torch on its final leg at the opening ceremony of the Winter Games in Sochi (and was mired in a controversy over her recent posting of a doctored and racist photograph of President Obama and his wife, Michelle), RIA Novosti reported.Mr. Valuev, an unmistakable presence at 7 feet 1 inch tall, described the visit as a fact-finding mission \u201cto personally interact with the residents to know the situation from the inside.\u201d Like many officials in Russia, he said the crisis in Ukraine, or at least the foreign news media reporting on it, was clouded by Western propaganda. \u201cThere is an information war,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.The military exercise that began in earnest on Thursday added an ominous element of volatility. Aleksandr Golts, an independent military analyst in Moscow, said that the exercise could theoretically \u2014 and he emphasized the word theoretically \u2014 disguise a more general mobilization of Russia\u2019s military in case a conflict erupted over Ukraine.\u201cIn my view it\u2019s very bad, even if there are no plans to use the military, that maneuvers are being held with the goal of testing the nerves of others,\u201d he said.To critics, especially in Ukraine, the Kremlin\u2019s hand is seen in many of the most disturbing turns in the unfolding situation, including the visits by Russian lawmakers; reports of handing out Russian passports to Crimea\u2019s citizens, as happened in Georgia\u2019s breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia; and the mysterious seizure of the Parliament building in Crimea. They see the downward spiraling of events as evidence that Mr. Putin intends to splinter the country and retake Crimea as Russian territory.\u201cWe\u2019re not interfering,\u201d Mr. Peskov, the president\u2019s spokesman, said on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re standing on this position.\u201dAndrew Roth contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Incomes Are Flat, Reflecting a Slowdown in Job Growth, but Consumer Spending Rises", "Date": "2014-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmericans increased their spending at a solid pace for the second straight month in December, even though their incomes were flat.Consumer spending rose 0.4 percent in December after an increase of 0.6 percent in November, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. The November increase was the biggest gain in five months. Income, however, showed no gain in December after a 0.2 percent rise in November. Wages and salaries were essentially flat in December, reflecting a sharp slowdown in employment growth. For all of 2013, income growth was 2.8 percent, the weakest performance since 2009, when income fell 2.8 percent as the country struggled with a deep recession.Consumer spending is closely watched because it accounts for 70 percent of economic activity.For the October-December quarter, consumer spending was rising at the fastest pace in three years, giving economists hope that the economy had finally turned the corner to faster growth after a prolonged period of subpar activity following the end of the recession in June 2009.This year, analysts say the economy will get a lift from continued gains in hiring, which would give more households money to spend. Manufacturers are also expected to benefit from rising global demand, and housing construction and auto sales are expected to improve further.Some economists say they think growth could accelerate to around 3 percent this year. If it does, 2014 would be the best year for growth since the recession ended.Stronger growth and the improving job market are the primary reasons the Federal Reserve is pressing ahead with a plan to scale back its economic stimulus.Most forecasters think the economy will manage to withstand such factors as turmoil in emerging economies, which have been rattled by the pullback in the Fed\u2019s stimulus and the prospect of higher domestic interest rates.One major reason for optimism: A belief that the government will be less of a drag than in 2013, when higher federal taxes and spending cuts trimmed overall growth by an estimated 1.5 percentage points.A budget deal Congress approved earlier this month halted tens of billions in additional spending cuts that were scheduled to kick in this year.Many global investors are concerned that the Fed\u2019s pullback in its bond purchases will raise interest rates and cause investors to shift money out of emerging markets and into the United States for higher returns. Currency values in emerging economies have fallen over that concern.For December, prices measured by an inflation gauge tied to consumer spending rose only 0.2 percent compared with November, and were up just 1.1 percent for the entire year, well below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent inflation target.While consumer confidence has been rising, the University of Michigan\u2019s index of consumer sentiment showed a slight drop in January, to 81.2, from its December reading of 82.5, a decline attributed in part to recent setbacks in the stock market.The combination of stronger spending in December but no improvement in income meant that many consumers tapped into savings to finance their spending. The saving rate slipped to 3.9 percent of after-tax income in December, down from 4.3 percent in November. It was the lowest monthly saving rate since last January, when the rate dropped to 3.6 percent. For the year, the saving rate was 4.5 percent, the lowest since 2007. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Trade Talks Threaten Obama\u2019s Longtime Balancing Act", "Date": "2014-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Aficionados liken trade expansion to riding a bicycle: If it does not move forward, it tips over. Under President Obama, the bicycle has wobbled.But it has not fallen. Whether Mr. Obama can keep that from happening, while juggling competing priorities, is a big question mark over his second-term economic and foreign policy agenda.He plainly wants to achieve the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal that the United States is currently negotiating with Asian countries and, less urgently, a separate pact with the European Union. Both hold the promise of accelerating global economic growth, which has been sluggish.But they conflict with another, more immediate political goal: to preserve unity among fellow Democrats. Many of them believe that those deals would undercut efforts to narrow income inequality and therefore complicate the party\u2019s campaign for midterm House and Senate elections.Those competing pressures have come into sharper focus lately. Mr. Obama plans to travel to Asia in April, by which time his administration hopes to have Trans-Pacific Partnership talks all but wrapped up.However, Democratic leaders in Congress have openly rejected legislation Mr. Obama wants that would smooth the path for those deals. Not only has the president declined to challenge them, but Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. last week acknowledged in a meeting with Democratic lawmakers that \u201clocal political priorities\u201d prevented action on the legislation now.That balancing act has marked Mr. Obama\u2019s approach since 2008. Courting union voters who blame globalization for stagnant wages, Obama the candidate spoke of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. Then, as president, he dropped the idea.He won approval, on revised terms, of agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea that he inherited from the George W. Bush administration. But new trade deals took a back seat to economic recovery, Wall Street regulation and health care during his first term.Global trade talks through the World Trade Organization, which began in 2001 and stalled during the Bush administration, continued to languish. Critics faulted the administration for lukewarm commitment at the expense of growth and expanded exports.\u201cIt\u2019s a major problem for global economies that the multilateral trading system is stuck in the mud,\u201d said Susan Schwab, who served as Mr. Bush\u2019s trade representative.Mr. Obama\u2019s trade representative, Michael Froman, disputes that Mr. Obama has played down the issue. In December, W.T.O. talks in Bali produced a modest accord to cut red tape. The next month, the United States and major trading partners decided to seek agreement on free trade of environmentally friendly \u201cgreen goods.\u201dTogether with the potential Asian and European deals, it represents \u201camong the most ambitious trade agendas in history,\u201d Mr. Froman said in an interview. Mr. Obama has, however, allowed the window for achieving it to narrow. Though he called on Congress to enact \u201cTrade Promotion Authority\u201d in his State of the Union address, he has not pressed for action as vigorously as on other issues like raising the minimum wage.The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, and her Senate counterpart, Harry Reid, have both waved off his request for this year. Mr. Obama picked a leading Democratic trade advocate, retiring Senator Max Baucus of Montana, as his new ambassador to China. The maneuver was designed in part to increase Democrats\u2019 chances of holding Mr. Baucus\u2019s seat.Presidents value the Trade Promotion Authority because it forces Congress to vote up or down on trade deals, shielding them from House and Senate amendments at the behest of corporations, unions, environmental groups or other interests. It also helps negotiating partners conclude agreements by clarifying the United States\u2019 bottom line.As a fallback strategy, Mr. Obama and his aides now aim to flip that dynamic around. They hope to persuade lawmakers to grant that authority after midterm elections by showing them a tentative Asia deal.That would leave little time for action before the 2016 presidential primary season \u2014 which, if 2008 is any guide, will probably amplify Democratic resistance.The stakes for Mr. Obama extend beyond the economy. The Trans-Pacific Partnership represents a central element of his attempt to \u201cpivot\u201d American foreign policy toward Asia and its growing power. His challenge is a mirror image of the one facing Republicans on immigration. Republican presidential aspirants feel pressure to court Hispanic voters that many House members and senators, because of the contours of their constituencies, do not.Two decades ago, President Bill Clinton established trade expansion as a tenet of efforts by modern Democrats to promote growth and court the support of businesses. He won over enough intraparty allies to join with Republican backers and win passage of Nafta as well as admit China to the W.T.O. (Mr. Clinton waited to embrace Nafta until after the 1992 Democratic primaries, however, in deference to the same intraparty pressures Mr. Obama faces now.)That could happen again before Mr. Obama leaves office. Mr. Reid, the Senate majority leader, will not feel the same imperative to block a president of his party after the battle to preserve Democrats\u2019 Senate majority has concluded.But like Republicans whose gerrymandered districts have few Hispanic voters, many union-friendly House Democrats heed different voices than presidents do. They insist that trade expansion keeps squeezing low-income workers through escalating competition with cheaper foreign labor.The White House insists he can. But bucking that resistance, as Mr. Clinton did, would require a stronger presidential push.\u201cThe Democratic Party needs to return to our traditional support of seeing trade\u201d as advancing economic opportunity, said Mr. Bacchus, a House colleague of Mr. Bonior\u2019s during the Clinton era. \u201cFar too many Democrats have forgotten that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Chinese authorities themselves seem to believe this. The government and the central bank want to reduce credit growth and to replace the unregulated, opaque \u201cshadow lending\u201d system with properly supervised, well-capitalized modern banks. But the government has two other economic objectives that it sees as equally or more important.The second, though many observers would argue that this is really the overarching objective, is to ensure that restructuring occurs in an orderly manner, without risking a severe slowdown that might threaten the Communist Party\u2019s monopoly of power. In practice, the government has quantified this objective with its \u201ctarget\u201d economic growth rate of 7.5 percent. China\u2019s third major economic objective is overhauling the finance sector and restraining excessive credit growth.The problem, which Chinese leaders and economists were until recently very reluctant to acknowledge, is what happens if these three objectives clash. What if restraining credit growth causes a severe economic slowdown, or if clamping down on shadow banking starves private enterprises of capital for growth, or if aggressive industrial restructuring becomes incompatible with financial stability?In the past few months, the answers to such questions have become clearer. Although the Chinese leadership remains committed to all three major economic goals, it is starting to acknowledge that progress may not be possible simultaneously on all fronts. Policy will therefore have to prioritize objectives \u2014 and financial reform is proving a less important priority than industrial restructuring and maintaining an acceptable rate of growth.Whenever possible, China will try to move ahead on all three objectives, but if there is a serious conflict, maintaining an adequate growth rate will trump its desire to restrain credit or overhaul the financial sector.This is a sensible ordering of priorities, both for China and for the world economy, which is still desperately short of growth. But even if China is determined to keep its economy expanding and avoid a credit crunch, is it capable of doing this? After all, the United States government allowed the failure of a midsize investment bank to degenerate into the greatest financial meltdown in modern history. Why then, should we expect China do any better?Partly because the United States did not really try to avoid a financial crisis. On the contrary, the United States Treasury pushed Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy in 2008 to demonstrate that there were limits to government bank bailouts. Recently, some Chinese officials, especially central bankers, have made similar statements, suggesting that reckless lending must be disciplined and \u201cmoral hazard\u201d curbed. Does this suggest that China could \u201cdo a Lehman\u201d and reverse the order of policy priorities, putting a financial clean-up ahead of economic growth?This is where the debate about Chinese policy gets really interesting \u2014 and confusing. Like other central banks, the People\u2019s Bank of China, if left to itself, would probably prioritize curbing excess lending and moral hazard, even if this jeopardized economic growth and industrial restructuring.And although China is seen as a monolithic authoritarian state where only one view prevails on any important issue, economic policy is in fact subject to intense debate, which is sometimes as open as the clashes between American Keynesians and monetarists or between South European governments and the German central bank.As result, mixed messages flow constantly from China, and these are particularly confusing for financiers whose instinct is to treat central bankers as more authoritative than politicians.Which leads us back to the question of whether China, with its primitive financial system, has the tools to maintain financial stability, if it really wants to do this? The answer is almost certainly yes. A relatively primitive financial system, dominated by state-owned banks that are really just arms of the central government, is actually easier to stabilize than a complex market-driven network of private financial institutions.State-controlled banks may be inefficient at allocating capital, but they cannot be forced into insolvency unless the government itself is insolvent \u2014 and the Chinese government is perhaps the most solvent financial entity in the world. The central government has a cast-iron budgetary position that is more than adequate to underwrite the bailouts of insolvent banks and local governments.Even more important, China has the world\u2019s largest trade surplus, total control over cross-border capital flows and $3.5 trillion in foreign exchange reserves.Anyone betting on a Lehman-style meltdown in the Chinese financial system will need $3.5 trillion to call the Beijing government\u2019s bluff.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Traveling From Ocean to Ocean Across South America", "Date": "2014-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Voyages IssueBefore the passengers turned on the driver and began plotting a mutiny, the ride was smooth. The bus rolled out of the station in S\u00e3o Paulo at about 4 o\u2019clock on a Wednesday afternoon last July, and within an hour it had shaken free of the city\u2019s clotted tunnels, jammed overpasses and coded graffiti. By 6, we were barreling straight into a lurid sunset that endowed everything with the candied luster of fresh paint. Green hills, silver ponds, golden palms. Two parrots soared in tandem over a sugar-cane field, inviting us to drift into a pastoral trance.Then the engine\u2019s fan belt snapped. The bus limped into a roadside service station about 220 miles from S\u00e3o Paulo.\u201cIn a half-hour we\u2019ll be ready to go,\u201d Mauro Yodes, our cheerful driver, assured us. \u201cGo ahead and get something to eat at the cafe, if you want.\u201dThis was the only bus that advertised start-to-finish service on the recently completed Interoceanic Highway, the first paved route to fully cross the big green heart of South America. The breakdown should have been a useful reminder that South American cross-continental travel was still new and many kinks had yet to be worked out. But we were antsy. We had so much ground to cover.The bus was supposed to cross 3,500 miles of pavement (roughly the same distance as a flight from New York to Paris) in about 96 hours. My plan was to disembark early, about 50 hours into the trip, then I\u2019d cobble together a series of shorter bus routes, which would allow me to spend time in towns and villages, all the way to the Pacific Coast. Mauro told us he planned to stop for just 40 minutes a day \u2014 enough time, theoretically, for each passenger to wash up and buy food and drinks at a gas station. For the other 23 hours and 20 minutes, as he shared driving duties with his partner, Jos\u00e9, we\u2019d be confined to rigid seats \u2014 benumbed contortionists sweeping crumbs from our laps.Among those onboard were more than a dozen unrelated Peruvians who worked in S\u00e3o Paulo and were returning home to visit family; a few Brazilians on vacation; a college professor from Ecuador, who said he was studying the continent\u2019s \u201ctouristic infrastructure\u201d; and a young couple from Cuzco, laboring heroically to entertain their 18-month-old daughter.The various nationalities rarely mingled. The informal segregation reflected the continent itself, where two of the Western Hemisphere\u2019s most isolating geographical features \u2014 the Amazon basin and the Andes mountain range \u2014 have always gotten in the way of a unified South American culture. Lowland Brazilians and highland Peruvians couldn\u2019t be more different \u2014 in language, in genetic ancestry, in culinary traditions. But now an unbroken strip of common ground unites them, and every time someone makes the journey from one end of the Interoceanic to the other, the clean divisions between regions blur a little.By 9 p.m., about three hours into the delay, the independent passengers had become a collective, united by grievance and doubt. Mauro, all smiles, kept ducking back into the cabin to tell us not to worry. But our patience had narrowed to a very sharp point. Passengers began discussing the merits of other South American bus companies \u2014 the reliability of their vehicles, the plushiness of their fully reclining seats, their straight-shooting drivers. The Ecuadorean professor, who proved our most enthusiastic mutineer, suggested we present Mauro with a strict ultimatum: Either the bus was fixed within an hour, or we got our ticket money back plus return fare to S\u00e3o Paulo.We marched off the bus and peered through the cafe windows, watching Mauro settle his dinner bill. Moments later, he walked through the door and straight into our little nest of vipers.Mauro \u2014 a compact 52-year-old who spends an average of 26 days a month driving this highway \u2014 calmly illustrated what he would later describe to me as the most important lesson the Interoceanic has taught him: Plans rarely match up with reality, and it\u2019s almost never immediately obvious whether that\u2019s a good or a bad thing.\u201cLook,\u201d Mauro explained to our group, \u201cif we run on schedule, we reach the Peruvian border at about 1 a.m. on the third day.\u201d But he said the border-patrol office would be closed at that time. So we would have to sit there and wait until 8 a.m., when the office opened again. He motioned to the cafe, with its 24-hour food service, its ice-cold drinks, the soccer match on TV. \u201cWaiting here is better, believe me.\u201dExpertly defanged, we offered no rebuttal. About 20 minutes after midnight, more than five hours after the belt snapped, we settled back into our seats \u2014 legs stretched, bellies filled and perspectives altered by a highway that\u2019s constantly turning expectations inside out. Many pilgrims have been drawn to the road by dreams of transformation, but those who thrive learn to rewrite their plans on the go.In 1970, a cyclical drought scorched the fields of northeastern Brazil and drove president Gen. Em\u00edlio Garrastazu M\u00e9dici to make a promise: No longer would the country\u2019s farmers be dependent on a relatively slender track of arable territory near the eastern seaboard. M\u00e9dici vowed to open Brazil\u2019s vast, forested interior to agricultural and industrial development. Step 1: A road.David Guttenfelder captures scenes along the Interoceanic Highway.The proposed Trans-Amazonian Highway would cross Brazil\u2019s western border and connect to Peru\u2019s highway system, which itself was mostly hypothetical. A Brazilian government report printed that same year described the continent\u2019s core as \u201can enormous demographic and economic emptiness\u201d where \u201cman continues to be the great absent.\u201d The report\u2019s authors cast themselves as realists grounded in practicality; the so-called experts who worried about the environmental impacts to the region, on the other hand, were fantasists. \u201cIn fact, many of the various scientific missions that have studied [the Amazon region] seem to lose themselves in its immensity, offering reports much more descriptive and full of admiration and astonishment than sound conclusions and objective results,\u201d the report declared.Years passed, and funding evaporated. But the idea of a coast-to-coast road didn\u2019t die. In 1984, Brazil finished paving the BR-364, connecting S\u00e3o Paulo to the thickly forested state of Rond\u00f4nia. M\u00e9dici\u2019s plan for the Trans-Amazonian had envisioned a Peruvian border-crossing hundreds of miles north of the BR-364\u2019s trajectory. But by paving an existing dirt road that stretched from the Peruvian border to the terminus of the BR-364 about 500 miles away, Brazil could piece together a more efficient route.In 2000, the presidents of 12 South American countries identified the completion of an interoceanic route as one of the continent\u2019s top infrastructural priorities. A committee of South American leaders approved a financing plan that combined state and private resources with funding from international-development banks. Brazil\u2019s government \u2014 seduced by the promise of easier access to lucrative Asian markets \u2014 agreed to finance much of the work on the Peruvian side. The cost of the new construction has been estimated to be about $2.8 billion.From Mauro\u2019s bus, the highway that emerged after all those years of back-and-forth often looked like a simple country road. For a majority of its length, it was just wide enough for one lane of traffic in each direction. As we motored across the plains of Mato Grosso, I saw drivers choose to travel on the comparatively smooth dirt shoulder instead of slaloming the potholes in the pavement. Tractors and other slow-moving farm vehicles regularly forced Mauro and Jos\u00e9 to play chicken in the other lane. I never saw a patrol car lying in wait for speeders; the road conditions allowed the highway to police itself.Back in the 1990s, Brazilian analysts predicted that an interoceanic highway, by shortcutting the Panama Canal, would reduce Brazilian agricultural shipping costs to Asia by as much as $100 per ton. These days, even the highway\u2019s most enthusiastic proponents concede that the Asian angle was oversold. \u201cThe truth is this hasn\u2019t happened yet,\u201d said Jorge Barata, who heads the Peruvian offices of Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction firm that built many of the newest stretches of the road and has a 25-year concession to maintain them. The road in its current form, he said, simply isn\u2019t suitable for heavy-duty, long-distance shipping. \u201cThe cost of river transport ends up being a lot more competitive.\u201dFor the first two days, through Mato Grosso and much of Rond\u00f4nia, the view from the bus was dependably uniform: oceanic fields of sugar cane, soybeans and corn and flat pastureland studded by rust-colored termite mounds and patrolled by herds of wattle-necked Brahman cattle. No one exposed to more than 50 consecutive hours of it could doubt that Brazil was the world\u2019s top beef exporter or that Brazil will most likely produce more soybeans than the United States this year. Similarly, no one treated to so many hours upon this spine-rattling highway could fail to recognize how much more might be possible if Brazil\u2019s infrastructure were better. Last year, China\u2019s largest soybean-importing firm canceled an order for two million metric tons of Brazilian soybeans because of crippling transportation delays in getting those crops to the Santos port.It came as something of a surprise when the road abruptly came to an end at the Madeira River in western Rond\u00f4nia. Dozens of bridges had been constructed in Brazil and Peru before South American politicians inaugurated the \u201ccompleted\u201d Interoceanic almost two years before, but this one was left unbuilt. A barge waited to ferry the bus to the other side.We began drifting across the inky current at 11:15 p.m. Several of my fellow passengers staggered moon-eyed, mouths agape, conversing in tones that deserved italics and multiple exclamation marks. At first, I assumed they\u2019d been drinking, but I had failed to recognize something rare: genuine, un-self-conscious wonder. They were staring at the night sky, which shone with enough stars to impart an instant understanding of the infinite. A 20-something Brazilian tourist named Guilhermo spoke for everyone: \u201cI have never seen anything like that!\u201dWe were leaving the pragmatic monotony of large-scale agribusiness and heading into more improvisational territories. Ahead lay the steamy hollows of the Amazon basin and the stonewashed skies of the Andes, regions where the highway more forcefully influences the enterprises popping up in its path. Guilhermo, doling out high-fives to anyone with a free hand, seemed to sense and embrace the change. Before we got back on the bus, he told me that he\u2019d never in his life been this far from home.According to government figures, more than 85 percent of the state is jungle; the rest mostly consists of Rio Branco and the string of small villages along the highway. That denuded strip has been filled with people, Toyotas, pizza parlors and shopping malls, yet the forest\u2019s shadow looms over everything. One of Rio Branco\u2019s soccer stadiums is called Arena da Floresta (Forest Arena); another is known as Florest\u00e3o (the Big Forest). The regional government\u2019s public Wi-Fi network is called the Digital Forest. A central square is the Plaza of the People of the Forest.Some people, like Eziquiel Alves da Silva, the manager of the state\u2019s first ethanol-producing factory, are pushing for Acre to become more like the regions we\u2019d already passed through. Da Silva told me that he had been visiting local landowners, trying to convince them that sugar-cane-based ethanol soon would become a cornerstone of the local economy. He suggested that if exports to Asia took off, market forces could expand the sugar-cane industry, now centered in S\u00e3o Paulo, westward.\u201cWe\u2019re in a privileged position here,\u201d he said of the month-old factory, which perfumed the highway with sweet, pungent notes. \u201cFrom here, we can go\u201d \u2014 he waved his arm with a flourish \u2014 \u201cto the world.\u201dBut along the highway he seemed outnumbered by people resisting corporate development and experimenting with enterprises that might protect local forest traditions. About 120 miles past Rio Branco, I passed a government-subsidized company called Natex, which uses latex collected from trees by local rubber tappers to make condoms. A few miles down the highway, I followed a dirt road into a 100-square-mile reserve that\u2019s collectively managed by about 80 families, most of whom make their livings roaming the forest and harvesting either Brazil nuts or latex. They told me they\u2019re trying to carry on the legacy of Chico Mendes, the rubber tapper and activist who was shot in 1988 for defending the rain forest. \u201cThis is what he fought for,\u201d said Everton Paiva de Oliveira, who manages an eco-lodge in the reserve with one of Mendes\u2019s nieces.Trails led into the forest between the flying-buttress roots of enormous tauari and sama\u00fama trees. Dozens of white butterflies erupted upon approach \u2014 a handful of tossed confetti. In the tree canopy, Oliveira pointed to an obstacle course of rope bridges and zip lines. Guests can sleep in individual chalets or less-expensive dormitory-style rooms. But when I visited, at a time of year that should have been considered high season, every room was empty.Over a glass of pale yellow ara\u00e7\u00e1-boi juice, Oliveira admitted that the lodge wasn\u2019t turning a profit and depended on state funds to stay afloat. When he mentioned that they didn\u2019t have Internet access, I wasn\u2019t sure if it was another example of the rustic ambience he was trying to sell or if he was explaining why they were having trouble selling it. The lodge\u2019s quandary was Acre\u2019s writ small: How much change can tradition absorb before it becomes something else entirely?On a Saturday night back in Rio Branco, I met Junior Fera, an 18-year-old who doesn\u2019t make a habit of worrying about such questions. I first noticed him standing with a small group of friends in the middle of a suspension bridge and embracing a girl. A couple of seconds later, both of them plunged off the side of the bridge toward the current far below, still locked in each other\u2019s arms. A harness line, which I hadn\u2019t noticed at first, cut their swan dive short. They swung together in a wild arc, a few feet above the water, before their scissoring feet eventually found purchase on the sloping bank. A few minutes later Junior returned to the bridge, alone. \u201cWas that your girlfriend?\u201d I asked, wondering where the other jumper went. He erupted in laughter. \u201cIt was just some girl who was walking by!\u201d he said. \u201cI asked her if she wanted to jump, and she actually said yes!\u201dOnce or twice a week he and a group of about 30 friends bring their ropes and harnesses to the bridge. They range in age from 15 to 45 or so, and about the only obvious thing they share is the instinct to embrace the natural world \u2014 rivers, forests, mountains, whatever \u2014 in the most physical way they can. The group wouldn\u2019t exist, they admitted, if the highway didn\u2019t; all of their rappelling equipment comes from their periodic road trips into the Andes. \u201cBy car, by bus \u2014 we go any way we can,\u201d said Junior, who told me that he finances his trips by working as a physical therapist. He and his friends were the only people I found in Acre who seemed comfortable honoring both nature and the highway at the same time.\u201cThis is not a big place,\u201d Junior said, \u201cso we have to make our own opportunities.\u201d He clipped the ropes back into his harness and took another leap into the dark. Acre exists.After the 2010 earthquake, rumors began circulating around Port-au-Prince that Brazil might be a haven for migrants. Human smugglers began offering desperate Haitians travel packages priced anywhere between $2,000 and $4,000 for passage to Brazil, typically via a bus to the Dominican Republic, a flight to Ecuador through Panama, another bus to Lima and, finally, a ride to the Brazilian border along the Interoceanic Highway.More than 7,000 Haitians have been granted a visa or permanent residence in the past three years. But the immigration bureaucracy struggles to keep pace. Newcomers were showing up at the pavilion every day, where they generally waited 20 to 30 days for their Brazilian residency papers to come through.The population of the encampment was around 500 when I was there, but recently it was as high as 1,200, about four times its capacity. Most are men. When I arrived, a mob of about 50 pressed against me on the off chance I was an immigration official. It must have been 100 degrees in the middle of that crowd.Scores of saggy, stained mattresses lay on the concrete slab under the open pavilion. Many people tried to sleep; others listened to headphones. Few spoke.\u201cWe wait patiently to be able to leave,\u201d said Joseph Silas, 34, who left his wife and three children in Haiti. \u201cThat\u2019s all we do.\u201dThe men described conditions that were tolerable, but just barely. A few shower stalls stood nearby, but most said they washed with buckets of water. Their meals never varied \u2014 rice, beans, a little chicken. Many complained of stomach problems.Everyone was focused on getting to S\u00e3o Paulo. They all wanted jobs, the kind of legitimate work they believed they could get only with solid immigration papers. A civil engineer hoped to work in a restaurant, any restaurant; Silas, who was a professional driver, figured he might get a job in construction. Or as an electrician. Or whatever else he could find. They spoke of handing over their life savings, but no one expressed buyer\u2019s remorse. \u201cThere is no hope in Haiti,\u201d Silas explained to me. \u201cThat is the difference.\u201dLater that day, I took a minibus to the Peruvian border, sharing the vehicle with two Brazilians and two Peruvians, one of whom avoided Peruvian immigration officials by hiring a motorcycle to take him on dirt paths around the passport station. A couple of miles beyond the office, our driver pulled over to welcome our lawbreaking companion back onboard. I thought of the Haitians waiting in the heat of the pavilion, playing by the rules. Nothing was keeping them in that slice of hell, other than an unwillingness to stop pursuing a rumor of hope.But when I stopped by the offices of the Amazon Conservation Association, the regional director, Juan Loja Alem\u00e1n, said he tries to be careful not to go overboard with the dire warnings. \u201cThere are no comprehensive statistics yet measuring the positive and negative impacts of the highway,\u201d Loja, a biologist, said. \u201cBut an interesting balance is starting to emerge. Illegal activity has definitely increased, but clearly so has interest in sustainable activities. The Interoceanic is creating a tourist circuit that\u2019s getting very interesting.\u201dI rode a motorcycle taxi over one of the secondary roads toward a wildlife rescue center, where staff members and volunteers nursed red howler monkeys, turtles and white-throated toucans for an eventual return to the wild. Clouds of parrots swirled around the clay banks of the Tambopata River, a short distance from a secluded research center that, according to a sign, was dedicated to reducing human impacts on the forest. Late in the afternoon I stood alone in the middle of a suspension bridge that stretches for nearly a half-mile over the Madre de Dios River. The sky above the glassy water turned orange, then pink, then purplish. The sun dropped so fast I half-expected to hear a splash.The next morning, though, about an hour and a half down the highway, the negative impacts reasserted themselves. The town of Mazuco is the unofficial gold-mining capital of Amazonian Peru, and the Interoceanic is its Main Street. Among the vegetable stands and clothing stores are gold-buying shops, where independent miners can trade their gold dust for cash. The mining boom helped the town\u2019s population to grow exponentially, to about 8,000 people, in the past five years, according to the handful of locals I found gathered in a hair salon beside the highway.\u201cThere\u2019s so much destruction,\u201d said Anthony Andea, who runs the salon with his wife. \u201cThere used to be forest. Now it\u2019s just sand. A desert.\u201d Andea was 29, but like most I spoke to in Mazuco, he sounded like a grumpy senior, wary of more change. \u201cPeople come here for work,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut the work is crap. It\u2019s exploitation. The wages are terrible, and the conditions are inhuman.\u201dMost of the mining camps are technically illegal, yet some abut the Interoceanic. Environmentalists blame their continued existence on Odebrecht, which maintains most of the highway in Peru. The Brazilian company collects tolls to help finance the upkeep of the road and the land immediately flanking it. The Odebrecht officials I spoke with blamed the Peruvian government for not enforcing the law, and almost everyone bemoaned a collusive atmosphere of corruption that allows the camps to spread without consequence. \u201cPolitical power in Peru is very centralized, and that power simply doesn\u2019t exist here,\u201d says C\u00e9sar Ascorra, from the local office of C\u00e1ritas, a Catholic social service agency, and an outspoken critic of the highway. \u201cThe government responds with laws, but that\u2019s just paper. The people who come here know this very well.\u201dBefore the highway, the only way to get to Mazuco was to hitch a ride on a diesel truck from Cuzco. The trip down the muddy mountain roads usually took a few days, longer if it rained. Nowadays any miner with a few hours to spare can make the journey. All of the old-timers \u2014 a group that seemed to include anyone who lived there for more than four or five years \u2014 said the miners had brought with them delinquency, crime, and drunkenness.Actually, not all of the old-timers said that. A man of about 45 interrupted my conversation with a pessimistic clothing-store owner to tell me: \u201cThe mining sector has opened things up here, economically.\u201d He had lived in town since 1993, he said, when the population was \u201cmaybe 150\u201d; anyone who yearned for the good old days had a patchy memory. I asked him his name, but he narrowed his eyes and wagged his index finger at me. \u201cNo name,\u201d he said, and disappeared down the street.About a half-hour later, I ducked into one of the gold-buying shops. There he was again, manning the scales behind the counter. \u201cNot in here,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cThis is a place of business.\u201d He punctuated the warning with the same wag of his index finger.I got out of the taxi and stepped across a wooden plank that spanned the highway ditch. Brown water ran under the boards and radiated in channels behind the tents. A young woman, probably in her late teens, carried a case of pisco into a tent labeled \u201cDisco Fontana,\u201d where another girl in impractical heels swept trash from the floor. Men in tank tops, athletic shorts and muddy wading boots walked between tents. Under a water stall built to wash motorcycles, a woman scrubbed an infant.When I walked a short distance into the camp toward what seemed to be a convenience store, a woman rose from behind a table, alarmed. Two men, one whose face was hidden behind the dark shield of a motorcycle helmet, walked toward me. The woman indicated I wasn\u2019t welcome by flashing a sign that I understood perfectly: the wagging finger. I turned and left.I spent one night in Ocongate, the collective name for 33 villages of clustered huts embedded in the mountainside at about 11,500 feet. There I found the first motorist lodge built along the Andean stretch of the Interoceanic, a 35-bed complex on the banks of the Mapacho River. A retired Peruvian narcotics-dog trainer named Rub\u00e9n Santander built the place in 2010. His clients often include hikers who trek around the snow-capped Ausangate peak. In a couple of weeks, he was expecting 25 German hikers, followed by a group of anthropologists from the University of Minnesota, but I was alone in the complex.Santander, like many of Ocongate\u2019s residents, had been schooled in the business of hospitality by Odebrecht. About twice a month for most of 2011 the construction company held workshops for all locals who might benefit from the expected influx of highway travelers \u2014 grocers, street vendors, even alpaca herders with some wool to sell. Once, the workshop participants took a field trip to Cuzco to visit a five-star hotel. \u201cThey wanted us to see how clean it is,\u201d Santander said, \u201cand what services they offer.\u201dIn late December 2012, three American tourists pulled their camper off the highway one night, parking it on a small dirt road in Ocongate. According to an account titled \u201cNightmare in Peru\u201d on the tourists\u2019 blog, they had just popped open beers when villagers approached them and demanded to see their identification. But the Americans, who spoke limited Spanish, refused to surrender their passports and tried to drive away. Rocks were thrown by the villagers, and a can of Mace was deployed by the Americans. \u201cAfter nearly 11 hours of being attacked, chased, beaten, whipped and held at gunpoint without food, sleep or water, we were led back to the truck,\u201d one tourist wrote after getting medical treatment in Cuzco, three hours away. \u201cAll of the windows and the windshield of the truck had been broken, and the camper had been broken into.\u201dMost people I spoke with said they were still waiting for the influx of tourists they were promised. Near evening I took a walk for a couple of miles along the highway. I spotted a woman carrying an enormous cloth bundle, which she laid out on the gravel shoulder of the road. Inside the bundle was a load of recently harvested quinoa, which she spread out on her cloth. Then she waited. Within minutes, a large fuel truck whooshed by. The wind from the tires blew over her pile, separating the light chaff from the heavier grain. For centuries, Andean farmers have fanned or hand-tossed their grain to do the same job. The Interoceanic, it seemed, was not wholly without local benefits.Enriques stood beside two roomy pickup trucks he hoped to move and watched one customer after another pass him by. \u201cLots of first-time buyers,\u201d he complained. \u201cThey start off with the little ones, and then they move up to something bigger.\u201dOne first-timer was Eudes Ayrampo, 40, trailed by his teenage daughter and son. He quickly eyed a Suzuki Alto, the smallest car in sight. The family huddled together. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary,\u201d his daughter said. \u201cWhat if there\u2019s an emergency and we need to get somewhere fast?\u201d Her brother agreed, and rubbed his father\u2019s shoulders, trying to loosen him up. Eudes conceded that a car would make family trips easier, and with that, another car joined Cuzco\u2019s fray.You can argue that this emerging demographic of car buyers unites one end of the continent to the other. As Roberto Espejo, a 66-year-old cabdriver, told me: \u201cThe people believe if you own a car, you are in a different class. It automatically puts you above the lowest.\u201d The wave of protests in Brazil didn\u2019t reflect an increasing gap between rich and poor, as some articles suggested; it reflected rising expectations of those in the middle. In the past decade, tens of millions of Brazilians climbed over the poverty line to join the middle class, according to government figures. This helps explain why Brazilians bought more than 3.8 million automobiles in 2012, setting a new national sales record for the eighth consecutive year. Peruvians also bought more cars than ever that year \u2014 165,427 \u2014 eclipsing the previous year\u2019s sales total, which had also been a record, by 28.4 percent. Sales in Peru more than quadrupled between 2007 and 2012.The bus I boarded in Cuzco to get to the Pacific had fully reclining bed seats, silken pillows and individual touch screens with dozens of movies to choose from. I settled in for a 20-hour ride, planning to enjoy the best leg of the trip, but constant twists and plunges meant sleep was out of the question. Moans issued from the back of the bus, and by dawn, the bathroom had suffered unspeakable indignities. When we finally rolled into Lima on a cloudy afternoon, past Catholic churches, high-rises and five-star hotels, all I saw was a finish line.I eventually found my way to the ocean. The words \u201cfrom sea to shining sea\u201d clanked around in my head. Nothing about that phrase sounded right. That was partly because the idea of interoceanic unity is still too new here to be reduced to clich\u00e9, but mostly because the sea in Lima wasn\u2019t shining. It was matte gray, leaden. The sky was overcast and drab.I stood in front of a dark, shaly beach. Six surfers in wet suits paddled out into the water and disappeared in the blur of sea mist and sky haze. I was staring into the Pacific, but all was fog. It felt very much like the end of a line. There was no horizon to look into or beyond. The only thing to do was to turn around.The original plans for a transcontinental highway imagined a road that would allow goods to flow outward, from the heart of South America to the world. One day that very well could happen. But for now, the travelers on this road seemed to have reversed the prevailing course. The destinations were right here, inside the very continent that had opened itself up.When I got back to my hotel room, an email from Joseph Silas, one of the Haitians I met in the migrant camp, was waiting for me. He had received his residency papers, he said, and was ready to hit the road. Based on the date that he sent his message, I calculated that he would be arriving in S\u00e3o Paulo very soon, if he hadn\u2019t already. He was traveling every inch of the highway I\u2019d covered, feeling every bump and curve, taking it all in a totally different direction.Advertisement"}

Instead, the president will demand what the country needs the most: new investments in education, in energy efficiency, in job training. When Republicans turn away, as they will, they will have to explain to voters why they prefer tax loopholes for the rich over programs to create jobs and rebuild the economy.\u201cOver the course of last year, Republicans consistently showed a lack of willingness to negotiate on a deficit-reduction deal,\u201d a White House official said, \u201crefusing to identify even one unfair tax loophole they would be willing to close, despite the president\u2019s willingness to put tough things on the table.\u201dHaving finally realized that a deal with the inflexible House was impossible, the president is pursuing a better course, seeking $56 billion in new spending, evenly split between defense and nondefense, following the pattern set in December\u2019s temporary budget agreement. The nondefense spending would be used for job training and manufacturing assistance, new programs to cut energy waste and modernize the power grid, and more investment in high-quality preschool programs.As Mr. Obama promised in his State of the Union speech, the budget will also propose an important expansion in the earned-income tax credit to childless adults.

{"Headline": "No Surprise, Fed Was Biggest Buyer of Treasuries in 2013", "Date": "2014-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsTHE Federal Reserve financed most of the government\u2019s deficit in 2013, in sharp contrast to the year before, when the Fed did not add to its holdings of Treasury securities. The American private sector appears to have been a net seller of Treasuries in 2013, but the foreign private sector was a substantial buyer, according to government estimates released this week.In 2013, the government issued a net $759 billion in Treasury securities to the public. That was the lowest figure in six years, as the budget deficit declined because of a healthier economy, which increased tax receipts, and to government austerity that cut spending.The Fed bought a net $543 billion of Treasuries during 2013. That was not a record amount \u2014 in 2011 it had purchased $656 billion \u2014 but it enabled the Fed to finance 71 percent of the net Treasury borrowing during the year. That was the highest proportion since the government resumed running deficits in 2002. The 2011 purchases amounted to 61 percent of the money the government borrowed that year.The Fed has begun \u201ctapering\u201d its purchases of Treasury securities, as it grows more optimistic about the economy. If it continues on that course, purchases in 2014 are likely to be considerably lower than in 2013. In general, the Fed does not directly finance the Treasury by purchasing newly issued securities. Instead, it buys in the open market. But the net impact is the same.While the Fed was stepping up buying, China \u2014 the largest foreign creditor of the United States \u2014 slowed its purchases, according to United States Treasury estimates of international capital flows. The Treasury estimated that China bought a net $48.5 billion in Treasury securities in 2013, $20 billion less than it bought in 2012. Japan replaced China as the largest foreign investors, buying $71.3 billion in Treasuries, up from $53.1 billion in 2012.Those figures include both private and public sector purchases, although in China, the figures are presumably overwhelmingly from the public sector. In total, the government estimates that foreign private investors purchased a net $198.9 billion in Treasury securities, while public agencies, including central banks, bought only $22.2 billion in those securities. If China\u2019s purchases were primarily by the government, that would indicate that other governments around the world were net sellers.It is unusual for private foreigners to be more enthusiastic than foreign governments about Treasuries. The last time that happened was in 2005. That year, Japan became a net seller of Treasuries for the first time in three years, having halted dollar purchases that were viewed as a way of seeking to keep the yen from rising too high relative to the American currency.China is now estimated to own $1.27 trillion in Treasuries, and Japan to own $1.18 trillion. Between them, they control 42 percent of the $5.8 trillion held by foreigners.Long-term Treasury yields began to rise in 2013, as the American economy seemed to strengthen. That led some American financial institutions to avoid such securities, whose market values will decline if rates continue to go up. Over all, the American public, including banks as well as private investors, is estimated to have reduced its holdings of Treasuries by $4.7 billion in 2013.If that is accurate, and its accuracy depends in large part on the Treasury\u2019s estimates of foreign transactions, which can be subject to substantial revisions, it would probably indicate that it was banks, not individuals, who were net sellers of Treasuries. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reports that during the first nine months of the year, banks and savings institutions collectively reduced their Treasury holdings by about $46 billion.Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spurred by Global Crises, Germany Weighs a More Muscular Foreign Policy", "Date": "2014-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUNICH \u2014 German leaders are pushing a vigorous new case that it is time for their nation to find a more muscular voice in foreign affairs, even suggesting that Germany should no longer reflexively avoid some military deployments, as it did in Libya almost three years ago.Chancellor Angela Merkel has yet to weigh in on the use of the military, and it is not clear how willing the German public is to embrace a more assertive posture. But a variety of senior officials are urging a rethinking of the country\u2019s assumptions about its diplomatic and military role. They are driven partly by alarm about crises from Ukraine to Africa, but also by unease about the strength of Germany\u2019s partnership with the United States after revelations of American spying, and about American officials\u2019 increasing reluctance to take the lead in interventions.President Joachim Gauck sent the strongest signal yet of a possible change in direction with a speech late Friday at the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering that attracts an array of world leaders and defense experts and has historically been a forum for sharp policy debates.Germany\u2019s Nazi and Communist pasts are no excuse for ducking international duties, Mr. Gauck said. He argued that the current Germany \u2014 \u201cthe best we have ever known,\u201d he said \u2014 was well established as a democracy and as a reliable partner and ally, and that it should step out \u201cearlier, more decisively and more substantially\u201d on the world stage. The president has no power to make policy under Germany\u2019s Constitution, but is expected to guide debate. G\u00fcnther Nonnenmacher, co-publisher of Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a center-right newspaper, wrote after the speech that Mr. Gauck \u201cmay well have spoken the authoritative word in the debate over German foreign and security policy.\u201d In his widely covered speech, Mr. Gauck, who was a Lutheran pastor in Communist East Germany before the Berlin Wall fell, told his 80 million compatriots that stepping up to the demands of a fast-changing world was \u201cthe greatest challenge of our time.\u201dIn a carefully composed, half-hour speech that skirted direct admonition, Mr. Gauck said Germany could not grant itself some kind of privileged abstention, hiding behind history or simply being too cozy to act. He called for debate, saying, \u201cWhen the ultimate case is discussed \u2014 deployment of the German military \u2014 it should be Germany can neither answer \u2018no\u2019 out of principle or give an automatic \u2018yes.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Germany\u2019s new defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, took the stage after Mr. Gauck and said, \u201cIndifference is not an option for Germany.\u201dMs. von der Leyen, the first woman to hold the defense minister post, spoke days after telling the newsmagazine Der Spiegel that Germany might send more soldiers to bolster the French presence in Mali, meant to prevent the disintegration of a country that has been a growing base for Islamist militants.Mr. Steinmeier cast that call as part of a new German role in Europe. Echoing United States officials and other foreign policy makers who have encouraged Germany to act in accordance with its status as Europe\u2019s largest and the world\u2019s fourth largest economy, he added, \u201cGermany is really too big to just comment from the sidelines.\u201dNorbert R\u00f6ttgen, a member of Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservative party who heads the foreign affairs committee of the German Parliament, said in an interview that the new tone stemmed from \u201ca coincidence of several events that shake you awake.\u201dDisillusionment with the United States, which taught postwar Germany the value of individual freedom and privacy, has been acute across the spectrum of the German political elite.Particularly among Germans who have long embraced the United States, \u201cthe disappointment sits deep,\u201d said Georg Mascolo, a prominent German journalist, voicing a view expressed in conversations with other experts and policy makers at the Munich conference. The idea that Germany\u2019s greatest ally would spy on its most eager pupil has shaken the elite into action, several experts said, convincing Germany that it needs to set its own, more robust foreign policy.Mr. R\u00f6ttgen said the new tone came \u201cas the consciousness dawns that Europe is not in such good shape\u201d and its strongest nation is looked on to do more. Longtime observers of German affairs said it was not clear that the new tone would result in major change. Josef Joffe, publisher and editor of the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a visiting professor of political science at Stanford University, wrote in Die Zeit that even the government\u2019s proposal for muscularity envisioned military engagement only in homeopathic doses.Washington, though, appears to have taken heart. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel welcomed Ms. von der Leyen\u2019s pledge to take on a larger role in Africa, and the two agreed that she should visit the Pentagon soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Long-Haul Expansion by a Norwegian Carrier Upsets U.S. Airlines", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFlying doesn\u2019t come cheaply these days, particularly on long-haul flights across the Atlantic.But Norwegian Air Shuttle, which specializes in low-cost flights within Europe, plans to bring its pared-down model to the United States and Asia.Its strategy, however, comes with a few twists: Norwegian is moving its long-haul operations from Norway to Ireland, basing some of its pilots and crew in Bangkok, hiring flight attendants in the United States, and flying the most advanced jetliner in service \u2014 the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. In the process, it has infuriated established carriers and pilots.Other airlines have tried a low-fare approach on long-haul flights, with little success. But Bjorn Kjos, Norwegian\u2019s ebullient chief executive, is confident that his unconventional approach will allow the airline to offer fares 50 percent cheaper than the competition\u2019s.Norwegian started flying between Oslo and Kennedy Airport in New York in May and has round-trip fares starting at $509. The second-lowest price found recently was $895 on United Airlines flying out of Newark Liberty International Airport. Norwegian plans to add more than a dozen new routes this year, including direct service from London to New York and Copenhagen to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., once regulators approve its new registration in Dublin.\u201cWe expect to see more dramatic reductions in fares,\u201d said Mr. Kjos, a former maritime lawyer who co-founded the airline in the early 1990s.But Norwegian\u2019s novel model has raised stiff opposition from American labor groups, airlines and pilots who see it as a backhanded attempt to outsource cheaper labor and undercut competition. Norwegian, these critics argue, is unfairly taking advantage of an open-skies agreement between the United States and Europe even though Norway is not a member of the European Union.\u201cComplex is not a good word here for what they are trying to do; I\u2019d say it\u2019s convoluted,\u201d said Lee Moak, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, a union that is one of the leading opponents of Norwegian\u2019s plans. \u201cThey want to exploit legal and regulatory loopholes to give them an unfair economic advantage over U.S. airlines that operate in a global marketplace.\u201dIn a joint letter to the Department of Transportation, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines said the low-cost airline wanted to skirt labor laws by resettling its long-haul operations in Dublin, while using a Singapore-based company to hire pilots on its behalf in Thailand. The result would give it \u201ca competitive advantage on trans-Atlantic routes in direct competition with U.S. carriers.\u201d (A Norwegian subsidiary, called Norwegian Air International, is waiting to be certified as an air carrier by Irish civil aviation authorities.)The lobbying battle is heating up. American and European Union officials and pilots met in Oslo this week to press their opposition to Norwegian\u2019s expansion plans. At the same time, the Norwegian transportation minister, Ketil Solvik-Olsen, made the airline\u2019s case on Monday in a letter to his American counterpart, Anthony Foxx.\u201cI believe we should not hinder the establishment of new business models just because we cannot know for sure how they will develop,\u201d Mr. Solvik-Olsen said in his letter.Norwegian\u2019s case may be testing the spirit of the labor protection provisions in the open-skies agreement, according to William S. Swelbar, an aviation expert and the executive vice president at InterVISTAS Consulting, but the airline will provide the type of competition to United States carriers and their global partners that was contemplated by regulators.\u201cThey are the first true low-cost carrier to take advantage of the opportunities provided for under that agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cAs in any agreement, the first case always challenges the meaning of the negotiated language.\u201dMr. Swelbar added Norwegian could be setting a precedent that incumbent airlines probably wish to avoid. \u201cMaybe the fear is that if Norwegian is successful, then that will invite Ryanair and some U.S. low-cost carrier and others to take advantage of what was negotiated between the U.S. and the E.U.,\u201d he said.Other airlines are beginning to test those waters, too. Emirates, the Dubai-based giant airline, recently began flying direct service between New York and Milan, a move that has also angered domestic carriers. Norwegian\u2019s long-haul business model essentially establishes new bases for pilots and flight attendants in the United States and Asia that will serve nonstop destinations in Europe.The airline opened a base in Bangkok last spring, as it began its international service out of Thailand with flights from Bangkok to Oslo and Stockholm. Pilots for the 787s based there come from various European countries, and have previously flown for airlines like British Airways and KLM Royal Dutch, Mr. Kjos said. They are paid competitive salaries averaging $200,000 a year, he said.The airline also just started two new bases in the United States and plans to hire 300 flight attendants and ground agents in New York and Fort Lauderdale.\u201cYou need to put your crew in large catchment areas,\u201d Mr. Kjos said, meaning it makes more financial sense for the airline to hire crew members outside of Europe since that\u2019s where most of its long-haul passengers and traffic will come from. For instance, out of the 10 weekly flights that Norwegian plans to have out of Kennedy Airport, just three will fly to Norway.In a letter to the Department of Transportation, the airline said its planned trans-Atlantic service was \u201cprecisely the kind of pro-competitive, pro-consumer, pro-growth innovation that the department has long supported and that was envisioned by the framers of the Open Skies Agreement.\u201dNorwegian, the third-largest low-cost airline in Europe after Ryanair and EasyJet, carried more than 20 million passengers last year.It has shown no signs of slowing down. In 2012, it made what was then the largest plane order in European history, pledging to buy 222 jets from Boeing and Airbus worth nearly $22 billion at list price. Most of those are the more efficient B737 Max or A320 Neo \u2014 narrow-body planes for the carrier\u2019s European network that will be delivered starting in 2016.The order also included 10 787s that will form the backbone of the airline\u2019s long-haul operations. Three were delivered last year; Norwegian will get four more this year and the rest through 2016. The 787s are also critical to the business plan since they promise fuel savings of 20 percent compared with similar-size planes. Norwegian is flying 291 passengers in a coach-only cabin, with 32 seats in a \u201cpremium economy\u201d configuration that provides a little more legroom. (The planes have individual TV screens, but the airline charges for food.)The long-haul plan has had its share of hiccups. The 787 has had numerous problems since its commercial debut in 2011, and the fleet was grounded for three months last year after a couple of unresolved battery flameouts. Norwegian was forced to lease an Airbus A340 for its new long-haul route and Mr. Kjos has complained loudly to Boeing about the fleet\u2019s reliability.In the most recent incident, in January, a flight from Bangkok to Oslo was delayed 19 hours after passengers noticed a fuel leak from one of the plane\u2019s wings.Still, Mr. Kjos remains confident in the 787. \u201cIt\u2019s a great airplane,\u201d he said.Labor relations have also been tense in the past year, particularly after the airline decided to hire a Thai cabin crew at lower wages than those paid to Scandinavian employees. Norwegian pilots threatened to go on strike but a deal for a new contract was eventually reached in November.\u201cSouthwest and JetBlue established new standards of fares,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is exactly what will happen across the Atlantic. We just need to be incredibly efficient.\u201dMr. Kjos once wrote a spy novel about his years as a fighter pilot in the Norwegian air force policing the skies against potential intruders from the Soviet Union. He now seeks to challenge the iron grip of the three global airline alliances \u2014 Star Alliance, SkyTeam and Oneworld \u2014 which he said accounted for 87 percent of flights across the Atlantic. (United, Delta and American each belong to a different group.)\u201cObviously they want to keep competition out.\u201d Mr. Kjos said. \u201cEspecially low-cost carriers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Jeff Weiner, the chief executive of LinkedIn, explains how his company aims to build an economic graph that will link together the whole global work force with every job being offered in the world, full-time and temporary, for-profit and volunteer, the skills needed for each job, and a presence for every higher education institution everywhere offering a way to acquire those skills. Aaron Levie, the chief executive of Box, explains how his online storage and collaboration technology is enabling anyone on any mobile device to securely upload files, collaborate, and share content from anywhere to anywhere.

Curt Carlson, the chief executive of SRI International, which invented Siri for your iPhone, recalls how one leading innovator just told him that something would never happen and \u201cthen I pick up the paper and it just did.\u201dWhat they all have in common is they wake up every day and ask: \u201cWhat are the biggest trends in the world, and how do I best invent/reinvent my business to thrive from them?\u201d They\u2019re fixated on creating abundance, not redividing scarcity, and they respect no limits on imagination. No idea here is \u201coff the table.\u201dThen, after you\u2019ve been totally energized by people inventing the future, you go back to your hotel room and catch up with the present: the news from Washington. Two headlines stand out like flashing red lights: House Speaker John Boehner says immigration reform in 2014 is off the table and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says the \u201cfast track\u201d legislation we need to pass vital free-trade agreements with the European Union and some of our biggest trading partners in the Asia-Pacific region is off the table. Forget about both until after the 2014 midterm elections, if not 2016.Summing this all up, The Associated Press reported on Feb. 9 something that you could not make up: \u201cWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Little more than a week after Groundhog Day, the evidence is mounting that lawmakers have all but wrapped up their most consequential work of 2014, at least until the results of the fall elections are known.\u201dWhat a contrast. Silicon Valley: where ideas come to launch. Washington, D.C., where ideas go to die. Silicon Valley: where there are no limits on your imagination and failure in the service of experimentation is a virtue. Washington: where the \u201cimagination\u201d to try something new is now a treatable mental illness covered by Obamacare and failure in the service of experimentation is a crime. Silicon Valley: smart as we can be. Washington: dumb as we wanna be.True, some libertarians in Silicon Valley cheer Washington\u2019s paralysis. But it is not so simple. There is a certain \u201cleague minimum\u201d that we need and are entitled to expect from Washington, especially today. America just discovered huge deposits of energy and gold at the same time. That is, thanks to advances in drilling technology we have unlocked vast new sources of natural gas, which \u2014 if extracted with environmentally sound practices \u2014 will give us decades of cheap, cleaner energy and enable America to restore itself as a center of manufacturing.At the same time, the dominance of American companies in cloud computing, and the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d \u2014 billions of devices with sensors \u2014 have given us a huge lead in the era of Big Data, where the winners will be those who are best at amassing, analyzing and protecting that data and use software to quickly apply what they learn from the data to improve any product or service. These data mountains and the tools to exploit them are the new gold. And we\u2019ve got it.In such an era, one of the two most valuable things Washington can do to create more good jobs and wealth is to open more export markets. The other is to have an immigration policy that not only provides a legal pathway to citizenship for those here illegally but enables America to attract the best brainpower and apply that talent to the data mountains and software opportunities we\u2019re creating. \u201cStudies suggest that proposed deals with Asia and Europe could generate global gains of $600 billion a year, with $200 billion of that going to America,\u201d The Economist added. \u201cAnd that understates the benefits, since the deals would spur competition in the market for services, which make up most of rich countries\u2019 output but are seldom traded across borders. Opening industries like finance and transport to greater competition could bring great savings to consumers.\u201dThe U.S. trade representative, Michael Froman, told me that if we\u2019re able to conclude these two trade deals, America would have free trade with \u201ctwo-thirds of the world.\u201d If you combine that with our lead in cloud computing, social media, software and natural gas for low-cost manufacturing \u2014 plus our rule of law and entrepreneurial cultural \u2014 you understand, says Froman, why one European C.E.O. told him that America will be the \u201cproduction platform of choice\u201d for manufacturers all over the world to set up their operations and export to the world. But it will all have to wait at least until after 2014 when we might have a week to legislate before we get ready for 2016. God forbid either party should challenge their respective bases who oppose freer trade or immigration. That would actually require leadership.Start-up America is our best hope. Sure, we\u2019re doing better than most everyone else, but just being the \u201ccleanest dirty shirt\u201d has never been the American dream.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Announces Resignation Amid Party Revolt", "Date": "2014-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Prime Minister Enrico Letta, whose weak coalition government has come under increasing criticism, announced on Thursday that he would resign, after his own Democratic Party staged a dramatic insurrection and set the stage to replace him with the party\u2019s new leader, Matteo Renzi. The Democratic Party is the largest member of Italy\u2019s coalition government, and the party\u2019s decision to dump Mr. Letta could be put to a confidence vote in Parliament. Mr. Letta will meet with his cabinet on Friday morning and then present his resignation letter to Italy\u2019s president. This clears the path for Mr. Renzi, 39, to try to become Italy\u2019s youngest prime minister.Mr. Renzi, the mayor of Florence, recently won a nationwide primary to become leader of the Democratic Party. He has a reputation for boldness and has long been considered Italy\u2019s most promising young politician. He has spoken repeatedly about the need for sweeping political and economic changes. But until a few days ago, few analysts anticipated that he would lead a revolt against his own party\u2019s sitting prime minister.\u201cItaly is living in a moment of difficulty,\u201d Mr. Renzi said during a televised party meeting on Thursday. \u201cWe need to offer the possibility to emerge from this morass with a radical program to relaunch the country.\u201dItaly is suffering through a prolonged slump, even as some other European countries are starting to emerge from a devastating recession. Unemployment tops 12 percent, and while business leaders have called for major changes to spur economic growth, Italy\u2019s political system has been stalemated, largely unable to respond.For Europe, which is witnessing rising populist anger before European parliamentary elections, Italy\u2019s economic doldrums and political gyrations are sources of persistent concern. Last year, Mr. Letta fended off challenges to his government by arguing that Italy needed stability, an argument endorsed by many European leaders.But Mr. Letta\u2019s government was ultimately doomed by inaction, partly because of the awkwardness of his coalition, a contentious marriage of left and right parties that was cobbled together after inconclusive national elections last February. Mr. Letta was chosen by Italy\u2019s president, Giorgio Napolitano, to lead the coalition as a compromise figure, a coolheaded politician with ties to opposition parties.In his speech at the party meeting on Thursday, Mr. Renzi expressed gratitude to Mr. Letta \u201cfor the considerable work he has done with government, a government born in a delicate moment.\u201d But for weeks, tensions had been rising, as Mr. Renzi began openly questioning the government\u2019s effectiveness to tackle the country\u2019s pressing problems, with Mr. Letta occasionally sniping back.The two men met privately on Wednesday and, hours later, Mr. Letta used a televised news conference to fight for his job. He promised a new overhaul push and swatted at rumors about his uncertain future, making a veiled jab at Mr. Renzi, by saying that anyone who wanted his job should declare it openly.Mr. Renzi has often said that he would prefer to become prime minister by winning an election, so he could assume office with a public mandate. Italy, though, may not be prepared to hold elections for months, or longer. The highest court has struck down portions of election laws as unconstitutional and called on the government to draft a new law.Mr. Letta had promised to do so \u2014 until Mr. Renzi unexpectedly intervened by brokering a deal with his party\u2019s longtime enemy, Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister. Parliament is expected to begin debating that proposal next week, but it is unclear how long it will take to pass. Given the uncertainty in Parliament, and the growing outside criticism of the government, analysts say Mr. Renzi calculated that he could be more effective leading the government, rather than just leading his party.\u201cThe push to have Renzi taking the lead comes from society, more than from within the Democratic Party,\u201d Giorgio Tonini, a party member who serves in Italy\u2019s Senate, said on Wednesday night. \u201cThe idea behind it is that a leadership change can bring new nourishment to the government\u2019s actions and more consensus with the party.\u201dMr. Renzi is already facing criticism that he is motivated by personal ambition, and some members of his party used Thursday\u2019s meeting to express discomfort by the sudden shift in direction.\u201cI am not convinced by this solution,\u201d said Giuseppe Civati, a party member who challenged Mr. Renzi for leadership of the party last year. \u201cI have always been skeptical of the bipartisan government. I don\u2019t know why its future would be different by changing the prime minister.\u201dHe also questioned whether Mr. Renzi\u2019s legitimacy would suffer by not waiting to hold elections. \u201cThis is a passage which is a little less democratic,\u201d he said.Now the question is how Mr. Renzi will coexist with the other parties in the coalition. Angelino Alfano, the deputy prime minister and leader of the party New Center-Right, praised the accomplishments of the Letta government as a ship that had navigated rough waters. He warned that his party would not continue to support the government if Mr. Renzi moved it too far to the left.Mr. Alfano noted that Mr. Letta was expected to tender his resignation on Friday, the day Italy\u2019s national statistics agency was expected to announce positive news about the economy.Elisabetta Povoledo and Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Growth Slows, Raising Concerns About Obstacles That Lie Ahead", "Date": "2014-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 The Japanese economy grew at a tepid rate of 1.0 percent in the final quarter of 2013, falling short of analyst expectations and heightening concerns that Japan\u2019s recovery may not be strong enough to weather further challenges expected this year.Forty-one economists polled by the Japan Center for Economic Research had predicted annualized growth of 3 percent for the quarter. But an unsteady recovery in exports and a surge in imports helped blunt the rate of growth, according to preliminary figures released Monday by the Cabinet Office.On a quarterly basis, Japan\u2019s economy expanded 0.3 percent between October and December, for the fourth consecutive quarter of growth. Economic growth for the year came to an estimated 1.6 percent, separate data showed.Private consumption rose 0.5 percent from the previous quarter, though economists attributed much of that to spending ahead of a sales tax increase set to go into effect in April and warned that growth could slow later this year. Exports grew 0.5 percent, a gain offset by a 3.4 percent jump in imports. Capital expenditure grew 1.3 percent, which was weaker than expected.The latest readings underscored the challenges facing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his three-pronged plan to put Japan\u2019s long-deflationary economy back on a robust growth path.Markets rose by over 50 percent last year in response to Mr. Abe\u2019s first \u201carrow,\u201d an aggressive monetary stimulus that has flooded the Japanese economy with money and helped weaken the yen. But while the weaker currency has brought record overseas earnings for Japanese exporters, it has yet to translate into significantly higher export volumes or a rebound in wages and investment back home, undercutting the economic recovery.Japanese stocks have recently fallen back somewhat, hurt by concerns over the strength of the global economic recovery. The weaker yen has also driven up Japan\u2019s import costs, contributing to a record trade deficit in 2013.The planned sales tax increase in April to 8 percent from 5 percent, which economists say could depress consumption, presents another problem for Mr. Abe. But the government says a 5.5 trillion yen stimulus package approved by Parliament this month will help minimize the tax increase\u2019s fallout.\u201cAfter continued recovery through the year\u2019s end, the Japanese economy is set to take a temporary tumble following the consumption tax increase,\u201d economists at the Mizuho Research Institute said in a statement ahead of Monday\u2019s numbers.Other economists worry that economic growth has become dependent on the large-scale government spending that is the second component of Mr. Abe\u2019s growth plan. At the same time, the economic reforms designed to raise Japan\u2019s growth potential \u2014 the final and most anticipated facet of Abenomics \u2014 have yet to crystallize.The prime minister chose to go ahead with the hike to quell concerns over the government\u2019s dire finances, which have helped drive Japan\u2019s public debt to over twice the size of its $5 trillion economy.This year, Mr. Abe is set to decide whether to raise the tax rate to 10 percent in 2015 to help pay for costs incurred because of Japan\u2019s aging population, a difficult decision that highlights the challenges of chasing economic growth and fiscal consolidation at the same time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colombia\u2019s Warning for Mexico", "Date": "2014-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMEDELL\u00cdN, Colombia \u2014 Most everyone agrees: The only thing worse than killing is being killed. If our lives are threatened, we have the right to defend ourselves, with force if necessary. In a civilized society, that defense is delegated to the state. But not all of us, apparently, live in that kind of civilized society. Colombia in the 1990s saw the rise of vigilante self-defense groups. In its impotence and desperation at not being able to rapidly win the war against the guerrilla army (which was essentially a drug cartel) and against the drug lord Pablo Escobar\u2019s private army, the state gave the green light to these groups \u2014 called Convivir. They were made up of agricultural laborers, trained by soldiers, and financed by landowners and agribusinesses. When they began to extort money from the very businessmen who were financing them, they were declared illegal. But it was already too late. They had become clandestine paramilitary groups, using the same weapons as those they were fighting: kidnapping, murder of innocents, drug trafficking. What has been going on these last few months in Mexico, in the western state of Michoac\u00e1n, makes me fear that the same thing is happening there today. \u201cAutodefensas\u201d have organized to drive out the vicious local drug cartel, called the Knights Templar. After first demanding that the vigilantes disband, the government of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has now sanctioned them as part of the Rural Defense Corps \u2014 at least nominally under the control of the military. This is how it happens. The army, with the blessing of the central authorities, looks for an ally, a lesser evil among the local powers. Compared with the cruel and bloodthirsty Knights Templar, the self-defense groups have popular support and are allowed to operate. Meanwhile, the government ignores the fact that some of these vigilantes might be financed by the enemies of the Knights Templar \u2014 for example, rival drug gangs or another cartel from the neighboring state of Jalisco. The government allows the vigilantes to act for a while, but when it tries to come back in, the self-defense groups will have turned into a real armed power with whom the government will have to make a pact, for without them the state won\u2019t be able to assert its authority. Mexico, like several Latin American countries, is able to guarantee security and the rule of law only in certain zones. The lifeblood of law and order manages to flow near the heart of power, around the big cities, but the farther away we get, the weaker the pulse, and in some places there is none at all. Police officers are few and corrupt, judges live under threat from local despots and strongmen, and the legitimate authorities have been paid off by illegal ones. It\u2019s like the American Wild West, but with 21st-century armaments, private armies funded by the torrential flow of money from drug trafficking, and no prospect of a righteous sheriff riding in to restore calm.Sometimes the United States \u2014 which understands itself so well, but badly misunderstands Latin American realities \u2014 asks governments of its friendly southern neighbors to wage heroic battles. It asks for elimination of illicit crops, total war on drugs or extermination of guerrilla forces. The most obedient governments ignore what might be real solutions \u2014 like cutting off the source of the cartels\u2019 enormous wealth by legalizing drugs \u2014 and instead attempt to carry out these requests. They send their national armies to undertake the thankless task of fighting against their own compatriots. That\u2019s what Felipe Calder\u00f3n, Mexico\u2019s previous president, tried. But these wars to the death always fail. What they generate is local powers defending themselves by arming to the teeth, and outlying territories turning into battlefields where life is impossible for defenseless civilians. The legitimate economy and tourism disappear, death tolls soar (to around 80,000 in Mexico), and the final winner, inevitably, is not the state but some local narco-dictator with his own army of mercenaries.This is what we learned in Colombia: When the state is not present, it is local tyrants who take power and brutally impose their rules, which are nothing more than the defense of their privileges. The old Hobbesian concept, that the natural state of mankind is that man is a wolf to man, seems confirmed in these involuntary Latin American anarchist experiments. The strongest and richest wolf (from trafficking drugs or illegal mining) dominates the other wolves. Of course, every country is different. But I fear that today Mexico is making the same mistake Colombia did a quarter of a century ago. The vigilantes appear to be a cure \u2014 they are seen as saviors \u2014 but in reality they are part of the illness, one more illegal army, acting without restraints and financed by dirty money. In Colombia, the self-defense groups were eventually pursued until, in 2003, 25,000 of them were forced to demobilize. Since they were also drug traffickers, a few top paramilitary ringleaders ended up being extradited to the United States. But their legacy persists. Their descendants still live in Colombia and still have power: Now they\u2019re called criminal gangs, and they are still practicing extortion and murder financed by illegal mining and drug money. The vigilantes might begin by killing kidnappers, drug dealers and extortionists, but soon they begin killing their relatives, and then their friends, or those they think are their friends, and then the friends\u2019 families, until everyone is suspect and they might come knocking at your own door, as happened to us in Colombia \u2014 as happened to my own father, when he was gunned down in the streets of Medell\u00edn. To allow private armies, even if they are supposedly for self-defense, is to create a monster like the Hydra: If you cut off one head, two more grow back. Advertisement"}

To the list of good proposals unveiled in his first month \u2014 an ambitious surge in affordable apartments, a tax increase to pay for universal prekindergarten, expanded paid sick leave \u2014 Mr. de Blasio added some new ones. He wants Albany to allow New York City to raise its minimum wage and wants to require city-subsidized employers to pay a higher-than-minimum \u201cliving wage.\u201d These are two excellent ideas, though the minimum-wage increase sets up a likely confrontation with Gov.

Such an exercise in immigrant integration has worked in cities like New Haven and San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Amid Political Upheaval, Ukraine Faces Dire Need for Economic Help", "Date": "2014-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 With a manhunt underway for the deposed Ukrainian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was charged on Monday with mass murder, officials in Parliament pushed ahead with the monumental task of rebuilding the collapsed government. The country\u2019s most pressing problem, however, is largely out of their control: a fast-approaching economic disaster that they cannot solve without international assistance. The new speaker, Oleksandr V. Turchynov, admitted as much, warning in an open letter to the Ukrainian people on Sunday that \u201cUkraine is now in a pre-default condition and sliding into the abyss.\u201dOn Monday, Parliament accepted the surprise resignation of Ihor Sorkin, the head of the Ukrainian National Bank, and approved a replacement, Stepan Kubiv, who said one of his top priorities would be to secure aid from the International Monetary Fund.Russia had extended a lifeline of $15 billion in loans and cheap gas, but the Kremlin has suspended that aid in response to the political uncertainty in Ukraine. Russian officials continued their saber-rattling on Monday, with Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev dismissing the current government as backed by \u201cKalashnikov-toting people in black masks\u201d and saying that the leaders in Parliament were not legitimate.It was not clear when or if financial assistance promised by Europe and the United States would arrive. Though the West is claiming victory in the tug of war with Russia over Ukraine, neither the European Union nor the United States has done anything more than make promises.Catherine Ashton, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, was in Kiev on Monday, visiting Parliament and meeting throughout the day with lawmakers and others. For the moment, though, it seemed that all she was able to offer was moral support. The Obama administration said it was prepared to provide financial assistance beyond that from the I.M.F., but it did not say how much. \u201cThis support can complement an I.M.F. program by helping to make reforms easier and by putting Ukraine in a position to invest more in health and education to help develop Ukraine\u2019s human capital and strengthen its social safety net,\u201d the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, told reporters in Washington.The I.M.F. has made clear it is unwilling to help Ukraine without a commitment from the country to undertake painful austerity measures and other restructuring. Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s resistance to those demands was a principal reason he backed away from a trade deal with Europe and sought help from Russia instead. In a statement on Monday, the acting finance minister, Yuriy Kolobov, said Ukraine would need a staggering $35 billion in assistance between now and the end of next year, as well as an emergency loan within the next two weeks that he said was expected from Poland or the United States. In his statement, Mr. Kolobov said he hoped to organize a conference with international donors. \u201cThe situation in the financial sector as a whole is complex but controlled,\u201d he said. That could change at any moment, however, should Russia decide to follow through on previous threats of devastating trade sanctions if Ukraine moves closer to Europe. Mr. Turchynov and other officials have said that the new government will revive the political and trade deals with Europe that Mr. Yanukovych scuttled in the fall, setting off the unrest.Given the animosity of the new Ukrainian government toward Russia, Ivan Tchakarov, an analyst with Citibank, said that Ukraine could turn only to the West for help, and would inevitably face demands for tough reforms and a near-certain recession as a result. \u201cAssuming that Russia will pass, it will be up to the I.M.F. and E.U. to pick up the tab,\u201d Mr. Tchakarov said. \u201cThe I.M.F. will impose hard constraints on the economy, and these will most probably mean a recession in 2014.\u201d Still, Mr. Tchakarov noted that there would be long-term benefits to Ukraine\u2019s undertaking desperately needed measures, like ending subsidies of gas prices and cutting the thickets of business regulations that weigh down the economy. These actions could potentially allow it to emerge far stronger, like its neighbors Poland and the Baltic countries, he said. Until the government is in place, Ukraine cannot even make a formal request for the assistance.Lesya Orobets, a member of Parliament from the party Fatherland, said that if there was ever a moment to ask Ukraine for painful sacrifice, this was it: Things could hardly get any worse. \u201cWe are already on the bottom,\u201d Ms. Orobets said in an interview just outside the Parliament chamber. \u201cThis was already very shaky for most of the population. It\u2019s not only about the low salaries, it\u2019s about finding jobs, which was a huge problem. People are starving for some concrete steps. The demand for that is huge.\u201dUkraine\u2019s troubles run deep. Before the last three months of civil unrest, before the clashes that left more than 80 people dead, before the prime minister was fired, the police vanished and the president fled, and before teetering at the edge of chaos and civil war, Ukraine was plagued by corruption, plagued by political and fiscal mismanagement, hopelessly dependent on Russian gas and beholden to the Kremlin\u2019s whims, nearly broke and hurtling toward bankruptcy. It still is. Inna Bohoslovska, a lawmaker who defected from Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions shortly after the street protests began, said that safeguards would need to be put in place to make sure any international aid money is not wasted or stolen. \u201cWe will have to create a special body to control the international financial aid and loans,\u201d Ms. Bohoslovska said. \u201cToday, this ugliness remains, political corruption remains, thievery remains,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we let even one cent of the financial aid, which in fact will be a real Marshall Plan for Ukraine, get stolen again, then no one will believe us anymore.\u201d Standing outside the Parliament building on Monday, Irina Nikanchuk, a 25-year-old economist, waved a banner calling for early elections to a new Parliament, and heaped scorn on lawmakers and opposition politicians who are the principal beneficiaries of a revolution driven by passions on the street.\u201cWe need new people who can say no to the oligarchs, not just the old faces,\u201d said Ms. Nikanchuk, referring to the billionaires who control blocks of votes in Parliament.\u201cTymoshenko is just Putin in a skirt,\u201d she added, comparing the former prime minister and, until Saturday, jailed opposition leader with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. As if to underscore the point, Ms. Tymoshenko arrived at the Parliament building on Monday evening in a black Mercedes sedan, part of an entourage of at least three cars. An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of Ukraine\u2019s acting interior minister. He is Arsen Avakov, not Arsent.Andrew Higgins contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Hefty Yoke of Student Loan Debt", "Date": "2014-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceMore than five years after the binge of irresponsible lending led to the credit crisis and Great Recession, the amount of consumer debt in the United States has begun to rise again, but with an important difference. This time the credit standards appear far tougher. Those who should not borrow generally do not. Except, that is, for one type of debt: student loans.There delinquencies continue to rise, and loans continue to be made without regard for the ability to repay.At one time, student loans were a clear way to provide economic opportunity to people who might not have been able to attend college otherwise. In many cases, they still are. But increasingly it is becoming obvious that student loans are creating large problems that may persist for decades to come. They will impoverish some borrowers and serve as a drain on economic activity.Since 2003, the New York Fed has been using a unique database of consumer credit \u2014 the credit files from Equifax, one of the main credit reporting services. Taking a sample of accounts, the Fed is able to see the trends in both lending and repaying and determine what is happening to people who do, or do not, have student loans outstanding.Until 2009, young adults with student loan debt were more likely to own homes and were more likely to have car loans outstanding than were people of the same age without student loans. Those loans had enabled many of them to obtain college degrees and earn more money, qualifying them for mortgages. Those with student loans generally had better credit scores than those who did not.But now the opposite is true. \u201cYoung people with student loans are less likely to buy a house,\u201d said Wilbert van der Klaauw, a senior vice president of the New York Fed\u2019s research and statistics group. Those with student loan debt also are less likely to have taken out car loans. They have worse credit scores. They appear to be more likely to be living with their parents. In other types of personal loans, those who owe the most are the most likely to default, for obvious reasons. But the opposite is true for student loans. \u201cThis suggests that borrowers who default are overwhelmingly noncompleters,\u201d said Rohit Chopra, the student loan ombudsman for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cThese borrowers take on some debt but do not benefit from the wage increase associated with a degree.\u201dA lot of people are defaulting. The New York Fed report shows that while seriously delinquent personal loans have generally been declining since early 2010, delinquent student loans have been soaring. The report, for the fourth quarter of 2013, showed that 11.5 percent of such loans were at least 90 days behind in payments. In credit cards, traditionally the type of loan most likely to default, the rate was just 9.5 percent.Actually, those figures seriously understate the problem. They ignore the fact that nearly half the student loans outstanding do not currently require any payment at all, either because the student is still in school or because the student has taken advantage of other ways to defer payment.Before the Great Recession, many families financed college by taking out home equity loans, or by refinancing their mortgages, or by simply using savings. But the decline in home values, coupled with tougher lending standards, closed off the home equity route for many, and unemployment no doubt drained savings for others.But the real issue may be that the most important lesson of the credit crisis \u2014 that those who make loans need to have good reasons to care if they are repaid \u2014 was not extended to the student loan market.These days, federal student loans \u2014 the largest part of the market \u2014 are essentially made by the colleges, using government money. There is no underwriting criteria and few limits on how much any student can borrow. The limits that do exist apply to so-called dependent undergraduate students, who are at least partly supported by their parents. Graduate students can borrow what they want, and parents of dependent undergraduates can take out their own student loans after the student has maxed out.Obviously, there is no way to apply conventional loan underwriting standards to students who, by definition, are not at the moment earning enough money to repay their loans. But the program is subject to abuse by colleges whose primary \u2014 if not only \u2014 goal is to get their hands on the money.For programs that do not lead to conventional degrees \u2014 largely the training programs pushed by for-profit private schools, the kind that do a lot of advertising on New York subways \u2014 the Department of Education has been trying to come up with a rule to exclude programs that have a clear history of not producing people who can earn enough to repay their loans: a \u201cgainful employment\u201d rule.The department\u2019s first effort was rejected by a federal judge after the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities sued.The department has now submitted a second rule to the Office of Management and Budget; the details are not yet public. The department did that after a panel it appointed, including representatives of various types of colleges and students, could not reach agreement.It might make sense for the department to instead, or in addition, design a \u201cskin in the game\u201d rule for the colleges. If a college\u2019s former students turn out to default frequently, the college could be required to pay a substantial penalty. That could mean colleges would have good reasons not to promote programs that did nothing to help their students.On the other hand, colleges whose alumni were particularly good at repaying loans might receive some kind of financial reward, perhaps in the form of a grant that could be used for scholarships.Any such proposal would prompt protests that such a rule would keep needy students from receiving the aid they need to get ahead. But all too often now, student loans are not a pathway to the middle class but a burden that keep young people from having any real chance of success.\u201cYou want to open doors for students,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Sullivan told me, \u201cbut you do not want to open doors that lead off a cliff, to default.\u201dMore also needs to be done to regulate the companies that service the student loans. \u201cThere are uncanny resemblances between issues faced by student loan borrowers and struggling homeowners,\u201d Mr. Chopra, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau official, told me. One thing the federal student loan program does not lack is ways to collect the money. Bankruptcy will usually not cancel student loans, and the government has the power to seize income tax refunds and garnishee wages as needed. Some parents who guaranteed student loans that have defaulted find the money taken out of their Social Security checks. For a student, a default can destroy a credit record, making it hard even to rent an apartment, let alone buy a home.And even those who manage to stay current on their loans will be significantly less well off than their predecessors. They are presumably less likely to contribute to 401(k) retirement accounts.\u201cRising student debt may prove to be one of the more painful aftershocks of the Great Recession,\u201d Mr. Chopra said in his speech to the St. Louis Fed, \u201cespecially if left unaddressed.\u201dFloyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economic Road Ahead", "Date": "2014-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialRepublican intransigence on spending will continue to impede growth. It will not do as much damage as last year, when budget cuts and the government shutdown trimmed nearly a percentage point from growth in the fourth quarter alone. But Republicans\u2019 refusal to renew expired federal unemployment benefits will hurt, as will their expected opposition to a higher minimum wage and other policies. Economic fundamentals remain worrisome. Much of the fourth-quarter growth came from bolstered consumer spending. But much of that spending was for bigger outlays on household utilities and groceries, necessary expenditures that are hardly indications of surging consumer sentiment. Spending on homes and cars, which does reflect rising demand and confidence, was disappointing. The residential housing sector contracted in the fourth quarter, for the first time since 2010, and motor vehicle sales slowed from the third to the fourth quarter. Whether housing and vehicle sales will recover quickly is an open question. In the recent past, housing has been strengthened by favorable interest rates and low home prices; light-truck sales were aided by the related surge in housing construction. Eventually, however, the health of home and car buying is inseparable from the health of the job market and the availability of credit \u2014 especially, in the case of homes, for first-time buyers. Good jobs and ample credit are still hard to come by. Another risk is the possibility that interest rates will rise in the wake of Federal Reserve efforts to gradually withdraw stimulus. The report also does not inspire confidence in business investment, which has been subpar for some time, to spur the economy. The only bright spot in the fourth quarter was a jump in spending on equipment, which appears to be tied to tax-motivated buying at the end of last year. At bottom, the economy is where it has been before in the recovery that began, officially, in mid-2009. Aggregate growth numbers look encouraging, but the drivers of the growth look shaky and, in any event, are still too weak to translate into more good jobs, higher pay and a better life for most Americans. Nor is there any guarantee that the benefits of stronger growth, when and if it materializes, will be broadly shared; to date, what growth there has been has largely benefited those at the top of the income and wealth ladder, a dynamic that becomes more entrenched the longer it endures. Congress could help, with government spending, labor reforms and other policies to support job creation and higher wages and, by extension, consumption and investment. But legislative solutions are not in the cards. President Obama\u2019s recent executive efforts to create jobs and increase pay are positive, but modest. Cautious optimism is better than utter despair, but the emphasis still falls on \u201ccautious.\u201d Advertisement"}

But international lenders\u2019 hands are tied until the country has a transitional government in place, officials said. Even once the money is flowing, a lending program is likely to be accompanied by demands for a necessary but bitter pill of government cutbacks, higher energy costs and structural changes that previous Ukrainian governments found impossible to swallow. Western officials are well aware that a rescue package will be necessary to stave off an absolute financial collapse \u2014 and thus to help ensure the success of the political transition already underway. But they also worry that the standard prescriptions for economic overhaul risk sending Ukraine into even worse turmoil and that the nascent government might not be able to deliver.\u201cThis is not simple arithmetic,\u201d said Douglas A. Rediker, a former American official at the I.M.F. American officials said it was important that the assistance be substantial. On Wednesday, Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters that Obama administration officials had been discussing a separate package of assistance that would complement the I.M.F.\u2019s efforts.\u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t think it is enough for us to be heralding the advent of democracy and to applaud the courage and conviction of the people who brought about this transition and then just not do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that is unconscionable.\u201dAccording to the plans, which have yet to be formally decided by the White House, the United States would provide $1 billion in loan guarantees. Mr. Kerry said that administration officials were also considering a direct cash infusion to Ukraine. He said that he had just talked to Senator John McCain, the leading Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, about a potential aid effort but that it was not clear how large a package of direct aid Congress would support. \u201cWe are formulating initially a $1 billion loan guarantee,\u201d Mr. Kerry said, \u201cbut we are also looking at the possibility of additional assistance.\u201dThe pathway to a more substantial aid package is fraught with hurdles. It is unclear how bad Ukraine\u2019s books have gotten. A government needs to be put in place that is prepared to request an I.M.F. package. And it will be asked to agree to tough economic conditions that are likely to prove deeply unpopular with Ukrainians already suffering from economic and political instability. \u201cWe need to have somebody to talk to, O.K.?\u201d said Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., answering questions about Ukraine from journalists last weekend in Sydney, Australia. \u201cAny discussion takes two.\u201dOnce that happens, any package needs to be \u201cowned by the authorities, by the people, because at the end of the day it will be the future of the Ukrainian economy,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said. \u201cThere are economic reforms that we all know need to be started.\u201dPolicy makers are already hotly debating a rescue package for Ukraine, with conversations about the economy dominating discussions on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meeting of economic officials in Sydney. \u201cWith the authorities mostly preoccupied with handling the political upheaval, economic policies have remained in limbo,\u201d said Ondrej Schneider and Lubomir Mitov of the finance institute. \u201cRisks of prolonged political uncertainty still remain substantial, however, raising odds of delays in implementing reforms with potentially disastrous consequences for financial stability and growth.\u201dA Treasury official \u2014 speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatically fragile matters \u2014 said that there was significant good will toward Ukraine among international officials and an acknowledgment that an emergency program needed to come quickly. But the official said that an I.M.F. program \u2014 including a careful assessment of the country\u2019s financial state and a commitment by Ukraine to economic overhaul \u2014 must be the priority.The fund, before lending, will take a thorough accounting of Ukraine\u2019s finances, especially given concerns that previous governments have been less than honest about its books.\u201cSomeone had to pay for those ostriches,\u201d said Mr. Rediker, referring to the zoo found at the compound of Viktor F. Yanukovych, the ousted president.Analysts said they expected Ukraine to require a package of about $10 billion to $20 billion in short-term lending, with the possibility of more next year. That lending would allow the new government to run a fiscal deficit without having to finance itself on the punishing international bond markets.\u201cWe will be ready to engage, ready to help,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said this weekend. \u201cWe, of course, try to go further and play the catalytic role that the I.M.F. typically plays in such situations.\u201dThe I.M.F. is expected to insist that Ukraine raise domestic gas prices, cut government spending, tackle corruption and allow the country\u2019s currency to float on the international markets. Opposition leaders have signaled their support for substantive changes.\u201cThe popular demand is radical,\u201d said Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cThe public sector has been working for the enrichment of the elites, and the old tricks need to be done away with.\u201dThe prime minister of Georgia, Irakli Garibashvili, who met with Mr. Kerry on Wednesday, also emphasized the need for the West to move quickly to support Ukraine\u2019s transition. \u201cI think the European Union, together with I.M.F. and with other international institutions, should find a solution now to solve their problems,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI think they should be very flexible.\u201dIn 2010, the I.M.F. had offered to lend to Ukraine, only to pull back when it found the government unable or unwilling to follow through on its commitments. That experience is likely to limit the fund\u2019s flexibility, leading it to require shorter disbursements with more conditions attached, analysts said. \u201cThere are those who say, \u2018Throw money at them! They\u2019re the good guys!\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Mr. Rediker, now with the Peterson Institute. \u201cBut that\u2019s not how the I.M.F. works.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Skating Close to the Edge, Again, on the Debt Ceiling", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Here they go again.As of Friday, the Treasury will no longer have the authority to issue bonds as necessary to pay the government\u2019s bills. In a matter of weeks, the government could run out of cash and begin defaulting on some payments unless Congress acts to raise the official ceiling on the national debt. And once again, Congress is struggling to avoid a potential fiscal and economic train wreck. But this fourth debt ceiling standoff in three years is taking place in an atmosphere of fatigue and caution rather than brazenness and conviction. A confrontational parliamentary tactic that came in with a bang might finally be exiting with a whimper.\u201cThis is the dying gasp of a dead-end strategy,\u201d said Representative Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat. \u201cI think this fight is over.\u201dEven as some Republicans continued to hunt for one policy concession or another to demand from Democrats in exchange for lifting the ceiling, leadership has indicated it has no appetite for brinkmanship \u2014 particularly as Republicans head into a midterm campaign for control of Congress where they feel they have an upper hand, given the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act and President Obama\u2019s low approval ratings. And the White House has made clear that it has no intention of giving Republicans anything in exchange for increasing the limit.\u201cI think that we\u2019re still looking for the pieces to this puzzle,\u201d House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said at a news conference on Thursday. \u201cBut look, we do not want to default on our debt, and we\u2019re not going to default on our debt. We\u2019re in discussions with members about how we can move ahead.\u201dBut there is always a risk, remote as it may be, that something could go wrong. The Obama administration has warned that Congress has less time for its deliberations \u2014 even if they are less heated \u2014 in the latest merry-go-round.In the past, the Treasury has managed to keep paying the bills for months after hitting the debt ceiling, using \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to move cash from pocket to pocket. But it is currently sending out billions of dollars of tax refunds, warning that Congress probably has only until the end of the month to act.\u201cThe bottom line is: Time is short,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, speaking in Washington this week. \u201cCongress needs to act to extend the borrowing authority for our nation, and it needs to act now.\u201dAt the moment, a showdown over the debt ceiling seems to be the furthest thing from investors\u2019 minds. Instead, Wall Street is focused on signs of trouble emanating from emerging-market countries like Turkey, Argentina and South Africa and worries over whether growth in both China and the United States is about to falter.\u201cThe broader markets couldn\u2019t care less,\u201d said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, the head of global fixed-income strategy for Barclays Capital.In part, Mr. Rajadhyaksha said, that is because Wall Street has become better at reading the signals coming from Washington after repeated standoffs that were ultimately resolved without a catastrophe. Three years ago, \u201cnobody knew what the exchange stabilization fund was,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody knew what the G-fund was,\u201d he said, referring to accounts that the Treasury tweaks to free up money after it hits the debt ceiling.\u201cMarkets understand this process considerably better,\u201d he said, \u201cand because of what they\u2019ve learned the past few times, they\u2019re very sanguine at the moment.\u201dBut even with markets calm, uncertainty stemming from policy impasses in Washington remains a threat \u2014 not just because of the unknown consequences of default for the value of Treasury securities. Around the world, the perception of Treasury debt as being absolutely safe has shifted, said Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute and a former central banker at the Bank of England. Managers of sovereign-wealth funds in countries like Norway and Singapore are rethinking their exposure to the dollar, he said.\u201cThe dumb money says, \u2018Every time I reacted to a debt deliberation in the United States, I overreacted and lost money,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cBut the smart money knows the market has been changed by this uncertainty.\u201dIn the last few weeks, Republican leaders have trotted out various ideas in hopes of coming up with a plan that would win at least 218 Republican votes in the House, enough to pass a measure without Democratic support. These have included tying the debt ceiling to approval of the Keystone pipeline or to a repeal of a provision in the Affordable Care Act that shelters insurers from higher-than-anticipated claims. But none of those has succeeded.\u201cYou know, Mother Teresa is a saint now, but if Congress wanted to make her a saint, and attach that to the debt ceiling, we probably couldn\u2019t get 218 votes for it,\u201d Mr. Boehner said Thursday.A Republican leadership aide said that Mr. Boehner was trying to develop a proposal that would also bring in some Democratic votes. That might include reversing an unpopular cut to military pensions or tweaking Medicare payments to doctors.Publicly, Democrats are insisting on a \u201cclean\u201d debt ceiling bill, saying they won\u2019t bow to blackmail by Republicans.\u201cThey are just throwing ideas against the wall to see what sticks, and creating more uncertainty,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the Democratic chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s time for House Republicans to find their way out of this mess the same way they always do: by agreeing to raise the debt ceiling without any strings attached.\u201dWhatever the outcome, serious damage has already been done to America\u2019s status in the global economy. \u201cThe United States has benefited for decades by standing out for the quality of its governance,\u201d Mr. Posen said. \u201cWe\u2019re not Italy. We\u2019re not Greece. Now, we\u2019re just willfully closing that gap.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s Aid in 2008 Crisis Stretched Worldwide", "Date": "2014-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Tuesday morning, Sept. 16, 2008, was perhaps the darkest time for the United States economy in modern memory \u2014 even if nobody knew it quite yet. It was barely 24 hours removed from the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, and a few hours before the government would rescue the insurer American International Group.Events had been set in motion that would drive the unemployment rate to double digits and cause half a decade of economic misery.But before they would confront any of that, the men and women of the Federal Reserve received an urgent briefing on Norway.\u201cI have just sketchy details based on a phone call,\u201d Mr. Dudley said. \u201cBut my understanding is that this morning Norway put in place a facility by which they are going to offer their banks dollars, up to $5 billion,\u201d adding that \u201cthe fact that Norway is doing this suggests that the situation has broadened quite a bit further.\u201dIn conversations with counterparts at the European Central Bank, Mr. Dudley said, he learned that there was \u201cquite a bit of interest\u201d in \u201can open facility where European banks could come and get dollars.\u201dWhile reporters and lawmakers focused on the bailouts of American financial institutions, the Fed was quietly pumping hundreds of billions of dollars to nations stretching from Switzerland to South Korea to bolster global banks when dollars were in short supply. European banks were particularly heavy beneficiaries.At their peak in December 2008, these \u201cliquidity swap lines\u201d totaled $580 billion. The money was extended to 14 central banks from Sweden to South Korea to Singapore, which, in turn, lent it to private banks. The bailout of A.I.G., which attracted bigger headlines and louder public fulmination, was a comparatively paltry $85 billion.\u201cThe crisis was global,\u201d said Francesco Papadia, who helped engineer the program as markets chief at the European Central Bank and is now an affiliate fellow at Bruegel, the Belgian research organization, \u201cand the central banks had to get global to answer the crisis.\u201dThe root of the problem was this: Global banks did lots of business in dollars \u2014 buying up United States mortgage-backed securities, financing international trade between companies operating around the world, and more. But at that moment in 2008, private lending markets were essentially shut down. Banks did not trust one another enough to lend freely the way they might in normal times. Everybody was hoarding dollars at once.On Feb. 22, the Federal Reserve released the transcripts of the 2008 meetings of its Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy. The transcripts provide a detailed account of some of the Fed\u2019s key decisions during that crisis year.In the United States, the Fed, the one entity in the world that can create dollars out of thin air, addressed the dollar shortage with the time-honored practice of serving as the \u201clender of last resort,\u201d making emergency loans to banks and other financial institutions, as central banks have done for hundreds of years.But the Fed was in no position legally to extend the same courtesy to international banks. (Their United States affiliates were a different matter \u2014 during this period the American arms of European banks took billions in emergency loans.)So the Fed and its international counterparts turned to a tool that had been used only on a much smaller scale, including during the disruptions after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The idea is simple: The Fed sends dollars to, say, the European Central Bank, in exchange for a comparable value of euros, plus interest. The bank then lends those dollars to European banks against collateral. At a fixed date, the transactions are reversed; the Fed gets its dollars back and the European Central Bank gets its euros back.Ultimately, the Federal Reserve and American taxpayers profited from the arrangement. No one had ever imagined such transactions could be used on such a huge scale. \u201cIf I had said to the F.O.M.C. in 1998 that 10 years later you\u2019ll have $600 billion in credit outstanding to foreign central banks, they would have said, \u2018You\u2019re nuts,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Edwin M. Truman, a former head of the Fed\u2019s international division, referring to the policy committee, the Federal Open Market Committee. Mr. Truman is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The program started with the central banks of major industrialized nations, including the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Swiss National Bank. But that fall, the Fed began undertaking arrangements with emerging nations\u2019 central banks. \u201cAnother way to think about this is that the privilege of being the reserve currency of the world comes with some burdens,\u201d Mr. Geithner said during the meeting, on Oct. 28 and 29. \u201cNot that we have an obligation in this sense, but we have an interest in helping these guys mitigate the problems they face in dealing with currency mismatches in their financial systems.\u201dThat said, Fed officials, then and now, framed the program as intended to help the United States economy. After all, international banks were supporting lending in the United States by buying securities backed by Americans\u2019 home mortgages, credit cards and other debts. If the dollar crisis continued, there could be even more of a fire sale of those securities, driving up interest rates in the United States and making credit even harder to obtain.\u201cTo the rest of the world, I don\u2019t think these transcripts are going to be very reassuring,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a Cornell economist and author of \u201cThe Dollar Trap,\u201d a book that examines the currency swaps. \u201cWhat they show is that the U.S. policy makers are very narrowly focused on U.S. interests, and their actions are not so much determined by any moral obligation to save the world economy, but rather a clear self-interest in preserving U.S. economic interests.\u201dThe Fed rejected some nations that wanted dollar swaps but, in the Fed leaders\u2019 judgment, were not important enough to American economic interests to warrant participation. The transcripts redact the names of those countries, but diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks indicate they included Indonesia, Turkey and the Dominican Republic.The Fed was approached by other countries, Nathan Sheets, the leader of the Fed\u2019s international finance division, said at the October 2008 meeting. \u201cBut we have not encouraged that,\u201d Ben S. Bernanke, then the Fed chairman, chimed in.\u201cWe have done everything we possibly can do discourage it,\u201d Mr. Sheets added. \u201cWe\u2019re not advertising.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hard and Soft Power Both Frustrated in Ukraine", "Date": "2014-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropeBRUSSELS \u2014 There\u2019s nothing like an old-fashioned expletive to add spice to a trans-Atlantic difference of opinion.But when Victoria Nuland, the American assistant secretary of state, was caught using an expletive on an unsecure telephone line to disparage European Union policy on Ukraine, it highlighted the fact that neither Washington nor Brussels had much of a strategy for handling the crisis in the former Soviet republic.Since the Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych, ceded to Russian pressure and pulled out of a major trade pact with the European Union in November, a move that sparked mass protests, the United States and Europe have struggled to gain any influence over events in the country.Ms. Nuland\u2019s remark in late January, which was leaked onto the Internet, was apparently directed at the Union\u2019s reluctance to impose targeted financial and travel sanctions on Mr. Yanukovych and his aides in response to their crackdown on pro-Europe demonstrations.In another part of the conversation with the United States ambassador to Ukraine, she discussed which opposition leaders Washington wanted to join or remain on the sidelines of a proposed transitional government.Her tone recalled the 2003 book \u201cOf Paradise and Power,\u201d written by Ms. Nuland\u2019s husband, the historian Robert Kagan, who upset many in Brussels by asserting that \u201cAmericans are from Mars, Europeans are from Venus.\u201d In other words: Americans are tough, Europeans are wimps. Americans take responsibility for international security, spend their hard-earned dollars on defense, and recognize the threats to freedom and stability in the world. Europeans are politically na\u00efve, unwilling to risk their own blood and treasure, and happy to free ride on American military protection.Proclaimed in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States by Al Qaeda and published in the year that President George W. Bush invaded Iraq, Mr. Kagan\u2019s words echoed the thinking of that time.Things look different a decade later. The United States has been humbled by military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq that turned sour after achieving the initial objective of ousting hostile rulers.Europe\u2019s preference for diplomacy, nation-building and the \u201csoft power\u201d of economic engagement no longer looks quite so illusory, though it has not necessarily proved more effective.In the Ukrainian case, Washington and Brussels may differ on tactics but they share common objectives, American and European officials say, and neither is considering the use of force.Both believe that Ukrainians should be free to choose closer economic integration with Europe and that Russia should not be allowed to thwart that aim with threats and sanctions.Both are prepared to contribute to an aid package if Kiev meets conditions set by the International Monetary Fund, which Mr. Yanukovych has refused to accept.Neither is willing to outbid the $15 billion offered by the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, in grants, loans and cheap gas to Ukraine. The United States and Europe have their own financial constraints. In addition, both consider Ukraine to be riddled with corruption and fear financial aid would end up in the wrong pockets.For Mr. Putin, keeping Ukraine in Russia\u2019s economic and political orbit is a way of salvaging the power of the former Soviet Union.Europe and the United States see Mr. Yanukovych as part of the problem rather than the solution, though Europe is less inclined to regard him as a pawn of Moscow. European officials harbor some hope that Mr. Yanukovych may be willing to preside over an orderly transition that involves constitutional reform and a fair election if he and his entourage are promised legal immunity and protection.Diplomats say the United States is seeking to isolate Mr. Yanukovych in the belief that he can be forced from power by the protest movement \u2014 although that is not its official position.But both parties may be deluded. Some European officials and experts in the private sector say that Mr. Yanukovych, at Mr. Putin\u2019s bidding, may just be waiting until the end of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, on Feb. 23 to unleash the security forces and drive the protesters out of the country\u2019s squares.The only question in some minds is whether Mr. Putin, having worked hard to burnish Moscow\u2019s image with the Games, is ready to sacrifice it before Russia hosts a summit meeting of the Group of 8 leading economies in June.Opposition groups have mobilized across Ukraine, including in Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s home base in the country\u2019s east, so any attempt to crush the movement could lead to serious bloodshed.Meanwhile Moscow is pressing Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to join its exclusive Eurasian Union trade bloc, which Europe and China warn would be incompatible with global trade rules. Neither country seems eager to do so.Some European aides fret privately about a more radical outcome in which Russia annexes Crimea, the Black Sea region in Ukraine that is home to a Russian naval base at Sebastopol. There are also fears of Russia partitioning the eastern part of Ukraine, where Russian is the primary language.\u201cWould the Americans intervene if that were to happen? Of course they would not,\u201d a senior European Union official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Displaying resentment at Ms. Nuland\u2019s attitude, the official noted that the Ukrainian protesters were carrying European Union flags and not American ones.Some European officials are also concerned that sanctions against Mr. Yanukovych would drive the Ukranian leader firmly into the arms of Mr. Putin.Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society European Policy Institute, which supports political organizations in Ukraine, said the trans-Atlantic differences were more about timing.\u201cThe United States was looking for a quick political fix,\u201d she said. \u201cThe E.U. is thinking longer-term about what a sustainable future for Ukraine might be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The kind of 21st-century technology that is needed is available in too few schools, he said.Technology companies like Verizon and Microsoft have committed to increasing access to high-speed Internet in the classroom, as well as at home; providing software and devices like tablets and laptops; and training teachers to use the new technology.Several other companies have agreed to join the president\u2019s initiative over the next few years, including Sprint, which has pledged to provide Internet access to 50,000 underprivileged students, and Apple, which has promised to give iPads, MacBooks and other devices worth a total of $100 million to disadvantaged schools.AT&T will offer more than $100 million to give middle school students free Internet access on their educational devices. Microsoft, among its other commitments, pledged to give 12 million copies of its Office software to schools. Verizon will invest up to $100 million, and Autodesk and O\u2019Reilly Media pledged to make their software available at no cost.Fewer than 30 percent of schools are equipped with the broadband connectivity needed to stream video and use other educational tools available on the Internet, Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, the director of the White House\u2019s Domestic Policy Council, told reporters in a conference call on Monday.Daniel R. Hesse, Sprint\u2019s chief executive, and Judson Althoff, Microsoft\u2019s president of North American sales and marketing, were among the business leaders who joined the president at a Maryland middle school, one of four in Prince George\u2019s County that use iPads in the classroom.\u201cI\u2019m only standing here today because my education gave me a chance,\u201d Mr. Obama told students in a packed gymnasium. \u201cI\u2019m not so different than a lot of these young people.\u201dFollowing up on his State of the Union address last week, Mr. Obama emphasized that this would be a \u201cyear of action\u201d with or without Congress, reiterating his promise to use his executive authority and relationships with business leaders to achieve his goals.\u201cThis is something we can do without waiting for Congress,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Does his compensation strike you as a great injustice? Does it make you want to take to the streets in protest? These questions go to the heart of the debate over economic inequality, to which President Obama has recently been drawing attention.Certainly, $50 million is a lot of money. The typical American would have to work for about 1,000 years in order to earn that much. That sum puts Mr. Downey in the top ranks of American earners. Anything more than about $400,000 a year puts you in the much-talked-about 1 percent. If you earn more than about $10 million, you are in the top 1 percent of the top 1 percent. Mr. Downey makes it easily.Yet, somehow, when I talk to people about it, most are not appalled by his income. Why?Of that amount, only about 3 percent went to pay Mr. Downey. In other words, if you bought a matinee movie ticket for, say, $8, about 25 cents went to pay for Mr. Downey\u2019s acting. If you have seen the movie, you might be tempted to say: \u201cHe gave a great performance. I\u2019m happy to pay him a quarter for it.\u201dBut actors, authors, and athletes do not make up the entire ranks of the rich. Most top earners make their fortunes in ways that are less transparent to the public.Critics sometimes suggest that this high pay reflects the failure of corporate boards to do their job. Rather than representing shareholders, this argument goes, those boards are too cozy with the chief executives and pay them more than they are really worth. That is hardly a surprise. A typical chief executive is overseeing billions of dollars of shareholder wealth as well as thousands of employees. The value of making the right decisions is tremendous. Just consider the role of Steve Jobs in the rise of Apple and its path-breaking products.A similar case is the finance industry, where many hefty compensation packages can be found. There is no doubt that this sector plays a crucial economic role. Those who work in banking, venture capital and other financial firms are in charge of allocating the economy\u2019s investment resources. They decide, in a decentralized and competitive way, which companies and industries will shrink and which will grow. It makes sense that a nation would allocate many of its most talented and thus highly compensated individuals to the task. To be sure, some people find ways to get rich at others\u2019 expense. Bernard Madoff most famously comes to mind. The solution here, however, is not to focus on the income distribution but to devise better regulation and oversight.A reliable tax system is also important to ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share to support the public weal. That is generally the case. Our tax system is far from perfect and is arguably in dire need of reform, but examples of the tax-dodging wealthy are not at all the norm.So, by delivering extraordinary performances in hit films, top stars may do more than entertain millions of moviegoers and make themselves rich in the process. They may also contribute many millions in federal taxes, and other millions in state taxes. And those millions help fund schools, police departments and national defense for the rest of us.Unlike the superheroes of \u201cThe Avengers,\u201d the richest 1 percent aren\u2019t motivated by an altruistic desire to advance the public good. But, in most cases, that is precisely their effect.N. GREGORY MANKIW is a professor of economics at Harvard. Advertisement"}

With social trends pushing partners apart, why shouldn\u2019t the government push them together \u2014 and help end poverty and improve the lot of children while we\u2019re at it? It\u2019s a rare policy solution that data-crunching geeks and Bible-thumping crusaders can agree on \u2014 albeit for very different reasons. Unfortunately, there might not be much that Washington can actually do about it.Giving all this evidence some urgency is the fact that so many children are born out of wedlock today, and so many couples decide to divorce or not to marry at all. As Rubio pointed out, by now, about four in 10 children are born to an unmarried mother. For poor children, that proportion is higher.While culture warriors might focus too na\u00efvely on matters of the heart, wonks have their own strategies for promoting marriage, and they\u2019re all left-brain. For example, some low-income married women who go back to work after having children face steep, steep tax rates. Imagine a working husband making $25,000 a year whose wife decides to take a job for $25,000 a year. Melissa S. Kearney, the director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution, and a co-author have estimated that the couple would keep only about 30 percent of the wife\u2019s earnings, after you factor in the loss of breaks like the earned-income tax credit. Statistics like that, along with the sky-high cost of child care, help explain why so many women choose not to work \u2014 or not to marry. By removing these disincentives, the rather dispassionate logic goes, more Americans would take the plunge.To understand why, it is worth looking at the economic fortunes of the poor in isolation \u2014 marriage rates and childbearing out of wedlock aside. Globalization, the decline of labor unions, technological change and other tidal economic forces have battered the poor, with years of economic growth failing to lift their prospects. These forces have inevitably affected young people\u2019s choices, researchers think.In an economy that offers so little promise to those at the bottom, family planning in the name of upward mobility doesn\u2019t make much sense. \u201cEngaging in family formation by accident rather than by design, you get a story of low-opportunity costs,\u201d says Kathryn Edin, the poverty researcher at Johns Hopkins. \u201cWe\u2019ve created the situation where pregnancy is not the worst thing that can happen to you. It can be seen as a path to redemption in an otherwise violent, unpredictable, hopeless world.\u201dSimilar forces might also spur some young couples not to get married, even if they want to. Many poor women opt not to marry the poor men in their lives, for instance, to avoid bringing more economic chaos into their homes. And the poor women who do marry tend to have unstable marriages \u2014 often to ill effect. One study, for instance, found that single mothers who married and later divorced were worse off economically than those who did not marry at all. \u201cThese women revere marriage, they want to get married,\u201d Williams says. \u201cThey aren\u2019t making an irrational choice not to marry.\u201dThe success or failure of any given marriage depends on so many minute, hardly tangible factors. But from an economist\u2019s perspective, our collective allergy to matrimony might be a macroeconomic issue: In order to save marriage, we\u2019d have to end poverty. Creating good jobs with growing wages at the bottom of the income scale might be the best, if hardest, way to encourage young couples to wed. \u201cMarriage is an emotional institution, a child-rearing institution and an economic institution,\u201d says W. Bradford Wilcox, the director of the National Marriage Project. \u201cUnless we improve the fortunes of poor working people, particularly poor working men, we aren\u2019t going to see marriage coming back.\u201d And then we wouldn\u2019t need policy wonks and politicians peddling marriage as a salve for poverty.

{"Headline": "Caribbean Islands Agree to Swap Diesel Power for Renewable Sources", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeveral Caribbean nations committed on Thursday to start replacing diesel generators, the most common means of producing electricity on islands, with renewable sources like wind, solar or the earth\u2019s heat.The countries, which have already taken steps toward developing the new energy projects and include St. Lucia, Turks and Caicos and the British Virgin Islands, signed the pact at a multiday meeting organized by the Carbon War Room, a nonprofit organization that Richard Branson, the billionaire founder of the Virgin Group, established to fight climate change.As part of the effort, Mr. Branson announced on Tuesday a deal with the independent power producer NRG Energy to install solar and wind power on Necker Island, a private enclave he owns, to cover about 80 percent of the power needs. Islands throughout the Caribbean have extremely high electricity costs, and the new renewable projects can help reduce them sharply, he said.\u201cWhat we hope to do is use Necker as a test island to show how it can be done,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe only way we\u2019re going to win this war is by creative entrepreneurship,\u201d to make the price of clean energy cheaper than that of energy from fossil fuels.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned in the renewable world is everyone wants to save the world,\u201d said David W. Crane, NRG\u2019s chief executive, \u201cbut very few people want to pay more for energy.\u201dThe cluster of nations, like islands elsewhere, have lacked access to low-cost power because of the small size of the market \u2014 the British Virgin Islands\u2019 population, for example, is around 31,000 \u2014 and a dearth of up-to-date infrastructure and equipment, said Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres, a former president of Costa Rica who is now president of the Carbon War Room. On many islands, he said, a longstanding supplier has a virtual monopoly over the system. Lynn Tabernacki, managing director of renewable and clean energy programs at the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, said that persuading banks to lend money for energy projects had been a challenge because the projects were often too small or they lacked standardized contracts and regulations. She has been advising developers and government officials to help clear those hurdles. The effort at the Carbon War Room \u2014 which aims to sign up 10 islands looking to move away from diesel without turning to natural gas \u2014 started with Aruba.There, a wind farm is up and running, and more are on the way. There are also plans for solar arrays and experimental storage systems involving underwater compressed air and flywheels, said Peter Lilienthal, chief executive of Homer Energy, a technical adviser to the Caribbean program.The British Virgin Islands is looking into using waste-to-energy plants and has already started changing streetlights to more efficient LEDs. It has also created a climate change policy and is establishing an environmental trust fund that would be financed by fees or taxes collected from residents and visitors, said Kedrick D. Pickering, deputy premier. St. Lucia has been testing the use of solar on various buildings, but it also plans to explore wind and geothermal development, said James Fletcher, minister for sustainable development and energy. \u201cWith our economy, with the level of unemployment that we have, if you can create some more green jobs, if you can reduce some of the expenditures that we\u2019re seeing right now, particularly on oil, it would increase the island\u2019s economic competitiveness,\u201d he said, The Necker Island project still needs the approval of regulators in the British Virgin Islands, but it seeks to establish a microgrid made up of solar, wind and battery technologies. It is also to include energy-efficiency and control software to help reduce overall energy use and balance supply and demand on the grid.Mr. Crane said NRG would pursue similar projects throughout the Caribbean and, eventually, in the United States once the costs came down.Mr. Lilienthal said that creating microgrids fueled by renewable energy is still too expensive for most of the United States, but that it made sense for the Caribbean and remote places like Alaska. \u201cThere\u2019s tens of thousands of islands burning diesel fuel that\u2019s really destroying their economies because it\u2019s so expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just the beginning.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018A Guest of My Time\u2019", "Date": "2014-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cAll conservatism begins with loss,\u201d Andrew Sullivan writes. \u201cIf we never knew loss, we would never feel the need to conserve.\u201d That\u2019s why the first and still canonical conservative text is Edmund Burke\u2019s \u201cReflections on the Revolution in France,\u201d a lamentation on the uprooting of that country\u2019s monarchical order. And that\u2019s why America, as an experiment in modernity, hasn\u2019t had many genuine conservatives in its history. The so-called conservative founding fathers, John Adams and Alexander Hamilton, were in fact creators of a new and radical system of government. The 19th-century Whigs \u2014 Webster, Clay and Calhoun \u2014 sometimes seen as conservatives, were aggressive proponents of capitalist development. Even many Southerners who argued for slavery were advocating an economic system that kept them rich, enthusiastically embracing the trade and modern technology that made slavery so profitable. And contemporary conservatism \u2014 which began as a reaction to the progressive era and the New Deal \u2014 has always mixed dynamic capitalism with moralism. Given this background, \u201cThe Kennan Diaries\u201d is an illuminating, fascinating and sometimes disturbing book. George F. Kennan was the most celebrated \u00addiplomat-intellectual of the 20th century, the brilliant author of the strategy of containment that the United States adopted and that won the Cold War. For most of his life he was seen as a strategist and \u2014 because he was dovish on most foreign policy issues \u2014 a liberal. As these diaries make clear, he spent much of his life thinking about political philosophy. And his instincts and insights were deeply conservative, but in a way that doesn\u2019t really fit into today\u2019s left-right categories. \u201cI cannot help but regret that I did not live 50 or 100 years sooner,\u201d he wrote in one of his entries. \u201cLife is too full in these times to be comprehensible. We know too many cities to be able to grow into any of them, . . . too many friends to have any real friendships, too many books to know any of them well, and the quality of our impressions gives way to the quantity, so that life begins to seem like a movie, with hundreds of kaleidoscopic scenes flashing on and off our field of perception, gone before we have time to consider them.\u201d It\u2019s a vivid expression of a deep, instinctual conservatism, especially when you consider that it was written in December 1927.In keeping with a long tradition of conservatism, Kennan mourned the loss of small communities with their sense of common purpose. In 1938, while working at the State Department, he took a brief leave and bicycled through rural Wisconsin, the state he grew up in, and recalled how the small villages he moved through had often rallied together, in the wake of floods, hurricanes and war, and how modern life, with its emphasis on individualism, was eroding that sense of solidarity. Seventeen years later, he surveyed his country \u2014 the booming, urbanizing America of the 1950s \u2014 with disgust: \u201cI could leave it without a pang: the endless streams of cars, the bored, set faces behind the windshield, the chrome, the asphalt, the advertising, the television sets, the filling stations, the hot-dog stands, the barren business centers, the suburban brick boxes, the country clubs, the bars and grills, the empty activity.\u201dHe saw a dark side in almost all the advances of modern life, especially cars and airplanes. On the former: \u201cThe best thing is travel by turnpike \u2014 at night, a wholly useless exercise, to be sure \u2014 hours of death subtracted from the hours of life, but better than seeing anything.\u201d \u201cFlying (but particularly the airports) puts me into the nearest thing to a wholly psychotic depression,\u201d he explained. His reaction to the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986 was to note that he would gladly trade \u201cthe entire American space program, in all its forms military and civilian, for a good national telegraph system and railway transportation network such as we used to have.\u201dHis views were rooted in history, philosophy and \u2014 somewhat surprisingly to me \u2014 faith. Writing on Good Friday, 1980, he composed a beautiful paean to the life and legacy of Jesus Christ: \u201cMost human events yield to the erosion of time. . . . The greatest, most amazing, exception to this generalization . . . occurred . . . on the hill of Golgotha. . . . A man, a Jew, some sort of dissident religious prophet, was crucified in company with two common thieves . . . . In the teachings of this man were two things: first the principle of charity of love . . . but secondly, the possibility of redemption in the face of self-knowledge and penitence. . . . The combination of these two things: charity and redemption . . . inspired an entire vast civilization, created a great art, erected a hundred thousand magnificent churches, . . . shaped and disciplined the minds and the values of many generations \u2014 placed, in short, its creative stamp on one of the greatest of all flowerings of the human spirit.\u201dKennan\u2019s conservatism was poetic, comprehensive and utterly impractical. In 1979, he outlined the kind of politics he would favor. \u201cIn addition to being a political isolationist, I am a believer in autarky. Not only do I believe that the healthy national society would rigidly eschew the importation of foreign labor . . . but I consider that it should restrict to a minimum its economic and financial involvements with other peoples.\u201d To some readers, this may sound like North Korea, but Kennan\u2019s celebration of the character, coherence and moral superiority of small communities has a rich pedigree in European thought. It also informs what can only be described as Kennan\u2019s racism. Writing on a flight to Los Angeles in 1978, Kennan thinks about how few white faces he will see when he lands and laments the decline of people \u201cof British origin, from whose forefathers the constitutional structure and political ideals of the early America once emerged.\u201d Instead, he predicts, Americans are destined to \u201cmelt into a vast polyglot mass, . . . one huge pool of indistinguishable mediocrity and drabness.\u201d Kennan at times displayed conventional racism. His views on South Africa were strongly shaped by his feeling that blacks were simply not capable of handling liberty and democracy. \u201cI would expect to see within five or 10 years\u2019 time,\u201d he wrote in 1990, \u201conly desperate attempts at emigration on the parts of whites, and strident appeals for American help from an African regime unable to feed its own people from the resources of a ruined economy.\u201d But for the most part, Kennan\u2019s racism was a product of his conservatism, which is to say that he was profoundly mistrustful of the modern multiethnic \u00adnation-state with its \u201cmingling of the \u00adraces.\u201d He did not look down on the Chinese, Indians, Russians or Jews, believing that they would succeed better in their own coherent communities than in a mixed-up melting pot. The tone of his comments about nonwhites, however, always has a sharp and derisory edge.With time, Kennan\u2019s lamentations grew in scope, encompassing the environment, overpopulation and the rape of the earth\u2019s limited natural resources. \u201cThe danger of collective catastrophe . . . is so great as to be in part a certainty,\u201d he wrote in 1968. He worried about nuclear weapons for much of the 1970s and 1980s, believing firmly that they would lead to war and therefore a global cataclysm of unimaginable proportions. As late as 1988, as Mikhail Gorbachev was bringing the Cold War to a close, he wrote, \u201cI have no hope that a nuclear disaster can be avoided.\u201d For years, Kennan had been deeply critical of American foreign policy for its militarization, imperial reach, arrogance and aggression. The end of the Cold War, in a manner he had largely predicted in 1946 and 1947, brought him no joy or sense of vindication. He worried about the dynamic and disruptive changes taking place across Europe and hence was skeptical about the reunification of Germany.I realize that at this point Kennan sounds like a cranky old man, trapped in nostalgia and ideology. How, then, to explain the extraordinary brilliance of Kennan the strategist? From his earliest days as a diplomat, he was an acute observer of the world \u2014 and we see this in the diaries. He arrived in Russia in December 1933, with the first American ambassador to the Soviet Union, and quickly grasped the cruel realities of the Soviet system, while many Westerners were still in awe of it. Describing a tea at the American Embassy in Moscow in September 1934, with British liberals, including a founder of Fabian socialism, Sidney Webb, he noted that British liberals \u201cthink very abstractly and find it easy to be enthusiastic about Communism because their attitude is a complete pose. In their hearts, they never dream of being Bolshevistic or anything else except plain British.\u201dThis acute sense of realism pervades all of Kennan\u2019s diplomatic observations. In 1944, having dinner with the Polish prime minister, who had received encouraging words of support from the Russians for the country\u2019s independence, Kennan was sure that no matter what anyone said, the Poles would end up badly. \u201cThe jealous and intolerant eye of the Kremlin can distinguish, in the end, only vassals and enemies, and the neighbors of Russia, if they do not wish to be one, must reconcile themselves to being the other.\u201d Similarly, Kennan\u2019s critique of American plans for a postwar peace upheld by international organizations was shaped by his historical perspective. \u201cThese structures have always served the purpose for which they were designed just as long as the interests of the Great Powers gave substance and reality to their existence,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe moment it became in the interests of one or the other of the Great Powers to alter the status quo, none of these treaty structures ever stood in the way of such alteration.\u201d Few were as prescient about the United Nations in 1944. In 1945, he was almost alone in predicting that Russia would take control of Eastern Europe and that Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s faith in Stalin was misguided and na\u00efve. He was also, along with some others, farsighted in predicting in the late 1940s that China and the Soviet Union, though tight Communist allies, would split apart.What then explains Kennan\u2019s strange mixture of prescience abroad and obtuseness at home? I think it lies in his own admission that he felt like a stranger in his own country, \u201ca guest of my time and not a member of its household.\u201d Kennan\u2019s genius was to perceive accurately the essence of other countries, often far more traditional than America \u2014 and to connect them to their past. For example, in his famous 5,500-word \u201cLong Telegram,\u201d which argued for containment of the Soviet Union instead of military confrontation, his seminal contributions were to show how Stalin\u2019s policies were largely a continuation of an older Russian strategy \u2014 and why the modern, imposed Soviet system would eventually wither. His analysis of Poland, the United Nations, China, all drew on a similar understanding of history, continuity and culture.What Kennan could not really comprehend was modernity. Technology, capitalism, trade, immigration, all created so much change that Kennan could not see in them anything but danger and disaster. America, the center of these forces of dynamism, became the locus of his worst fears. In 1994 (at the age of 90) Kennan wrote an entry in which he tried to put Russia\u2019s foreign policy into context, pointing out that seven decades of Communism had distorted a great civilization and that one must have sympathy for this \u201ctragically injured and spiritually diminished country\u201d to understand its fitful moves on the international stage. He then went on to reflect on America, for which he could muster no empathy at all. He saw in it a land consumed by \u201cunrestrained decadence,\u201d a \u201cpathological preoccupation with sex and violence, the weird efforts to claim for homosexuality the status of a proud, noble and promising way of life\u201d and, finally, perhaps most menacing for him, the curse of political correctness, which meant \u201cthe total loss of a sense of humor.\u201d That was his reaction to the booming 1990s.George Kennan shined a powerful light on the world beyond. But in his own land, from the beginning to his last days, he remained a bewildered guest. THE KENNAN DIARIESBy George F. KennanEdited by Frank CostigliolaIllustrated. 712 pp. W. W.

{"Headline": "Tax Overhaul Plan Faces Key Hurdles", "Date": "2014-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The proposal by the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee to overhaul and simplify the nation\u2019s tax code is already coming under scrutiny from fellow Republicans, with at least one party leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, saying the plan has no chance.Mr. McConnell, the Senate minority leader, said efforts to pass the proposal \u2014 which is expected to call for a cut in the top corporate income rate to 25 percent from 35 percent, and a reduction of the seven individual tax brackets to two \u2014 would prove insurmountable against Democratic demands that any tax overhaul include $1 trillion in new revenue. \u201cThe majority leader and the president have said they want $1 trillion in new revenue for the federal government as a condition for doing comprehensive tax reform, which we know we ought to do,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Tuesday. \u201cSo I have no hope for that happening this year.\u201dThe proposal, which is to be released Wednesday after nearly three years of behind-the-scenes efforts, is the work of Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and reflects goals long held by Republicans.Under the plan, the tax rate for about 99 percent of Americans would be, at most, 25 percent, but the remaining 1 percent, whose income is above $450,000 or so, would also be subject to a 10 percent tax surcharge on certain types of income, according to congressional aides. The surcharge would affect salaried professionals, like lawyers and accountants, while excluding those whose income comes from industries that produce goods, like manufacturing and farming.The current top tax rate for individuals is 39.6 percent. Under the new plan, the seven existing tax brackets would be collapsed into just two \u2014 at 10 percent and 25 percent, according to congressional aidesSenator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, agreed with Mr. McConnell\u2019s assessment that a tax overhaul will be difficult to push through Congress this year, but he blamed Republicans for the impasse. \u201cThe truth is, we should have tackled tax reform years ago,\u201d Mr. Reid said Tuesday. \u201cIt will be extremely difficult \u2014 with the obstruction that we get here from the Republicans on virtually everything \u2014 to do something that should have been done years ago.\u201dBut he praised Mr. Camp for \u201ccoming forward with a piece of legislation.\u201dHe went on to predict that families at the median income level \u2014 $51,000 for a family of four \u2014 would \u201chave on average an extra $1,300 in their pocket at the end of the year.\u201dMr. Camp is also set on Wednesday to shepherd a bill through the House that would stop new Internal Revenue Service regulations of political \u201csocial welfare\u201d groups. That underscores a quandary facing House Republican leaders as they head into the midterm elections: Should they limit their agenda to political bills tailored to aid Republican campaigns like the I.R.S. bill, or should they take big risks on ambitious policy proposals, like simplifying the tax code?Intraparty controversies were precisely what Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio had hoped to avoid this year when he shelved a broad immigration push, then whisked through an increase in the debt ceiling, relying almost entirely on Democratic votes.Even those who believe that Mr. Camp\u2019s proposal has little chance this year say that his so-called discussion draft will serve as a test of support among fellow Republicans who favor tax changes in theory but often balk at the trade-offs required. Those Republicans are especially hesitant to act on a bill that is unlikely to make it through the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats. If Mr. Camp\u2019s plan fails to attract a Republican majority, it is coming early enough in the year that it is unlikely to have lasting ramifications in the midterm elections.House leadership aides told Mr. Camp in November that he needed to find a Democratic partner other than Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee at the time, who had been working with Mr. Camp on a tax code overhaul. But Mr. Camp failed to do so \u2014 and now Mr. Baucus is ambassador to China. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, now leads the Finance Committee.Democrats are expressing their frustration with how the tax plan is being rolled out. Democratic aides say that unlike their Republican colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee, Democrats have not been briefed on any of the plan\u2019s details, and they did not receive a letter that went out to all the Republican members last week alerting them of the draft legislation to be released on Wednesday.In addition to the I.R.S. legislation \u2014 part of the House Republicans\u2019 \u201cStop Government Abuse\u201d push this week \u2014 Democrats pointed to the Ways and Means Committee\u2019s focus in recent months on the Affordable Care Act as a sign of the panel\u2019s partisan approach. The last full committee hearing on any topic other than the health care law, they added, was in July.\u201cThere\u2019s a real contrast here,\u201d said Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. \u201cOn the one hand, Dave\u2019s acting as chairman of Ways and Means, putting out a tax reform bill. On the other hand, he acts like chairman of the Republican campaign effort.\u201dMr. Camp has been working to shore up support with business groups like the Alliance for Competitive Taxation.\u201cWe think Chairman Camp\u2019s discussion draft will provide a real boost to the tax reform discussions,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and an economic adviser to the Alliance for Competitive Taxation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economy and Crime Spur New Puerto Rican Exodus", "Date": "2014-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 Alexis Sotomayor has many reasons to stay in Puerto Rico: his two children; his mother and their gossip sessions over plates of fried rice; and the balm of salt and sun that leavens his life on the island.But the artisanal soap business that Mr. Sotomayor built is barely hanging on amid rising costs and taxes, and sales that have sunk by 40 percent in five years. Crime is rampant; his girlfriend was nearly carjacked at gunpoint recently. So last month he boarded a flight to Orlando, Fla., to interview for a job at a rum distillery in the hope of joining the ever-growing Puerto Rican diaspora.\u201cI don\u2019t see it improving,\u201d said Mr. Sotomayor, a 47-year-old chemical engineer. \u201cI see it getting worse. It\u2019s the uncertainty. What am I going to do \u2014 wait until it gets worse?\u201dPuerto Rico\u2019s slow-motion economic crisis skidded to a new low last week when both Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s downgraded its debt to junk status, brushing aside a series of austerity measures taken by the new governor, including increasing taxes and rebalancing pensions. But that is only the latest in a sharp decline leading to widespread fears about Puerto Rico\u2019s future. In the past eight years, Puerto Rico\u2019s ticker tape of woes has stretched unabated: $70 billion in debt, a 15.4 percent unemployment rate, a soaring cost of living, pervasive crime, crumbling schools and a worrisome exodus of professionals and middle-class Puerto Ricans who have moved to places like Florida and Texas.The situation has grown so dire that this tropical island, known for its breathtaking beaches, salsero vibe and tax breaks, is now mentioned in the same breath as Detroit, with one significant difference. Puerto Rico, a United States territory of 3.6 million people that is treated in large part like a state, cannot declare bankruptcy.From bottom to top, Puerto Ricans are watching it unfold with a mixture of disbelief and stoicism.Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, who was elected Puerto Rico\u2019s governor by a sliver of a margin in 2012, said that after he began to wade deeply into the island\u2019s economic and social quagmire, his fight-or-flight instincts kicked into high gear.\u201cI thought about asking for a recount,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla, 42, said with a grin during a recent interview in La Fortaleza, the 500-year-old government residence, recalling, among other things, the $2.2 billion deficit. \u201cBut now it\u2019s too late.\u201dA sense of pessimism pervades on the island. Streets are lined with empty storefronts in San Juan and in smaller cities like Mayag\u00fcez; small businesses, hit hard by high electricity, water and tax bills and hurt by drops in sales, have closed and stayed closed.Schools sit shuttered either because of disrepair or because of a dwindling number of students. In this typically convivial capital, communities have erected gates and bars to help thwart carjackers and home invaders. Illegal drugs, including high-level narcotrafficking, are one of the few growth industries.Puerto Rico, about 1,000 miles from Miami, has long been poor. Its per capita income is around $15,200, half that of Mississippi, the poorest state. Thirty-seven percent of all households receive food stamps; in Mississippi, the total is 22 percent.But the extended recession has hit the middle-class hardest of all, economists said. Jobs are still scarce, pension benefits for some are shrinking and budgets continue to tighten. Even many people with paychecks have chosen simply to parlay their United States citizenship into a new life on the mainland.Puerto Rico\u2019s drop in population has far outpaced that of American states. In 2011 and 2012, the population fell by nearly 1 percent, according to census figures. From July 2012 to July 2013, it declined again by 1 percent, or about 36,000 people. That is more than seven times the drop in West Virginia, the state with the steepest population losses.A Lack of HopeCoupled with a falling birthrate, the decline is raising worries about how Puerto Rico will thrive with a rapidly aging population and such a large share of jobless residents. Of the island\u2019s 3.67 million people, only one million work in the formal economy. The island has one of the lowest labor participation rates in the world, with only 41.3 percent of working-age Puerto Ricans in jobs; one in four works for the government.\u201cToday, Puerto Ricans with jobs are moving to the U.S.,\u201d said Orlando Sotomayor, an economist at the University of Puerto Rico and the brother of Alexis. \u201cEven people in their 40s and 50s, college professors with complete job security, are doing so. Some are starting all over. The phenomenon is highly uncommon and underscores the lack of hope that the ship can or will be righted.\u201dThe current exodus rivals the one in the 1950s, when job shortages on the island forced farmers and rural residents to find factory work in cities like New York and Boston. Today, it is doctors, teachers, engineers, nurses, professors who are leaving Puerto Rico behind.Just about everyone in Puerto Rico has a relative who left recently for Florida, New York, Texas or Virginia, among others. But the decision is never easy. Fathers leave behind children. Houses must be rented or sold at a loss in a glutted market. Businesses must be shut. And English must be polished, or in some cases learned, in a hurry.Alexis Sotomayor said that on his January flight to Orlando, two acquaintances sitting nearby were also headed there hoping to find work. \u201cGoing out there in the morning and returning in the evening, after an interview,\u201d he said.After Coca-Cola laid him off in 2001, Mr. Sotomayor started experimenting with distilling plant extracts. He found he could make natural soaps and decided to go into business for himself, a move that would allow him more time to spend with his children.Business boomed for years. So much so that he moved his homespun facility out of his house in 2005 and into a small building he bought in San Juan. He found that he was earning more money making soap than working as a chemical engineer.Then in 2008, the recession pounded at his door. For five years, he has tried to lift his business; he went to fairs around the island, set up booths in shopping malls, promoted his flower-infused soaps, candles and lotions on television. He divvied up his store last year and decided to rent out half the building. He let go two of his four employees.But his expenses mounted, including $600 a month in power bills, more than double what consumers pay on the mainland. The sky-high cost is a consequence of Puerto Rico\u2019s inefficient government-run monopoly on electricity and its 67 percent dependency on petroleum for electric power. Other utilities are exorbitant, too. Last year, water rates rose 60 percent in a bid to help cut the state-run water company\u2019s debt.The cost of private tuition for his children, a total of $2,000 a month, is one nonnegotiable expense for him. Like most middle- and upper-class Puerto Ricans, he long ago lost faith in the island\u2019s troubled public schools. Public school enrollment has plummeted in recent years, in part because of declining birthrates but also because of the schools\u2019 poor quality.\u201cMany parents, even lower-middle-class parents, put all their money into their children\u2019s private school, even if sometimes they have to live in rented houses,\u201d said Nilsa Velazquez, an economics professor at the University of Puerto Rico who plans to move to Virginia with her family this summer.For many, the high rate of violent crime has been the capper. There were 1,136 murders in 2011, a record and far higher than the mainland\u2019s rate. It fell to 883 homicides last year, a point of pride for the governor.But the damage had been done. Life here has always been full of trade-offs, including a high cost of living. Now, though, there is little left to trade.\u2018Live Here Just to Survive?\u2019\u201cBetween making less money and not knowing when someone will jump you, that pushed the quality of life very low,\u201d Alexis Sotomayor said. \u201cTo live here just to survive? No, thanks.\u201dFor Ms. Velazquez, the tenured professor who lives in Mayag\u00fcez, and her husband, who works for the Air Force Reserve, the mental calculations were similar. She is 50, she said. The last thing she wanted to do was give up her job as an economics professor, move her two teenage children and uproot her 76-year-old mother, who speaks no English and has never left the island.But she has grown so disillusioned with the University of Puerto Rico Mayag\u00fcez \u2014 one of the crown jewels of the island\u2019s higher-education system, where she has worked for nearly three decades \u2014 that she no longer views it as a viable option for her children. In the face of continuing economic stress, the University of Puerto Rico has suffered the loss of a steady stream of valued professors and funding for important research projects. Even tenured professors have left, Ms. Velazquez said.\u201cThe most important thing for me is my children\u2019s education, and the second is my quality of life,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see all of these fees and taxes going up, but the streets are terrible.\u201dThis summer she will try to rent out her house rather than selling it and take a loss, and will move to Fairfax County, Va., where her husband will work for the federal government and her children will attend a top public high school. As an economist with a law degree, she is hoping to find some kind of job.\u201cI thought I could do anything in Puerto Rico,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that is gone.\u201dThe frustrations of Mr. Sotomayor and Ms. Velazquez speak to the depth of the island\u2019s economic problems.The origins of the crisis, though, stretch back more than a decade. Tax incentives have long been a draw for corporations seeking to do business in Puerto Rico, and the island in turn has benefited from its ability to offer such breaks, in large part structuring its economy around them.Tax laws were once abundantly generous, which fueled the spread of factories that made textiles and pharmaceuticals, among other things. That came to a crash in 2006, after the 10-year phaseout of a subsidy that provided American firms operating in Puerto Rico with tax-free income. Changes to the global economy and the worldwide recession exacerbated the situation. Since 1996, factory jobs on the island spiraled from 160,000 to 75,000.Little was done to try to revamp the island\u2019s economic framework. Instead, deficits climbed and pensions spun out of control. In 2006, the government shut down for two weeks because it lacked the cash to meet expenses. The governor moved to raise taxes. In 2010, the next governor reduced taxes and laid off 33,000 government workers. But Puerto Rico\u2019s governors began borrowing even more heavily to get out of the economic logjam.\u201cIt was cheap and easy to borrow,\u201d said Mike Soto, the president of the Puerto Rican Center for a New Economy. \u201cIt got to the point where we tapped out what we can borrow.\u201dPainful CorrectionsLast year, Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla, the first governor from the countryside, took over. With the island\u2019s economy a shambles, and credit agencies threatening a downgrade to junk status, he had no choice but to take swift action.Economists have given him credit for acting to remedy problems that have festered for decades. In one year, he moved to overhaul three major pensions, including for teachers, that were on a pace to run out of money soon. Two of them are still pending final court approval. He reduced the deficit by 70 percent. And he is holding the four main debt-laden government-run companies more accountable and insisting on more transparency.Vowing not to lay off any more workers, he raised taxes sharply to provide much-needed revenue and moved aggressively to promote incentives to entice wealthy investors, like the hedge fund billionaire John Paulson, who has invested in an exclusive beach resort and condo complex. A number of businesses have left the island, scared away by the groaning economy and the high cost of electricity. But others have arrived or expanded, like Eli Lilly, Seaborne Airlines and Cooper Vision.Four days before the junk status decision, Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla announced that he would present a balanced budget for next year, one year ahead of his own schedule. But his job just got harder. Analysts said the credit downgrades would make it harder to improve the economy. The governor ordered agencies to cut budgets by 2 percent.\u201cI\u2019ve done everything I can to avoid a downgrade,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla said in an interview, calling the move \u201cunjust.\u201d \u201cMaybe I can\u2019t detain the winds right now, but I can build the windmills. I am an incurable optimist.\u201dBut not everyone is applauding. His tax increases have hit some businesses hard, which could pose a further drag on the economy. Among the many taxes he initiated, the governor raised the corporate tax rate to a maximum of 39 percent. Last year, the economy continued on a slide. \u201cThe new administration has a bookkeeping mentality as opposed to an economic development mentality,\u201d said Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico\u2019s nonvoting representative in Congress and a political opponent of the governor. \u201cHere you find Puerto Rico with an underlying economic problem charging its corporations \u2014 its job creators \u2014 39 percent. Hello!\u201dPerhaps the most maligned is the new lucrative gross receipts tax, which some owners of small- and medium-size businesses say threatens to put them out of business. Because of the way the tax is structured, it affects companies with less than a 5 percent net profit margin. This means that many food-related companies, like supermarkets, and new businesses, are hit hardest. The smaller the margin, the higher the tax.Some stores are paying an effective tax rate of 130 percent, said Manuel Reyes Alfonso, the vice president of a trade association that represents the food industry. If the tax is not revised, some will be forced to shut down and others will have to raise prices, he said.\u201cIt is absurd,\u201d said Mr. Reyes Alfonso. \u201cIt\u2019s like selling the car to buy gas.\u201dIn response, the governor is forming a committee to take a second look at the new taxes and the island\u2019s complicated tax code. Waivers to the tax are available, but Mr. Reyes Alfonso said they were difficult to obtain.As he sipped coffee in the bakery section of one of his stores, Jos\u00e9 Revuelta, the president of SuperMax grocery stores in Puerto Rico, said he managed to expand during the recession. But now, with the gross receipts and corporate tax cutting into his business, he is holding back on capital investments, raises and bonuses. He said he wanted reassurance that the tax hikes would be temporary.\u201cI can understand doing this on a short-term basis,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there needs to be a plan.\u201dNot many are confident that a long-term plan exists to lift the island from such a sustained crash. But it cannot get much worse, they say.\u201cSometimes you have to hit rock bottom to restore yourself,\u201d said Mr. Soto, of the Center for a New Economy. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Overhaul That Looks More Like a Tuneup", "Date": "2014-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel 2014 | Chevrolet SilveradoGlencliff, N.H. \u2014 Not far from where some emergency vehicles had pulled off the dirt road, Douglas Dutile, the Grafton County sheriff, was keeping an eye on the traffic. When he saw me appear over the crest of a hill here in the White Mountain National Forest, he recognized the truck I was driving as the new-for-2014 Chevrolet Silverado.\u201cThey changed the front end a little bit,\u201d Mr. Dutile, a happy owner of a 2012 Silverado, said. \u201cI think they look sharper than the older ones.\u201dIn the two weeks that I drove the 2014 pickup, last revised as a 2007 model, he was the only person to comment on the update.That incognito existence is a shame: Many features are new or significantly updated, including three engines that are more fuel-efficient; a quieter and more comfortable interior; and enhancements that make the cargo bed easier to use.General Motors is aware, much as I experienced, that people are not recognizing the truck as a redesigned model, said Jeff Luke, executive chief engineer for trucks.\u201cI would say, if you put our old truck right beside our new truck, they are pretty dramatically different,\u201d Mr. Luke said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut there is still some heritage there that is important to Silverado buyers.\u201dFrom a marketing perspective, however, one could argue that consumers should instantly notice a new vehicle without needing a before-and-after demonstration. Having Americans appreciate \u2014 and ideally, eager to buy \u2014 the Silverado is hugely important to General Motors. Last year Chevrolet sold about 480,000 Silverados, including heavy-duty versions, roughly a quarter of the company\u2019s total sales.As with all full-size pickups, there are many combinations of cabs, bed sizes and powertrains. The least expensive is $26,670, including a $1,095 destination charge, for a regular cab with the standard 6-foot-6 bed, 2-wheel drive, a 4.3-liter V6 and 6-speed automatic in 1WT trim. That is a basic work truck, although it does have air-conditioning and cruise control. Adding 4-wheel drive costs $3,940.There is also a double cab version, which has a seat sufficient for small passengers, but the big seller is going to be the crew cab, said Lloyd Biermann, the Silverado marketing manager. Crew cabs, which have back seats large enough to comfortably accommodate two adults, account for about 60 percent of pickup sales, Mr. Biermann said.For automakers, selling more crew cabs translates to higher profits.\u201cThirty percent of pickup trucks purchased today are purchased at over $40,000,\u201d Mr. Biermann said.Indeed, a Silverado Crew Cab with 4-wheel drive, the short (5-foot-8) bed, a 4.3-liter V6 and the midlevel LT trim is $40,920. Move to the fancy LTZ trim, a 5.3-liter V8, the off-road Z71 suspension \u2014 and no options \u2014 and the price is $46,145.The truck that I tested had options including the driver alert package with lane-departure warning and collision alert, a sunroof, power adjustable pedals, Bose stereo, a navigation unit and heated and cooled seats, bringing the price to $51,575.The top-of-the-line luxury trim level, called the High Country, starts at $46,700.There are two major changes to the configuration of the 2014 Crew Cab. Previously it was available only with the short bed. Now it is offered with the 6-foot-6 bed. It is also available with the new 4.3-liter V6.The 5.3- and 6.2-liter V8 engines are also new. They are aluminum and have direct fuel injection and variable valve timing to improve fuel economy. They can also shut down half the cylinders when there isn\u2019t much of a workload. The only transmission choice is a 6-speed automatic.The V6 is rated at 285 horsepower and 305 pound-feet of torque. That is 90 more horsepower and 45 more pound-feet than the old V6. The new 5.3-liter is rated at 355 horsepower and 383 pound-feet of torque, a gain of 40 horsepower and 48 pound-feet over its 5.3-liter predecessor. The 6.2-liter V8, available for $1,995 on LTZ and High Country models, delivers 420 horses and 460 pound-feet.In a 4-wheel-drive crew cab pickup, the 4.3 V6 is rated by the E.P.A. at 17 m.p.g. in the city and 22 on the highway, an improvement over 2013 of 3 m.p.g in town and 4 on the highway.The mileage increase for the new 5.3-liter V8 is less impressive, perhaps because last year\u2019s 5.3 engine already had the ability to switch between 4 and 8 cylinders. In a 4-wheel-drive crew cab, the new engine is rated at 16 m.p.g. city and 22 m.p.g. highway, only one more m.p.g. in either category than the 2013 model. The same truck with a 6.2 V8 is rated at 14/20.14 PhotosOwners will see a significant improvement in \u201creal-world driving,\u201d particularly when towing, compared with the older model, Mr. Luke, the chief engineer, said. During a 185-mile trip on Interstate 91 in the hills of northern Vermont with the cruise control set at 65 m.p.h., I averaged 21 m.p.g., just under the federal rating.G.M. knew that with crew cab models getting increased family use, the redesign would need to bring improvements to the interior. But there was a limit on what could be done to increase space inside the cab since the overall length of the crew cab is unchanged, as is the wheelbase. Legroom in the front is the same 41.3 inches as last year, although a new measuring method makes it appear that legroom has grown four inches. Rear legroom has increased 2.2 inches.Consequently, there\u2019s adequate room for a pair of 6-footers up front and two more in the rear. If push literally comes to shove, a third adult could fit in the middle back there.For carrying packages, the rear seats easily flip up. There\u2019s a huge storage bin between the front seats and outlets to handle all varieties of electronic devices.The controls for heating, cooling and the audio system are blissfully practical, relying on large knobs. Oddly, the knob for the volume seemed to require a ridiculous number of rotations to achieve a modest increase in the sound level. The voice-command controls worked well, a big improvement over some systems that struggle with spoken English and often misinterpret requests.On the road, the Silverado is pleasingly quiet, a result of added soundproofing provisions and a new door design. A Ram 1500 driven on the same roads seemed to have more wind noise.The truck that I tested was equipped with lane-departure warning, which tracks lines in the road and alerts the driver if the vehicle strays. Some automakers use an audible warning, but Chevrolet has adopted a more discreet alarm: There is a vibration in the seat bottom, allowing the driver to quietly correct the error of his ways.I had only one complaint about the interior accommodations, but it was a major one: I found the driver\u2019s seat uncomfortable. Usually my seat is happy in any seat, but these cushions were unyielding.Chevy made useful improvements to the cargo box: Attachment points for tie-downs are available at the top of the bed, not just the bottom. The tailgate is fitted with new struts that make it easy to lower and raise. And there are small steps in the corners of the rear bumper, making it easier to climb into the bed.Carrying all of this is the same basic frame. But there were changes \u2014 such as using more high-strength steel \u2014 to make it stronger and lighter. The suspension has also been revised, G.M. says, although it continues to use leaf springs in the rear.I spent about two weeks driving on Interstates and two-lanes, including dirt and gravel. There\u2019s no way a truck weighing more than 5,200 pounds is going to feel sporty, even with the optional Z71 off-road suspension. Instead, the Silverado is compliant, something that has come to be expected in recent generations of full-size pickups from major automakers. However, on washboard roads the Silverado displayed an undesirable pickup trait: The tail skittered about.On last year\u2019s Silverado, some models had drum brakes in the rear. Now all Silverados get four-wheel disc brakes, and the pedal feel is excellent. The electric-assist power steering is predictable and reassuring, though it lacks feel.The 5.3-liter V8 and 6-speed automatic are excellent, civilized companions. The transmission is eager to get into the highest gear possible to keep engine speed low and save fuel, yet there is no hesitation when acceleration is needed. A light indicates the change between 8 and 4 cylinders; the transition would be impossible to tell otherwise.Despite all the new creature comforts, trucks are still hauling and towing vehicles. And Chevy has not forgotten that.G.M. rates the maximum towing load of the 4-wheel-drive crew cab with the 5-foot-8 bed, the 5.3-liter V8 and the optional heavy-duty towing package at 11,200 pounds, up from 9,500 pounds last year when there was no heavy-duty tow package offered with the 5.3 engine.The payload \u2014 the maximum combined weight of the passengers and cargo \u2014 for the short-bed crew cab model with 4-wheel drive and a 5.3-liter V8 is 1,957 pounds.Looking at the overall package it\u2019s tough to say that the new Silverado is unequivocally better than the Ram 1500 or the aluminum-body Ford F-150 pickup coming later this year.But there\u2019s no doubt that Chevrolet has done a great job with the Silverado, even if the changes are not apparent to most onlookers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Mexico Meeting, a Show of Friendship With Few Results on Immigration and Trade", "Date": "2014-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOLUCA, Mexico \u2014 They call it the \u201cThree Amigos\u201d summit meeting, and President Obama and his Mexican and Canadian counterparts played their parts on Wednesday. They shared a lunch, joshed about the Olympics, promised enduring cooperation, and took a staged stroll through a botanical garden, complete with requisite smiles for the cameras.The meeting came 20 years after the three largest nations of North America tied their economies together in a landmark trade pact. Mr. Obama, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada vowed to further expand commercial flows and to broaden their ties to partners across the Pacific. But they gave little hint as to how they would overcome the obstacles holding up a proposed trade agreement with the dozen nations involved in negotiations, much less the political hurdles in Washington where Mr. Obama\u2019s own party refuses to give him the authority he seeks to seal the deal.Indeed, Mr. Obama arrived here in Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s hometown with little concrete to offer his host given the seemingly fading prospects not only for trade authority but for winning congressional approval of an immigration overhaul. Nor did Mr. Obama give Mr. Harper the commitment the prime minister wanted for construction of the Keystone pipeline to take Canadian oil to the Gulf of Mexico.Until pressed by reporters at the end of the day, the president passed lightly over those issues during the public portions of the gathering, reiterating that immigration legislation \u201cremains one of my highest priorities\u201d and pledging \u201cto complete negotiations\u201d on the proposed trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, with labor and environmental safeguards.Mr. Obama conceded that some in his party oppose a new trade pact but pointed out that he managed to pass smaller ones involving countries like Panama and South Korea despite that sentiment within his liberal base. \u201cWe\u2019ll get this passed if it\u2019s a good agreement,\u201d he said. The \u201cThree Amigos\u201d summit meetings began under President George W. Bush as annual events, although they have been somewhat less regular under his successor. Mr. Obama, making his fifth trip to Mexico as president, said Wednesday that the three-way get-togethers were useful because they were a \u201cforcing method.\u201d Yet the joint statement drafted and released before the three leaders actually sat down together seemed a statement of status quo. It used the phrase \u201ccontinue to\u201d eight times. With so little new to agree on, Mr. Obama opted not to stay for dinner and planned to head back to Washington after just eight hours on the ground.The \u201ckey deliverables,\u201d to use the White House phrase for concrete agreements, included creating a North American Trusted Traveler Program allowing prescreened individuals to travel more easily among the three countries. The leaders also agreed to create a working group to study ways to protect the Monarch butterfly, an issue that has generated great passion in Mexico. (The habitat that supports their migration across the continent is being compromised as milkweed, the monarch caterpillar\u2019s only food source, has been disappearing.)The leaders also promised to work on ways to improve freight transportation, increase educational exchanges, expand energy cooperation and synchronize trade data. American officials said such step-by-step progress represented a maturing of the relationship and ultimately would add up to important results.Mr. Obama was not the only leader with tough issues to avoid. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said little about the most recent drug violence that has plagued his country, part of his desire to shift relations with his large northern neighbor away from security issues to the economy. He noted the 20-year anniversary of the North American Free Trade Agreement, commonly known as Nafta, calling it \u201can economic initiative that marked a transcendental change\u201d on the continent and calling for its expansion. \u201cWith the same spirit two decades later, we are obliged to go further,\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said.Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based group, said it was understandable that Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto would focus on economics. \u201cHowever tempting it might be to do so, it is impossible to sweep security questions under the rug,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile Mexico has made some progress over the last year on the security front, profound troubles persist.\u201dRafael Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro, a professor of international studies at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, said the meeting was important to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto to at least begin to lay out a road map for how to move forward on economic integration. \u201cAfter 20 years of Nafta, where should we be in 10 or 20 years?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere is already a de facto integration. Now we have to take it into our own hands and manage it.\u201dMr. Obama preferred to talk about the Olympics. \u201cMy brother-in-law is Canadian,\u201d he told Mr. Harper, \u201cso you know I have to like Canadians.\u201d But then he noted that the United States and Canada may meet in hockey. \u201cFor a very brief period of time, I may not feel as warm toward Canadians as I normally do,\u201d he joked.Randal C.

{"Headline": "Virus Advances Through East Caribbean", "Date": "2014-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 A painful mosquito-borne virus common in Africa and Asia has advanced quickly throughout the eastern Caribbean in the past two months, raising the prospect that a once-distant illness will become entrenched throughout the region, public health experts say.Chikungunya fever, a viral disease similar to dengue, was first spotted in December on the French side of St. Martin and has now spread to seven other countries, the authorities said. About 3,700 people are confirmed or suspected of having contracted it.It was the first time the malady was locally acquired in the Western Hemisphere. Experts say conditions are ripe for the illness to spread to Central and South America, but they say it is unlikely to affect the United States.\u201cIt is an important development when disease moves from one continent to another,\u201d said Dr. C. James Hospedales, the executive director of the Caribbean Public Health Agency in Trinidad. \u201cIs it likely here to stay? Probably. That\u2019s the pattern we have observed elsewhere.\u201dChikungunya fever is particularly troublesome for places such as St. Martin, a French and Dutch island 230 miles east of Puerto Rico, where two million tourists visit annually. In an effort to keep the disease from affecting tourism and crippling the island economy, local governments began islandwide campaigns of insecticide fogging last week and house-to-house cleanups of places where mosquitoes could breed.Already, the travel search engine Kayak said there was a 75 percent decline in searches for St. Martin in the past three weeks, compared to the same period last year.Searches for Martinique, which has had 364 confirmed chikungunya cases, were down 18 percent.\u201cThe owners said they would spray the house,\u201d Ms. Carter said. \u201cBut what if you want to leave the house?\u201dPublic health and tourism officials on the islands are urging visitors to wear long sleeves and insect repellent high in DEET.\u201cNot a lot of bookings were canceled, but there were a few people not understanding exactly what this was, thinking it was a pandemic on a large scale,\u201d said Kate Richardson, a spokeswoman for the French St. Martin\u2019s tourism board. \u201cPeople got a bit scared, and a few of them have declined to take their trips.\u201dShe said the hotel association had not reported the number of cancellations.Chikungunya (pronounced chik-en-GUN-ya) causes high fever and muscle pain, symptoms similar to those caused by dengue fever, which has swept the Caribbean for several years. While dengue can be fatal and chinkungunya rarely is, experts said the effects of chikungunya, such as pain in the small joints, tend to last longer, sometimes for months.Ann M. Powers, a vector-borne disease specialist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said past outbreaks in other nations had incapacitated people because the pain in their wrists and ankles was so severe.\u201cThey miss school and work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a drain on resources and the work force.\u201dNora E. Kelly, an Ontario restaurant comptroller, is leaving for St. Martin on Sunday with a group of 28 friends who have tracked the disease closely and loaded up on insect repellent.\u201cIt\u2019s been a miserable winter,\u201d Ms. Kelly said. \u201cChikungunya is not going to stop me from getting on that plane in a million years.\u201dThe health ministry in Sint Maarten, the Dutch side of the Caribbean island, said no Canadian, European or American tourist at a resort had fallen ill.\u201cIn order to keep the virus under control, various proactive steps have been taken and continue to be taken by both the Dutch and French authorities,\u201d Lorraine Scot, a spokeswoman for the ministry, said in a statement.Those steps include fogging, surveillance of suspected cases, biological lab investigations and a public-awareness campaign alerting people to the dangers of standing water, where mosquitoes lay their eggs.The virus has also been detected in the British Virgin Islands, Dominica, French Guiana, Guadeloupe and St. Barth\u00e9lemy.\u201cIt certainly has the potential to move to a lot of other places in the Western Hemisphere,\u201d Ms. Powers said. \u201cAll of Central America and big parts of South America would certainly be susceptible.\u201dThe disease has not spread to the United States, but the two species of mosquito that carry it can be found in this country.Chikungunya was first identified in Tanzania in 1952. The name translates to \u201cthat which bends up\u201d in the Kimakonde language of Mozambique.According to the World Health Organization, since 2005, nearly two million cases have been reported in India, Indonesia, Malvides, Myanmar and Thailand.An article last Sunday about the advance of chikungunya fever, a mosquito-borne virus, in the Caribbean referred incompletely to its possible spread beyond that region. While the virus has not yet reached the United States, both species of mosquitoes that carry it can be found in the country, and experts said it could be contracted in the United States in the warmer months. In addition, a picture caption misspelled, in some copies, part of the name of one of two species of mosquitoes that carry the virus. The species is Aedes aegypti, not Aedes aegpyti. (The other one is Aedes albopictus.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Payroll Data Shows a Lag in Wages, Not Just Hiring", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the more than 10 million Americans who are out of work, finding a job is hard. For the 145 million or so who are employed, getting a raise is even harder.The government said on Friday that employers added 113,000 jobs in January, the second straight month of anemic growth, despite some signs of strength in the broader economy. The unemployment rate inched down in January to 6.6 percent, the lowest level since October 2008, from 6.7 percent in December. But the report also made plain what many Americans feel in their bones: Wages are stuck, and barely rose at all in 2013. They were up 1.9 percent last year, or a mere 0.4 percent after accounting for inflation. Not only was that increase even smaller than the one recorded in 2012, it was half the normal rate of wage gains in the two decades before the last recession. The stagnation helps explain why many people feel apprehensive even though the economy grew at a robust pace in the second half of 2013, corporate profits rose, the stock market boomed and the housing market continued to gain ground. The issue cuts across the American work force. In fact, white-collar workers did a bit worse than blue-collar workers last year in terms of wage growth. \u201cPeople are running in place in terms of their living standards,\u201d said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cThere\u2019s almost no growth in spending power.\u201d As recently as 2008, when the economy sank deeper into recession and Lehman Brothers collapsed, wages still managed to rise by 3.5 percent, before inflation. But the combination of a backlog of workers left behind in the recession\u2019s wake, as well as productivity gains resulting from new technologies, means salaries may not rebound anytime soon. \u201cWe won\u2019t see stronger wage growth until unemployment gets below 6 percent and we begin adding 200,000 jobs a month,\u201d Mr. Harris predicted. Friday\u2019s data from the Labor Department shows an economy performing well below that level, however. The 113,000 jobs that were added in January fell far short of the 180,000 economists had anticipated, and came after a particularly weak December. Despite the decline in the jobless rate, some economists said on Friday that job creation had indeed slowed, in what might be called a winter wobble for the economy \u2014 the cold weather equivalent of last year\u2019s summer swoon. Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays, noted that over the course of November, December and January, the more reliable three-month pace of job creation stood at 154,000, roughly 75,000 positions fewer than employers added in September, October and November. Initially, the weak report for December was blamed on wintry conditions that inhibited hiring, but Mr. Maki said a second straight month of disappointing job gains led him to conclude that the cold and snow could not be blamed this time.\u201cI don\u2019t think we can say weather affected January payrolls,\u201d Mr. Maki said, noting that the construction sector, for example, bounced back in January after a weak showing in December. Nevertheless, Mr. Maki and most other economists said they did not believe the weak numbers for job creation in December and January would prompt the Federal Reserve to reverse course on its decision late last year to steadily reduce its stimulus efforts in 2014.\u201cThis will get the Fed\u2019s attention, but it won\u2019t affect their trajectory,\u201d Mr. Maki said. Still, another poor showing for hiring when the next employment report comes out in early March might prompt a pause among Fed policy makers at their meeting later that month, especially if other indicators show a parallel cooling.Wall Street shrugged off the unemployment report on Friday, as bullish investors sent stocks higher, with market indexes finishing higher for the week after three straight weeks of losses. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 165.55 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 15,794.08. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index gained 23.59 points, or 1.3 percent, finishing at 1,797.02. The Nasdaq surged by 68.74 points, or 1.7 percent, to 4,125.86. In bond trading, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 5/32 to 100 18/32, while its yield dropped to 2.69 percent from 2.7 percent late Thursday.One reason Wall Street may have looked on the bright side Friday is that the separate survey of households the Labor Department uses to calculate the unemployment rate told a different story from the payroll data survey. It showed a gain of more than 600,000 workers, helping bring down the unemployment rate. In the payroll data survey for January, the public sector held back overall payrolls, as government employment shrank by 29,000 jobs in January. Excluding that loss, private employers added 142,000 positions, a slightly better showing. Several other sectors which had been strong in recent months \u2014 education and health care, as well as retail \u2014 also lost positions, contributing to the overall weakness.The falloff in hiring in the health care sector was especially noteworthy. In December and January together, just 2,600 health care positions were filled. By contrast, as recently as November, nearly 25,000 health care workers were added to payrolls.Although this area of the economy is undergoing a transformation as President Obama\u2019s new health care plan is slowly introduced, that is unlikely to have caused the abrupt slowdown in hiring, said Mr. Harris, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist. If anything, he said, the law should create new jobs in the sector as health care coverage is expanded, even if higher costs for some employers result in job cuts elsewhere in the economy.As for retail, which lost nearly 13,000 jobs in January, Mr. Harris said that some of the reduction could have been because of excess hiring in December, when stores added nearly 63,000 positions as the holiday shopping season peaked. The cuts may also have been spurred by weak results at some retailers, with chains like J. C. Penney announcing major job cuts last month, and Loehmann\u2019s, the venerable discounter, now in liquidation.The employment-population ratio, which has been falling as more workers drop out of the job market, edged up 0.2 percentage points, to 58.8 percent in January.While salary gains have been muted across the work force, more educated workers continue to enjoy much better employment options than those with a high school degree or less. The unemployment rate for college graduates in January stood at just over 3 percent, compared to 6.5 percent for high school graduates and 9.6 percent for people who lack a high school diploma. The problem for economic growth in general, and wage growth in particular, is that only one-third of the American work force \u2014 50.4 million out of 155 million \u2014 have a college degree or more. By contrast, there are approximately 73 million workers who have a high school diploma or some college, and 11 million workers who did not finish high school. With many less educated workers chasing a limited number of new jobs, employers have little reason to increase wages. \u201cIt\u2019s just an extremely competitive environment for workers, where people have little negotiating power,\u201d Mr. Harris said.

He said that by April he would submit proposed changes to Italy\u2019s sclerotic public administration laws and its byzantine corporate regulations, which are widely blamed for restraining the country\u2019s economic progress. He promised proposals to revise Italy\u2019s tax system by May. He said that bringing down unemployment, which he called Italy\u2019s \u201cbiggest emergency,\u201d would be his main priority.But his first challenge is to form a coalition that will back his party, which does not have a majority in either house of Parliament. Mr. Letta remained in power for nearly 10 months supported by traditionally antagonistic political parties from across the political spectrum. The parties\u2019 divergent interests were seen by some analysts as a brake to promised changes. Mr. Renzi will most likely have to depend on the same majority to back his cabinet.Mr. Renzi returned to Florence on Monday, and told reporters that on Tuesday he would begin consultations with other party leaders to try to assemble a coalition. The New Center Right Party of Angelino Alfano, who served as Mr. Letta\u2019s deputy prime minister, said over the weekend that the party\u2019s support was contingent on a \u201cright-leaning\u201d agenda.Mr. Renzi said that forming a government would \u201ctake a few days,\u201d given the scope of the changes he hoped to enact.\u201cI will take the time necessary,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe sense of urgency is extraordinarily delicate and important.\u201dA small group of protesters with the right-leaning Brothers of Italy Party gathered outside the presidential palace while Mr. Renzi was inside, chanting, \u201cElections, elections.\u201d Some opposition party leaders had hoped that Mr. Napolitano would call new national elections, exactly a year after the last ones, when Mr. Letta resigned. The president, however, has said that new elections are not possible until Parliament drafts a new law that will ensure the election of more stable majorities.After presenting his government to the president in the coming days, Mr. Renzi will go to Parliament, where he must win confidence votes in both houses. \u201cI intend to work seriously,\u201d he told reporters, \u201cand we will put content ahead of everything.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tepid Economic Growth in Japan", "Date": "2014-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 The Japanese economy grew at the tepid rate of 1 percent in the final quarter of 2013, data showed Monday, falling short of analysts\u2019 expectations and heightening concerns that the country\u2019s recovery might not be strong enough to weather an impending sales tax increase, a worsening trade balance and other problems expected this year.Forty-one economists polled by the Japan Center for Economic Research had predicted an annualized growth rate of 3 percent for the quarter. But an unsteady recovery in exports and a surge in imports helped blunt the rate of growth, according to preliminary figures released on Monday by the Cabinet Office.On a quarterly basis, Japan\u2019s economy expanded 0.3 percent from October to December, for the fourth-consecutive quarter of growth. Economic growth for the year came to an estimated 1.6 percent, separate data showed.Private consumption rose 0.5 percent from the previous quarter, though economists attributed much of that to spending ahead of a sales tax increase set to take effect in April and warned that growth could slow later this year. Exports grew 0.5 percent, a gain that was offset by a 3.4 percent jump in imports.The latest readings underscored the challenges facing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his three-pronged plan to put Japan\u2019s economy, long in the grips of deflation, back on a path to robust growth.Stock markets rose by over 50 percent last year in response to Mr. Abe\u2019s first so-called arrow \u2014 aggressive monetary stimulus that has flooded the Japanese economy with money and helped weaken the yen. But while the weaker currency has brought record overseas earnings for Japanese exporters, it has yet to translate into significantly higher export volumes or a rebound in wages and investment at home.Japanese stocks have recently fallen back somewhat, hurt by concerns about the strength of the global economic recovery. The weaker yen has also driven up Japan\u2019s import costs, contributing to a record trade deficit in 2013. The worsening trade balance was the most significant damper on growth in the fourth quarter, the data showed, illustrating that Mr. Abe\u2019s bid to weaken the yen to increase exports had not yet hit home.Fourth-quarter growth \u201ccame in much weaker than expected,\u201d said Masamichi Adachi, an economist at JPMorgan Securities Japan. A \u201cmuch larger increase in imports and softer exports left a significant drag, while private consumption was somewhat softer,\u201d he said.A planned sales tax increase in April, to 8 percent from 5 percent could depress consumption, presenting another problem for Mr. Abe. But the government says a stimulus package worth 5.5 trillion yen, or $54 billion, approved by Parliament this month will help to minimize the effects of the tax increase.Some economists worry that economic growth has become dependent on the large-scale government spending that is the second component of Mr. Abe\u2019s growth plan. At the same time, the economic changes intended to improve Japan\u2019s growth potential \u2014 the final and most anticipated facet of \u201cAbenomics\u201d \u2014 have yet to crystallize.\u201cTaking away the effects of last-minute demand, it is hard to say that underlying consumption is strong,\u201d said Ryutaro Kono and Hiroshi Shiraishi, economists in Tokyo for BNP Paribas. And they added that a significant part of that domestic demand was, in fact, escaping overseas through the higher prices that households were paying for imports like fuel and food.The prime minister chose to go ahead with the tax increase to quell concerns over the government\u2019s finances, as Japan\u2019s public debt has risen to more than twice the size of its $5 trillion economy. But the tax increase could be ill timed, especially when the Japanese are already grappling with rising costs and their wages have not kept up.This year, Mr. Abe is set to decide whether to raise the tax rate to 10 percent in 2015 to help pay for costs incurred because of Japan\u2019s aging population. That decision highlights the challenges of chasing economic growth and fiscal consolidation at the same time.Still, Kyohei Morita and Yuichiro Nagai, economists in Tokyo for Barclays Capital Japan, wrote in a research note that though growth sharply undershot forecasts, they did not expect the numbers to prompt the Bank of Japan to immediately introduce more credit-easing measures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bailout Gave Small Bank a Chance to Survive", "Date": "2014-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceThe image of bank bailouts in the United States was set by the megabanks, and with it widespread public hostility to the bailouts.But more than just giant banks received bailouts. More than 700 banks received TARP money, most of them unknown outside their hometowns.Some of those banks failed anyway, at perhaps a greater cost to the government, including the bank insurance fund, than would have been the case otherwise. But others prospered, and the government made money while saving them.By bailing out those banks \u2014 and in some cases by stepping up regulatory oversight \u2014 the government kept those banks in business. Now those that have recovered are able to make loans again in the communities they know. Had there been no bailouts, many of those banks would have failed or been snapped up by larger competitors with greater resources. Bank concentration would be greater than it is. Whether the new bank would have been as willing to make local loans is, of course, not knowable. Even when the government lost money on the bailout, the net result was sometimes positive for the bank and its customers.Old Second avoided some of the pitfalls that got banks into trouble during the real estate bubble. At least it stuck to its own area, rather than expand to hot spots like Las Vegas or Phoenix, as some banks did.But it turned out there were ample opportunities to lose money at home. Early in this century, the far western suburbs of Chicago were growing rapidly, and Old Second was eager to lend to developers. It concentrated its loans in residential development and in that regard was typical of many banks that got into trouble when the credit crisis hit and real estate prices fell.\u201cThey were chasing profits and their underwriting standards loosened as their concentration grew,\u201d Kristina B. Whittaker, the deputy comptroller of the currency who is in charge of supervising troubled community banks, said in an interview. She was speaking generally, but it appears that Old Second did exactly that.In January 2009, the government bailed out Old Second with a $73 million investment in preferred stock and warrants. At the time, a glance at the bank\u2019s books would not have revealed why that was necessary. The bank reported it was profitable in 2008, and its filings with federal regulators concluded that there was no need to charge off even $1 in construction or land development loans. That may have reflected rose-colored glasses rather than reality. In due course, the losses did arrive as one land developer after another went broke. By 2010, the bank\u2019s nonperforming assets were greater than its capital, which is not a recipe for survival. After those results were reported, the regulators stepped in and put the bank under close watch, requiring the board to report frequently on its progress in cleaning up its balance sheet. It appears, says Michael R. McKenzie of McKenzie Partners, a bank strategic consultant who formerly worked at Old Second, that the regulators feared the bank had understated its nonperforming assets.The bank brought in a new chief credit officer, closed some branches, sold assets and laid off some employees. It expanded its money management business.As recently as a year ago, it did not look as if these steps were working. As a result of the bailout, the government owned $73 million in preferred stock, which was supposed to pay a 5 percent dividend but had not done so since 2010. When the government auctioned off the preferred stock last March, it received only 35 cents on the dollar, and even at that price could not sell it all. But the bank reports it was profitable in the first nine months of 2013. In part, that was because of an accounting decision to reverse an earlier charge \u2014 a decision based on a conclusion that the bank will earn enough money in the future to take advantage of the ability to deduct past losses from current profits on its tax returns. But regulators seem convinced. Both the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve lifted orders that restricted the bank\u2019s operations.Old Second officials declined to comment, citing the pending stock offering.In retrospect, Old Second made two big mistakes. The first came in 2003, when the bank needed more capital to finance its growth. Rather than sell common shares \u2014 a move that could have diluted the stake of shareholders and reduced reported earnings per share \u2014 it set out to borrow its way to being well capitalized.That is my description. The bank would say it sold trust-preferred stock, which in those days regulators deemed to be capital even though it paid interest just like a loan. The reason was that the bank had the right to defer interest payments for up to five years.In 2007, it sold more trust-preferred stock. In 2010, when it stopped paying dividends on the Treasury\u2019s preferred shares, it also suspended the dividend on its trust-preferred shares.The second mistake came in making too many loans to real estate developers and failing to understand how vulnerable they \u2014 and the bank \u2014 would be if the real estate bubble burst.The bank appears to have largely cleaned up the loan portfolio, but the results of the capital problems remain. A good part of the money to be raised in the stock offering will go to pay back dividends on the trust-preferred stock.And the bank could be setting up for an interesting game involving the current holders of the preferred shares issued for the bailout. It has a tentative deal with holders of about a third of the outstanding preferred shares to buy them back for just less than face value, but with the sellers waiving the right to collect any of the dividends they are owed. The bank directors who own some of the stock plan to take a similar deal.That will allow them to almost triple their money in a year, which is a little galling. To be sure, the directors put up money when others would not, but they did so in a bank about which they presumably knew a lot. Of the six directors who bought the stock, four were around when the bank was being mismanaged before the credit crisis. One was president of the bank when most of those bad loans were made. Before the stock offering becomes final, it would be nice if the S.E.C. required disclosure of how much each director stands to make.Still, those directors may be leaving money on the table. It seems likely that other holders of the bailout preferred shares will seek even better deals.The bank will be able to pay the back dividends with proceeds from the stock sale. But if the holders of those shares will not sell at a discount, the bank will be able to redeem the shares only by repurchasing them at face value, in addition to the dividends.The bank could leave the shares out indefinitely. But starting next month, the required interest rate on the preferred shares rises to 9 percent from 5 percent. For a buyer who acquired the shares at 35 percent of par value, that works into an annual yield of 31.5 percent based on the money invested. The bank may not be in a very good negotiating position if it wants to buy that stock back at a discount. That fact could serve as a deterrent to potential buyers of the common stock. This success story is not yet a sure thing.Nonetheless, the fact the stock offering is being proposed signals that the operations of Old Second have turned around. Thanks to the bailout \u2014 and to regulators who eventually got tough \u2014 the bank was saved. Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Small Towns in Southwest Fear Loss of Cherished Train Line", "Date": "2014-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAMY, N.M. \u2014 For 18 years, Maryalice Garrigan has been taking the train from this wisp of a town near Santa Fe to visit her family in Albany, spending four days to reach New York via a connection in Chicago. She cherishes the annual ritual: Sipping the whiskey she packs in a cooler, and tracing the creeks and mesas that whiz by with a map she brings on each trip.But now the historic route of the Southwest Chief, which runs between Los Angeles and Chicago, is in danger of being altered, a shift that would sever a practical and symbolic lifeline for Lamy and other struggling rural communities. People here and in other small towns along the train\u2019s path say that if Amtrak leaves, Lamy \u2014 population 200 \u2014 will simply dry up and drift away across the high plains.Amtrak, which has operated the Southwest Chief since 1971, has asked Colorado, Kansas and New Mexico to each pitch in $40 million over 20 years to help pay for track upgrades and maintenance it says are needed to keep the route viable. But some state officials are balking, saying that Amtrak, which draws financial support from the federal government, should cover the costs itself.\u201cWhere would the train go?\u201d asked Ms. Garrigan, waiting at the station here with a dozen other travelers on a recent Sunday afternoon. \u201cThey can\u2019t take it away \u2014 there\u2019s too much history,\u201d she said.Gone are the days when well-dressed families en route to Los Angeles or Chicago would peer out at Lamy from their seats in dome cars. The town\u2019s lone restaurant and saloon has been transformed into a railroad museum. A small plaque marks where El Ortiz Hotel once stood. And cartoonish signboards of Native Americans still stare out from the front of an out-of-service dining car \u2014 stage props of sorts, from a time long past. But the tableaus of badlands and desert, the lonesome stretches of railroad, are still there.At several legislative hearings this month, county officials from northern New Mexico implored lawmakers to keep the railroad route alive.\u201cWe need this train here,\u201d said Jim Maldonado, chairman of the board of commissioners for Colfax County, where the train stops in Raton (population: 6,700), bringing thousands of Boy Scouts each year for retreats before dropping over the Raton Pass and into Colorado.\u201cLosing it would be devastating for our county,\u201d Mr. Maldonado said. \u201cThings have just been dying out here for years.\u201dAt issue is who will shoulder the financial burden of modernizing the route. The railroad track is owned by Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, a Fort Worth company that manages slower freight trains on the line.Amtrak says that the tracks that guide the Southwest Chief will soon be unable to withstand the speed that a modern passenger train needs to stay efficient, and that track replacement is most pressing in New Mexico, Colorado and Kansas. The total cost to upgrade the route would be $200 million, Amtrak says, and it and Burlington Northern Santa Fe would each contribute $40 million.But with its contract with the freight train company up at the end of 2015, Amtrak wants funding assurances from the states as well \u2014 and soon. Unless all three states pitch in, Amtrak says it will potentially drop nine small-town stations in favor of existing track in Texas and Oklahoma.\u201cThe train is not viable as a business when it operates at a lower speed, because it ends up being slower than driving,\u201d said Marc Magliari, an Amtrak spokesman, adding that the company does not have the funding to pay for the upgrades on its own.The Southwest Chief, which runs in both directions once a day, needs to reach 79 miles per hour wherever possible to make its scheduled stops on time, Mr. Magliari said. If old track is not replaced soon, he added, the train will have to travel at slower speeds for longer distances.Before Amtrak took over the line, a predecessor train called the Super Chief ran for many years, operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.So far, the administration of Gov. Susana Martinez in New Mexico has been wary of supporting Amtrak\u2019s plan, pointing out that the railroad already receives annual federal funding for operational and capital expenditures.\u201cWe need to look at the cost benefit of the whole thing,\u201d said Tom Church, New Mexico\u2019s transportation secretary. \u201cObviously, we would like to see the route continue, but there is also the issue that Amtrak is funded by Congress.\u201dColorado could lose stops in the towns of Trinidad, Lamar and La Junta, each of which has a population of less than 9,000. These towns, like their New Mexico counterparts, have seen fortunes fade over the years, as coal mines, a military base and a bus factory all closed.Leroy Garcia, a Democratic state representative from Colorado, recently introduced legislation to preserve the train route and add a stop in the city of Pueblo. Under his proposal, which has drawn bipartisan support from Colorado lawmakers, a commission would be created to find funding and figure out the cost for an additional stop.\u201cBy adding the stop to Pueblo, you\u2019d now have access to 165,000 more people in the county,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have heard over and over that rural and southern Colorado is really struggling for jobs \u2014 this could serve as a hub for growth.\u201dColorado\u2019s governor, John W. Hickenlooper, supports keeping the train operating and expanding its route, said a spokesman, Eric Brown. But Mr. Brown said that the issue was \u201cprincipally a federal funding issue,\u201d and that no money for the project was included in the proposed budget pending before Colorado legislators.Kansas is also weighing how to proceed. If Amtrak changed the route, the Southwest Chief would no longer stop in Hutchinson, Dodge City or Garden City \u2014 populations 42,000, 28,000 and 27,000.\u201cAll parties would need to be at the table financially to make this work,\u201d said Sara Belfry, a spokeswoman for Gov. Sam Brownback.Amtrak said that ridership on the route has held mostly steady over the years, at more than 250,000 passengers a year for the last decade. The Southwest Chief is one of its top financial performers for long-distance trains, the company said, and keeping the route would help boost the economy of the region.For passengers like Ms. Garrigan, who is 48 and works at the Taos Ski Valley resort, the solace she finds on the train is the greatest advantage of all.\u201cIt\u2019s so much less stressful than flying,\u201d she said.As the Southwest Chief shot out of the Ortiz Mountains in the distance and hurtled toward Lamy, she smiled widely, grabbed her bags and prepared to board.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Economic Growth in Thailand Cools to 0.6%", "Date": "2014-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 It was, until recently, one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia. It shrugged off coups, street protests and natural disasters. And it earned the nickname \u201cTeflon Thailand.\u201dBut Thailand has been shaken by unrest since November, and it is taking a toll, with potentially lasting effects, on the country\u2019s economy just as regional growth over all is being dragged down by a slowing China and a reduction in stimulus from the United States Federal Reserve.Data released by the Thai authorities on Monday showed that the economy grew 0.6 percent in the final quarter of 2013, compared with the same period a year earlier. That was slightly better than analysts had expected, but sharply down from the 2.7 percent pace of the previous quarter and the slowest pace since early 2012, when the economy was reeling from floods that paralyzed much of Thailand\u2019s manufacturing heartland for weeks.Full-year growth slumped to 2.9 percent from 6.5 percent in 2012,the National Economic and Social Development Board said.The unrest, which stems from a drawn-out power struggle between opponents and backers of Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire tycoon and former prime minister who was ousted in a 2006 coup, has focused largely on Bangkok. Antigovernment protesters have been blocking key roads in the capital for weeks, and a 60-day state of emergency is in force in the city and neighboring areas. In the latest development on Monday, protesters surrounded the government\u2019s headquarters and threatened to prevent Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, the sister of the former prime minister, from entering the building.Other parts of the country \u2014 including major tourism destinations such as Koh Samui and Phuket \u2014 have been largely unaffected, as have the country\u2019s airports.Still, Thailand\u2019s tourism industry, which accounts for 7 percent of the economy and much of the country\u2019s international image, has been badly hurt by the unrest, as visitors have avoided travel to Bangkok.As the protests have dragged on, consumer and business confidence has plummeted. Retailers in the city complain of falling sales. Advertising and property transactions have slowed. Toyota\u2019s chief of operations in Thailand, where the Japanese automaker has large manufacturing sites, cautioned last month that the company might have to reconsider plans for a major investment plan if the unrest continued indefinitely.An election on Feb. 2 has not eased the deadlock, meaning that government spending plans are unlikely to materialize for many months.Thailand\u2019s stock market and currency have proved relatively immune to the unrest of the past three months, and the benchmark SET stock index closed up 1.6 percent Monday, for its highest close since Dec. 25.However, the index is down 7.4 percent since early November, reflecting concern about Thailand\u2019s long-term economic outlook. With the unrest now in its fourth month and little prospect of any resolution soon, analysts are increasingly worried that Thailand could lose precious time in expanding its transportation infrastructure and making other changes that might help increase its attractiveness to foreign investors.\u201cWith Thailand\u2019s political crisis still showing no clear signs of an end, the economic outlook is increasingly poor,\u201d Krystal Tan, an analyst in Singapore for Capital Economics, wrote in a research note. \u201cSpending restrictions on the caretaker government leave it with limited ammunition to boost the economy. Large public infrastructure investments have been stalled and are now unlikely to begin soon enough to lift growth significantly in 2014.\u201dThailand\u2019s economy, she added, was not hurt as badly by the unrest in the fourth quarter of 2013 as she had feared. But with the disruption increasing since late December, she said, \u201cmuch worse probably lies ahead.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Whose Turkey Is It?", "Date": "2014-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is still a marvel to behold Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s self-confidence, even after 11 years of his rule. In recent weeks, a new poster featuring Turkey\u2019s prime minister has appeared throughout Istanbul, on highway billboards and mass transit. Wearing his usual dark suit, Erdogan looks to be in purposeful motion, like an action hero. Two large words in block letters, SAGLAM IRADE, Turkish for \u201cIron Will,\u201d accompany him. Surely some of his supporters appreciate this evocation of 1930s-era masculinity, but for others, it must feel like an invasion of personal space. The enormous billboards intensify the claustrophobia that many Turks have felt for years: that Erdogan is everywhere, in every tree or open space sacrificed for a building, in every traffic jam, in every newspaper column and pro-government tweet and call to prayer. The poster, which a group of his supporters claims to have put up, begs to be defaced, and Turks have torn at it or covered it with new slogans: \u201cIron Fascist,\u201d \u201cIron Corruption,\u201d \u201cIron Enemy of the People.\u201dThe public turn against Erdogan began last May, when protests in Istanbul escalated and pictures of police officers violently attacking the demonstrators circulated around the world. For the first time in a decade, Turkey didn\u2019t look like one of the few Middle Eastern destinations where Westerners would take a vacation. The government was caught off guard. A couple of weeks later, Erdogan convened two meetings in the capital, Ankara, with assorted activists, artists and observers. Many immediately dismissed this public exercise as a sham gesture \u2014 plausible, given that the invitees included film stars \u2014 but some activists relished the opportunity to speak to their prime minister. The episode recalled the time when Robert F. Kennedy met with James Baldwin, Harry Belafonte and Lorraine Hansberry in 1963 because he wanted to understand why blacks were angry. Erdogan wanted to understand why so many Turks were angry.In one meeting, Erdogan sat at the head of the table, constantly writing with a fountain pen in a leather-bound notebook. He wrote for five hours as activists gave testimony about their experiences in the previous weeks. Erdogan\u2019s cabinet ministers often cut them off or spoke with weary condescension about whether, say, tear gas could be dispensed from a low-hovering helicopter. Erdogan sometimes told his officials to be quiet. \u201cLet them speak,\u201d he said.The protests began when activists gathered in Gezi Park to demonstrate against its demolition. Ipek Akpinar, a professor of architecture, asked Erdogan if he gave orders during the brutal first days, when the police burned the tents of peaceful environmentalists and assaulted them with pepper spray and tear gas. \u201cSomehow, in the last 10 years, he gave an image of being democratic, of trying to talk with everyone, to understand other groups,\u201d Akpinar told me later. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe \u2014 we didn\u2019t want to believe, probably \u2014 that he would do this.\u201d The activists kept returning to this question. \u201cPrime Minister Erdogan,\u201d Akpinar asked, \u201cdid you know what was happening in the first three days?\u201dHe said he did not. \u201cMy team didn\u2019t take it very seriously,\u201d Erdogan said, according to several people who attended the meeting. \u201cWe thought it was just environmentalists, and so we didn\u2019t react. But yes, the police acted severely. I wasn\u2019t aware of the burning of the tents the first two nights. I was told about it on the third day, and then it was too late.\u201d\u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d the professor asked. Several other activists joined in. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d cried Nil Eyuboglu, a 20-year-old college student. \u201cTell us! They violently attacked us! How could you not know?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cI brought the people responsible into my office and yelled at them. I made them cry.\u201dThe prime minister seemed more like a clan leader than the head of a government. \u201cIt was like . . . there\u2019s just one man,\u201d Akpinar said later. She wasn\u2019t the only one disappointed. Some of the young people in the meeting had attended religious schools, as Erdogan had, and their families had championed Erdogan\u2019s conservative Muslim party. Like the millions of countrymen who regarded him as a hero, they had lived through decades of repression of religious Turks by secularist regimes. Now they were criticizing Erdogan harshly. Some even cried at the betrayal they felt.Finally, listening to those who once supported him, he showed emotion: \u201cHow can even you misunderstand us,\u201d he said,\u201c like everyone else?\u201dErdogan\u2019s response to both threats has been to punish those he considers disloyal. Critics of Erdogan are called traitors or terrorists \u2014 or, more colorfully, assassins. Thousands of activists have been detained, their schools or workplaces investigated, their homes raided. Informal emergency medical care, common during street protests, has been criminalized. Some 5,000 police officers and prosecutors, who Erdogan claims are conspiring against him, have been dismissed from their jobs or reassigned. Internet sites have suddenly become inaccessible. The judiciary is in danger of falling under Erdogan\u2019s control. The exchange rates for Turkey\u2019s currency, the lira, have plunged significantly, and predictions for the economy are dire. The feeling in Turkey is that, all of a sudden, the country that was a model for the modern Muslim world is on the verge of disintegration.An Erdogan government was once synonymous with stability. One reason even skeptical secular Turks tolerated the A.K.P. was its hard-working officials. Even if people disliked their Islamist pasts or their head-scarf-wearing wives, they liked their industriousness, and above all the rapid economic development they facilitated in the 2000s. Before then, Turkish politicians were mostly bland bureaucrats, and Turkey was very poor. The military staged coups every decade or so in the name of secularism or anticommunism, each time shattering the country\u2019s diverse political longings and enfeebling its government. The pattern changed somewhat in the mid-1980s, when Prime Minister Turgut Ozal liberalized the economy, which allowed a capitalist class of small-town entrepreneurs and fledgling corporate bigwigs to take root.Erdogan, who attended a religious high school and played semiprofessional soccer, grew up in a conservative, blue-collar neighborhood in Istanbul called Kasimpasa. The men there are quick to say they are Erdogan\u2019s \u201cbest friend,\u201d and their loyalty to him can be fierce. At Erdogan\u2019s old soccer club, I once asked some of them what makes a Kasimpasa man. A silver-haired guy in a black leather jacket said: \u201cWatch Tayyip, watch how he walks. That\u2019s Kasimpasa.\u201dA member of the youth groups of Islamist parties that later evolved into the A.K.P., Erdogan was elected Istanbul\u2019s mayor in 1994 at age 40. He cleaned up the city; his administration distributed largess to peripheral neighborhoods and improved the water supply. To various elites, the A.K.P. men might have seemed like provincial rubes, but as an organization, the A.K.P. was like a sleek corporation.\u201cOne usually assumes that Islamists are not educated, that Islamists are provincial \u2014 no, no, no,\u201d says Seyla Benhabib, a Turkish political philosopher at Yale University. \u201cThere is a new political class in Turkey. The C.H.P. cadre\u201d \u2014 the Republican People\u2019s Party, the main secularist opposition party \u2014 \u201ccomes from the usual civil servants, teachers, judges, bureaucrats. A.K.P. is a very young and ambitious professional cadre of people.\u201dThe A.K.P. emerged from an Islamist movement called Milli Gorus, whose outlook was anti-Western and combative \u2014 the Turkish, watered-down version of Egypt\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood. Theirs was a challenge to the preceding Kemalist regimes, which embraced the ideals of Turkey\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, and enforced strict adherence to a secularist, nationalist identity. In the late 1990s, after he was jailed briefly for reciting a supposedly Islamist poem in public, Erdogan shifted course. He began preaching a pro-European Union, pro-American and pro-business worldview, and rather than espousing Islamist politics, he framed religious rights in terms of personal freedom. As a Turkish scholar named M. Hakan Yavuz put it in his 2009 book, \u201cSecularism and Muslim Democracy in Turkey,\u201d the A.K.P. didn\u2019t operate outwardly as an Islamist group at all; it was a pragmatic party of \u201cservices.\u201d Erdogan\u2019s transformation won him the admiration of liberals at home and abroad. It also caught the attention of another Islamic movement eager for power, one that followed the teachings of an imam named Fethullah Gulen.When I embarked on a tour of Gulen\u2019s world a few years ago, I visited some of the schools in Houston and Washington, as well as a boarding school in Kabul, Afghanistan. In many of them, students learn Black Sea folk dances\u00ad and Turkish poetry. Gulen himself, who is 72, lives in a wooded area in the Poconos behind a security checkpoint; he is supposed to have moved to the United States for medical treatment, and his residence in a country that many Turks deem meddlesome, if not nefarious, has made him the human flame that sustains a thousand conspiracy theories. In 2010, when I visited Gulen\u2019s compound, a couple had come from Japan to see him. \u201cHocaefendi,\u201d or master teacher, as he is called, was too ill to meet me. He typically gives interviews to journalists only when he has something specific to announce.The Gulenists I met at the compound were relentlessly charming, friendly and intelligent. They also engaged in self-protective obfuscation, something the sociologist Joshua Hendrick, an assistant professor at Loyola University in Maryland, calls \u201cstrategic ambiguity,\u201d which shrouds some of their activities. This lack of transparency, they say, is justified by their past persecution at the hands of the Turkish military.An alliance in the early 2000s with the ascendant A.K.P., whose center-right, pro-business perspective they shared, offered the Gulenists a way to extend their influence, even as they refrained from putting up their own candidates for Parliament. In Turkey, Hendrick says, \u201cparties come and go, and any party isn\u2019t going to have a long shelf life.\u201d But, he says, succeeding in business or receiving ministerial appointments or joining the police confers lasting power: \u201cAffiliates of the Gulen community have been accruing influence in the Istanbul police force and other police forces, and in the judiciary and prosecuting offices around the country.\u201d This aspiration to secure important government jobs makes many Turks suspicious of their motives.Mustafa Yesil, the president of the Journalist and Writers Foundation, an Istanbul-based public-relations arm for Gulen\u2019s followers, argues that every citizen has the right to work in any sector of the society. \u201cMr. Gulen sees three problems in society: ignorance, conflict and poverty,\u201d he said of the Gulenists\u2019 ideals. \u201cHizmet supported A.K.P. based on the promise that A.K.P. would fight against the military tutelage, further the E.U. process and democratization and create a new civilian constitution.\u201dErdogan welcomed the movement\u2019s international influence and media support. With its endorsements, he achieved real gains. He sidelined the military. He moved Turkey\u2019s laws significantly toward European Union norms. The economy flourished, as he pushed privatization and investors from abroad poured money into the country. The A.K.P. built hospitals, roads, bridges and luxury shopping malls. Turkey had been so dysfunctional, and so undemocratic, that many of these initiatives were necessary.Eventually, however, they seemed like a power grab. Around 2007, the A.K.P. and Gulenists in the judiciary and the police force put hundreds of journalists and former military generals on trial, charged with being members of a Kemalist \u201cdeep state.\u201d Much of the evidence appeared to have been manufactured by Gulenists. At the same time, many Turks were beginning to believe that the intelligence wing of the police force was wiretapping the phones of journalists and businessmen. Erdogan himself bullied the corporate owners of media outlets, and hundreds of journalists were muzzled or fired. And in 2010, a referendum on the Constitution revamped the judicial system to favor the judges affiliated with Erdogan and Gulen. Instead of reforming the state, the A.K.P. appeared to be capturing it.Yet the Erdogan-Gulen media machine, suffusing the landscape with the rhetoric of freedom and progress, managed to portray Erdogan as the very incarnation of democracy. In 2011, Erdogan won his third national election with nearly 50 percent of the vote, which he took as a mandate for the Erdoganization of everything.Taksim, in the center of the city\u2019s European side, is considered the heart of Istanbul. The square itself surrounds tiny Gezi Park and is covered with concrete and filled with traffic, but the absence of buildings offers at least a sense of free space. Erdogan wanted to close the square to cars, build tunnels for them beneath it and replace Gezi Park and its rows of sycamore trees with a giant shopping center designed to look like Ottoman-era military barracks. Putting anything Ottoman-like in Taksim, a symbol of the secular republic, felt like an assertion of Erdogan\u2019s neo-Islamic identity. In terms of scale and presumption, it would be as if Michael Bloomberg, New York\u2019s former mayor, tried to erect a five-story shopping mall in Bryant Park with facades like blinking Bloomberg terminals.Except Erdogan wasn\u2019t the mayor of Istanbul. And he wasn\u2019t consulting his constituents there. Far from it: When a local committee composed of academics, historians and municipal appointees unanimously voted against the plan, he simply had another committee made up of his own bureaucratic appointments override the vote. This, to Turks, was what his rule had come to mean.Osman Can, a constitutional scholar who is on the A.K.P.\u2019s executive committee, says Erdogan\u2019s ability to act unilaterally is a byproduct of Turkey\u2019s highly centralized political structure, in which all decisions are made in Ankara. \u201cThe governors are appointed by the central government, so they are not elected,\u201d Can says. \u201cThe mayors are elected, but Ankara also controls the mayors. Normally the mayor would decide things in a city. But if the prime minister happened to be interested in a park, the mayor can\u2019t resist him.\u201dThe A.K.P. is the rare party that has made important changes to democratize Turkey, Can says, but the system established a century ago by Ataturk and his followers limits those advances. \u201cIt was a conscious choice of Ataturk,\u201d he says. \u201cThey wanted to control everything, they want to change the people, change the minds, reformat people. How could they do this? A decentralized system? No. An independent judiciary? No.\u201d The only limitation, Can says, \u201cis the reaction of the people.\u201dAnd the people reacted in a surprising and organic way. Many of the protesters in Istanbul last year were not activists. They were apolitical verging on apathetic members of the middle class, whose parents, traumatized by coups, taught them to stay out of politics. Radicalization happened quickly. Guzin, a 35-year-old lawyer who didn\u2019t want me to use her last name, was a typical case. A week after the police cleared Gezi Park of its occupants, I met her in the Taksim neighborhood of Cihangir.\u201cMy father is a supporter of Erdogan \u2014 he is in love,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents also had not been happy about what happened to religious people in the 1990s, when women couldn\u2019t wear the head scarf \u2014 my mother covers \u2014 and Erdogan had fought for their rights. But it\u2019s more that my father likes all the things that capitalism brings; every time I go to my village, he says, \u2018Look at the roads, look at the factories, look at the health care.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t see the negative. And he was really angry when I told him I was protesting.\u201dGuzin had heard that some 50 environmentalists, in a city of 15 million people, in a country of 80 million, had pitched tents in Gezi. \u201cWhen I read about Gezi Park, for the first time I said, \u2018We should do something,\u2019 \u201d she told me. \u201cI got like five people, and we just went and sat on the grass. There were some tents, but it wasn\u2019t that crowded. I had wanted to see so many more, like 5,000 people. So I was a little disappointed, and we went home.\u201dAround 4 the next morning, the police lit tents on fire. Guzin said that when she read about it in the newspaper the next day, she thought: They have no right to do that. They don\u2019t even have the right to take the tents.\u201cI got really angry,\u201d she said, \u201cand I called all my friends and said, \u2018Come on, let\u2019s go again.\u2019 We knew they had used tear gas before, so we went to the pharmacy to get masks, and they said: \u2018O.K., get ready, bring water, put on your gas mask. And come back safe.\u2019 We thought, What is happening? Then we saw a huge crowd walking toward Gezi Park. And suddenly I couldn\u2019t see anything, I couldn\u2019t breathe, I couldn\u2019t even put my mask on.\u201dGuzin continued: \u201cI started to breathe again, thankfully, but I saw the water cannon, and I was scared, and people got panicked. I kept checking behind me to see if it was going to hit me, and it did. But then I thought, O.K., we passed this, we can survive it. And I became braver. We went back maybe 10 times that night. When everyone in the neighborhoods began banging pots and pans from their windows for us, I was going to cry. I thought, Wow, we are doing something good.\u201dWithin a week, the activists\u2019 tiny sit-in spread to 70 cities. The occupation of Gezi Park lasted 19 days. In Istanbul, on the evenings the riot police stayed away, thousands of people \u2014 Kurds and nationalists, gays and soccer fans, secularists and leftists \u2014 streamed into the square to celebrate what was a historic act of state defiance. It was utterly leaderless. One Kurdish demonstrator told me, \u201cPerhaps the only thing that could have brought all of these warring groups together was something as innocuous as a park.\u201dMany participants described their time in Gezi Park as a first brush with political consciousness. In the early 2000s, the Turkish people experienced what they were told was a democratic opening. Now they wondered whether something was being taken away from them, or whether that democracy was a mirage. The protesters showed a global audience that Turkey\u2019s new wealth was a distraction from the realities of injustice and one-man rule. And the cacophonous utopia that bloomed in the park served as a rebuke to the blandly baroque language of neoliberal democracy and family-values conservatism that the A.K.P. and Gulenist media had so skillfully deployed. As one activist named Zeynel Gul explained to me, Gezi wasn\u2019t Occupy, Syntagma or Tahrir \u2014 referring to the protests in New York, Athens and Cairo \u2014 it was \u201call but none.\u201d Erdogan, meanwhile, called the protesters \u201cterrorists\u201d and \u201clooters\u201d and declared that a conspiracy was opposing him.The quarrel between the two allies had been slowly brewing for years. It was financial, ideological and moral, but it was mostly about power. The Gulenists didn\u2019t like Erdogan\u2019s sudden transformation into a hero of the Arab street. In 2010, when the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara tried to break an Israeli blockade of Gaza, the Gulen sympathizers were against, as they put it, \u201cconfrontation.\u201d \u201cWhat I saw was not pretty,\u201d Gulen said in a rare interview with The Wall Street Journal. \u201cIt was ugly.\u201d More important, Gulenists seemed to oppose Erdogan\u2019s ways of resolving the 30-year-old conflict between Turkey and its disenfranchised Kurds. In 2012, prosecutors who were assumed to be Gulenists subpoenaed a Turkish official who had been negotiating with Kurdish leaders and who also happens to be the head of Turkey\u2019s national intelligence organization. Erdogan was enraged by the Gulenists\u2019 meddling.Fundamentally, Gulenists disagreed with Erdogan\u2019s political tactics. \u201cGulen doesn\u2019t cultivate influence through top-down reforms,\u201d says Hendrick, who lived among the Gulenists for more than a year while researching his book about Gulen. \u201cThey encourage social change by winning hearts and minds through media, through education and through competitive market performance.\u201dErdogan attacked the Gulenists at that level. In November, his plans to close the college-exam-preparation schools, many of which are run by the Gulen movement, became public. Closing a multimillion-dollar industry has more than financial ramifications; those schools are where the Gulen movement recruits members. Erdogan, Hendrick says, is \u201cgoing after the existential nature of the movement by destroying its human resources.\u201dThree weeks later, the Gulenists struck back. (On Twitter, someone posted a doctored picture of Gulen holding a lightsaber.) In mid-December, the authorities, presumably Gulenist sympathizers, brought corruption charges against the businessman sons of three A.K.P. ministers and several businessmen tied to Erdogan, including his son, Bilal. Millions of dollars were said to have been suddenly discovered in shoe boxes in a closet belonging to the chief executive of a bank. Shady gold-for-oil schemes with Iran were exposed. Bribery for construction projects unexpectedly came to light. Corruption is an open secret in Turkey, but the A.K.P. had been untouchable. When Erdogan asked the ministers to take the fall and resign, one of them said publicly that most of the construction projects had been approved by Erdogan. \u201cI want to express my belief that the esteemed prime minister should also resign,\u201d he said.Since then, Erdogan has declared that the Gulenists\u2019 corruption charges\u00ad constitute a conspiracy against him by a \u201cparallel state.\u201d To obstruct the investigation, he has purged thousands of supposed Gulenists from the police forces and reassigned the prosecutors on the corruption cases. Last month, the Gulenist Journalists and Writers Foundation held a news conference in Taksim Square and denied that Gulen sympathizers made up a parallel state with intelligence capabilities. One speaker there nevertheless made it clear that the movement wanted Erdogan to go: \u201cIn England, Margaret Thatcher lost touch with the people at the end. In the United States, even a popular politician like Bill Clinton cannot serve three terms.\u201dBut Erdogan no longer has use for his country\u2019s nascent inclusiveness. With his electoral mandate, he seems to believe he embodies Turkey himself. It is very likely that his core constituents, those who still love the man they call the Conqueror, will cast their votes for the A.K.P. in this spring\u2019s municipal elections. Erdogan\u2019s public vengefulness, however, may well wreck the economy, wounding the vulnerable people he once claimed to speak for. When he lashes out during public appearances \u2014 most recently describing his critics as members of a \u201closers\u2019 lobby\u201d \u2014 many Turks feel as if they are seeing the fractured future of their country.In a way, Erdogan\u2019s bad year is a result of a liberalizing society clashing with an inherently illiberal Turkish system. The Turkish Model \u2014 the idea that the A.K.P.\u2019s softer vision of Islam was compatible with democracy \u2014 suggested a way forward for Middle Eastern countries. But Turkey\u2019s biggest problem, its authoritarian structure, has little to do with Islam. The state remains a tool for accumulating disproportionate power, and when threatened, it sacrifices its citizens to save itself. If a prime minister can co-opt the laws and the media, and if a self-interested group can prosecute trials of dubious legality, and if the citizens have nowhere to express themselves but in the streets, then the state institutions are broken. Someday Erdogan will be gone, but Turkey\u2019s system will still be a work in progress. Democratization takes a long time, and as Gezi Park and other global movements have proved, part of the process is figuring out what kind of country its citizens want.The activist Zeynel Gul touched on this feeling when he said to me about Gezi Park: \u201cIt was important for us to experience that kind of life. If you were hungry, the food was free. If you were wounded, someone would carry you to the emergency tent. If you needed a lawyer, he is always there. Gezi gave us a powerful sense of a world based on solidarity and equality, which we could not imagine before. No one can take away what we experienced in the park.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Dingell to Retire After Nearly 60 Years in House", "Date": "2014-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by14 PhotosWASHINGTON \u2014 No member of the House has served as long as Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan. So it resonated when Mr. Dingell announced on Monday that he would not seek re-election to a seat he has held since the Eisenhower administration in part because the institution he once revered had become \u201cobnoxious,\u201d riven by acrimony and marked by lack of productivity.\u201cThere is going to be a lot of blaming and finger-pointing back and forth, but all of us are at fault,\u201d Mr. Dingell said in remarks to a chamber of commerce in Michigan, adding: \u201cThe enormous expense of money made by people in the course of the campaign has not been well spent in the interest of the public, of the Congress of the country.\u201dIn an interview with The Detroit News, Mr. Dingell, 87, was scathing. \u201cI find serving in the House to be obnoxious,\u201d he said, noting a hostile climate both inside and outside Congress.While others have shied from so directly criticizing the state of politics in announcing their retirements, such sentiments have been a clear undercurrent as other accomplished legislators such as Representatives Henry A. Waxman and George Miller, both California Democrats elected in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal in 1974, are leaving as well.On the Republican side, two current committee chairmen, Howard (Buck) McKeon of California and Doc Hastings of Washington, are quitting along with longtime Representative Tom Latham of Iowa, who chairs an Appropriations subcommittee, once one of the most sought-after positions in Congress.Other House and Senate veterans are leaving as well, taking hundreds of years of experience out the ornate doors.\u201cIt\u2019s a different place than it was in the past,\u201d acknowledged Representative Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican who now chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, which Mr. Dingell presided over for years as an intimidating watchdog of government operations. \u201cAnd we all sort of lament some of those days, for sure, but it comes with the territory. It just does. The issues are very complex, and I don\u2019t think the founding fathers ever thought we\u2019d be representing 700,000-plus people, as we do in Michigan.\u201dOthers noted that while the deterioration of personal and partisan relationships in Congress was no doubt a contributing factor, many of the retiring lawmakers are well advanced in years, have health concerns and no longer want to maintain the demanding pace of the current 24-hour political world.In addition, the retirements by top Democrats represent a recognition that their party is unlikely to recapture the majority in November, making them reluctant to undertake a costly and exhausting campaign to spend yet another two years in the minority with little influence. Over the course of a tenure beginning in 1955, when he won a special election to succeed his late father, Mr. Dingell will have been in the minority for just 16 of his 59 years of service.Still, some expressed concern that lawmakers schooled in the art of compromise and deal cutting are departing and those following do not have the same expertise or experience.\u201cThe truly distressing thing about these folks leaving is that they\u2019re the ones who know how to negotiate, know how to legislate, know how to get things done,\u201d said David Goldston, a Republican congressional aide for more than 20 years who is now director of government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cCongress is increasingly left with people who not only don\u2019t know how to do those things; they don\u2019t know that they can be done.\u201dMr. Dingell\u2019s decision is not expected to change the partisan breakdown of the House as the district is considered to be safely Democratic. Several names quickly surfaced as potential candidates to succeed him. There has been persistent suggestion that his wife, Deborah, one half of a longstanding Washington power couple, would step forward to run for his seat when he retires, and Mr. Dingell said that if she were to run, he would vote for her. He thanked her in his remarks Monday at the Southern Wayne County Regional Chamber of Commerce, saying, \u201cShe has been tireless, devoted, and worked just as hard \u2014 if not harder \u2014 for this district throughout the years.\u201dRebekah Warren, a Michigan state senator whose district includes Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, is considered an up-and-coming liberal voice in the state, and has also been mentioned as a possible candidate for the seat.Praising Mr. Dingell, President Obama released a statement calling him \u201cone of the most influential legislators of all time\u201d and noted his \u201ctireless fight to guarantee quality, affordable health care for every American.\u201dMr. Dingell often cited the support of his father, John, for comprehensive national health care as his own inspiration, and he presided over the House debate on the new health care law. But he also clashed with his own party, particularly when as an advocate for the automobile industry in Detroit he resisted tightening auto fuel economy standards. And he was a leading Democratic voice for gun rights and often served as a conduit between the more liberal House Democratic leadership and more conservative Democrats, known as Blue Dogs.After Mr. Obama\u2019s election in 2008, Mr. Waxman challenged and defeated Mr. Dingell for the chairmanship of the Energy and Commerce Committee, a devastating loss for Mr. Dingell. He remained active legislatively, particularly on health issues, though the imposing stature and style that he used to great effect against quavering hearing witnesses was notably diminished by age and deteriorating health.In recent years, Mr. Dingell often weighed whether to run again, and this year was no exception. Many expected him to remain as long as he could, but he determined his time was up, though he used the occasion to issue a plea for more cooperation in Congress.\u201cCongress means coming together, the great coming together of the American people,\u201d he said. \u201cCompromise is an honorable word.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Small Businesses, a Road Without a Map", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast year, owners of small businesses had to cope with higher tax rates. This year, they will wrestle with greater uncertainty about the fate of some deductions they have come to rely on.\u201cThe extenders didn\u2019t get extended,\u201d said Kate Barton, vice chairwoman for tax services at the Americas tax practice of Ernst & Young. \u201cEvery company in the United States right now has to plan for 2014 without the research credit, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit and a whole bunch of other provisions. It\u2019s a real bummer for small companies.\u201dThe first credit is for part of expenditures on qualified research and development. The second is for a part of the wages of new employees drawn from certain segments of society, including military veterans, welfare recipients and ex-felons.Also left unextended is the $500,000 ceiling on the Section 179 expense election. This provision has allowed businesses to write off capital expenditures in the year they were incurred, up to that amount, instead of depreciating them over several years. Without an extension, the ceiling falls to $25,000.Tax returns for 2013 aren\u2019t affected by the expirations of these extenders. But returns for future years will be, unless Congress acts. Will the provisions be renewed?\u201cThat\u2019s the zillion-dollar question,\u201d Ms. Barton said. \u201cThey have in the past, but there\u2019s a lot of politics involved. There could be piecemeal tax reform that affects the extenders.\u201dA widely shared goal in Washington is to lower corporate tax rates and recoup the potential lost revenue by removing many business deductions, such as the ones in the extenders. This would broaden the tax base, but an overhaul of corporate taxation remains elusive because businesses like the write-offs, use them liberally and are not afraid to tell their elected representatives how they feel.\u201cIt\u2019s probably the foggiest it\u2019s ever been as to whether they will be extended and at what cost,\u201d Ms. Barton said. \u201cWe probably won\u2019t know until late in the year. They could skip a year and do it retroactively.\u201dThat would repeat what played out starting two years ago. Businesses went through 2012 with the extenders unextended. They were continued a year ago for 2012 and 2013.Chris Whitcomb, tax counsel for the National Federation of Independent Business, acknowledged that business-friendly provisions are often reinstated retroactively, but he emphasized that this isn\u2019t the same as being able to count on them all along.\u201cThe frustration we hear from our members is over the unpredictability of measures that might get extended,\u201d Mr. Whitcomb said. \u201cThe more predictability and permanence there is in the tax code, the better. Tax provisions that encourage investing more capital would be ideally done permanently.\u201dHe was referring above all to the Section 179 election. \u201cBusinesses have some leeway for a few months,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the longer you wait on things like capital expenditure, the harder it is to plan.\u201dThat has been the experience of Doug Click, president of Arizona Hi-Lift. The company, in Phoenix, rents out equipment for working in places like tall buildings and cellphone towers \u2014 \u201ccherry pickers on steroids,\u201d as Mr. Click describes it. If the $500,000 limit on the Section 179 provision is not reinstated, his capital-spending plans may be crimped.\u201cThe last couple of years we have utilized 179 as the economy has recovered,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great help having that when you buy pieces of capital equipment, as I do.\u201d Without the Section 179 provision, which he has used to the maximum in recent years, he would have to pay for the equipment up front and write it off over five to seven years. \u201cThat\u2019s very difficult for a small business to pull off,\u201d he said, especially with credit hard to come by since the 2008 financial crisis.Other tax-code changes are also facing small businesses in 2014. Some work in their favor; others not so much.Bonus depreciation, which has allowed businesses to write off at an accelerated rate the cost of property beyond the amount that could be deducted using the Section 179 election, was also not extended. The same goes for a clause in the bonus depreciation rules allowing an additional $8,000 to be deducted on the purchase of a new vehicle.If you have a gain from sales of qualified small-business stocks, you were able until Dec. 31 to exclude all of it from capital-gains taxation. This year, that gets cut in half.On the bright side for small businesses, the tax credit available to those that have 25 or fewer full-time employees and pay at least half of their health insurance premiums rises to 50 percent of the amount paid, from 35 percent. Another break comes in a change in rules governing tangible property. Expenditures for replacing roofs, repaving driveways and the like will be considered as repairs that can be deducted immediately rather than as property improvements that must be amortized over years. Small businesses may get more good news if Congress reinstates the extenders. Until then, Ms. Barton expects these businesses to remain cautious and to assume that no news is bad news. She also warns that if the provisions are not extended, the damage will go beyond the businesses that hope to use them.\u201cMost companies are not factoring in the credits and are making capital-investment decisions\u201d as if the credits are not there, she said. The lack of clarity \u201cmakes it very difficult to do tax planning, and it doesn\u2019t help from an overall economic perspective to have a chunk of the Internal Revenue Code expire like this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Public Sector Cuts Part-Time Shifts to Bypass Insurance Law", "Date": "2014-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Cities, counties, public schools and community colleges around the country have limited or reduced the work hours of part-time employees to avoid having to provide them with health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, state and local officials say.The cuts to public sector employment, which has failed to rebound since the recession, could serve as a powerful political weapon for Republican critics of the health care law, who claim that it is creating a drain on the economy.President Obama has twice delayed enforcement of the health care law\u2019s employer mandate, which would subject larger employers to tax penalties if they do not offer insurance coverage to employees who work at least 30 hours a week, on average. But many public employers have already adopted policies, laws or regulations to make sure workers stay under that threshold.Even after the administration said this month that it would ease coverage requirements for larger employers, public employers generally said they were keeping the restrictions on work hours because their obligation to provide health insurance, starting in 2015, would be based on hours worked by employees this year. Among those whose hours have been restricted in recent months are police dispatchers, prison guards, substitute teachers, bus drivers, athletic coaches, school custodians, cafeteria workers and part-time professors.Mark D. Benigni, the superintendent of schools in Meriden, Conn., and a board member of the American Association of School Administrators, said in an interview that the new health care law was having \u201cunintended consequences for school systems across the nation.\u201dIn Connecticut, as in many states, significant numbers of part-time school employees work more than 30 hours a week and do not receive health benefits. \u201cAre we supposed to lay off full-time teachers so that we can provide insurance coverage to part-time employees?\u201d Mr. Benigni asked. \u201cIf I had to cut five reading teachers to pay for benefits for substitute teachers, I\u2019m not sure that would be best for our students.\u201dIn Medina, Ohio, about 30 miles south of Cleveland, Mayor Dennis Hanwell said the city had lowered the limit for part-time employees to 29 hours a week, from 35. Workers\u2019 wages were reduced accordingly, he said.\u201cOur choice was to cut the hours or give them health care, and we could not afford the latter,\u201d Mr. Hanwell, a Republican, said. The city\u2019s 120 part-time employees include office clerks, sanitation workers, park inspectors and police dispatchers.Mr. Hanwell said that new rules issued by the Internal Revenue Service this month did not address the city\u2019s fundamental concerns about the cost of providing health insurance.Lawrence County, in western Pennsylvania, reduced the limit for part-time employees to 28 hours a week, from 32. Dan Vogler, the Republican chairman of the county Board of Commissioners, said the cuts affected prison guards and emergency service personnel at the county\u2019s 911 call center.In Virginia, part-time state employees are generally not allowed to work more than 29 hours a week on average over a 12-month period. Thousands of part-time state employees had been working more than that, according to the state personnel agency.Virginia officials said they could not extend coverage to part-time wage workers because of the expense. Health benefits cost the state an average of more than $11,000 a year per employee.For months, Obama administration officials have played down reports that employers were limiting workers\u2019 hours. But in a report this month, the Congressional Budget Office said the Affordable Care Act could lead to a reduction in the number of hours worked, relative to what would otherwise occur.Jason Furman, the chairman of the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, reaffirmed the White House view that the law was \u201cgood for wages and incomes and for the economy over all.\u201dSince Mr. Obama signed the health law in March 2010, the private sector has added more than eight million jobs. But in the public sector, the picture is different.Government employment at the federal, state and local levels is lower today than in March 2010, by a total of 698,000 jobs, the Labor Department says. And in a recent survey, the National Association of State Budget Officers found that \u201cstates plan to reduce the number of full-time employees again\u201d this year.It is not entirely clear how private employers will respond, but as some government officials point out, businesses at least have the option of passing along some of the additional costs to consumers.In Indiana, Daniel T. Tanoos, the schools superintendent for Vigo County, which includes Terre Haute, said, \u201cThe school system has no way to increase prices as a private business can.\u201dTo hold down the work hours of school bus drivers, Vigo County has reduced field trips for children and cut back transportation to athletic events. School employees who had two part-time jobs totaling more than 30 hours a week \u2014 for example, bus driver and basketball coach \u2014 were required to give up one of the jobs.The Obama administration says \u201cthere is absolutely no evidence\u201d of any job loss related to the Affordable Care Act. And the Congressional Budget Office says \u201cthere is no compelling evidence that part-time employment has increased\u201d as a result of the law.But economists tend to focus on the private sector, which employs more people and has been adding jobs, unlike the public sector.Republicans in Congress like Representatives Tim Griffin of Arkansas, Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania and Todd Young of Indiana said they knew of public employers in their states that had restricted the hours of part-time employees.Authors of the health care law wanted more people to have insurance, Mr. Griffin said, but he asked: \u201cWhat did they get? No insurance and less pay. Genius! That\u2019s a genius federal program right there.\u201dCommunity colleges depend heavily on part-time faculty members, who teach about 45 percent of all courses, according to the American Association of Community Colleges. The association praised the new rules, saying they would allow many community colleges to avoid the expense of providing health benefits to part-time faculty members.However, the denial of benefits irks some instructors.William J. Lipkin, an adjunct professor of American history and political science at Union County College in Cranford, N.J., said: \u201cThe Affordable Care Act, rather than making health care affordable for adjunct faculty members, is making it more unaffordable. Colleges are not giving us access to health care, and our hours are being cut, which means our income is being cut. We are losing on both ends.\u201dThe American Federation of Teachers lists on its website three dozen public colleges and universities in 15 states that it says have restricted the work assignments of adjunct or part-time faculty members to avoid the cost of providing health insurance.The University of Akron, in Ohio, has cut back the hours of 400 part-time faculty members who were teaching more than 29 hours a week, said Eileen Korey, a spokeswoman for the school.\u201cWe have more than 1,000 part-time faculty,\u201d Ms. Korey said. \u201cFour hundred would have qualified for health insurance. That would add costs that we cannot afford.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuba\u2019s Reward for the Dutiful: Gated Housing", "Date": "2014-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAVANA \u2014 In the splendid neighborhoods of this dilapidated city, old mansions are being upgraded with imported tile. Businessmen go out for sushi and drive home in plush Audis. Now, hoping to keep up, the government is erecting something special for its own: a housing development called Project Granma, featuring hundreds of comfortable apartments in a gated complex set to have its own movie theater and schools.\u201cTwenty years ago, what we earned was a good salary,\u201d said Roberto Rodr\u00edguez, 51, a longtime Interior Ministry official among the first to move in. \u201cBut the world has changed.\u201dCuba is in transition. The economic overhauls of the past few years have rattled the established order of class and status, enabling Cubans with small businesses or access to foreign capital to rise above many dutiful Communists. As these new paths to prestige expand, challenging the old system of rewards for obedience, President Ra\u00fal Castro is redoubling efforts to elevate the faithful and maintain their loyalty \u2014 now and after the Castros are gone.Project Granma and similar \u201cmilitary cities\u201d around the country are Caribbean-color edifices of reassurance, set aside for the most ardent defenders of Cuba\u2019s 1959 revolution: families tied to the military and the Interior Ministry. With their balconies, air-conditioning and fresh paint, the new apartments are the government\u2019s most public gifts to its middle ranks and a clear sign of Cuba\u2019s new hybrid economy, in which the state must sometimes compete with private enterprise.The housing is just one example of the military\u2019s expansive role in Mr. Castro\u2019s plan for Cuba, and it illustrates a central conflict in his attempts to open up the economy without dismantling the power structure he and his comrades have been building for more than five decades.In the short term, analysts and former officers say, he is relying on the military to push through changes and maintain stability as he experiments with economic liberalization. Yet his abiding dedication as a lifelong soldier who was defense minister for 49 years threatens to further entrench an institution that has often undermined changes challenging its favored status.\u201cRa\u00fal knows the military answer is not the answer, but he also knows that at this time he absolutely needs military loyalty,\u201d said Hal Klepak, a Canadian scholar who closely tracks the Cuban military. \u201cThey are the only ones who will follow him if the reform succeeds, or if it fails.\u201dMr. Castro and his brother, Fidel, given their guerrilla history, have always turned to the military in times of need. In the 1960s and early \u201870s, as Cuba\u2019s professional class fled, officers in fatigues ran government ministries and nationalized industries. Since the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the armed forces have been slashed to around 55,000, from a peak of more than 200,000, but they have also been pushed further into the Cuban economy.The military\u2019s interests bestow the privileges of business on a chosen few, especially senior military officials. \u201cThey live better than almost anyone in Cuba,\u201d said Brian Latell, a former C.I.A. officer who worked in Cuba.But in the lower and middle ranks, experts say, esteem and relative wealth have eroded. Career officers in Cuba are now more likely to have friends or relatives who live abroad, or who visit Miami and often return with iPhones or new clothes unavailable at the state\u2019s musty stores.Meanwhile, military members must report all remittances they receive, and they are not allowed any \u201cunauthorized contact\u201d with foreigners or Cubans living abroad \u2014 limiting access to the money that other Cubans use not just for purchases, but also to improve their homes and open small businesses.At its edge, there is a baseball field. Inside the gates, streetlamps resembling classic gaslights line the sidewalks, while cars, another perk, fill lots.At a building with rounded archways, where a movie theater, market and health clinic are meant to go, one of the project\u2019s engineers said several thousand people would eventually call Granma home. Sweating in green army fatigues, he praised the plan, noting its imported, prefabricated design that allowed walls to be assembled quickly, like puzzle pieces. He failed to mention what a security guard had pointed out: Most of the workers painting were prison inmates.Several residents said they were thrilled to live in what Mario Coyula, Havana\u2019s former director of urbanism and architecture, called \u201cthe first gated community in Cuba since the 1950s.\u201d Some said they had been living in cramped quarters with generations of family.Support for Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s economic changes seemed strong here among those willing to talk. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary,\u201d Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, the official among the first to arrive at Granma, said as he sat outside with a cigarette. \u201cIf you\u2019re cold, you put on a coat; it\u2019s just what makes sense.\u201dBut in the push and pull that has defined Cuba\u2019s economic policies over the last two years, the government has often struggled with when to let the market function and when to protect the Communist establishment. The authorities, for example, recently cracked down on private vendors selling clothes and other items, widely seen as an effort to help the state\u2019s own retail network.Mr. D\u00e1maso, who spent 32 years in the military, said that the country\u2019s leaders, while longing for economic improvement, mainly want to preserve the Cuba they know.\u201cIf you have a business run by military officers, when there\u2019s a transition, you\u2019re not going to get rid of all these people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a way to maintain a space for established powers in a future Cuban society.\u201dAn article on Feb. 12 about a decision by Cuba to build gated housing developments for members of the armed forces and others most loyal to the Castro government after realizing they were falling behind in the country\u2019s new hybrid economy misstated the given name of a retired colonel who writes a blog often critical of the government. He is Fernando D\u00e1maso, not Jorge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egypt\u2019s Despair, and Its Hope", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 Last month, on the third anniversary of the revolution of Jan. 25 that led to the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak, millions of Egyptians came out onto the streets carrying Egyptian flags and pictures of Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, the army leader whom they considered their hero for siding with the will of the people and overthrowing the Muslim Brotherhood government in June. At the same time, supporters of the Brotherhood\u2019s deposed president, Mohamed Morsi, continued their confrontations with the police, which resulted in 49 deaths and scores of injuries. There was a third position taken by some of the young revolutionaries who played a role in ending Brotherhood rule last year, but were terrified at the prospect of the return of the police state they had opposed when Mr. Mubarak was in power. Two such people are Khaled el-Sayed, 30, and Nagy Kamel, 27, both engineers, who helped organize a demonstration against both a return of the Brotherhood and the Mubarak-style regime. The demonstration had hardly started before it was set upon by the police, reportedly using tear gas and live ammunition, causing the demonstrators to flee for their lives. After the protesters were dispersed, Mr. Sayed and Mr. Kamel went for lunch in the city center, where they were picked up and placed under arrest by the secret police, who charged them with possession of bombs for use in terrorist attacks. Prosecutors ordered both men to be held in custody for 15 days, pending investigation. What happened to these two men is just one episode in a long series that has targeted young revolutionaries. Some have been sentenced to three years in prison just for organizing a peaceful demonstration without prior authorization.These sentences are based on the law on demonstrations issued by the transitional government on Nov. 24, which has been widely criticized and has led several human rights organizations to issue a joint statement of protest. The statement noted that the law had been promulgated by an unelected government with no legislative authority, that it put unreasonable strictures on the right to peaceful assembly, and that it empowered the police to use lethal firepower.Such oppressive measures previously met with stiff resistance, but now they are used on a daily basis and few Egyptians raise much of a voice in protest. This change of stance has a number of explanations. First, since Mr. Morsi was deposed, terrorists have been carrying out armed attacks and car bombings against the army, the police and churches, causing hundreds of fatalities among both military personnel and civilians; this campaign has led most Egyptians to give their support to the state in its fight against terrorism and to turn a blind eye to excesses committed by the security apparatus.Second, the standard of living in Egypt three years after the revolution has deteriorated to the point where it is worse now than it was under Mr. Mubarak. Many Egyptians long for the reimposition of security and an improvement in the economy at any price. The third reason is a systematic media campaign carried out by state television and the private channels owned by businessmen who used to back the Mubarak regime. This public relations effort aims to convey the notion that the January 2011 revolution was a plot by American intelligence agencies to remove Mr. Mubarak. It accuses the young revolutionaries of being traitors and paid agents of the West.The campaign to discredit the activists has not provided any conclusive evidence, but it has had the effect of reducing their popularity to the extent that some well-known dissidents have been attacked by ordinary citizens. Last month, when a prominent activist, Esraa Abdel Fattah, went to vote in the referendum on the new constitution, she was surrounded by women who forcibly ejected her from the voting station to shouts of \u201cenemy agent\u201d and \u201ctraitor.\u201d This is a tragic turn of events. Those young revolutionaries stood up to the giant machine of oppression that was the Mubarak regime; they resisted the previous military council and rose up against the tyranny of the Muslim Brotherhood. They carried aloft the corpses of their comrades, shot by the police. They sacrificed so much to restore freedom and dignity for precisely those Egyptians who now accuse them of being traitors. A few days ago, someone posted a comment on Facebook that went viral:\u201cFellow revolutionaries, we have been through the three most beautiful and difficult years of our life. We have tried to realize the dream but we now know that it has become impossible. Yet we keep on stating that it was a real dream, no matter how much they try to falsify history. None of us who have lived that dream will ever forget, or regret it, for a moment. As for those who have died in the service of the revolution, we say to you and your families that we apologize because we are not worthy of your sacrifices.\u201dThe poster\u2019s words clearly reflect the despair of this generation, a disillusionment that led many to abstain from voting in the constitutional referendum, which was approved by 98 percent of those who turned out. Commenting on the abstentions, observers have noted that it has made the transitional government uneasy: Egypt\u2019s prime minister has convened more than one meeting with representatives of the young revolutionaries. It has also led General Sisi to issue a statement confirming that there can be no return to the status quo that existed before Jan. 25.Is the Egyptian revolution over, as the frustrated young Facebook poster declared? The answer is provided by recent official statistics that show that the country\u2019s population has already reached 85 million, 60 percent of whom are under 29. It is these young people \u2014 the majority of the population \u2014 who made the revolution. It is they who, in the end, will win out, because they alone are the future. Advertisement"}

Housing starts dropped 16 percent in January, the biggest decline in almost three years, and home resales slid to a year-and-a-half-year low last month.Bitter cold and snowstorms this winter have been blamed in part for the weakness in the housing sector, though analysts say higher mortgage rates and low inventories have hurt as well.A Reuters poll showed that home price inflation, as measured by the Case-Shiller index, was expected to slow to less than 7 percent this year as mortgage rates rise and as a gradual transition from a market driven by institutional buyers looking for bargains takes place.The consumer sentiment survey on Tuesday suggested that Americans were wary of future economic conditions.Consumer confidence slipped in February, according to the private sector report by the Conference Board, an industry group. The board said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 78.1 from 79.4 in January, a downward revision. \u201cWhile expectations have fluctuated over recent months, current conditions have continued to trend upward,\u201d Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement.

{"Headline": "The Olympics: A Costly Feel-Good Moment", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven before the Olympic torch reached Sochi on Wednesday \u2014 after a 39,000-mile journey, the longest in the history of the Games \u2014 another Olympic record had already been shattered: the cost of the Games.The 2014 Winter Games, which open in the Russian city on Friday, will be the most expensive Olympics of all time. The estimated price tag is more than $50 billion, or approximately $510 million for each event.Hosting the Games is never cheap, but the bill keeps climbing as cities try to outbid one another for a chance to throw an Olympic-size party. To put Sochi in context, consider that in 1984, the Summer Games in Los Angeles cost about $546 million, or $1.2 billion in today\u2019s dollars.The Games are often billed as a boon for the host, a two-week bonanza of tourism and valuable television time. But do host countries really benefit economically?It depends \u2014 but don\u2019t count on it. Only a handful of Games (for instance, Los Angeles, in 1984; Barcelona, in 1992; and Atlanta, in 1996) have ended up in the black. And if you count all of the costs related to the Games, it is doubtful the Olympics ever turn out to be a major economic success, said Victor Matheson, who has studied the economics of big events like the Olympics and the World Cup.While tourism during the Olympics may help offset the expense for some cities, a spike in arrivals is not guaranteed. Beijing actually saw a drop in hotel bookings during its Summer Games in 2008. In pure economic terms, the best hope for Russia is that Sochi\u2019s new sports venues, roads and hotels will turn the city into a tourist destination.\u201cOne of the things you\u2019re always hoping is that you\u2019ll have some long-term impact,\u201d said Mr. Matheson, a professor of economics at the College of the Holy Cross. \u201cAnd there had better be some sort of legacy, because if you\u2019re going to spend $50 billion on the Olympics, like Russia, there\u2019s no way you can possibly get that back in the two weeks that they are going on.\u201dSo why host? The simplest answer may be this: It makes people feel good.\u201cThe Olympics may not make us rich,\u201d Mr. Matheson said, \u201cbut they make us happy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Obamacare Could Unlock Job Opportunities", "Date": "2014-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyDuring college, Lauren Braun worked at a health clinic in Peru, where she spent an inordinate amount of time tracking down mothers in an effort to get them to bring their children in for vaccinations. The experience was frustrating, but through it Braun came up with a business plan: Make silicone bracelets that function as punch cards, to remind mothers about upcoming appointments. Back in the United States, she consulted with mentors and perfected the idea, but then, she set it aside after graduation, going to work for a large health-insurance company, taking a salary and benefits over the uncertain life of an entrepreneur.A year and a half later, she got word that her bracelet company, Alma Sana, might have a life after all: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation had awarded her $100,000 to test the idea. Braun was O.K. with the 60 percent pay cut she would take by quitting her day job. But she did not want to lose her health insurance.Were it not for Obamacare, Braun, 25, would be confronting a phenomenon that economists call \u201cjob lock\u201d: when people stay in jobs they dislike, or don\u2019t want, solely to keep their health coverage. A Harvard Business School study in 2008 estimated that 11 million workers are affected by this dilemma. Other studies show that when people don\u2019t have to worry about health insurance, they are up to 25 percent more likely to change jobs. Obamacare was designed, in part, to fix this inefficiency in the labor market, and thanks to that association, job lock has become a political lightning rod.In a sense, Obamacare amounts to a massive transfer of risk. Under the old system, if you quit your job and couldn\u2019t get health insurance, you courted financial ruin every time you did something as mundane as riding your bike or playing pickup basketball. Now that risk is distributed to everyone who buys health insurance (including the government). Free of the massive financial risk of being alive, unemployed Americans can more easily take on risks associated with doing what they want to do.Though this is a good thing for people like Braun, it doesn\u2019t look good for the labor force as a whole \u2014 at least on the surface. In February, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Affordable Care Act would reduce employment by the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time jobs. Opponents seized on this as evidence that Obamacare is a job killer. But that\u2019s not what the C.B.O. meant. \u201cThe estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businesses\u2019 demand for labor,\u201d the report says. In other words, if people work less, it will be by choice.It may seem counterintuitive, but from an economics perspective, this is a good thing, because it encourages the labor force to allocate itself more efficiently. Older workers will finally be able to retire, leaving openings for younger workers. People will switch to jobs that better suit their talents. Parents will be able to spend more time with their families. Such changes don\u2019t always make people wealthier, but they make people happier.\u201cThis is allowing people to not have to stay in overworked, dead-end jobs that are probably making them sicker, any longer than they need to,\u201d says John de Graaf, executive director of Take Back Your Time, an organization dedicated to reducing overwork. De Graaf says that people who work long hours with little control over their schedules are more likely to suffer ill health effects like heart disease. So increasing their choices, he says, \u201cmay save more money on health than the act itself.\u201dThe health care law does contain some perverse incentives, which might make some people less productive. Low-income workers, who stand to lose their insurance subsidies if they earn too much, might drop out of full-time jobs.Conservative critics of Obamacare have latched onto this, and have been quick to mock the very notion that workers are \u201clocked\u201d to their jobs. \u201cYou\u2019re not being fired,\u201d tweeted David Burge, the conservative blogger and humorist. \u201cYou\u2019re just being freed from the job lock that keeps you from stardom in interpretive dance.\u201dBut in reality, many Republicans have long talked about the need to liberate workers from job lock, and conservative arguments against the Affordable Care Act willfully ignore the fact that giving workers more freedom benefits a favorite constituency: Would-be entrepreneurs. These future innovators might just be chained to their corporate gigs, unable to boost the economy with small-business hiring. Access to health insurance outside of work should enable them to take the leap.James Bailey, a graduate student in economics at Temple University, came up with a clever way to test that theory: he looked at what happened to 19- to 25-year-olds when the Affordable Care Act made it possible for them to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance plans, beginning in 2010. Those who got the coverage, he found, were two to three times more likely to go into business for themselves. And that increase was largely driven by women, who are generally more risk-averse than men.Still, having the government equalize risk cuts both ways. With Alma Sana\u2019s initial feasibility study complete, Lauren Braun is currently spending a few months in Germany, where the safety net is robust. Entrepreneurs there tell her they are envious of Americans. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot fewer investors here,\u201d Braun says. In part, that\u2019s because there\u2019s less wealth, fewer millionaires and fewer angel investors (or, in the case of her benefactor, the Gates Foundation, people with so much money they just give it away).Our economy needs risk-takers in order to grow. That\u2019s why the government creates programs to mitigate risk. For example, insuring student loans softens the risk of investing in an education. The bankruptcy system lessens the risk of starting a business.When Braun got the grant to start Alma Sana, the Gates Foundation\u2019s generosity might have been pointless had it not been possible for her to go on her parents\u2019 health plan. Without that, she says: \u201cI would have had to have gotten a different full-time job in addition to doing this, and that would have been really challenging. I\u2019ve worked 12 hours a day from the beginning of this grant period.\u201d Meanwhile, the bracelets, which cost just pennies to make, could save thousands of lives and millions of dollars in wasted vaccines \u2014 or her startup might fail entirely. That\u2019s a gamble Braun chose to take.Deep Thoughts: 1. Being uninsured is very financially\nrisky. 2. Which keeps people \u2018\u2018locked\u2019\u2019 to\ntheir jobs. 3. Preventing them\nfrom becoming the next Steve Jobs. 4. Or\npursuing their love of postmodern dance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kerry Implores Indonesia on Climate Change Peril", "Date": "2014-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Secretary of State John Kerry urged Indonesia on Sunday to take steps to combat climate change, warning that failure to act would jeopardize the nation\u2019s resources and damage its economy.Warming seas, he said, could deal a severe blow to Indonesia\u2019s fishing industry, while powerful storms could buffet the country and rising seas may put much of Jakarta, the capital, under water.Mr. Kerry, who has long been outspoken concerning climate change, hopes to make it a signature issue of his tenure as secretary of state. He aims, in particular, to be the lead broker of a 2015 United Nations treaty committing the world\u2019s economies to significant cuts in carbon emissions and sweeping changes in the global energy economy.The deliberations over climate change, however, have long been marked by disputes over which nations should bear major responsibility for limiting greenhouse gas emissions.China, India and other developing Asian economies have resisted American urging to commit to reductions in their own carbon emissions, arguing that the United States, the world\u2019s largest economy, should shoulder most of the economic burden.Mr. Kerry has said, however, that action by the United States alone will not slow global warming significantly unless other large economies commit to carbon cuts, as well.China recently surpassed the United States as the world\u2019s largest emitter of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and emissions across Asia are projected to surge in the coming decades as millions more people in the developing economies there begin to drive automobiles and gain access to electric power.Indonesia is in third place, after China and the United States. The chief source of the country\u2019s emissions is deforestation, but as its growing population depends increasingly on cheap electricity from coal-fired power plants, the country\u2019s emissions are expected to grow rapidly in coming decades.Mr. Kerry\u2019s speech was delivered at a cultural center in Jakarta sponsored by the American Embassy, and was transmitted to similar centers on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. It was one in a series of addresses in which the secretary of state will try to convince developing nations that they have an economic stake in addressing the problem.Mr. Kerry did not say what specific steps Indonesia should take. But he cast the problem in near-apocalyptic terms, describing climate change as \u201cperhaps the world\u2019s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.\u201dWarmer and more acidic seawater could reduce Indonesian fish catches by 40 percent, he said, while a three-foot rise in the sea level would be \u201cenough to put half of Jakarta under water.\u201d He cited a World Bank report warning of $1 trillion a year in flood-related economic losses by 2050 unless major efforts are made to improve Asian ports.Mr. Kerry said the scientific debate over climate change was settled, with 97 percent of scientists saying the problem is real.Combating climate change was also a main agenda item during Mr. Kerry\u2019s visit to Beijing on Friday and Saturday.After Chinese and American officials met there, the Americans announced agreement on joint initiatives to reduce emissions from heavy-duty vehicles, to promote improved technology for power grids and carbon capture, to collect and manage greenhouse gas data and to make buildings more energy efficient. A senior State Department official said the statement was noteworthy because it had been agreed on by \u201cthe two biggest emitters.\u201dIndonesia is the third stop on Mr. Kerry\u2019s diplomatic swing through Asia. His planned meeting with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, scheduled for Monday, was canceled before Mr. Kerry arrived Saturday night, a senior State Department official said, because the Indonesia leader was focusing on coordinating assistance efforts after the deadly eruption of a volcano.Michael R. Gordon reported from Jakarta, Indonesia, and Coral Davenport from Washington.Advertisement"}

Sales of locally made vehicles have suffered in recent years as a stronger Australian dollar makes imported cars more competitive.In contrast, global automakers have been building new factories and increasing capacity in countries like Indonesia that have growing middle classes and lower costs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Post Office Banks on the Poor", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorATHENS, Ga. \u2014 PEOPLE like to complain about banks popping up like Starbucks on every corner these days. But in poor neighborhoods, the phenomenon is quite the opposite: Over the past couple of decades, the banks have pulled out. Approximately 88 million people in the United States, or 28 percent of the population, have no bank account at all, or do have a bank account, but primarily rely on check-cashing storefronts, payday lenders, title lenders, or even pawnshops to meet their financial needs. And these lenders charge much more for their services than traditional banks. The average annual income for an \u201cunbanked\u201d family is $25,500, and about 10 percent of that income, or $2,412, goes to fees and interest for gaining access to credit or other financial services.But a possible solution has appeared, in the unlikely guise of the United States Postal Service. The unwieldy institution, which has essentially been self-funded since 1971, and has maxed out its $15 billion line of credit from the federal government, is in financial straits itself. But what it does have is infrastructure, with a post office in most ZIP codes, and a relationship with residents in every kind of neighborhood, from richest to poorest. The U.S.P.S. \u2014 which already handles money orders for customers \u2014 envisions offering reloadable prepaid debit cards, mobile transactions, domestic and international money transfers, a Bitcoin exchange, and most significantly, small loans. It could offer credit at lower rates than fringe lenders do by taking advantage of economies of scale. Many will oppose the idea of a governmental agency providing financial services. Camden R. Fine, chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers of America, has already called the post office proposal\u00a0\u201cthe worst idea since the Ford Edsel.\u201d But the federal government already provides interest-free \u201cfinancial services\u201d to the largest banks (not to mention the recent bailout funds). And this is done under an implicit social contract: The state supports and insures the banking system, and in return, banks are to provide the general population with access to credit, loans and savings. But in reality, too many are left out. It wasn\u2019t always this way. In 1910, President William Howard Taft established the government-backed postal savings system for recent immigrants and the poor. It lasted until 1967. The government also supported and insured credit unions and savings-and-loans specifically created to provide credit to low-income earners. But by the 1990s, there were essentially two forms of banking: regulated and insured mainstream banks to serve the needs of the wealthy and middle class, and a Wild West of unregulated payday lenders and check-cashing joints that answer the needs of the poor \u2014 at a price. People need credit to increase their financial prospects \u2014 that\u2019s the theory behind government backing of student loans and mortgages. The Latin root of the word \u201ccredit\u201d is credere \u2014 to believe. But belief is something that mainstream lenders lack when it comes to assessing the creditworthiness of the poor. And yet establishing credit not only allows individual families and communities to grow wealth, but also allows our economy to do so. Everyone benefits.There is, of course, a certain irony in the post office, cash-strapped and maxed out on credit, looking to elbow in on the business of check-cashing and payday-loan storefronts. And while the U.S.P.S. white paper stresses that its own offerings, rates and fees would be \u201cmore affordable,\u201d a note of alarm is raised when it highlights the potential bonanza that providing financial services to the financially underserved could yield, stating that the result could be \u201cmajor new revenue for the Postal Service\u201d estimated at $8.9 billion a year. It\u2019s a plan that could indeed save the post office, which last year recorded a $1 billion operating loss.In this potential transaction between an institution and a population that are both in need, it would be wise to look back a century ago, at the last time a similar experiment was conducted. In 1913, the chief post office inspector, Carter Keene, declared that the postal savings system was not meant to yield a profit: \u201cIts aim is infinitely higher and more important. Its mission is to encourage thrift and economy among all classes of citizens.\u201d Any benefit to the post office\u2019s bottom line should not come at the expense of those who can least afford it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Solar Industry Jump-Starts a Revival in California", "Date": "2014-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Back in 2009, when Danny Kennedy was looking for office space for the fast-growing solar services company he had co-founded, his venture capital investors recommended setting up shop in one of the \u201cTwitterville kinds of areas\u201d south of Market Street in San Francisco.There, social media and peer-to-peer pioneers like Foursquare, Yelp, Airbnb and, indeed, Twitter had created a technology zone where innovative ideas could fly free and cross-pollinate among young workers meeting casually over food and drink.\u201cThe whole point of the SfunCube is to bring in a whole bunch of solar companies, populate the whole square with a bunch of solar professionals and turn it into, like, a solar campus,\u201d he said.\u201cIf we succeed in our task,\u201d he added, \u201cwe\u2019ll have thousands of solar industry workers here \u2014 they\u2019ll want to walk to work or cycle. They\u2019ll become the population that helps make that happen. The whole thing will be this nice, synergistic sort of lift-all-boats kind of deal.\u201dThe effects of a growing solar cluster on Jack London Square are already visible in the crowds of workers grabbing a bite at restaurants like Bocanova, a beer at the sharply slope-floored Heinold\u2019s First and Last Chance, or a Gibraltar at the Blue Bottle coffee roasters up the street. But those developments are merely ancillary to a broader vision, Mr. Kennedy said.The real aim is to create a place that inspires the kinds of \u201ccreative collisions\u201d that allow for further innovation to speed adoption of solar energy, mainly by bringing its cost down. Companies that are offered space in the SfunCube must agree to pursue that goal, whether by developing more efficient technologies, say, or coming up with new ways of financing projects.Finding cheaper ways to finance, permit and install solar energy systems is \u201cjust as important as technology \u2014 arguably now even more important,\u201d said David Hochschild, the California energy commissioner in charge of environmental protection. \u201cThe entire Bay Area-Silicon Valley space has actually served as a larger campus for this kind of innovation. But doing it on a single site like this is actually pretty unique.\u201dDespite decades of city-sponsored redevelopment efforts that have come in fits and starts, Oakland has yet to emerge from the long shadow of its neighbor to the west, San Francisco, much like Brooklyn\u2019s former relationship to Manhattan, a comparison those redeveloping the East Bay are quick to make.Even so, Oakland has a base of high-tech and green energy companies, including the solar thermal company BrightSource and the commercial installer Borrego Solar Systems. The sector has been developing over many years, said Steve Lautze, who oversees green business development for Oakland, originally anchored by recycling companies attracted by the city\u2019s position as a portal to the Pacific for Northern California.Oakland development officials are now focused on maximizing what Mr. Kennedy has started at Jack London Square, said Kelley Kahn, the city\u2019s economic and work force development director, who helped oversee the transformation of Mission Bay in San Francisco into a biotech center.\u201cOakland even offers a lot more in terms of an urban experience than what we were building in Mission Bay,\u201d she said, adding that there was potential to create a new sector in Oakland\u2019s economy. Officials are trying to figure out \u201chow, across the board, can we really capture a bigger piece of this innovation economy.\u201dOfficials with the city and executives at the SfunCube \u2014 perhaps mindful of criticisms that gentrification has made real estate in parts of New York\u2019s Brooklyn more expensive than Manhattan \u2014 say they are trying to ensure that Oakland residents have access to whatever benefits come from the growth.Toward that end, Ms. Kahn said, they are working to support or promote organizations like Hack the Hood and others that are dedicated to high-tech training and education programs, while the SfunCube has an outpost of the California Center for Sustainable Energy, which runs jobs and youth education programs as well.Mr. Kennedy, along with his Sungevity co-founders Andrew Birch, the chief executive, and Alec Guettel, a company director, began developing the incubator at something he calls the Solar Dojo, a collection of start-ups in Berkeley that included Mosaic, the crowdfunding platform. After moving operations to Jack London Square, he co-founded the program with Emily Kirsch, who had been pressing him to do so. As chief executive of the SfunCube, she now oversees a handful of companies that share its values, as she put it. They are offered space for nine months and encouraged to get their products out to market quickly.\u201cIf it\u2019s going to fail, we want to know as soon as possible \u2014 and they probably do, too, even if it\u2019s their baby,\u201d she said.\u201cWhen you\u2019re an entrepreneur, there\u2019s a period that you go through, which is like, \u2018Wow, there\u2019s another mountain to climb,\u2019 and it\u2019s really helpful to have this environment that you can just show up in,\u201d Mr. Hornor said. \u201cKnowing that other people around you are in the same boat \u2014 that\u2019s morale-boosting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Obama administration later said it had placed 20 top Ukrainian officials on a visa blacklist.European diplomats and senior officials in Brussels began working on the logistics of imposing sanctions, in preparation for an emergency meeting of European Union foreign ministers called for Thursday.They also announced that the French, German and Polish foreign ministers would visit Kiev beforehand, to meet with members of the government and the opposition.President Obama warned the Ukrainian military to stay out of the crisis. \u201cWe have been watching very carefully and we expect the Ukrainian government to show restraint, to not resort to violence in dealing with peaceful protesters,\u201d Mr. Obama said during a one-day visit to Mexico to meet with Mexican and Canadian counterparts. \u201cThere will be consequences if people step over the line.\u201dIn Washington, the State Department said it had imposed a visa ban on 20 senior Ukrainian officials, whom it accused of playing a role in the government\u2019s crackdown. The State Department declined to say which officials were on the blacklist, which prevents them from traveling to the United States, but a senior State Department official said, \u201cthe list today includes the full chain of command responsible for ordering the violence last night.\u201dThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that if the violence continued, the United States, working with the European Union, would impose sanctions against Ukrainian officials \u201cin a much broader and deeper way.\u201dWhile this official said there were no signs of military involvement in the crackdown on Tuesday night, American officials were closely monitoring a \u201cchanging of the guard\u201d at military barracks on Wednesday, saying it raised concerns that troops could be yet mobilized.Earlier Wednesday Secretary of State John Kerry, who was visiting Paris for meetings on the Middle East, had also warned that the United States might join a European sanctions response to the Ukraine crisis. \u201cWe are talking about the possibility of sanctions or other steps with our friends in Europe and elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Kerry said in a joint appearance in Paris with the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius.President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, speaking at a joint news conference with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany after a regularly scheduled meeting in Paris, said, \u201cThere are unspeakable, unacceptable, intolerable acts being carried out in Ukraine.\u201dMs. Merkel, condemning the \u201cshocking pictures which are reaching us from Ukraine,\u201d made plain that sanctions would be applied against those responsible for the violence. E.U. foreign ministers have only to decide \u201cwhich specific sanctions should be applied,\u201d she said.\u201cBut sanctions alone are not enough,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have to get the political process going again,\u201d including both government and opposition representatives.She added that the French and German foreign ministers and top officials were using every available channel, including to Russia, to defuse the crisis.Mr. Kerry said the purpose of his warning to Ukraine was to \u201ccreate the environment for compromise,\u201d and that United States did not think it was too late for Ukraine\u2019s president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, to negotiate with the opposition.\u201cPresident Yanukovych has the opportunity to make a choice,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cOur desire is for Mr. Yanukovych to bring people together, dialogue with the opposition, find the measure of compromise and put the broad interests of the people of Ukraine out front.\u201dObama administration officials have said in recent weeks that the United States was prepared to move ahead with sanctions if Mr. Yanukovych cracked down on the opposition. American officials signaled on Wednesday morning that sanctions were under consideration.Poland\u2019s foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, said in a telephone interview en route to Kiev that \u201cwe will impose some sanctions tomorrow in Brussels.\u201dBut Mr. Sikorski said it was unclear whether sanctions would be imposed on Mr. Yanukovych himself. \u201cAfter all, he\u2019s still the democratically elected president, large numbers voted for him and he still controls the situation, though he\u2019s made a complete mess of it,\u201d Mr. Sikorski said.Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland said earlier that he would make the case for immediate measures against those who provoked the escalation that has left dozens dead and hundreds wounded.\u201cWe Poles will not remain indifferent to these events, because we know that the developments in Ukraine will decide the history and the future of the whole region, and thus also influences the future and the security of Poland,\u201d said Mr. Tusk, who held an emergency cabinet meeting late Tuesday as events unfurled in Kiev.The imposition of so-called smart sanctions is a standard foreign policy reflex of the European Union when confronted by acts of violence. Over the years, officials have honed a system for identifying individuals deemed responsible for repression, usually imposing a travel ban preventing visits to the 28-nation European Union and often freezing bank accounts.Experts debate their effectiveness when applied to countries like Zimbabwe, but their likely use in this case underlines the extent to which the bloc\u2019s efforts to use its influence in its own neighborhood have faltered.Nevertheless, they appear highly likely to be introduced, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the 28-nation bloc, having also said he expects targeted measures against those responsible for violence.Elmar Brok, chairman of the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Foreign Affairs, called for sanctions against specific individuals responsible for the violence. \u201cThis is not the time for news releases,\u201d he told a news conference in Brussels. \u201cWe don\u2019t call for sanctions against Ukraine but against certain responsible people.\u201dMr. Brok suggested a travel ban on leadership figures and measures to investigate the bank accounts held by individuals in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Britain.He was speaking alongside Ruslana Lyzhychko, a Ukrainian pop singer and protest leader, who said she would go on hunger strike if such sanctions were not introduced.If officials and diplomats decided on Wednesday and Thursday to go ahead with sanctions against individuals, they would be agreed formally by European foreign ministers at their emergency meeting Thursday. Any list of those targeted would normally be made public only when published in the European Union\u2019s Official Journal, which puts sanctions into legal effect. The earliest that is likely would be Friday. The system is designed to avoid giving warning to those whose bank accounts are about to be frozen.The German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, also issued a warning to the Ukrainian government. \u201cWhoever is responsible for the decisions which have led to the bloodshed in Kiev and other parts of Ukraine should expect Europe to reconsider its position on imposing sanctions on individuals,\u201d Mr. Steinmeier said in a statement, as lethal mayhem engulfed the center of Kiev Tuesday night.Hours earlier, Mr. Steinmeier telephoned his Ukrainian counterpart, Leonid Kozhara, urging an end to violence. The clashes in Kiev erupted only hours after Mr. Steinmeier, who has repeatedly and bluntly urged the Ukrainian authorities to fulfill their promises to the opposition, had received the two main opposition leaders, Vitali Klitschko and Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, in Berlin, where they also met Ms. Merkel for more than an hour. As those meetings were held, Russia made the surprise announcement that it would lend Ukraine the next $2 billion worth of assistance in a $15 billion package that Mr. Yanukovych signed with the Kremlin in December, but which Moscow suspended when the Kiev protests did not abate.The unusually high-level reception accorded the opposition leaders by Berlin showed how closely Germany has been tracking Ukraine\u2019s crisis, but also illustrated how little leverage Europe\u2019s most powerful economy has had as the tug of war between Russia and the West has unfolded over Ukraine.Alexander Kwasniewski, the former Polish president who has been European Parliament\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine and visited dozens of times in the past year, called the events in Kiev a \u201cUkrainian Tiananmen,\u201d alluding to the 1989 Chinese military crackdown on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in which hundreds were killed.In comments to Poland\u2019s RMF radio, reported by the German news agency DPA, Mr. Kwasniewski also acknowledged that Europe was relatively powerless to influence events. \u201cOne can\u2019t do much to stop the bloodshed,\u201d he said. \u201cDiplomatic acts are like a howl in the desert.\u201d\u201cI fear the thin red line has been crossed,\u201d the former Polish president added, saying that the worst of all situations had now arisen, \u201cwhere the government does not want to negotiate and the opposition does not have the strength to control all the action.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Sake, Japan Sees a Potential Stimulus", "Date": "2014-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAround the country at international airports, the government is helping to fund tasting booths where travelers can sample sake, an alcoholic brew made from fermented rice. On a recent morning, an attendant at a booth at Narita Airport near Tokyo explained that most high-quality sake is intended to be drunk slightly chilled \u2014 not heated, as lower-grade sake is sometimes offered at restaurants outside Japan.The program, set to run at least until March, is part of a broader push by the government to bring the country\u2019s cultural products to the world \u2014 and in doing so, hopefully, give a little lift to Japan\u2019s export economy. A government-financed program called Cool Japan looks to champion the country\u2019s softer goods, like anime, music, fashion, food and drink. In December, Japan secured \u201cintangible cultural heritage\u201d status for its traditional cuisine, known as \u201cwashoku,\u201d from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.Japan has been taking a broad approach to reviving its moribund economy. In the face of persistent deflation, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has introduced his \u201cthree arrows\u201d: fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reform.Sake and other softer goods are hardly going to fill the gap left by an erosion in core industries like electronics. But the government appears to be working on the assumption that every bit counts. In the case of sake and other rice-based products, the government hopes to increase exports fivefold by 2020, to a value of 60 billion yen, or $590 million.\u201cUntil the current government, hardly anything was done to promote sake,\u201d said Hideharu Ohta, chief executive of Daishichi Sake Brewery in Nihonmatsu, a small town in Fukushima Prefecture. \u201cThe government concentrated on electronics and cars, and lowering tariffs for those things.\u201dSake plays an important role in the culinary traditions of Japan, where it takes center stage in holiday toasts and is consumed by enthusiasts at izakayas, which are hole-in-the-wall bars. Yet consumption has fallen sharply over the last few decades, as many drinkers have switched to wine, much of it imported, or other domestic drinks like beer, whiskey or shochu.But sake producers lack the deep pockets of corporate giants like Suntory. The industry is highly fragmented, with hundreds of small, mostly family-owned producers dotting the countryside, from the island of Hokkaido in the north to Kyushu in the south. Daishichi is one of a handful of sake producers that still uses a time-consuming, laborious, traditional method called kimoto.With its artisan appeal, the company has managed to break into upmarket food shops like Le Bon March\u00e9 in Paris. Even so, Daishichi exports only about 3 percent of its production, about 50 percent above than the national average.In 2012, overall exports of Japanese sake totaled \u00a58.9 billion, or about $87 million at current exchange rates, according to the National Tax Agency. While that was up from \u00a57.5 billion a decade earlier, it is a tiny fraction of the 5.6 billion euros, or $7.7 billion, worth of wine that France exported in 2012.Sake producers in Fukushima are suffering even more than their peers elsewhere in Japan, rocked not just by the downturn in domestic consumption but also by fears over safety, after the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011. Some Japanese retailers have taken Fukushima sake off their shelves to avoid alarming their customers. China and South Korea do not allow imports of sake and other agricultural produce from the prefecture, citing health concerns. The government faces a battle as it tries to appeal to palates outside Japan. The United States accounted for more than one-third of Japanese sake exports in 2012. But it has not caught on in a big way anywhere else.One reason is price. With transport costs and import duties, sake can cost two to three times more as much overseas. Japanese negotiators have reportedly pushed sake into talks on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed trade agreement that would cut tariffs on a variety of goods.Another problem is confusion. Many sake labels are indecipherable to non-Japanese speakers. And much of the \u201csake\u201d served in Japanese restaurants abroad is little more than cheap distilled alcohol, not the real thing. Once Westerners have been burned by this firewater, it can be difficult to convince them of the charms of real sake.\u201cI spend more time telling people what sake isn\u2019t than telling them what sake is,\u201d said Sylvain Hu\u00ebt, a French blogger and sommelier who holds the title of sake samurai, awarded by the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association. The Japan External Trade Organization, which promotes exports, says it has educational efforts coming via conferences and other marketing. The brewers\u2019 association has named, for the first time, a Miss Sake, who will travel to events like a Joy of Sake festival in Hawaii this summer.Mr. Abe is doing his part, giving bottles of sake to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for his 61st birthday last year, and to President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France during a recent visit to Tokyo. The sake that Mr. Abe chose, from a brewery called Asahi Shuzo, is made in his home prefecture, Yamaguchi.Sold under the brand name Dassai, it is also from one of the few producers that has managed to buck the downturn in sales at home and to break into export markets. Asahi Shuzo exports about $3 million worth of sake yearly, or 8 percent of its production, to about 20 countries, according to Kazuhiro Sakurai, a vice president at the brewer. The company wants to raise that to 50 percent over the next 10 years, he said. To support the export push, the brewery plans to open a shop this summer in Paris.Mr. Ohta of Daishichi, whose company has been making sake for nearly three centuries and exporting it for three decades, knows selling abroad is not easy. He says producers should take a long-term view, like the French wine chateaus that have found export success by playing up their history and ties to the land.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to make concessions or to make a sake that would be easier for people abroad to drink,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make the products we are proud of in Japan.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Our economy works best when it grows from the middle out, not the top down.There are many ways we should combat income inequality and build new ladders to the middle class, including raising the minimum wage, establishing universal pre-K and investing in our crumbling infrastructure.In addition, we must ensure that taxpayer-funded economic development programs create good jobs, not poverty jobs, and include safeguards that hold the employers who benefit accountable for their commitments.Taking these common-sense steps is critical to our future because, ultimately we truly thrive only when there is shared prosperity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Last, Disposable Action Hero", "Date": "2014-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the screenwriter David Hayter conceived the idea for \u201cWolves,\u201d his directorial debut, he wanted to make a coming-of-age drama that he describes as \u201c \u2018Twilight\u2019 with a bit more bite to it \u2014 and without abstinence.\u201d His script focused on a high-school football-star-slash-werewolf who skips town after his parents are gruesomely murdered and eventually comes to blows with a man-eating alpha dog. Hayter just needed to find the perfect young werewolf, and he settled on a relatively unknown actor named Lucas Till as the lead. \u201cI thought of Lucas because I felt this movie was about a kid on the verge of adulthood,\u201d said Hayter, who also wrote the screenplays for \u201cWatchmen\u201d and \u201cX-Men.\u201d \u201cAnd this is the story that takes him over the brink.\u201dAt the time, Till hoped he was on the brink of something else. At 5-foot-10 and 145 pounds, he carried little physical resemblance to a guy capable of beating up a man-eating alpha dog, or even making a high-school football team. The Texas native, then 22, had a rangy build and a James Van Der Beek look; he played Miley Cyrus\u2019s ranch hand in \u201cHannah Montana: The Movie\u201d and then a college poet in Jackie Chan\u2019s \u201cThe Spy Next Door.\u201d The films made good use of what Hayter says is Till\u2019s greatest gift: \u201cthat face \u2014 he looks like an angel.\u201d Tom Sullivan, Till\u2019s manager, told me, \u201cHe\u2019s got the best chin in Hollywood.\u201dNot long ago, Till might have looked forward to a promising career in romantic comedies, but instead he is an aspiring action star. He has to be. The six major studios are releasing about 30 percent fewer movies than they did seven years ago, and they have largely narrowed their focus to expensive concept projects or franchises based on existing intellectual property \u2014 comic books, young-adult novels, older movies \u2014 that can be rebooted and sold to passionate pre-existing audiences around the world. Because the American movie market now makes up less than a third of global box-office receipts, studios tend to favor projects featuring explosions, car chases and doomsday scenarios \u2014 a universal language of violence that translates easily in China, India, Brazil and Europe. Almost without exception, the movies star some beefcake with pecs that make Ben-Hur\u2019s seem puny. In the last three years, the top-grossing movies have included Marvel\u2019s \u201cThe Avengers\u201d; \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d and its sequel; \u201cTransformers: Dark of the Moon\u201d; \u201cThor\u201d; and even \u201cFast & Furious 6.\u201d What used to be summer blockbusters are now anchoring box offices year round.Once upon a time, a movie poster needed to have only two words on it: the star\u2019s last name and the title. Stallone: Rambo. Schwarzenegger: Terminator. In the new action-hero economy, though, actors rarely carry the franchise; more often, the franchise carries the actor. Chris Hemsworth was little known before \u201cThor,\u201d and no one outside the industry was too familiar with Henry Cavill before \u201cMan of Steel.\u201d Lorenzo di Bonaventura, who produced \u201cTransformers\u201d and this winter\u2019s \u201cJack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,\u201d told me that studios were gambling on unproven actors for economic reasons. \u201cThese movies cost a lot to mount. Adding on the big movie star\u2019s salary is the thing that makes you go, \u2018Boy, I don\u2019t know if I can afford it.\u2019 \u201d Perhaps no movie typifies this model better than the 2006 mega-hit \u201c300,\u201d an adaptation of Frank Miller\u2019s popular comic-book series, which featured inexpensive and little-known actors like Gerard Butler and Michael Fassbender and then catapulted them to stardom. This week, the film\u2019s producers are trying to replicate that success with a sequel, \u201c300: Rise of an Empire,\u201d which is anchored by the unheralded Sullivan Stapleton and 299 other equally fit, anonymous men in leather skirts.There are now more indistinguishable, barrel-chested, eight-packed aspiring stars than ever, and they\u2019re all hoping to become the next Hems\u00adworth or Cavill. Nikki Finke, the former editor of Deadline.com, describes the modern casting process as a \u201cbake-off.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re looking at seven actors. You\u2019ve heard of two of them. . . . They all have names like Joe and Josh. It\u2019s impossible to keep them straight.\u201d The longtime action-movie producer Avi Lerner said: \u201cEvery day I get phone calls from two or three agents in big Hollywood agencies. They\u2019re always telling me about some new client that is going to be the next Tom Cruise. One in a hundred becomes a movie star.\u201d And the competition is only getting tougher. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an implosion,\u201d Steven Spielberg warned last spring at the University of Southern California\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts, \u201cwhere three or four or maybe even a half-dozen megabudget movies are going to go crashing into the ground, and that\u2019s going to change the paradigm.\u201d By the summer, that crash already seemed to be happening: \u201cR.I.P.D.\u201d and \u201cTurbo\u201d bombed, joining other megabudget flops like \u201cAfter Earth,\u201d \u201cWhite House Down\u201d and \u201cPacific Rim.\u201d \u201cThe Lone Ranger,\u201d for which Disney paid an estimated $375 million, made less than $261 million worldwide. \u201cEight years ago, there were roughly 150 wide-release movies,\u201d says Mark Gill, the president of Millennium Films. \u201cLast year, there were 115. My prediction is that it will be down to 50 in the next couple years. And there will be fewer tent poles.\u201dTill wasn\u2019t nervous about this ominous trend, he told me one afternoon outside Hal\u2019s Bar & Grill in Venice Beach. He\u2019d already played Havok, a plasma-shooting mutant in the \u201cX-Men\u201d franchise. \u201cWolves,\u201d he hoped, would be his ticket to stardom. The movie had a multimillion-dollar budget that he thought would attract notice from studios and get them to see his leading-man potential. He was ready. Before shooting the film, he experimented with something called hypertrophic training, which builds muscles through various methods, including straining them for extended periods. He sucked down post-workout whey protein shakes, swallowed Omega-3 capsules and ate a protein gelatin product designed for cancer patients. He put on 10 pounds in two months. Now he wanted to take advantage of his more distinct assets \u2014 that face, that chin. \u201cGrowing up, I\u2019d watch \u2018Rambo\u2019 or \u2018Commando,\u2019 and so many action heroes were these huge guys with six-pack abs. It almost became a novelty,\u201d he said, then added a bit of wishful thinking: \u201cNot everybody\u2019s got to be like that. I want to be relatable. I want to be the guy that people root for.\u201dThe rise of the Everyman made way for an era of unlikely action heroes, like Nicolas Cage and John Travolta, who thwarted their enemies more with their attitude than with their brute strength. These stars could also command inflated salaries, often $20 million up front and then 15 percent or 20 percent of the film\u2019s gross profits. But studios, hoping to increase their profits, wanted to curtail that. Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chairman of Walt Disney Studios at the time, circulated a memo in 1991 about eschewing a \u201cblockbuster mentality\u201d and wresting control back from the highest-paid talent. It took almost a decade, but by the start of the 2000s, it was understood that virtually every actor in a franchise could be replaced with someone cheaper. Edward Norton was replaced as the Hulk. When Terrence Howard wanted more money for \u201cIron Man 2,\u201d the studio gave his role to Don Cheadle; it also reportedly lowballed Mickey Rourke and Samuel L. Jackson.Till\u2019s co-star in \u201cWolves,\u201d Jason Momoa (the man-eating alpha dog), learned about this disposability firsthand. For years, a reboot of the \u201cConan\u201d franchise had been in the works, possibly starring Schwarzenegger as the aging savage. But when Avi Lerner\u2019s Nu Image Films decided on the revival, in 2008, Lerner and his partners opted to go with an unknown, which would be much cheaper. \u201cEverybody knows I\u2019m a money man,\u201d Lerner told me. \u201cI\u2019m not out to win an Oscar. If I spend $60 million on a movie, I want to make a 20 or 30 percent return.\u201d The \u201cConan\u201d bake-off reportedly included a not-yet-famous Chris Hemsworth and other relative unknowns, like Kellan Lutz, Jared Padalecki of the TV series \u201cSupernatural\u201d and Momoa, who is best known as the warrior Khal Drogo in HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dWhen the producers finally settled on Momoa in 2010, he threw himself into the role, embarking on an intensive six-week training regimen, working out six hours a day \u2014 including two hours of samurai sword practice. He ate a boiled chicken breast every two hours or so, roughly 56 per week, and packed on an additional 30 pounds of muscle to his already brawny frame. A few months before the film opened, in 2011, the trade show \u00adCinemaCon presented Momoa with its Rising Star award. During the lead-up to the movie, Momoa told reporters that a sequel was in the works and that this time around he was involved with the writing process.But \u201cConan\u201d suffered a dismal opening weekend, earning only $10.5 million domestically. \u201cI let myself cry for a day, then I moved on to the next one,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cWe make more than a dozen of these things a year. We don\u2019t stop.\u201d Another high-powered executive, who asked not to be identified, noted a deeper problem. \u201cNo one cared. It\u2019s a comic book that existed 40 or 50 years ago.\u201d Nonetheless, Paradox Entertainment, the company that owns the rights to \u201cConan,\u201d announced in October that it was leasing them to Universal for yet another version. Momoa took the job as a man-eating alpha dog and pledged to start over.A few years ago, Till said, he was so frustrated with the industry that he starred in an independent movie, \u201cAll Superheroes Must Die,\u201d which his roommate wrote and directed and Till helped finance with $20,000 of his own money. It had a limited release in 2013 and then found its way into stores. Till had recently sold the international rights, which allowed him to pay his rent for a couple of years without worrying, he said. Margarita No. 3 arrived. \u201cI\u2019m really worried about disposability,\u201d he finally offered. \u201cI\u2019m fighting for my life. I feel like I\u2019m up against the ropes.\u201dThe action-hero industry may have evolved from its roots in the \u201970s and \u201980s, but its center of gravity remains largely at Gold\u2019s Gym in Venice. Mark Wahlberg has been going for years, as have Dwayne Johnson, Chris Hemsworth and a number of producers, directors and studio heads. Mike Ryan, one of the gym\u2019s trainers, recounted a day years ago when he spotted Robert Downey Jr. and Jon Favreau chatting in a corner. Days later, Ryan spotted Downey shopping for issues of \u201cIron Man\u201d at a local comic-book shop. He wasn\u2019t completely surprised when Downey was cast as the lead.On a Thursday early last August, Carl Weathers was reading The Los Angeles Times on a recumbent bike, while Mickey Rourke, in a gray stocking cap and a stained undershirt, was kibitzing with Rico McClinton, a charismatic former heavyweight bodybuilding champion with screen time in \u201cBattleship\u201d and HBO\u2019s \u201cTrue Blood.\u201d Rourke and McClinton were also talking to Guy Grundy, a two-time Mr. Australia, who is trying to start an acting career at 43.Grundy is a throwback to the days when action stars came with their own real-life back stories, like Steven Seagal claiming to have worked for the C.I.A. After retiring from bodybuilding, Grundy got involved in underground fighting and eventually channeled his rage into a lucrative career as what he calls a \u201cdebt collector.\u201d After he was arrested on burglary charges in 2011, he was scared straight by the possibility that he might spend years behind bars, away from his daughter. \u201cI\u2019ve paid my dues,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve done the bad-guy thing, and I\u2019m waiting for my big role.\u201dGrundy has appeared as a corrections officer in Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cShutter Island\u201d and as a gladiator on Spike TV\u2019s \u201cDeadliest Warrior.\u201d Of late, he has been landing meatier roles in small movies \u2014 as a thug in the Jon Lovitz flick \u201cSharkproof\u201d and again as a bad guy in an indie action film, \u201cThe Lackey.\u201d \u201cI get villains and henchmen,\u201d he told me cheerfully. \u201cIt\u2019s such a competitive business. It\u2019s like politics \u2014 you\u2019re never really comfortable with where you are. I\u2019m constantly questioning myself. All I can do is my best, but is my best good enough?\u201dA few feet away, Julien Greaux, 36, closed his eyes and recited a secret mantra before attacking another set of superheavy seated rows. Greaux was determined to be Jason Statham\u2019s replacement in Luc Besson\u2019s reboot of the \u201cTransporter\u201d franchise. About a year ago, Greaux went to see Besson speak at a panel in Santa Monica. After the event, Greaux arranged to meet the director, who, according to Greaux, said he\u2019d be willing to give him a job; Besson needed to see him on film, though, first.The problem was that Greaux, who earns his living as a fitness model, has never appeared in a movie. \u201cI decided to take a different route to stardom,\u201d he told me in his thick-accented French. \u201cI wanted to make a name for myself before I began acting.\u201d Instead of slapping together a sizzle reel, Greaux secured a $20,000 grant from the French government and filmed a 20-minute short called \u201cParabellum.\u201d In it, he stars as an infamous French bank robber who tries to quit that life and make an honest living as a cabdriver in L.A. It took him a year to make. The film was being edited by a friend in Paris, and Greaux hoped to soon have the finished version to show Besson.These efforts, though, belie a truth about action heroes: Almost any actor, even some of Hollywood\u2019s most scrawny, can be physically transformed for the part if he\u2019s willing to put in the hard work. The studios know this, which is why any inexpensive unknown can be chosen. The cast for \u201c300,\u201d including a post-\u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d Butler and the relative newcomer Fassbender, were put on a brutal program with Mark Twight, a trainer whose workouts incorporated medicine balls, kettlebells and rings to emphasize the athleticism of the Spartans. \u201cI would argue that [director] Zack [Snyder] has changed the way that action movies are made,\u201d Twight told me. \u201cIn the past, there was a lot of doubling of the actors because they weren\u2019t athletic themselves. With \u2018300,\u2019 Zack wanted to make the actors as physically capable as possible so that there would be the absolute minimum of doubling.\u201dFor last summer\u2019s megahit \u201cMan of Steel,\u201d Snyder sent Cavill to work out with Twight. \u201cI wanted Henry to be the personification of physicality,\u201d Snyder told me. Cavill and Twight worked together for five months before production started and continued training during the six months of filming. Twight packed the pounds onto Cavill\u2019s 6-foot-1 frame by putting him on a 5,000-calorie-a-day diet. Leading up to Cavill\u2019s two shirtless sequences \u2014 a few days at the beginning of October 2011 and about six days at the end of that month \u2014 Twight scaled Cavill\u2019s caloric intake back to about 2,800 calories. According to Twight, the pressure on Cavill was intense: \u201cHenry was not a well-known guy, and he had chosen to be one of greatest comic-book icons ever. You\u2019re not going to give that guy an inch.\u201dA number of trainers and actors told me that steroids were out there and that everybody had a good idea of who was on them \u2014 though nobody is willing to name names. But as trainers like Twight make obvious, the Hollywood fitness mechanism is brutal and advanced enough to make any performance-enhancing drug seem primitive by comparison. \u201cPost-\u2018300,\u2019 there is a machine in place \u2014 it doesn\u2019t work for everyone, though,\u201d Twight said. \u201cNot everybody can handle the training.\u201d I wondered aloud if this system could, paradoxically, open up contenders to even more competition. Twight bristled. \u201cArguing that process leads to disposability is a tough sell for me. Not everybody that gets brought into this process comes out the other side living up to their potential. You make yourself disposable by your actions. If you come in and you\u2019re complaining about having to train or having to eat, then nobody has to work with you anymore.\u201dThe fight never came to fruition, and Till was not cast in the movie, but it turns out that he may not need that break. He was approached about an endorsement deal with a deodorant company, and he was the lead candidate for the starring role in Paramount\u2019s \u201cMonster Trucks.\u201d He was even approached about a sequel to his \u201cAll Superheroes Must Die.\u201d And in mid-January, after months of waiting, a new company called Ketchup Entertainment bought the distribution rights to \u201cWolves.\u201d It is scheduled to be released this year. Till was finally going to get his chance to be carried by a movie. To celebrate, Sullivan pulled his phone from his pocket and showed me a recent video of Till in a white T-shirt grunting and sweating through a set of seated rows. Till was thicker than he was the last time I saw him. He now resembled one of those six-pack hunks that he had told me he wished to distinguish himself from.Of course, in the zero-sum game of Hollywood action stars, Till\u2019s success narrowed his competitors\u2019 chances. In December, Grundy realized that the film he had hoped to shoot for six months was dead. (His consolation was that he was cast in the sequel to \u201cThe Lackey.\u201d) Greaux, meanwhile, was still waiting for a finished version of his movie and seemed to be growing impatient, maybe even desperate, to get it out in the world. It would be too late for Besson, who in mid-February announced that his company was rebooting the \u201cTransporter\u201d franchise with an unknown named Ed Skrein. I broke the news to Greaux the next day. He was confused, shocked and temporarily crestfallen. Then, after taking a moment to regroup, he said: \u201cEverything happens for a reason. I\u2019m not even worried about it. That guy\u2019s got nothing on me.\u201dMomoa, at least, seemed to have caught a bit of a break. He was cast as the lead in \u201cThe Red Road,\u201d a Sundance Channel drama about a sheriff fighting to keep his family together while policing two warring communities, and he had plans to start shooting his own film, a period piece about a 19th-century Hawaiian outlaw. Of course, it wasn\u2019t the career he expected back when he was filming \u201cConan,\u201d but he seemed unfazed. \u201cSometimes it hits, sometimes it doesn\u2019t, but I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he said, insisting, \u201cI\u2019m not a dime a dozen.\u201dSeeing those actors on the ropes, so to speak, reminded me of some advice Hayter had given to Till: \u201cI told him to watch a lot of Harrison Ford and Mel Gibson movies before we started filming,\u201d Hayter told me. \u201cThey\u2019re so compelling because of the kind of beating they can take. It\u2019s not how hard Harrison Ford can punch that makes him great; it\u2019s when he gets hit so hard that his knees buckle and he just keeps going. It\u2019s that blend of iron-jawed heroism with human vulnerability, his woundability. \u2018Wolves\u2019 has got to be a story about a kid who pulls through.\u201d That was beginning to sound like valuable career advice.An earlier version of an illustration with this article reversed the portraits of Alexander Ludwig and Lucas Till.An article on March 2 about actors in action movies misidentified the Hollywood studio for the forthcoming movie \u2018\u2018Monster Trucks.\u2019\u2019 It is Paramount, not Universal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Interns, All Work and No Payoff", "Date": "2014-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike other 20-somethings seeking a career foothold, Andrew Lang, a graduate of Penn State, took an internship at an upstart Beverly Hills production company at age 29 as a way of breaking into movie production. It didn\u2019t pay, but he hoped the exposure would open doors.When that internship proved to be a dead end, Mr. Lang went to work at a second production company, again as an unpaid intern. When that went nowhere, he left for another, doing whatever was asked, like delivering bottles of wine to 27 offices before Christmas. But that company, too, could not afford to hire him, even part time.A year later, Mr. Lang is on his fourth internship, this time for a company that produces reality TV shows. While this internship at least pays him (he makes $10 an hour, with few perks), Mr. Lang feels no closer to a real job and worries about being an intern forever. \u201cNo one hires interns,\u201d said Mr. Lang, who sees himself as part of a \u201crevolving class of people\u201d who can\u2019t break free of the intern cycle. \u201cIs this any way to live?\u201dThe intern glass ceiling isn\u2019t limited to Hollywood. Tenneh Ogbemudia, 23, who aspires to be a record executive, has had four internships at various New York media companies, including Source magazine and Universal Music Group.\u201cIn any given month, I\u2019d say I apply to at least 300 full-time jobs,\u201d she said, noting these attempts were to no avail. \u201cOn the other hand, I can apply to one or two internship positions a month and get a call back from both.\u201dCall them members of the permanent intern underclass: educated members of the millennial generation who are locked out of the traditional career ladder and are having to settle for two, three and sometimes more internships after graduating college, all with no end in sight.Like an army of worker ants, they are a subculture with a distinct identity, banding together in Occupy Wall Street-inspired groups and, lately, creating their own blogs, YouTube channels, networking groups and even a magazine that captures life inside the so-called Intern Nation.It is a young, rudderless community that is still trying to define itself. \u201cI\u2019m just wondering at what point how many internships is too many,\u201d said Lea, who received a master\u2019s degree from Parsons, the New School for Design two years ago and aspires to work as a magazine art director. (She was allowed to use only her first name to avoid jeopardizing a current job application.) So far, her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 has been limited to three internships \u2014 planning events for teenagers at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, compiling news clippings for a public relations agency in New York, and being the \u201cfetch-the-coffee girl\u201d at an art gallery.While feeling trapped inside what she calls a \u201cnever-ending intern life,\u201d Lea satisfies her creative impulses by editing a food and drinks column at a lifestyle blog, selling coral fan necklaces on Etsy, and starting a charity to teach children about \u201cresponsible\u201d street art. She wonders if she should surrender to a fourth internship or settle for an office job outside her chosen field.\u201cI\u2019m 26 right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that everyone has their own pace, but I don\u2019t really feel like a real adult right now.\u201dThere was a time not long ago when internships were reserved for college students. But that era is passing, with loosely defined internships \u2014 some paying a small stipend, some nothing \u2014 replacing traditional entry-level jobs for many fresh out of college.No one tracks how many college graduates take internships, but employment experts and intern advocates say the number has risen substantially in recent years. \u201cThe postgraduate internship has exploded,\u201d said Ross Perlin, author of the book \u201cIntern Nation: How to Earn Nothing and Learn Little in the Brave New Economy.\u201d \u201cThis was something that became a real mainstream experience after the recession began.\u201dBut the poor job market is not the only reason that recent graduates feel stuck in internships. Millennials, it is often said, want more than just a paycheck; they crave meaningful and fulfilling careers, maybe even a chance to change the world.That may explain why millennials like Breanne Thomas, 24, an aspiring entrepreneur in Brooklyn, has bounced from internship to internship. Unlike her parents\u2019 generation, it is not enough to find a steady job; she wants to follow the path of Mark Zuckerberg, or at least to get in on the ground floor of the next Facebook, the next Twitter.\u201c\u00a0\u2018Success\u2019 doesn\u2019t always mean financial success, but doing something you\u2019re passionate about,\u201d said Ms. Thomas, who graduated with two bachelor\u2019s degrees from the University of Oregon in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of my goal one day to have my own company, to be part of something that is going to do something great. That\u2019s why I\u2019m in tech.\u201dThat kind of ambition comes with a price, however. Competition for salaried high-tech jobs is fierce, so Ms. Thomas has had to settle for internships: three, so far, including at a five-person food-delivery start-up, a beauty products site and, currently, a well-known social-networking app that she asked not to name.While the idea of slaving away in two, three or four quasi jobs without a clear path for advancement may seem unimaginable to an older generation, those in their 20s seem to respond to their jobless fate with a collective shrug. To them, internships are the new normal. \u201cFor some people, being an accountant, taking a safe route, is perfectly fine, but that\u2019s not where my values lie,\u201d Ms. Thomas said.This is especially true in more creative fields, whether it is filmmaking or publishing. \u201cIt\u2019s fashion,\u201d said Dawn Joyce, 24, when asked why she has gone through four internships since 2010. Those include unpaid stints at a major fashion magazine, where she mingled with Zooey Deschanel and Julianne Moore at photo shoots, and at a public relations firm, where she held front-row seats for late-arriving celebrities like Selena Gomez. \u201cI consider myself to be pretty jaded already.\u201d\u201cI have seen a lot of people beside me quit,\u201d Ms. Joyce added. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like, \u2018Let\u2019s see who lasts the longest.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAs their ranks have swelled, interns are beginning to see themselves as part of a special class, albeit one with few privileges and perks. They share their own brand of gallows humor, their own pride of purpose and their own battle-hardened worldview tinged with a risk-taker\u2019s optimism.That something turned out to be a glossy, biannual magazine that is geared for those with a design and creative bent, and looks like a fashion bible for the Black Book crowd. The feature articles provide tips and inspiration for the faceless drones who keep the style industries humming, including a first-person piece by a Spanish photographer who cut his teeth by interning for Richard Kern in New York.\u201cThere is a culture of internships, a situation whereby it is completely normal for young people to think that working unpaid is just part of the process,\u201d Mr. Dudson said. \u201cNobody even questions it. I wasn\u2019t the only one confused about where the boundaries lie, how much of this stuff do you have to do before someone takes you seriously.\u201dWhile the plaintiffs in the Cond\u00e9 Nast suit had been students at the time of their internships, such lawsuits have sent a chill through the Intern Industrial Complex, affecting undergraduates and postgraduates alike as companies scramble to adjust to the new legal landscape.Some, like NBC Universal, have responded by paying interns. Other former intern magnets are redefining the position (Gawker Media now calls its entry-level workers \u201ceditorial fellows\u201d).In some cases, however, the intern revolt may be backfiring.Last October, Cond\u00e9 Nast announced that it was ending the internship programs within its 25 magazines, which means that 20-something aspiring magazine editors will have one less place to get a toehold for their \u201cmeaningful\u201d careers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Many in China Can Now Have a Second Child, but Say No", "Date": "2014-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 After three decades of a Chinese policy that limits most families to one child, many families say they will not take advantage of a major change allowing a second child because of the rising cost of child-rearing.\u201cWith two kids you have less money to give them the best,\u201d said Mao Xiaodan, 27, a Beijing lawyer seven weeks into her first pregnancy who has dismissed the prospect of a second child. She said she was concerned about stratospheric housing prices and the high cost of schooling. \u201cMy husband\u2019s co-worker has twins,\u201d she said, \u201cand just paying for elementary school has nearly bankrupted him.\u201dUnder the new policy, the most significant overhaul of China\u2019s family planning rules in 30 years, married couples in which just one parent is an only child can also have a second baby. The previous rules allowed two children for couples in which both parents are only children. The old policy also made exceptions for China\u2019s officially recognized ethnic minorities and rural couples whose first child was a girl or disabled.The government estimates that the change will allow an additional 15 million to 20 million couples to expand their families, helping to stem a plummeting birthrate that experts say has left China with a dangerous demographic imbalance in both age and sex. But only about half of those couples are willing to have two children, according to research by the National Health and Family Planning Commission cited in state news media.In interviews, many couples blamed the rising cost of living for their reluctance to have more than one child. Some cited a persistent cultural norm that requires husbands to provide an apartment, a car and other material riches to a bride, demands that can push an extended family deep into debt.Maggie Ding, 36, a university lecturer with an infant son, incorporated those costs into her reproductive calculus and decided that a second child would be potentially ruinous. \u201cI would run the risk of having two boys,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means double the mortgage and the pressure. It\u2019s too overwhelming to even think about.\u201dSuch sentiments are likely to conspire against government efforts to correct the demographic imbalance that led to the new policy.The imbalance is a result of Chinese using various sex selection methods to have a son under the so-called one-child policy.Since its inception in 1979, the one-child policy has been credited with helping foster China\u2019s surging economy by slowing population growth. But the family planning restrictions have produced an array of unintended consequences. In 2012, there were about 40 million more men than women, including 18 million more boys than girls under the age of 15. By 2020, the government estimates that 30 million eligible bachelors will be unable to find a wife.Beyond a surplus of single men, some economists have warned of an impending elder-care crisis, noting that China\u2019s working-age population peaked in 2012, leaving fewer gainfully employed people on hand to take care of their parents and older relatives. Last year, there were 194 million people over the age of 60 in China, the largest population of that age group in the world.The state news media has praised the latest overhauls as necessary for addressing the looming crisis. \u201cIn the long run, the new policy is expected to help facilitate family development, promote happiness and increase the ability of families to care for the elderly,\u201d the official Xinhua news service said in December. The changes, which were announced late last year, have been introduced in six provinces and regions, including Beijing, on Friday, with another 20 expected by the end of 2014.But there are concerns over how effective the changes will be. On Monday, The Qianjiang Evening News, a state-run newspaper in the coastal province of Zhejiang, reported that one month after the province began a trial period for the new policy in three cities, only 300 applications for a second child had been received, far lower than expected.There are, of course, many parents eager to take advantage of the newly relaxed rules. As she waited her turn to see a doctor one recent morning, Sun Li, a 35-year-old television station executive nearly nine months pregnant, griped about her aching hips while bemoaning the capital\u2019s toxic air. But asked if she would do it all again, she nodded enthusiastically. \u201cWe\u2019re already planning on having another baby,\u201d she said. \u201cAn only child is too lonely. It\u2019s better to have two.\u201dBut Ms. Sun will have to wait to benefit from the overhauls. According to the Beijing government, a second child must be born at least four years after the first, and only to mothers over the age of 28.Family-planning overhauls are unlikely to address what many critics say is the lasting trauma that countless families, and especially women, endured over the past three decades. They include crushing fines for those who violated the rules, soaring rates of female infanticide, involuntary sterilizations and forced abortions. According to government figures, 24 Chinese provinces and other regions in 2012 collected about $3.29 billion in fines, with little accounting for where the money went.Despite the most recent regulatory changes, China\u2019s baby bureaucracy remains invasive, evidence of the state\u2019s grip on all aspects of life, beginning in the womb.To ensure their baby is born legally, Chinese couples still need a government-issued \u201cfamily planning service certificate,\u201d which often takes months to obtain. \u201cJust getting the birth permit is so much trouble,\u201d said Natalie Wong, 27, who is six months pregnant and works for a television station in the eastern coastal city of Xiamen.The process requires prospective parents to collect over a dozen official stamps from neighborhood committees, family-planning departments and other agencies in their official hometowns, even if they have long since moved away.\u201cYou\u2019d better start applying the minute your baby is conceived, otherwise you might not get the permit before it\u2019s born,\u201d said David Chen, 30, an Internet technology developer in Beijing whose wife was pregnant with their second child.The quest for such documents allows employers, bureaucrats and neighbors to peer deep into a couple\u2019s private life. Mr. Chen and his wife, both only children, had to provide their marriage license, birth certificates and residency permits before they could get the green light for a second child.Each of their parents also had to get stamps from their work units and several government departments proving that the expectant couple was legally eligible. Although Mr. Chen sent the documents by express mail, approval still took months.\u201cLocal officials don\u2019t always know how to handle the procedures, so that really stalled the process,\u201d he said.Sitting in the beige-color prenatal waiting area at Chaoyang Hospital in central Beijing, Wang Xueyan, 32, fiddled with his smartphone alongside scores of other expectant fathers awaiting the latest update from the doctor. Because he has no siblings, but his wife does, the policy change will help fulfill his dream of a larger nuclear family. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping the more children we have, the more they\u2019ll support us when we\u2019re old,\u201d he said.Strangely, at least for China, Mr. Wang\u2019s mother-in-law has been lobbying against the prospect of two grandchildren. \u201cShe\u2019s worried that siblings will fight over the inheritance,\u201d he said.Lucy Chen contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Reports a Turnaround in Net Income", "Date": "2014-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrance\u2019s Credit Agricole flagged improving conditions in its main markets of France and Italy on Wednesday as it proposed its first shareholder payout since 2010 and beat its own annual solvency targets.The number-three listed French bank by market value reported 2013 net income of 2.5 billion euros ($3.4 billion), turning a page on two straight years of losses marked by a painful exit from Greece, Italy-related provisions and a pullout from riskier investment-banking activities.The bank said the economic outlook for France and Italy was improving slightly and that it would need to set aside less money for bad loans.\u201cOur fundamentals are sound,\u201d Chief Executive Jean-Paul Chifflet told journalists. \u201cWe believe that the French economy will get better in 2014... and in Italy revenues should improve and reserves for bad loans should stabilise\u201d.Shares in Credit Agricole outperformed broader markets , rising 1.6 percent by 0938 GMT.\u201cThe results reflect that the situation is back to normal,\u201d Pierre Chedeville, an analyst at CM-CIC Securities said in a note to clients.REFOCUSINGCredit Agricole said it expects its net interest margin - a metric that shows how profitable its lending is - to be flat in its main French market in 2014. The French recovery is so far struggling to pick up speed, with unemployment near 11 percent.Credit Agricole has slimmed down its investment banking business over recent years and has cut costs, as tougher regulation and volatile markets hurt, in what it called a successful refocusing on core domestic retail operations.\u201cBuoyant\u201d results at its retail business and stronger inflows in savings management and its asset management arm Amundi helped offset a decline in investment banking revenues in 2013.The bank, which plans to unveil a three-year strategic plan on March 20, reiterated its ambition to have the largest network of bank branches among European lenders by 2020.Credit Agricole has not yet disclosed targets for return on equity or dividend payout ratios, unlike French rivals Societe Generale and BNP Paribas.The bank said it would propose a dividend of 0.35 euro per share, either in cash or shares. Major shareholder SAS Rue la Boetie is opting for payment in shares, the bank said. Credit Agricole offered a higher dividend payout ratio than SocGen, but lower than BNP, at 35 percent.SOLID CAPITAL STRUCTURECredit Agricole said it was ahead of schedule on solvency targets last year, exceeding regulatory requirements and outperforming rivals.Regulators and rating agencies are looking at Credit Agricole at the group level to analyse its capital.The listed bank Credit Agricole is controlled by a network of regional savings banks that together form the Credit Agricole Group.Its fully-loaded common equity Tier 1 ratio under international rules was 11.2 percent at Dec. 31 versus the bank\u2019s forecast of 11 percent and the 8.5 percent required by regulators.The group leverage ratio stood at 3.8 percent, versus 3.5 percent at the end of the third quarter and 3 percent required by regulators.\u201cWe are not worried, but vigilant,\u201d Chifflet said, referring to the details it will have to supply to the European Central Bank\u2019s asset quality review, which will involve around 130 experts scrutinizing the group\u2019s balance sheet. Around 20 of them have already started.Credit Agricole shares are trading at a 20 percent discount to its European peers, Deutsche Bank analysts say citing concerns about the solvency of the group\u2019s listed entity. Its fully-loaded common equity Tier 1 ratio came in at 8.3 percent as of January versus a forecast of 7.8 to 8 percent.Credit Agricole said retained earnings, new accounting methods at its Italian unit and a reduction in risk-weighted assets helped the bank exceed solvency targets for 2013.The bank reported a better than expected fourth-quarter net profit of 612 million euros, compared with a 3.98 billion net loss for the same period a year earlier. That exceeded the 548.74 million of mean estimates in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll of analysts.Tax benefits in France and Italy, gains from lower loan-loss provisions and cost cuts helped offset a loss of 132 million euros related to the planned sales of its Bulgarian unit and its Nordic consumer finance entities, mainly in Sweden and Denmark.

{"Headline": "Currency Wars, Revisited", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialPolicy makers fear any big and sudden changes in the value of their currencies. A rapid appreciation makes their country\u2019s exports less competitive on the world market, while a fast depreciation raises the cost of imported commodities like oil and makes it harder for governments to repay loans they took out in dollars or euros.So it should come as no surprise that officials are upset by the recent market movements. But their anger is misplaced. There is no foreign conspiracy against the Argentine peso, the Turkish lira or other currencies that have fallen against the dollar. The Federal Reserve\u2019s recent decisions to slow its bond-buying program have strengthened the dollar. But most of these currencies have declined primarily because of domestic problems. Blaming the Fed is particularly misguided. Its bond-buying program, which was always meant to be temporary, has lowered interest rates and offset some of the damage from the financial crisis, though not nearly enough. Had the Fed not intervened, the global economy would have suffered a much deeper and longer recession.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Connecticut Plans to Market Health Exchange Expertise", "Date": "2014-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Connecticut has been so successful in getting people to sign up for health insurance through its online marketplace that it is setting up a consulting business to help other states build and operate websites where people can compare and buy private insurance policies.And the Obama administration has encouraged the effort, in the hope that more states will run their own exchanges in 2015 or 2016.Kevin J. Counihan, the chief executive of the Connecticut exchange, said Monday that it would license or franchise its technology, selling an \u201cexchange in a box\u201d to other states. It would offer a package of basic services, with an option for states to buy more.The Connecticut exchange has performed better than the federal insurance marketplace and its troubled website, HealthCare.gov, and better than many state-run exchanges. Since October, about 55,000 people have signed up for private health insurance through the Connecticut exchange, far exceeding the goal of 33,000 set for the state by federal officials for the entire open enrollment period, which ends March 31.The results in Connecticut stand in sharp contrast to those in some other states \u2014 like Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon and even Massachusetts, a model for President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul \u2014 which have had difficulties with their exchanges this year. Connecticut is talking to several states about its proposal, but officials would not name them, citing continuing negotiations. Potential customers include states like Arkansas and Iowa, which now use the federal exchange but have expressed interest in setting up their own marketplaces. \u201cWe are headed in the direction of a state-based exchange,\u201d Gov. Mike Beebe of Arkansas said Monday.The federal government runs the online exchange for three dozen states that were unwilling or unable to do so. Many of these states have lamented the fact that they ceded control of their exchanges \u2014 and a large part of their health insurance markets \u2014 to the federal government. At the same time, some states, having seen the troubles of the federal exchange, are wary of taking on the responsibility. Under the arrangement envisioned by Mr. Counihan, a state could set policy for its exchange while buying information technology and other services from Connecticut. Services could include determinations of eligibility, assistance with enrollment and marketing, the operation of a telephone call center and the collection of premiums from small businesses.\u201cThis would be an ideal solution for a state that does not like big government or does not want to hire a big new staff,\u201d Mr. Counihan said. \u201cWe have 59 employees at our exchange in Connecticut. Some states would rather have a skeleton crew of four or six or 12 employees. You can get the benefits of a state-based marketplace without the headaches of building or staffing it yourself.\u201dGov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon, which is still struggling with its own insurance website, said in an interview: \u201cWe will be looking to see if there are modules we could take from another state. We are definitely looking at that.\u201dLikewise, Paul Hencoski, a leader of the health and human services practice at KPMG, the accounting and consulting firm, said it would make sense for states relying on the federal marketplace to \u201creuse the assets\u201d developed by Connecticut, rather than starting from scratch to build their own. \u201cConsumers would get a better functioning exchange, and states could achieve economies of scale,\u201d he said.When states run into problems, Mr. Counihan said, they often blame companies that supplied their information technology. But in many cases, he said, state officials are partly responsible because they did not properly manage or supervise the vendors.Exchanges perform a wide range of functions: evaluating and certifying health plans; disseminating information about their costs and benefits; sending computer files to insurers, state Medicaid agencies and the federal government; collecting huge amounts of data needed to enroll people in health plans and calculate the federal subsidies for which they may be eligible.Dr. Robert E. Scalettar, a member of the board of the Connecticut exchange, said its venture was conceived in part as a way to raise money to help pay for education of the newly insured. The federal government provided money to help states establish exchanges, but each state exchange is supposed to pay for its continuing operations.\u201cWe realized that we had invented a better mousetrap,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could package our services and expertise and make them available to other states, promoting collaboration and avoiding a duplication of effort.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stability and Chaos, Hallmarks of Presidential Races, Swap Parties", "Date": "2014-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 For generations, the two major political parties have taken strikingly different approaches to picking their presidential candidates: Republican primaries usually amount to coronations, in which they nominate a candidate who has run before or is otherwise deemed next in line, while the Democratic contests are often messier affairs, prone to insurgencies and featuring uncertain favorites.Or, as former President Bill Clinton likes to put it, \u201cRepublicans fall in line and Democrats fall in love.\u201dBut as the early positioning for the 2016 presidential primaries gets underway, the two parties appear to be swapping their usual roles. With former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s widely presumed candidacy overwhelming the Democratic field and dominating the news media\u2019s attention, Democrats are playing the part of the royalists seeking a smooth succession. At the same time, the Republicans are acting like the Democrats of yore, anticipating a free-for-all primary that highlights the competing and at times fractious constituencies in their coalition.\u201cThe Democrats look like they\u2019re going to have a strong front-runner like we usually do and we look like we\u2019re going to have a very large, very competitive field like they do when they win the White House,\u201d said former Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, a onetime Republican National Committee chairman who has worked on presidential campaigns since 1968.Gov. Mike Beebe of Arkansas, a Democrat who has also participated in many campaigns over the decades, phrased the 2016 circumstances less charitably for Republicans: \u201cThey\u2019ve adopted our model of total chaos.\u201dThe reversed roles were on display over the weekend as the nation\u2019s governors gathered in the capital for their annual winter meeting, traditionally a showcase event for ambitious chief executives of both parties to talk up their records and test out their messages for a future presidential campaign. This time was no different, but it was the silence of one potential candidate and the shadow of another that vividly illustrated the contours of the coming race. The Republican who many in his party believed was the closest thing they had to a presidential front-runner, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, attended the conference but avoided the news media and therefore questions about his administration\u2019s role in closing down the George Washington Bridge as a form of political payback. Even though he is effectively the spokesman of his party\u2019s governors as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, Mr. Christie declined sit-down interviews and avoided impromptu encounters with reporters that are typical of the event. Into this void stepped a bevy of Republican governors who are also thought to be eyeing the White House; they used the weekend to appear on Sunday political programs and begin making their case for the nomination.Of course, few will admit to planning a presidential campaign even before the midterm Congressional elections, but conversations with governors and political operatives suggest that as many as seven current Republican governors are considering bids. Then there is the prospect of Senators Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, all Republicans considering the presidency. All told, 2016 is shaping up to be the most unpredictable Republican primary in decades, perhaps since 1964, when the party was facing an internal struggle much like the one today.\u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d said Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, one of the Republican prospects, referring to what he called his party\u2019s \u201cwide-open race.\u201d \u201cAll of us candidates always say we hate primaries, but the fact of the matter is we\u2019re always much better for them.\u201dThe Republican contest in 2016 could bring some clarity to whether the Tea Party wing or the establishment-aligned forces are in control of the party. It will also offer insights on more complex questions about the party\u2019s tendencies on foreign policy, social issues and the economy. One reason there is no obvious Republican presidential heir is that the party has not yet resolved its own identity in the Obama era.Former Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina, a Democrat, compared the Republicans\u2019 plight to his party trying to find its way in the late 1980s and early 1990s after Ronald Reagan\u2019s two terms.\u201cThey\u2019ve lost several elections in a row, so they are faced with a question of whether they go back to their core or become something else,\u201d Mr. Hodges said.If the Republicans are in the middle of trying to determine who they are, the Democrats are focused on the more calculating question of how they retain presidential power.\u201cMy party is in a little bit of a just-don\u2019t-blow-this-thing mode,\u201d said James Carville, Mr. Clinton\u2019s former chief strategist. \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re now consistently winning presidential elections isn\u2019t lost on us.\u201dAfter decades of internal feuding when they were mostly shut out of the White House, the Democrats are much more unified now on policy, particularly social issues.Further, after electing the country\u2019s first black president, Democrats want to make history again.\u201cI just think it\u2019s going to be the year of the women,\u201d Mr. Hodges said of 2016.So while Mrs. Clinton may not have been at the JW Marriott for the governors\u2019 meeting, her political presence was unmistakable.The Democrats who would like to run for president dutifully paid homage to the former first lady, but could not help but show a touch of frustration.\u201cI do think that the clock ticks and while folks certainly want to give her some time to think and rejuvenate and get ready and all that sort of stuff, I do think you get past this November and people start toeing lines,\u201d said Gov. Jay Nixon, of Missouri, a Democrat, taking care to add that if Mrs. Clinton ran he would help her \u201ccarry the Show Me State.\u201dAnother Democrat, Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, noted that the campaign should be about policy not primogeniture.\u201cIt would be a huge mistake to forget the lessons that we learned in the \u201980s and the \u201992 election that elections are supposed to be about ideas and about how do you move the country forward,\u201d said Mr. Markell, while calling Mrs. Clinton \u201can incredible candidate.\u201dAs for Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, who has been more candid about his presidential aspirations than any other Democrat, he said Mrs. Clinton would not freeze his ambitions. \u201cI spoke in New Hampshire about three months ago, I\u2019ll be going to California to talk to the state convention there, I\u2019ll be going to Wisconsin, so I don\u2019t feel particularly frozen by anything,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Missing Out on the Latest Texas Oil Boom, One Town Repurposes Its Leftovers", "Date": "2014-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneLULING \u2014 Down, up. Down, up. Click. In the parking lot of a Dollar General store, a pump jack slowly works oil to the surface, its steady motion hypnotic. Out-of-towners zipping down Magnolia Avenue would probably not notice this working monument to a community\u2019s past \u2014 if not for the gray-blue shark attached to its rusty beam. The shark, fashioned from plywood, chomps at a tiny fish with each churn of the pump. The days of limousines parked downtown here are long gone. The sulfuric stench of crude \u2014 some call it the smell of money \u2014 now lingers only in pockets by the wells, no longer filling the air. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much drilled up. Swiss cheese,\u201d Tracy Perryman, an independent oil producer and president of the town\u2019s Central Texas Oil Patch Museum, said of the area\u2019s shallow Edwards limestone, which is pockmarked with wells every 330 feet. \u201cThere were lots of straws in it.\u201dWhen the big oil companies left decades ago, the wells stayed put. Now 183 are scattered in Luling\u2019s backyards and next to its churches, restaurants and gas stations. But rather than asking visitors to avert their eyes, officials here want folks to take notice. They have commissioned art on more than a dozen functioning pump jacks along the town\u2019s main strip. As a drilling boom grips communities in the Eagle Ford Shale, Luling, just a tobacco spit away, is left out, leaving officials to focus on other ways to draw visitors. The town\u2019s proximity to rapidly growing Austin helps, as does a nationally known barbecue joint (City Market) and a full slate of festivals, including a four-day Watermelon Thump. But as the community plans a future with little oil production, it refuses to play down its past. In addition to the Dollar General shark, there is a pump-jack Santa Claus in the store\u2019s side lot. A cow jumps over the moon along the train tracks, where a metallic butterfly bobs and flaps its wings. In the First Baptist Church parking lot, a pump-jack quarterback painted in Luling High School Eagle green and white stands poised to pass. With a population around 5,500, the city has added more than 400 people since 2000. It is building a second hotel, and officials talk of a new visitors\u2019 center. Trey Bailey, executive director of the Luling Economic Development Corporation, said he hoped to diversify an economy that still depended on oil-field service companies. But Mr. Bailey, who a few years ago sold the 11 wells he had inherited, added, \u201cWe\u2019ll always have a tie to the oil industry in one way or another.\u201d In 1922, Edgar B. Davis, a Massachusetts businessman, struck oil here, spurring a mad dash to a railroad community that with a mix of oilmen, cowboys and bootleggers earned the title \u201ctoughest town in Texas.\u201d Luling rode the boom-and-bust cycle with oil prices in the following decades, before fading into relative obscurity in the 1980s. Around that time, city officials, hoping to catch the eyes of passers-by, commissioned art on the jacks. The ploy has worked, to some degree. \u201cIn the summertime, you will see tourists getting their pictures taken in front of them,\u201d said Carol Voigt, director of the Oil Patch Museum, which has seen an increase in visitors. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many people from the North think they\u2019re just the cutest things ever.\u201dGeorge Kalisek, an artist in nearby Moulton, has overseen the project for 15 years, maintaining the original art and creating a few new characters, including the shark. He may soon add another piece, pending permission from a well owner.The art does not interfere with production on the wells, most of which pump less than a barrel of oil per day, Mr. Kalisek said. When the pumps need repairs, he quickly disassembles the characters.Mr. Kalisek said his favorite creations were those \u2014 like the shark \u2014 with multiple moving pieces. They are also the most challenging to design. Without the art, some might consider the pumps an eyesore, he said. \u201cWhat these characters do is turn something that could be a liability into an asset.\u201djmalewitz@texastribune.org Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Website Offers Help Finding a Hotel Where You Can Light Up", "Date": "2014-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the RoadSMOKERS are often reviled and pitied by those with lesser vices, but do not they who smoke also need a place to lay their weary heads? Yes, they do, insists Shawn Bradley, who runs an odd little website called Smoketels.com, where those who puff can book a hotel that welcomes them.\u201cWe don\u2019t offer nonsmoking rooms, so if you\u2019re a nonsmoker, you\u2019re not for us,\u201d says Mr. Bradley, whose background is in web development. The company says it has smoking rooms available for booking at 100,000 hotels around the world, from Beijing (lots of choices there) to New York (slim pickings).Many hotels in the United States, and some abroad, ban smoking entirely. Notable among them is Marriott International, which since October 2006 has banned smoking in its 2,300 hotels (with about 400,000 rooms) in the United States and Canada. Marriott hotels include brands like Ritz-Carlton, Marriott, Courtyard and Residence Inn. Marriott\u2019s far-flung international properties, though, are not bound by the no-smoking rule, an accommodation that Marriott describes as a nod toward \u201clocal laws, cultures and preferences\u201d in the rest of the world.Even throughout the United States, lots of hotels \u2014 especially those in the lower midlevel and economy niches \u2014 set aside rooms for smokers.\u201cMany chains still offer them,\u201d Mr. Bradley said. But hotels tend to keep quiet about allowing smoking, so booking a smoking room can be frustrating and time-consuming \u2014 hence the Smoketels site, which opened for business in November.\u201cFor those who are smokers, and I am myself, they\u2019re spending hours trying to find hotels,\u201d he said. For the technology to make its reservations, Smoketels belongs to the Expedia Affiliate Network, a booking-engine system managed by Expedia.com, the travel company.\u201cIt\u2019s an arrangement where they basically push all smoking room inventory to our site,\u201d Mr. Bradley said.Let me pause right here to put in a word of disapprobation about smoking and its deadly toll. According to the World Health Organization, smoking kills nearly six million people a year, about 10 percent of them through exposure to secondhand smoke. Still, the agency adds, \u201cConsumption of tobacco products is increasing globally, though it is decreasing in high-income and upper-middle-income countries,\u201d while nearly 80 percent of the world\u2019s one billion smokers \u201clive in low- and middle-income countries.\u201dAnd now that we\u2019ve added an element of class and income to the equation, let\u2019s consider another breed entirely of smoker \u2014 those who puff on premium cigars, who tend to be in higher-income brackets, many with fancy tastes in travel, including high-end hotels with cigar-shop humidors in the lobbies, where a prized Arturo Fuente Opus X might cost as much as dinner.A fair number of business travelers smoke cigars, which are typically savored one by one, and certainly not consumed in packs of 20, like cigarettes. Furthermore, they tend to smoke in social settings, like a fancy cigar lounge, and not necessarily in the hotel room itself.\u201cThe cigars I smoke, Maduros, are enormous, basically the size of a bus muffler. They\u2019re as black as an attorney\u2019s heart, and they emit voluminous clouds of smoke, which works against a desire to smoke one in the confines of a hotel room,\u201d said Jack Riepe, the author of a book, \u201cPolitically Correct Cigar Smoking for Social Terrorists,\u201d published in 1999 and now out of print. Mr. Riepe is revising the book, which is to be republished with a modified title that omits the \u201cunfortunate word \u2018terrorist,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Mr. Riepe, who travels by motorcycle when he can avoid flying.\u201cI do smoke cigars when I travel, so I often look to find a hotel that allows smoking. You can generally find them in the cheaper properties, which is where I\u2019m inclined to stay when I travel on a motorcycle anyway,\u201d he said. Still, on the other side of the travel scale, even higher-end hotels that do set aside smoking rooms seldom discriminate against cigars, as opposed to cigarettes. \u201cAnd of course, many Europeans and Asians still smoke like chimneys, and many are fond of cigars,\u201d he pointed out.I called Gordon Mott, the executive editor of Cigar Aficionado, a monthly magazine for discriminating cigar smokers who tend to have other expensive tastes, and I asked how cigar lovers know where they can smoke in peace on the road.\u201cMore and more of the high-end hotel properties are looking for ways to accommodate their smokers, particularly their cigar smokers, where it\u2019s possible on a policy level \u2014 that is, not prohibited by law,\u201d Mr. Mott said. And like cigarette smokers who might consult a site like Smoketels.com, some cigar lovers also tend to research smoking accommodations (including nearby cigar lounges) when making a reservation. And yes, Cigar Aficionado will have an app for that.\u201cWe are working on exactly that kind of information for travelers, so that when you\u2019re traveling, rather than worry about whether your hotel allows it, you\u2019ll be able to pull up the app,\u201d Mr. Mott said.Email: jsharkey@nytimes.com Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Budget Puzzle for Mayor: What to Do With a Surplus That May Top $3 Billion", "Date": "2014-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA rosier-than-expected financial picture has left Mayor Bill de Blasio with an unanticipated predicament as he releases his first preliminary New York budget on Wednesday: how to hide a surplus that could easily exceed $3 billion. The problem is not that the city does not have ways to spend it. Its 152 labor unions are demanding some $7 billion in back pay. Members of the City Council want to increase spending on social programs and repairs to public housing. And the mayor has his own ideas.But if Mr. de Blasio acknowledges that there is extra money in the next budget, fiscal experts warn, it will become open season for different groups to make demands for it. \u201cCity Council members, member items \u2014 he doesn\u2019t want a lot of time to go by with people coming up with their own priorities,\u201d said Carol Kellermann, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed watchdog group. Hence, the ritual game of hide and seek.On the eve of the budget presentation, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s aides played down the likelihood of a big surplus, saying that such talk was exaggerated and that there were many potential risks to the budget, like the unsettled labor contracts and reduced support for the city from the federal and state governments.In his State of the City address on Monday, the mayor warned that the city was \u201cin the midst of a budgetary challenge that is unprecedented.\u201dStill, the numbers are the numbers: The Independent Budget Office projected in December that the city would have a surplus of $1.9 billion in the fiscal year that starts July 1. On top of that, the Bloomberg administration accounted in its financial plan for 1.25-percent-per-year raises for municipal unions in this fiscal year and the next one \u2014 putting aside some $730 million for that purpose. If that money is not spent on raises, it will be added to the surplus. Moreover, each year, sometimes as early as February, the city\u2019s administration adjusts its financial plan to reflect both anticipated income that did not materialize and planned expenditures that did not end up being spent. Typically, the result has been a net gain of several hundred million dollars.The budget Mr. de Blasio will present on Wednesday is known as the preliminary budget \u2014 in essence, a starting proposal. By early May, he must present his executive budget, which is expected to be more detailed. Then he and the Council must negotiate a final budget before the fiscal year begins on July 1.Just how much detail Mr. de Blasio includes in his initial budget could be a function more of political concerns than of fluctuating revenue estimates, experts said \u2014 such as a desire to maximize his leverage in talks with labor leaders, and with lawmakers in Albany over his request for the right to raise taxes on high-income city residents.Nicole Gelinas, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, said she understood if Mr. de Blasio did not want to tip his hand to the unions, who are seeking back pay after several years working without a contract. But, she said, if the mayor gave no indication on Wednesday of what he was putting aside for collective-bargaining settlements, \u201cit\u2019s not a real budget.\u201dSimilarly, Michael Mulgrew, the president of the teachers\u2019 union, said he hoped that Mr. de Blasio would not indulge in chicanery to hide a windfall. \u201cEvery year, it\u2019s the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe city at the beginning of the year cries the sky is falling, and then they find millions of dollars in surplus. This is not new. This is a pattern.\u201d The tax increase, on those earning $500,000 or more, would raise some $500 million to pay for the expansion of prekindergarten and after-school programs, which Mr. de Blasio wants to begin in September. Fiscal watchdogs said they expected the mayor to include both the added revenue and the increased spending in his proposal. A spokesman for the mayor declined to say one way or the other. Those in Albany who oppose the income tax increase, meanwhile, could argue that a surplus made it unnecessary.Ms. Gelinas and Ms. Kellermann said it would be prudent for the mayor to sock away any surplus for future retirees\u2019 health costs, as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg did in flush years (though he later spent the money when the economy soured). The city is on the hook for over $90 million in such spending.But council members were already hatching ideas for what to do with any extra money that may suddenly turn up.Helen Rosenthal, a freshman council member from the Upper West Side, said she was concerned about how many Council programs were not funded through next year and how many agencies were scheduled to take cuts. She talked of accelerating repairs at housing projects, among other uses. \u201cI\u2019m sure all of us could spend this money many times over,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Wonderful Country", "Date": "2014-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEL AVIV \u2014 One of the most popular shows on Israeli TV is called \u201cEretz Nehederet\u201d or \u201cA Wonderful Country.\u201d It\u2019s a comedy show that lives to make fun of Israeli politicians and the absurdities of life here. It recently opened its 2014 season with a cartoon graphic of a beautiful, multicolored, flower-filled garden with a butterfly fluttering across the screen. Then, suddenly, a concrete wall rises up all around the garden, which was an image the producers used last year. But this season not only does the wall emerge but a glass dome rises out of the wall and seals off this Garden of Eden from above as well. This scene is noteworthy for a couple of reasons: I\u2019ve long believed that the Israeli-Arab conflict is to the wider global war of civilizations what Off Broadway is to Broadway. It is the small laboratory where trends get tested out first, or are perfected, and then go global \u2014 from airline hijacking to suicide bombing to the attempt, through force and rebuilding, to create a negotiating partner out of a traditional foe (Israel in Lebanon 1982 and with the Palestinians in the Oslo process; America in Iraq and Afghanistan). So it is useful to ask: What\u2019s playing Off Broadway now? What do you see? You see Israel, as in the \u201cEretz Nehederet\u201d skit, literally trying to wall itself off from the multiplying threats around it and contending with all the ethical dilemmas that entails. And you see a wider region that is no longer divided along pro-U.S. and pro-Soviet lines, socialist or capitalist, secular or religious. You see instead a region increasingly divided between \u201cthe world of order\u201d and \u201cthe world of disorder.\u201d What Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kurdistan, Turkey, the Gulf states and even to a lesser degree the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank all have in common is that they are islands of order, where at least there is someone to answer the phone, it doesn\u2019t come off the wall when they do and there is a minimum of human security. That is less and less true today in Syria, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq, not to mention nearby Somalia, Eritrea and northern and southern Sudan.Guess how many African migrants, mostly from South Sudan, Eritrea and Uganda, have entered Israel in recent years and are here illegally: 54,000! Stroll around the Central Bus Station in Tel Aviv, where many have found shelter, and you\u2019ll see African men on cellphones on every street. They sailed, walked or drove to Israel\u2019s borders and either slipped in on their own or were smuggled in by Bedouins across Egypt\u2019s Sinai Desert. That\u2019s why the latest fence Israel has built is along the Israel-Sinai frontier. The Sinai is so out of control that last week Islamist militants shot down an Egyptian military helicopter there with a surface-to-air missile believed to have been smuggled in from Libya after Muammar el-Qaddafi\u2019s arsenals were broken into during his overthrow.I chatted with a Christian Eritrean \u2014 \u201cMark,\u201d age 26 \u2014 who opened a makeshift clothing and Internet shop near the bus station. Sitting under a Bob Marley poster, he told me that he had fled from Eritrea\u2019s brutal government to Ethiopia, then to Sudan, then to Libya, tried to sail to Italy but got turned back and eventually walked to Israel. He\u2019s now living here illegally with his father, he said, because Israel has the \u201cmost security.\u201dI wonder if the torrid pace of technological change, the rising education demands for running a successful economy, the superempowerment of individuals to organize as militants or come together against corrupt governments and environmental and population stresses aren\u2019t putting unbearable pressure on fragile states \u2014 particularly multisectarian and multitribal ones \u2014 and literally blowing them apart. And there is no Soviet Union or America to hold them together as in the Cold War. The PowerPoint maps that Israeli military briefers use for Sinai, Gaza, Lebanon and Syria today consist of multicolored circles, and inside each are clusters of different armed groups. Israel is like a Petri dish of the new world, with nonstate actors, armed with rockets, dressed as civilians and nested among civilians on four out of its five borders: Sinai, Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. I understand why all this makes even some moderate Israeli military leaders more wary about any West Bank withdrawal. But the status quo is not neutral. Israel needs to do all it can to avoid turning itself into a kind of forced binational state \u2014 with a hostile minority in its belly \u2014 by permanently holding onto the West Bank and its 2.5 million Palestinians. That\u2019s exactly the kind of states blowing up in the world of disorder. And it\u2019s why the success of John Kerry\u2019s peace mission is so important for Israelis, and Palestinians.You don\u2019t want to be in these wars. This is not your grandfather\u2019s battlefield. When the enemy is nested in homes and apartments and no one wears a uniform but everyone has a cellphone camera, you have a real strategic and moral challenge \u2014 as the U.S. has discovered with its own drone wars. It\u2019s hard to defeat this enemy without killing a lot of civilians. It\u2019s no accident that every Israeli brigade now has a legal adviser.This is what\u2019s playing Off Broadway. Take note. It may be coming to a theater near you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece Has a Budget Surplus, a Respite That Could Be Short-Lived", "Date": "2014-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 The verdict set crowds of police officers cheering.Greece\u2019s top administrative court declared in mid-January that wage cuts imposed two years ago on police officers, firefighters and military personnel under a sweeping austerity plan were unconstitutional.Welcome as it was to the employees, the news could not have come at a worse time for Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. After years of sacrifice by Greeks, he was preparing to announce last week that his country had scored a rare victory in its long-running economic crisis, posting its first primary surplus \u2014 a budget in the black, before debt repayments \u2014 in more than a decade.The back pay by itself is not a big number. The government might be forced to repay up to 300 million euros, or about $405 million.But it could blow a hole in Mr. Samaras\u2019s projected surplus, which itself is only about 1 billion euros ($1.35 billion). The repayment is a reminder of the continued fragility of Greece\u2019s public finances \u2014 and Mr. Samaras\u2019s continuing challenge of trying to appease the populace while also struggling to please the country\u2019s international creditors.Not only is his coalition government under pressure domestically, but he has been hoping that Greece\u2019s fiscal discipline might persuade its international lenders to ease the burden of the \u20ac240 billion ($324 billion) in bailout loans that it is obliged to pay back.Without some sort of relief, that mountain of debt will make it difficult for Greece to lift itself from its five-year recession or to reduce its disastrously high unemployment rate.\u201cThe narrative in Greece is that the economy is improving: For the first time, it is hitting a primary surplus; its fiscal numbers look good, and there\u2019s a clear turnaround in economic sentiment,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the Europe director of the Eurasia Group in London. \u201cBut the challenges are far from over.\u201dMr. Samaras\u2019s announcement of a primary surplus was supposed to represent a turning point. Under the conditions set by Greece\u2019s so-called troika of lenders \u2014 the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission \u2014 the country is allowed to spend a portion of the surplus on anything it deems necessary.The target would most likely be programs to assuage austerity-weary voters. It is something Mr. Samaras is eager to do ahead of pivotal local and European parliamentary elections in May, when his government will face a stiff challenge at both levels from Syriza, the anti-bailout opposition party.May is also when Greece must make an \u20ac11 billion payment on its international debt.Well before then, Mr. Samaras will need to figure out his response to the high court\u2019s ruling. The government may need to recalculate its \u20ac1 billion surplus or find other means to finance the back pay to public safety and military personnel, said Jens Bastian, an economic consultant who served for two years on the European Commission\u2019s task force for Greece in Athens before stepping down in December.The liabilities could grow even higher, as other elements of Greece\u2019s austerity program face legal challenges. Last week, the same court concluded that a tax on benefits to university staff was illegal. Pending cases are questioning whether wage cuts imposed by the troika violated the Constitution.While some of the recent improvement in Greece\u2019s coffers was achieved through sharp spending cuts, much of it came from higher taxes, including an increase in the value-added tax, a new property tax and a rise in business taxes.Those levies may prove hard to maintain. Companies continue to collapse amid the recession. The amount of tax that property owners will pay this year is expected to reach \u20ac3.5 billion, a sevenfold increase from 2009.While tax evasion has long been a problem in Greece, even citizens who have been willing to pay their share now say they are being squeezed. \u201cMany people are having a hard time now, even higher earners,\u201d said Mr. Bastian, the consultant. \u201cThey are not saying, \u2018We won\u2019t pay.\u2019 They say, \u2018We can\u2019t pay.'\u2009\u201dA recent report by the Parliamentary Budget Office in Greece said taxpayers\u2019 capacity was being exhausted, putting the goals of a steady primary surplus in doubt. Business leaders sound a similar warning. \u201cThe tax burden is killing the economy,\u201d said Evangelos Mytilineos, the chairman of Mytilineos Holdings, one of Greece\u2019s largest industrial conglomerates.\u201cBut the troika and the government says Greece\u2019s only advantage is our fiscal surplus, so at the moment the directive is to achieve that no matter what,\u201d Mr. Mytilineos said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing we can use to say to Germany: \u2018We are putting our house in order.'\u2009\u201dThe primary surplus, after all, is simply an accounting target. But Greece\u2019s underlying debt burden is growing larger \u2014 climbing to an estimated 174 percent of its economic output last year. That was up from 130 percent four years earlier, and is the second-highest in the world, after Japan\u2019s. But Japan\u2019s global creditworthiness enables it to shoulder that load.Although the Greek government forecasts a tiny economic recovery this year, projecting growth of 0.6 percent, that would be nowhere near robust enough to make a dent in the debt.Unemployment continues to climb. In October, the most recent month for which data is available, it hit a record 27.8 percent, with youth unemployment reaching 59.2 percent, according to Eurostat. As wages fall, consumer spending slumped more than 7 percent last year.Small and midsize businesses continue to close as banks refrain from lending. While Greek banks have been recapitalized, around 30 percent of the loans in their portfolios are in or near default. The figure may rise as high as 40 percent this year, further crimping banks\u2019 willingness to lend and removing credit that is needed to stimulate the economy.\u201cThe dynamics are such that Greece is not on a path toward debt sustainability,\u201d Mr. Bastian said. \u201cGreece is nowhere near being able to grow itself out of debt.\u201dThat has set the stage for a battle between Greece and its creditors. Part of the debt burden was eased two years ago at the height of the euro zone crisis, when the banks and hedge funds that held the bulk of Greece\u2019s debt were forced to accept a 75 percent loss on their Greek bond holdings, the largest debt write-down in history.But as public institutions extended emergency lifelines to the country, about 70 percent of the remaining debt is now held by foreign taxpayers in Germany and elsewhere, where governments are much less inclined to take a hit.The I.M.F. broached the issue last year, saying that Greece would require additional debt relief. Even Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, acknowledged after German elections in the autumn that some help would be needed.But any hopes that those remarks may have raised in Athens have since been curbed, as other German officials have argued that Greece is already getting some relief through previous agreements that more than doubled the length of its loan paybacks, to an average of 30 years. Greece is pushing to extend some repayments out to 50 years.Greece, the Germany says, is also receiving very low interest rates on its bailout loans. Any relief would effectively involve European taxpayers; governments including those in Germany, France and Spain are loath to tell electorates that they are liable for Greece\u2019s debt.\u201cThere will not be a debt haircut,\u201d said Klaus Regling, the German official in charge of the euro zone\u2019s bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility.The debt load is hurting business. While foreign investors have started to come back to Greece, \u201cthe mountain of debt is putting the brakes on getting more foreign direct investment,\u201d said Mr. Mytilineos, the Greek industrialist.There have been signs that foreign investors, which as a category got burned by the Greek debt restructuring in 2012, have started to test the Aegean waters again.In October the Canadian investment fund Fairfax Holdings acquired a 5 percent stake in Mr. Mytilineos\u2019s industrial group, and took a stake in the property developer Eurobank Properties.York Capital Management in November invested \u20ac100 million in the Greek construction group GEK Terna. And the hedge fund billionaire John A. Paulson and American hedge funds have been investing in Greece\u2019s struggling banking sector. But there may be limits to such inflow of capital, as long as Greece\u2019s long-term prospects remain cloudy.The currency depreciation across the globe also complicates Greece\u2019s recovery. While countries like Turkey are struggling with plummeting values for their currency, those declines will eventually make their exports more competitive on the global market. Greece, however, remains attached to the euro, whose strength is pegged to stronger economies like Germany\u2019s. That makes it harder for Greece to grow through exports.\u201cIf you consider that Greece is in the monetary union and it can\u2019t depreciate its currency, its other main options are to increase public infrastructure works, increase the supply of money or decrease taxes to kick-start the economy,\u201d Mr. Mytilineos said.\u201cGreece has none of those options, so as long as we don\u2019t get more foreign direct investment, the economy won\u2019t get going,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who think growth will increase this year are optimistic. It will be a very slow process.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Disunited Kingdom", "Date": "2014-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorORKNEY, Scotland \u2014 With a referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom only seven months away, political rhetoric is escalating, and so is fear-mongering.In recent weeks George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, warned that an independent Scotland might not be able to use the British pound as its currency, and the European Commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, suggested that it would be \u201cextremely difficult, if not impossible\u201d for Scotland to remain in the European Union. These assertions are highly contestable.Other leaders are trying for a softer touch.Earlier this month, Prime Minister David Cameron entered the fray, with a speech intended to remind Scots of the many virtues of staying in the United Kingdom. He called on the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland to urge us Scots not to leave. \u201cGet on the phone, get together, email, tweet, speak. Let the message ring out ... from us to the people of Scotland \u2014 let the message be this: We want you to stay.\u201dThe address has been called the \u201clove-bomb\u201d speech, but even though it was directed to the Scottish people, it wasn\u2019t delivered on Scottish soil. It came from the Olympic velodrome built for the 2012 Summer Games in London. Mr. Cameron chose the stadium as his venue because of its symbolism: The cyclist Chris Hoy, a Scot, won two gold medals here in 2012 as part of \u201cTeam G.B.\u201d This sporting triumph unleashed something Mr. Cameron calls \u201cpatriotism.\u201d And there we have it: Team G.B., \u201cpatriotism\u201d and U.K. flags. This was his pro-Union stall, belatedly set out.But the trouble with addressing Scotland from London is that you have to shout very loud. And many of us Scots have grown weary of being shouted at by ministers of governments we have emphatically not elected and whose policies we have rejected over and over again.Mr. Cameron told us that a move by Scotland for independence would undo \u201ccenturies of history.\u201d Actually, it\u2019s only three: England and Scotland entered into a political union in 1707. Mr. Cameron also appealed to something he called \u201cfusion of bloodlines,\u201d as if we were racehorses. He reminded the citizens of the U.K. that we are united by family ties. Of course we are, but that won\u2019t change if Scotland becomes independent. My own family is typical: My husband is English (and plans to vote an enthusiastic \u201cyes\u201d for Scottish independence); my sister-in-law is Welsh; my brother and his family are settled in the Republic of Ireland, which is of course an independent state \u2014 and so what?The prime minister also appealed to the security of being part of \u201csomething bigger\u201d and argued that a disunited United Kingdom would no longer be a \u201cmajor global player.\u201d We would no longer have \u201cthe finest armed forces on the planet.\u201d We would no longer be \u201cworld-beating\u201d \u2014 whatever that means.Many Scots believe an alternative narrative: That even though the referendum was brought about by the Scottish Nationalist Party, it is less about nationalism than about a crisis of democracy that has built up over the last 30 years. Scotland gets what the south of England wants, regardless of its own aspirations and its own votes. (Currently that means a government dominated by Conservatives, even though only one of the 59 Scottish MP\u2019s is a Conservative). Westminster imposes policies that many Scots consider irrelevant at best, and self-serving and cruel at worst.Many believe that under \u201cTeam G.B.\u201d our industries have been swept away (under a Cameron predecessor, Margaret Thatcher), our social contract torn up, the fabric of our communities assaulted, our poor demonized, our immigrants deported, and our social services starved, withdrawn, privatized.I\u2019m writing from the Orkney islands in the far north of Scotland, a place of sea and hills, with a dynamic economy based on agriculture and oil, with as many links to Norway as to London. Here the terms \u201cBritish\u201d and \u201cUnited Kingdom\u201d already feel remote. It is odd to hear them used as rallying cries; they awake no sentiment any more.Those of us who want Scotland\u2019s independence want it because we have no further interest in being part of a U.K. \u201cbrand\u201d; we no longer want to punch above our weight. We seek a fresh understanding of ourselves and our relationships with the rest of Europe and the wider world. If Scotland were independent, we would have control over our own welfare and immigration policies, look more to our Scandinavian neighbors and rid ourselves of nuclear weapons.We want independence because we seek good governance, and no longer think the Westminster government offers that, or social justice or decency. We find the prospect of being a small, independent nation on the fringe of Europe exciting, and look forward to making our own decisions, even if that means having to fix our own problems. We\u2019ll take the risk.Advertisement"}

Near Sydney", "Date": "2014-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real EstateA five-bedroom cedar and glass house on Little Lovett Bay, north of\u00a0Sydney, is on the market for $2 million (2.25 million Australian\u00a0dollars.)A FIVE-BEDROOM HOUSE ON THE WATER NEAR SYDNEY$2 MILLION (2.25 MILLION AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS)This 10-year-old cedar-and-glass house is one of nine secluded homes built around the edge of Little Lovett Bay, an inlet accessible only by boat less than an hour from Sydney.A deck at the water\u2019s edge looks south across the bay, which is frequented by dolphins and calm enough for swimming. The open living room has timber floors and a wood-burning stove. The kitchen is connected to the outdoor deck with folding timber windows, and skylights bring in sunlight filtered through the spotted gum trees that surround the house. The countertops are granite, and the stainless steel sink and drain board match the stainless steel gas appliances. A built-in bookcase holds cookbooks. The ground floor has two guest bedrooms and a full bath. An additional downstairs room could be used as a bedroom or a formal living room.The master suite is upstairs, and includes a bedroom with a peaked ceiling, an en suite bathroom with a soaking tub and a sitting area. A walkway suspended above the living room connects the master suite with another bedroom and an office nook. The houses in this tight-knit community of artists and writers back up on Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, a wild expanse of pristine bush that is home to koalas, kangaroos, parrots and kookaburras. The park is crisscrossed with a trail system for walking and cycling, but there are no roads in the immediate area. Many area residents are passionate about yachting, and there are quirky restaurants accessible only by boat where locals go to socialize and hear live music. The nearest groceries are a 10-minute boat ride away in Church Point.A small motorboat is included in the price of the house, and many Lovett Bay residents keep a car parked in Church Point. From there it\u2019s a 45-minute drive to Sydney\u2019s central business district. The airport is another 10 minutes away.MARKET OVERVIEWThe Sydney market has picked up in the last 12 months, with price gains as high as 10 percent in some areas, according to Noel Nicholson, a sales agent based in Sydney at LJ Hooker Palm Beach. \u201cThere\u2019s more confidence in the market, the economy is doing better, and people can see value,\u201d he said. Price gains have been strongest near the city\u2019s central business district. Mr. Nicholson said the waterfront communities around the city have also benefited from a stronger market, but this has manifested as an increase in sales rather than in price gains. Experts expect prices to climb another 5 to 10 percent in 2014, according to John McGrath, the chief executive of McGrath Estate Agents in Sydney. A high-quality home on the water costs 4 million to 10 million Australian dollars (around $3.6 million to $9 million), Mr. Nicholson said. But if the home is only accessible by boat, the price goes down a lot. There are about 500 homes in the Sydney area that are only accessible by boat, according to Sally Taylor, an agent with Unique Estates who has the listing. In the Lovett Bay area, Mr. Nicholson said a well-appointed waterfront home without road access costs between 2 and 3 million Australian dollars.WHO BUYS IN AUSTRALIA\u201cThere\u2019s been a flood of international buyers into Sydney in particular, but also Melbourne and Brisbane,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. She said many foreigners have been tempted by the lower Australian dollar, which has drawn buyers from Hong Kong and Singapore, England and other parts of Europe. In addition, \u201cthere\u2019s been a phenomenal amount of buying activity by Chinese buyers over the past two years,\u201d she said. Mr. McGrath said that Chinese buyers are attracted because \u201cAustralia is close to their homeland and in the same business time zone.\u201dBUYING BASICSForeign buyers are prohibited from buying resale homes in Australia unless they have a residency permit. \u201cWhile the place of your residency is Australia, you can own property,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. New properties or homes being sold off-plan must be approved by the Foreign Investment Review Board, and are generally eligible for purchase by nonresident foreigners.Mr. McGrath said about 9,800 foreign real estate investments were approved by the Foreign Investment Review Board in 2012, up from around 4,700 in 2009. Transaction costs consist of legal fees averaging 1,500 Australian dollars, and a stamp duty based on the price of the home. The stamp duty for this home will be about 109,500 Australian dollars, according to Ms. Taylor.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish; dollar (1 Australian dollar = $0.90)TAXES AND FEESCouncil taxes are 1,641 Australian dollars per year, and owners of this house will have to pay an additional 270 Australian dollars a year for use of the house\u2019s private jetty.

{"Headline": "Fannie Mae Posts Profit That Sets a Record", "Date": "2014-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe mortgage giant Fannie Mae passed a symbolic milestone at the end of the fourth quarter, generating profits that will push its total payments to the federal government higher than the amount it received in the 2008 bailout, the company reported Friday.The payment does not wipe out their draws on the Treasury, however, or remove them from conservatorship. There is no mechanism for the companies to pay back their debt, but in return for the bailout the government has claimed all of their profits. The company\u2019s profitability may slow the momentum of efforts on Capitol Hill to change the nation\u2019s housing finance system. President Obama, Democrats and Republicans have all voiced support for such reform.\u201cToday\u2019s move is largely symbolic but it doesn\u2019t change the underlying dynamic,\u201d said Julia Gordon, the director of housing finance and policy at the Center for American Progress. \u201cIt may be a profitable company but it is not a viable company, nor is it a company that is investing in its own future.\u201dTwo years ago, no one expected Fannie and Freddie to become profitable again so quickly, and there was little question that the system they embodied needed to be changed. No fewer than 26 proposals for doing so have been floated in Washington, and the Senate Banking Committee is expected to put forth a new one in the coming weeks, said James Parrott, a former economic adviser to President Obama and now a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.If their efforts falter, lawmakers will be starting over in the next Congress in a very different environment, one in which Fannie and Freddie are noted less for their role in the crisis and more as a source of revenue.\u201cWhat has put fundamental reform within reach is the widespread recognition that we have no choice,\u201d Mr. Parrott said. \u201cIf we have not achieved broad, structural reform by the time that moment of recognition passes, we may never achieve it.\u201dFannie Mae\u2019s profits were almost five times as great as they were in 2012, also a record year. They were buoyed by underlying market conditions like rising home prices and a falling default rate, as well as one-offs like payments from banks to cover losses from faulty mortgages and a hefty change in the value of the tax write-down on some assets.The company received $117.1 billion in government support and will have paid $121.1 billion into federal coffers when it hands over its fourth-quarter dividend of $7.2 billion.Investors like Perry Capital and Fairholme Funds have sued the government, saying that as shareholders they have a right to some of Fannie and Freddie\u2019s dividends. And housing advocates have said that a portion of them should go into an affordable housing trust that was set up just before the financial crisis.Advertisement"}

Last month Nugent said:\u201cI have obviously failed to galvanize and prod, if not shame, enough Americans to be ever vigilant not to let a Chicago communist-raised, communist-educated, communist-nurtured subhuman mongrel like the Acorn community organizer gangster Barack Hussein Obama to weasel his way into the top office of authority in the United States.\u201dFurthermore, the view of blacks as subhuman chattel was a prevailing sentiment of those who tried to justify the institution of slavery in America and around the world. And mongrel is often used as a pejorative term for a person of mixed-race heritage, which President Obama is.No matter how you cut it, Nugent was so far over the line that the line was no longer visible from where he stood.Now, Nugent is a bit player, a bomb-thrower not worthy of much attention in his own right, but the fact that he and so many like him feel at home within the Republican Party and aligned with conservative causes is.By no means are all, or even most, Republicans this extreme, nor do they condone this level of extremism. But far too many extremists seem to seek \u2014 and find \u2014 a home within the Republican ranks. There exists a foul odor of accommodation. But there are two important differences here. First, the Democratic Party is not suffering a diversity crisis; the Republican Party is.Second, the impression beginning to take hold is that the Republican Party is a home for the hateful, not necessarily because the party invites them, but because it doesn\u2019t forcefully enough reject them.How does this sit with minority members in the party\u2019s ranks and those it hopes to attract? How can they be expected to find a home among such hostility? And why aren\u2019t more party leaders willing to take a stand and stamp out the bigotry?Minority voters who happen to be conservative are looking at these incidents, no doubt, and hearing the horror of supposed friends\u2019 silence.

If we disagree on the role America should play in helping to police the world\u2019s quarrels, let\u2019s have that debate. If we disagree on the best way to jump start the economy, best prepare our children, fix our broken immigration system or adjust our system of taxation, let\u2019s have all those debates. But when the debate devolves into invectives born of hate \u2014 racist, misogynistic, homophobic or otherwise \u2014 it ceases to be healthy or productive and instead dredges up the worst of who we were and, in some cases, remain.With people like that under the Republican tent, they may as well fold it up where minorities are concerned.Advertisement"}

He is unmarried and lives a spartan life, an attractive quality for those angered by lavish living among the previously dominant Maoists.Mr. Koirala was not always so dour. In his youth, he took acting lessons in hopes of becoming an overseas movie star. King Mahendra\u2019s coup in 1960 dashed Mr. Koirala\u2019s acting dreams, and he spent the next 16 years in political exile in India.In 1973, Mr. Koirala was among the hijackers who forced a plane flying to Katmandu from Biratnagar to divert to India, where he and the other hijackers made off with 3 million Indian rupees to finance the fight for democracy. He was jailed for six years in India and Nepal as a result.Mr. Koirala\u2019s election was made possible after Nepal\u2019s two dominant parties, the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), both centrist movements, put aside weeks of acrimonious wrangling and signed a seven-point accord promising, among other things, to adopt a constitution within a year and allow the present president and vice president to remain in office until then.Mr. Koirala\u2019s election was opposed by the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party and some smaller parties. But Kanak Mani Dixit, a Nepali political commentator, said that Mr. Koirala\u2019s comfortable margin of victory gave hope that the Constituent Assembly might finally finish the job of writing a constitution, which must pass by a two-thirds majority.\u201cKoirala is going to have to gather all of his skills to persuade his partners to stick with him in governance and constitution writing,\u201d Mr. Dixit said.Ruled for centuries by monarchs, Nepal has 125 ethnic groups, 127 spoken languages, scores of castes and three distinct ecosystems that have long divided its 27 million people into a blinding array of feuding communities, making political consensus difficult and damaging the country\u2019s economy.

He said he had not heard the charges that American companies had helped the Chinese authorities maintain control over Internet access, but promised to look into the matter.\u201cObviously, we think that the Chinese economy will be stronger with greater freedom of the Internet,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.The United States Embassy organized the 40-minute session a day after Mr. Kerry met with President Xi Jinping and other senior Chinese officials.During the meeting, Mr. Kerry sometimes seemed inclined to see a glass half full, while the bloggers were worried that it was emptying. Wang Chong, the director of a major web portal and a fellow at an independent foreign policy research center, wanted to know how the United States could help Mr. Xi build democracy.

That compared with a profit of \u00a342.5 million during the period a year earlier.The company, based in Cambridge, generates income by licensing its semiconductor designs to chip makers like Qualcomm, while earning royalties on every chip those companies ship. But as consumer spending on smartphones stalls, revenue from ARM\u2019s royalty business, which constituted almost half of its $303 million in fourth-quarter revenue, rose 7 percent over the period, or roughly half of the growth it reported for the previous quarter.ARM shares were down 6.7 percent in afternoon trading in London on Tuesday, and have fallen about 15 percent so far this year.\u201cARM is heading into a period of slowing royalty growth due to the ongoing slowdown in the smartphone and tablet markets, particularly at the high end,\u201d Janardan Menon, a technology analyst at Liberum Capital, said in a research note on Tuesday.The company said that it had seen a reduction in chip sales for premium smartphones like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S4, and that it was trying to offset the decline by increasing sales in other areas, including wearable devices like smartwatches and fitness bands.\u201cARM\u2019s strategy is for our technology to continue to gain share in long-term growth markets, such as smartphones, tablets, enterprise equipment and embedded computing,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive, Simon Segars, said in a statement.The slowdown in ARM\u2019s chip royalties comes as global smartphone makers and their suppliers are reporting a cooling in demand for high-end phones. Analysts say that Western markets have become increasingly saturated and that the majority of future growth was expected to come from developing countries, like China and India.But as the middle classes in emerging economies upgrade their phones to costlier models, they are spending less compared with their counterparts in developed economies.Worldwide shipments of devices like smartphones, tablets and personal computers are expected to rise a combined 7.6 percent this year, to 2.5 billion units, according to the technology research firm Gartner. That figure includes double-digit growth from emerging countries like Indonesia and Thailand and a modest rise in devices across Europe and the United States.In response, ARM is looking to expand into new industries, including servers, where it would compete directly with Intel, the big American chip maker.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Test Europe\u2019s Banks Mustn\u2019t Fail", "Date": "2014-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEurope is lurching toward an overhaul of its banking system. Later this year, the European Central Bank is set to assume the authority to supervise the 130 largest banks in the euro zone \u2014 a momentous process of centralizing financial regulation in Frankfurt aimed at preventing another round of the bank failures that contributed to the 2007-8 global financial crisis. In preparation for the handoff, the E.C.B. will conduct a \u201cstress test\u201d to gauge how the banks would fare if economic conditions deteriorated. But the central bank\u2019s point person for these efforts, Dani\u00e8le Nouy, appears to have misdiagnosed the problem, suggesting that \u201cinsufficient transparency regarding the balance sheets of the European banks\u201d is the critical problem. Many of the large banks own huge amounts of government bonds that were issued by countries whose ability to fully repay their debts is in doubt. If the countries default, the banks will go broke. This risk is paralyzing the banks, which consequently shy away from lending. Without lending, Europe\u2019s economies are not growing, which reduces tax revenues and makes a default on the bonds all the more likely. To avoid such a vicious cycle, the E.C.B. should keep in mind three lessons from Japan and the United States about how to properly use stress tests to stabilize its banks. The first is that the main reason to care about the banks is that the credit they extend is essential for growth. The point of a stress test is to make sure that banks are strong enough to lend and, if they are not, to fix the problem. The second is that weak banks have powerful incentives to roll over bad loans (or hold on to impaired assets) to avoid taking losses. Acknowledging losses would reduce the value of shareholder equity and would expose management to criticism. The alternative is to raise more capital and hold management accountable. Absent fresh capital, attempts to protect taxpayers from having to bail out the banks mean that the banks will not extend more credit \u2014 because the new loans might go bad, too. The third is that stress tests need to come with a plan to restore lending. Japan had a banking crisis in the late 1990s that it finally tackled in 2003. American banks were nearly broke after the 2008 crisis. In both cases, regulators used cleverly designed stress tests: They calculated potential losses by the banks and, once the results were announced, the banks had to make adjustments. In Japan, many large banks were deemed undercapitalized: Management was replaced (and managers\u2019 pay was restricted) and the banks had to raise new capital (and while doing so they could not pay dividends). In the United States, the government offered money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program as a backstop after the Federal Reserve stress tests concluded that its 19 largest banks were at risk of losing more than $600 billion and that they needed about $75 billion in capital to survive in the worst-case scenario. The banks were given six months to plug their deficits and told if they did not do it on their own, the government would use the TARP money to invest in the banks on terms that would be attractive to the government but unattractive to existing shareholders. The result: The American banks raised more than $50 billion in new equity in one month, and another $120 billion over the next 18 months. The backstop was not needed. Europe\u2019s poorly conceived prior stress tests in 2010 and 2011 failed on all fronts. Most important, little capital was raised. Between 2011 and the middle of last year, European banks raised less than 75 billion euros ($103 billion), though their total assets are greater than American banks\u2019. Poor decisions by regulators enabled these failures. One was to allow the banks to determine their health by comparing their capital to their assets \u2014 rather than the amount needed to support the credit needs of the economy. Given the choice of raising new capital or reducing their size so that their capital base was commensurate with a smaller level of perceived risk, the banks\u2019 shareholders and executives chose the latter, easier option. This meant less lending, and economic stagnation. A second failure involved the government bonds held by European banks. The previous stress tests hid behind an accounting gimmick, pretending that if banks promised to hold on to the bonds, the bonds would be immune to losses. Of course, if there is a default, the losses will have to be recognized. And if default appears imminent, depositors and others who fund the banks will fear losses are coming and stop funding them. Unless the banks have an adequate equity cushion to protect them from this possibility, they will again be unable to lend. Europe needs a credible plan to rehabilitate its banks. The most direct way would be for the governments of the euro zone to pool resources and issue the same ultimatum America did: Raise more capital or our governments will invest in your banks in ways that will benefit taxpayers and disadvantage your shareholders. The economists Viral V. Acharya and Sascha Steffen have estimated that the capital backstop needed could exceed 500 billion euros. That\u2019s a huge number to swallow \u2014 yet it is essential for leaders to stop understating and to show the political will it takes to plug the hole. Until now, peculiar rules have also given shareholders too much power to prevent European banks from raising new equity. For example, Italian charities have lobbied to prevent or delay plans for banks to raise new capital, with surprising compliance from regulators at the Bank of Italy. The byzantine governance structure of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole in France puts potential equity investors at a disadvantage, relative to the regional cooperative that controls the bank. Mr. Acharya and Mr. Steffen estimate that banks in France are the most undercapitalized of all banks in the euro zone. With the new stress tests, the European Central Bank has a chance to change course. But to do that it needs to break with past practices and do what other countries have shown it takes to make sure that banks are no longer an obstacle to growth. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inflation in Euro Zone Falls, and a 12% Jobless Rate Doesn\u2019t Budge ", "Date": "2014-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Europe\u2019s labor market remained in the doldrums in December, while the inflation rate ticked back down to the same level that recently led the European Central Bank to cut interest rates, official data showed on Friday. The reports suggested that the central bank would be under pressure to provide more monetary stimulus to keep a nascent recovery alive.The latest batch of data added to nervousness in the markets, which have been more volatile on concerns about currencies in emerging markets like Turkey and Argentina.Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, and his colleagues on the central bank\u2019s Governing Council, surprised investors in November by cutting the euro zone\u2019s main interest rate by a quarter of a point to a record low of 0.25 percent, in the face of concerns that Europe might be headed toward a Japan-style deflationary quagmire. The central bank acted after the euro zone inflation rate fell to 0.7 percent. The bank tries to hold inflation at just below 2 percent.Some economists have argued that falling inflation in the euro zone, coming after five years of recession or very slow growth, means that the currency bloc faces an acute risk of deflation \u2014 a sustained and broad fall in prices that can destroy the profits of companies and the jobs they provide.Other economists say they believe that the slowing inflation is merely a sign that wages are falling in countries like Spain and Greece, where labor costs had become too high for companies to compete in the international marketplace.Mr. Draghi, who has cautioned that the euro crisis will not be over until the labor market begins to recover, has more recently sought to play down the risk of deflation, perhaps to hold in reserve the possibility of a last major rate cut, to zero.The 0.7 percent inflation rate most likely came as a surprise to the European Central Bank. Mr. Draghi had played down the significance of the 0.8 percent December figure, saying that a statistical quirk in the German services data for that month had pushed it lower and that January would probably show more upward pressure on prices.Despite continuing deflation worries, Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Group, predicted that the central bank would take no additional action when its Governing Council met on Thursday. For one thing, he noted, \u201cthe macroeconomic situation hasn\u2019t changed dramatically\u201d since the council last met in early January, and there were enough hopeful signs to allow policy makers to bide their time.Also, Mr. Brzeski said, the central bank was awaiting a ruling by a top German court on the constitutionality of its bond-buying program, \u201cand they don\u2019t want to engage in any tricky stuff before the verdict.\u201dThe specter of deflation poses a problem for a central bank, because nominal interest rates, the usual tool for addressing price levels, cannot go below zero.Mr. Draghi has suggested that the central bank was considering unconventional tools, including instituting negative deposit rates, in effect penalizing financial institutions for keeping funds at the bank in the hope that it would lead them to put more money into the economy.The central bank on Wednesday reported slowing growth in the broad money supply and a decline in loans to the private sector, indicating that credit is not reaching the real economy.A report on Friday from the German Federal Statistical Office showed that retail sales in Germany fell sharply in December, dropping 2.5 percent after a 0.9 percent rise in November.After Friday\u2019s reports, European stocks trimmed earlier losses but ended the day down.On the jobs front, the unemployment rate for the entire 28-nation European Union fell slightly, to 10.7 percent in December from 10.8 percent a month earlier. Eurostat estimated that 26.2 million people in the European Union were looking for work last month.\u201cThere\u2019s some stabilization in the unemployment rate, so at least it\u2019s not getting worse,\u201d Mr. Brzeski said. \u201cBut this is a strong reminder that this a very fragile recovery, one that is anything but self-sustaining.\u201dHe noted that the labor market was a lagging indicator, meaning that hiring tended to pick up only after the economy was on a sound footing.\u201cWe need at least 1 percent to 2 percent annualized growth to create jobs,\u201d he said, \u201cand we just haven\u2019t been getting it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Must Embrace Religious Pluralism", "Date": "2014-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLast March, I sublet my Manhattan apartment. A woman called Shireen answered my ad, and when she came to visit I was surprised to learn that, despite her traditionally Persian name, she was Indian. Mentioning this, Shireen replied, \u201cBut I am Persian! I\u2019m Zoroastrian.\u201d In India, she explained, Zoroastrians are called Parsis (literally, \u201cPersian\u201d) in reference to their Persian ancestry.Zoroastrianism was Iran\u2019s primary religion until the mid-seventh century, when Islam was imposed on the country by conquering Arabs. Many Zoroastrians fled to India to avoid forced conversion and discrimination. Today, Iran counts some 30,000 Zoroastrians; those who practice openly face persecution and are considered second-class citizens. Still, I urged Shireen to visit Iran and explore her heritage. But my encouragement was a painful reminder that I, born and raised in Iran, hadn\u2019t been back in 14 years. After being arrested and jailed in 1999 for reporting critically on the government, I fled to write and work freely. I wasn\u2019t certain I could visit anytime soon.Feb. 11 marks the 35th anniversary of the revolution that overthrew Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, in power since 1941, and established an Islamic state. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the revolution and subsequently became Iran\u2019s religious and political leader for life, promised justice, democracy and the rule of law. In an attempt to eliminate what he perceived as Western corruption, Ayatollah Khomeini mismanaged the economy, setting back development and widening the gap between rich and poor \u2014 while engaging in a devastating eight-year war with Iraq. The missteps continued under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who beat the anti-Western drum despite harsh sanctions that left many Iranians impoverished.In the 35 years since the revolution, millions of Iranians have emigrated. Some left seeking freedom of expression, others to escape religious persecution or even execution. Of the approximately 100,000 Jews in Iran at the time of the revolution, only 20,000 remain. They, like Shireen\u2019s ancestors, no longer felt welcome in their homeland. Today, despite promises by the new president, Hassan Rouhani, to protect the freedom of ethnic and religious minorities (and the appointment of an aide to focus on their affairs), the persecution continues. Baha\u2019is, the country\u2019s largest non-Muslim religious minority, are widely referred to as infidels and prohibited from practicing openly; their children can not attend university.Still, a strong sense of nationhood endures. The Persian empire, which at its peak stretched from North Africa to Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, boasted a wide array of ethnicities and religions. While these groups maintained their individuality, they also became part of a greater whole. Like the beloved carpets replete with flowers, colors and patterns, Iran is a fabric of cultures and faiths woven to create a pluralistic society. The different ethnicities and religions are its flowers and colors; the carpet is beautiful because of their variety and distinctiveness. This deep sense of connection was not born overnight. And it cannot be destroyed in 35 years.Unlike in Lebanon, Pakistan or Afghanistan, sectarianism does not play a major role in Iran. Indeed, ethnic groups are so well-integrated that they include some of the nation\u2019s most important figures. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the current supreme leader, is an ethnic Azeri. But this is neither protested nor trumpeted as an achievement. When Saddam Hussein attacked predominantly Shiite Iran in 1980, he believed that Arabs in southern Iran, who are mainly Sunni, would welcome his army onto Iranian soil. But this was a grave miscalculation. Instead they used their bodies to block Saddam\u2019s troops \u2014 not necessarily to defend the ayatollah, but out of love for their country.Tehran\u2019s decades-long pressure on Iranians to forget their pre-Islamic history and accomplishments has only generated increasing resentment. As the regime celebrates its 35th anniversary, I know that my people are preparing to fight back in March by celebrating Persian New Year, or Nowruz. The government strongly discourages Nowruz celebrations, given the holiday\u2019s Zoroastrian roots. Still, last year, thousands of Iranians traveled to Shiraz, a southern city considered one of Persia\u2019s oldest, and the nearby ancient site of Persepolis, to celebrate near the tomb of Cyrus the Great. Last month, a temporary international agreement on Iran\u2019s nuclear program took effect. Many hope that this reflects a changed Iran: one that understands that it can\u2019t endlessly antagonize the West, and is willing to make concessions. But real change will only come when the Islamic Republic extends concessions to its own people, welcoming all of them to live and practice what they believe. This is what our nation\u2019s history tells us: A revolution can only reflect victory if it includes all people of Iranian heritage. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Indonesia Reports Slowest Growth in 4 Years", "Date": "2014-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Indonesia\u2019s economy grew last year at an annual rate of less than 6 percent, the country\u2019s Central Statistics Agency reported on Wednesday, the first time that has happened since 2009.A poor fourth quarter exposed an economy hampered by an ailing currency, higher interest rates, a current-account deficit and other problems that analysts said could linger well into this year.Indonesia posted gross domestic product growth of 5.78 percent in 2013, the statistics agency said, compared with annual growth of more than 6 percent in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The country\u2019s G.D.P. grew 4.6 percent in 2009.For the fourth quarter of 2013, the economy shrank 1.42 percent from the previous quarter, although the agency noted it grew 5.72 percent compared with the same period in 2012.Didik Rachbini, director of the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance and a member of the National Economics Committee, which advises the Indonesian president, said multiple factors were influencing G.D.P. growth.\u201cFirst, the tensions on the rupiah because the central bank forced the interest rate up too much, which has influenced the private sector to postpone investment,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd also, there is the decline in the importation of raw materials and machinery. This decline will not happen only this quarter, but maybe the next two or three quarters will be slower.\u201dThe Indonesian central bank raised its benchmark rate five times \u2014 a total of 1.75 percentage points \u2014 in 2013 to try to contain a current account deficit that hit $10 billion in the second quarter of 2013.Most recently, in November, Bank Indonesia unexpectedly increased that rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 7.5 percent.The rupiah has fallen 21 percent in the last 12 months, according to data from Bloomberg.Stephen Schwartz, chief economist for Asia at BBVA Research in Hong Kong, said the drop in Indonesia\u2019s year-on-year and quarterly growth rates had not been as severe as expected and could be viewed positively, given signs in 2013 that the economy was overheating because of rapid credit growth and record foreign investment.\u201cThe good news is the Indonesian rupiah has stabilized in the last couple of months, and it\u2019s encouraging with the latest volatility we\u2019ve seen in emerging markets \u2014 Indonesia seems to be on the sideline,\u201d he said.\u201cIt suggests that at least for now, the markets are giving Indonesia credit for policies, for addressing issues such as the current-account deficit, which is narrowing, and FX reserves are increasing,\u201d he said, referring to foreign exchange reserves.Indonesia, which has long aspired to become a member of the BRICS group of major emerging economies, is now part of the so-called Fragile Five \u2014 the others being Brazil, India, South Africa and Turkey \u2014 which are experiencing turmoil and have become too dependent on foreign investment to finance their growth ambitions, according to analysts.On Tuesday, Finance Minister Chatib Basri of Indonesia called for improved corporate governance to attract more foreign investors.\u201cDuring the era of easy money, foreign investors usually place their portfolio without a full assessment of the country,\u201d Mr. Chatib was quoted as saying in an event hosted by the Financial Services Authority in Jakarta. \u201cAs that era ends, investors will take more time with their decisions and start looking to corporate governance as one of the indicators.\u201dIndia, another member of the Fragile Five, has gone from having annual G.D.P. growth rates like China\u2019s, more than 9 percent from 2005 to 2007, to projected growth of less than 5 percent in 2013. This has raised questions about whether its economic slowdown is a result of structural problems.\u201cWe find that over half of the slowdown is due to cyclical factors and the remainder is structural, and it\u2019s a good thing, because many people think the slowdown is due to structural factors,\u201d said Mr. Schwartz of BBVA Research. Among these, he said, are corruption, inflation, inadequate infrastructure and the government\u2019s sluggish pace in opening sectors to greater foreign investment.\u201cThe government is initiating reforms, it\u2019s fair to say,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks promising, but it\u2019s uncertain, because there\u2019s an election coming up this year.\u201dJapan, which is Asia\u2019s second-largest economy after China and the third-biggest globally after the United States and China, also faces a critical year with its Abenomics policy under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Mr. Schwartz said.\u201cMonetary policy has helped exports, the fiscal packages have helped stimulate growth, but the hard part is their structural reform agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s critical for them to do these supply-side reforms.

Another is to make the product with so few workers that not many have the money to buy it.The stagnating wages of the working and middle classes and the high unemployment create a situation in which the wealthy are the primary consumers. High-end businesses are thriving, while others are going under.This is an untenable state of affairs for capitalism. One economist, Steven Fazzari, is quoted as saying that \u201cit\u2019s going to be hard to maintain strong economic growth with such a large proportion of the population falling behind,\u201d and that to depend on only a small part of the population to drive demand makes the economy more volatile. Capitalism cannot survive under such conditions. The writer has published books and articles about poverty and social welfare.To the Editor:For centuries, wealth and political power were highly concentrated, and most people were poor. Only in the 19th century did a large but modest middle class emerge, a natural consequence of what was then novel \u2014 sustained economic growth.In the United States, the trauma of the Great Depression of the 1930s dictated, however, a mild, pragmatic redistribution of wealth, as much to protect the fortunes of the bitterly resisting rich as to alleviate the suffering of the restive multitude. Unprecedented prosperity for the many eventually followed, but it is now coming to an end.The unapologetic superrich, having waited patiently and long and having used their wealth cleverly, are now poised for a return to that earlier world. At least most of us won\u2019t actually be poor in that world, just a lot poorer than we were.To the Editor:Every time the media reports on our \u201crecovering\u201d economy, I feel as if it is reporting about another country. I\u2019m a highly educated middle-class worker (a teacher), and I\u2019ve been laid off three times in the past seven years. Everyone I know is struggling economically, either having been laid off or afraid of being laid off. Many are permanently unemployed.The next step in the collapse of our middle class is college tuitions. Most of my friends have taken out loans to help pay our kids\u2019 tuitions. Many people can\u2019t borrow against their houses anymore, so they borrow against their retirement funds.I know many people in their 50s and 60s who have little or no retirement money left. What will happen when we retire? What will our children\u2019s future be like?To the Editor:For many years now, conservatives have promised that a rising tide under the rich man\u2019s yacht would raise all of our boats. In the 1980s, it was dubbed \u201ctrickle-down\u201d economics; nowadays, it\u2019s more fashionable to describe it as the effort to assist \u201cjob creators.\u201d Either way, that theory is being put to the test, as the upper classes are amassing wealth at a rate not seen since the Gilded Age.If the conservatives are right, we are on the brink of a glorious new era of prosperity for the middle class. And we\u2019ll believe that when we hear the Koch brothers announce that they are buying Sears and J. C. Penney.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Swiss Turn Inward, by a Thin Margin", "Date": "2014-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter from EuropeSCHWYZ, Switzerland \u2014 Two weeks ago, voters here vented their frustration at the changes happening around them and voted overwhelmingly to put a stop to mass immigration.At 63.1 percent, the \u201cyes\u201d vote from Schwyz \u2014 one of the three founding cantons of the original 13th-century Swiss Confederation \u2014 was one of the highest in Switzerland, in striking contrast to the next-door urban canton of Zurich, where only 47.3 percent of voters supported the initiative, whose victory nationwide shook up Europe.Evidently, the good citizens of Schwyz \u2014 all 150,000 of them \u2014 are particularly upset about the steady influx of foreigners who\u2019ve been flocking to their region of lakes and mountains.For the most part, these are not poor immigrants from different continents and cultures, whose presence elsewhere in Europe has roiled a spreading right-wing reaction. In Schwyz, the new arrivals \u2014 about 2,000 to 3,000 a year \u2014 are mostly well-off, well-educated Europeans, an estimated 40 percent of them German, who have come to take specialized jobs the Swiss labor force can\u2019t fill.An inflow of German-speaking specialists coming to work in a German-speaking region of Switzerland, where unemployment is 1.3 percent, hardly seems justification for populist outrage.Yet, according to Kurt Zibung, a member of Schwyz\u2019s governing council and head of its economic department, people here voted on Feb. 9 \u201cwith their heart and their feelings.\u201d\u201cWe have a very conservative area,\u201d explained Mr. Zibung, member of a political party that opposed the referendum. \u201cThe vote was not against the foreigners. People are just afraid that they will destroy our culture.\u201dThe Feb. 9 referendum \u2014 narrowly approved by 50.3 percent of Swiss voters \u2014 sent shock waves across Europe, throwing into question interlocking treaties between the European Union and Switzerland, a nonmember, in effect since 2002. One allows citizens of European Union countries to work in Switzerland, and vice versa. Yet, most experts attribute Switzerland\u2019s recent economic boom to the package deal with the Union that opened the door to European job seekers.\u201cWe\u2019ve never been as rich as we are now,\u201d said Peter Fischer, economics editor at Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung, an authoritative economic newspaper. \u201cWe have an open, healthy economy for which, yes, it is hard to find qualified people.\u201dThe vote on Feb. 9 revealed a divided country, with one half looking outward and the other half clinging to nostalgic notions defined by cows, Alps and picture-postcard villages. \u201cIn the last two decades, Switzerland has changed, and there is now a gap between identity and reality,\u201d Mr. Fischer said.The fact is Switzerland has been faced recently with the daunting task of absorbing 80,000 foreigners a year, a lot for a country of eight million. Today, more than 20 percent of Swiss residents are foreigners, of which 85 percent are European, with Germans and Portuguese the largest groups.In a place like Schwyz, this puts a strain on the local population. According to Mr. Zibung, housing prices have doubled, traffic has increased, and young families are moving out.In the village of Muotatal, the conservative epicenter of the canton, one voter \u2014 a music teacher who declined to give her name \u2014 said she had voted for the immigration referendum without fully understanding its consequences.\u201cIt was just getting to be too much,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the Swiss feel overwhelmed, we can\u2019t manage.\u201dJosef Gwerder, a shop owner in Muotatal, said that about 10 of the 23 apartments in his building were occupied by Austrians or Germans, many of them working in the local hospital or retirement homes.Mr. Gwerder voted against the initiative, but he said many of his neighbors felt disregarded by their own government and by extension, by the European Union. \u201cVoting \u2018yes\u2019 was another way of voting \u2018no\u2019 to what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said.This sense of powerlessness is a sensitive subject in a country that prides itself on a tradition of direct democracy. \u201cWe are always a little bit afraid that other people are giving us rules that we don\u2019t accept,\u201d Mr. Zibung explained.

{"Headline": "False Nostalgia in Switzerland", "Date": "2014-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialSwiss voters have handed the populist right in Europe an alarming victory. On Sunday, Feb. 9, voters approved an anti-immigration referendum that effectively rejects one of the defining principles of modern Europe: the free movement of European citizens within the Continent. Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, but, in 2008, it accepted participation in the Schengen Agreement, a Pan-European accord that allows Europeans to move freely across borders. Switzerland\u2019s business community had warned that the anti-immigration measure would harm the country\u2019s economy and threaten Swiss jobs. But its argument failed to dissuade enough people, with the measure supported by 50.3 percent of those voting. Leaders of the European Union, which must now review its relationship with Switzerland, condemned the vote, as did the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, and Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel. Their governments, and others in Europe, must now review existing bilateral agreements with Switzerland that allow citizens to live and work in each other\u2019s countries. The right-wing People\u2019s Party was the driving force behind the measure, warning that an influx of foreigners is threatening to overwhelm Swiss identity. Parties across Europe, as well as the British government of David Cameron, are blaming immigration for a range of economic and social woes; immigration from poorer to richer countries has increased in recent years in tandem with Europe\u2019s economic crisis. Citizens of Romania and Bulgaria, neither of which is well-off, gained the right to move freely in the European Union at the beginning of this year, triggering more alarmist anti-immigrant rhetoric. France\u2019s right-wing National Front party was quick to praise the Swiss vote. The party is expected to be a big winner in European parliamentary elections scheduled for May. Anti-immigrant parties in the Netherlands, Austria and Scandinavia are also doing well. The Swiss vote is likely to give them a boost.The European right couples anti-immigrant fear-mongering with the promise of a nostalgic return to an idealized Europe of homogeneous national populations purged of unwanted foreigners. That kind of false nostalgia, part of the run-up to World War II, was a big reason the European Union was created in the first place. One can only hope that the reality of what this vote could cost the Swiss will serve as a wake-up call for other Europeans. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The I.M.F. Needs a Reset", "Date": "2014-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsFor all the criticism that has been directed at it over the decades, the International Monetary Fund provides vital services to the world economy. In particular, it acts as the nearest thing to an international lender of last resort to countries experiencing external financial crises \u2014 and thereby helps to maintain international financial stability.In 2010 the fund\u2019s board of governors agreed on a package of governance reforms, subject to ratification by the I.M.F.\u2019s member countries. Members would increase their quota subscriptions (similar to credit union deposits), raising the fund\u2019s resources. At the same time 6.2 percent of voting shares would be shifted in favor of \u201cdynamic\u201d emerging-market and developing countries.The I.M.F.\u2019s managing director at the time, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, called the accord \u201cthe most fundamental governance overhaul in the fund\u2019s 65-year history and the biggest-ever shift of influence in favor of emerging-market and developing countries to recognize their growing role in the global economy.\u201dBut the small print revealed that the agreed vote shift from developed countries to emerging-market and developing countries was only 2.6 percent, the rest being adjustments within the category of emerging-market and developing countries from \u201coverrepresented\u201d ones to \u201cunderrepresented\u201d ones. Even if implemented, the 2010 reforms would leave large discrepancies between a country\u2019s share of economic weight and its share of voting power.The overwhelming majority of I.M.F. member states approved the changes, but more than three years later the quotas and votes remain unchanged because the United States Congress has still not approved what the executive branch agreed to. Without congressional approval the whole readjustment remains paralyzed.The deeper problem is that the 2010 accord is a one-off. I.M.F. member states say that the fund should agree on a formula for the adjustment of quota shares going forward, but the executive board has repeatedly missed deadlines for doing so. Most members agree that quotas and votes should be based on a country\u2019s G.D.P., in the interests of simplicity and consistency. But the Europeans insist they should be based not only on G.D.P. but also on \u201copenness.\u201d In response, some developing countries argue that if measures beyond G.D.P. are to be included, criteria like \u201ccontributions to global growth\u201d should be among them.The upshot is stalemate. This lack of agreement suits the Europeans well, for it protects their current overrepresentation in the I.M.F.To unblock the stalemate, the board of governors should agree to amend the fund\u2019s constitution to delink the reallocation of quotas and votes from increases in total financial subscriptions. The I.M.F.\u2019s constitution says that a member state can veto any loss of quota and votes. In practice this means that a reallocation can only occur when there is also a large net increase in financial subscriptions. By separating the two issues, the fund could institute a routinized adjustment of voting power as countries\u2019 relative economic weight changes, without the changes always being held hostage to governments\u2019 willingness to make new capital contributions.This would remove the fiscal component of the reforms and go a long way to disarm its opponents in the Republican Party. The remaining parts of the 2010 reform might even make them happy to come on board. The United States would keep its solitary veto over super-majority decisions requiring 85 percent of votes, such as changes to the fund\u2019s constitution. And an agreement by the United States would open the way to changes that substantially cut Europe\u2019s overrepresentation, making space for increased representation for emerging-market economies \u2014 a long-standing American objective.2014 is the 70th anniversary of the Bretton Woods conference at which the International Monetary Fund and World Bank were founded. Breaking the deadlock in I.M.F. governance reform would help to ensure that emerging-market and developing countries see the fund as a cooperative of states \u2014 and no longer a device for Western countries to impose their conditions on others. It also would boost the prospects for international financial stability, and not incidentally, constitute a triumph for President Obama and the I.M.F.\u2019s current managing director, Christine Lagarde.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 Former Premiers Try to Use Tokyo Election to Rally Public Against Nuclear Power", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Waging an impassioned political campaign, two retired prime ministers, including one of Japan\u2019s most popular political figures, have tried to turn a local election in Tokyo into what they call Japan\u2019s first referendum on the future of nuclear power since the accident in Fukushima nearly three years ago.But as the vote on Sunday approaches, polls and political analysts say the two aging leaders have not yet been able to persuade enough voters to back their quixotic bid against nuclear power. Analysts say the message of the election results for Tokyo governor is likely to be muddled in any case, with the antinuclear vote split and the pro-nuclear governing party\u2019s candidate trying to blunt his rivals\u2019 message by saying he supports an \u201ceventual phaseout\u201d of nuclear power.At a campaign stop, Mr. Hosokawa, who was helped by aides up a ladder to a platform atop a truck, made a forceful appeal about how a vote for him could stymie Mr. Abe\u2019s plans.\u201cThis is not only Tokyo\u2019s election!\u201d bellowed Mr. Hosokawa, who had stunned Japan by announcing he would come out of nearly two decades of retirement as a potter to run as an antinuclear candidate. \u201cIf Tokyo says no to nuclear power, it can change the future of Japan! The whole world is watching! It wants to know, can Japan change?\u201dThe antinuclear campaign is remarkable not only for drawing two of Japan\u2019s best-known reformist leaders out of retirement, but also for highlighting their very public apostasy: Both were former believers in nuclear power who say they turned against it after the Fukushima disaster exposed its dangers. Both were also from rival parties.The two men have run a single-issue campaign in which they promise to declare that Tokyo, the capital, will never again use nuclear-generated electricity, and instead get as much power as possible from renewable sources like solar.Because of public concerns about safety, Japan\u2019s 48 operable commercial reactors were idled in the months after the triple meltdown in March 2011 that was caused by an earthquake and tsunami. But Mr. Abe and other nuclear supporters say Japan cannot recover from its long economic slump without cheap power.When Mr. Koizumi and Mr. Hosokawa began their campaign late last month, they pitched it as what many analysts agreed was the first real chance to put the nuclear question directly to a large number of voters. The governing Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s victories in two national elections after the accident are widely seen as having been votes of dissatisfaction with a previous opposition-party government, not a conclusive show of support for Mr. Abe\u2019s nuclear policies.But analysts say the two former prime ministers appear to be having trouble persuading enough voters to take their attempt seriously. Polls this week showed the governing party candidate, Yoichi Masuzoe, 65, a former labor minister who is backed by the governing party\u2019s powerful vote-gathering machine, ahead with just a few days to go, though many voters still appear undecided. Mr. Hosokawa also appears to have lost voters to another antinuclear candidate, backed by the Communist Party.\u201cKoizumi and Hosokawa just look too old and too removed from local concerns in Tokyo,\u201d said Hiroshi Shiratori, a political scientist at Hosei University in Tokyo. \u201cThis has not become the referendum on nuclear power that they had hoped for.\u201dMr. Abe has largely stayed aloof, intervening only to question whether a local election is an appropriate forum for deciding national energy policy. Mr. Masuzoe has also tried to focus the election on other issues like preparing for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.Mr. Hosokawa and Mr. Koizumi counter that the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant is relevant to Tokyo voters because the plant existed to supply their city with electricity.Still, the two former leaders draw huge crowds when they speak. In a recent speech in front of a Tokyo train station, Mr. Koizumi, who battled vested interests as prime minister from 2001 to 2006, said that turning away from nuclear power would give the nation a chance to reinvent itself, just as it did when it rose from defeat after World War II. He laid out a vision in which Japan would become a global pioneer in renewable energy.\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy, but we can rise to this new challenge if we try!\u201d boomed Mr. Koizumi, whose trademark wavy hair has whitened with age. \u201cJapanese are good at beating the odds!\u201dMany of those listening said they were moved by Mr. Koizumi\u2019s appeals, but were also worried that eliminating nuclear power would hurt the economy\u2019s chances for recovery.\u201cIt is an agonizing choice,\u201d said Hiromi Onuki, 77, a retired manufacturing company manager who strained to see Mr. Koizumi over the heads of the crowd. \u201cWe saw what happened in Fukushima, and Japan cannot survive another such accident. But does Japan really have any other realistic choice for affordable energy?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israeli Water, Mideast Peace?", "Date": "2014-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorNuclear proliferation, religious militancy and income inequality are all major threats to Middle East stability. Sadly, a new one is brewing: water scarcity.The human causes are clear: rapid population growth, antiquated infrastructure, the over-pumping of aquifers, inefficient crop practices and pollution from fertilizer and pesticides. Then there are the factors that climate change is accelerating, like evaporation of lakes and rivers and diminished rainfall.One country in the region might have a solution to these water woes: Israel. It shares the same problems of climate and desertification as its neighbors, but it has mastered the management of water resources, such that it can endure periodic droughts while supporting a growing population. Its water management can not only be a model but can even reduce regional tensions. Wasteful farming practices \u2014 in particular, flooding a field to irrigate it \u2014 are the biggest factor behind the regional water shortage. Starting in the 1960s, Israeli farmers abandoned this technique in favor of drip irrigation, which reduces the loss of water to evaporation, gets water to roots more efficiently and, critically, produces crop yields vastly greater than those with conventional irrigation. Israel also treats household sewage as a precious resource, reusing more than 80 percent of it for agriculture. In Iran and many Arab countries, sewage is dumped, which can threaten public health by contaminating wells and aquifers. There is precedent for Israel\u2019s helping its neighbors with water. Before 1979 \u2014around the time it began to adopt technologies and policies that led to its current water abundance \u2014 Israel was Iran\u2019s partner in developing its national water resources.That cooperation began in 1962, after a severe earthquake in the Qazvin region of Iran killed more than 12,000 people. The earthquake collapsed a chain of wells that engineers had drilled in a qanat, or tunnel, style. Hundreds of thousands were at risk from lack of drinking water. Israel flew in teams of drillers. New water supplies were identified, and a series of artesian wells were drilled. The drilling was such a success that Israel\u2019s water engineering company, today a private enterprise, was hired to identify and gain access to underground resources elsewhere in Iran.Beginning in 1968, a desalination company owned by the Israeli government built dozens of plants in Iran. These are now aging, while Israel continues to innovate: On its Mediterranean coast, it recently opened an immense, energy-efficient desalination plant. More than half of Israel\u2019s drinking water \u2014 purer, cleaner and less salty than natural sources \u2014 now comes from seawater.Cooperation with Iran abruptly ended with the Islamic revolution. Indeed, the Israeli team of water experts was on one of the last direct flights from Iran to Israel in 1979.Wars over water have been forecast as a coming threat worldwide, and the geopolitical risks can\u2019t be discounted. Syria, ruined by civil war, and Iraq, still an epicenter of religious violence, will suffer even more, as Turkey accelerates its diversion of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers to make up for its shortsighted over-pumping of once-massive Anatolian aquifers. Egypt, with 10 times Israel\u2019s population but nearly 50 times the water available, uses water inefficiently, despite the age-old centrality of agriculture to its economy. Ethiopia, upriver to Sudan and Egypt, is asserting water rights to the Nile for its growing population, putting it in tension with Egypt. Yemen might be in the worst shape: Short of immediate, radical steps, it could be out of water in 15 years.Because of geography and hydrology, the Palestinians\u2019 water future is closely tied to Israel\u2019s. In just the few years of Hamas control of Gaza, the water supply there has been polluted, and though no solution to its coming water crisis is likely without an Israeli role, Hamas has refused to cooperate with Israel. The Palestinians in the West Bank already receive much of their water from Israel\u2019s national water utility and, sovereignty and symbolism aside, neither a two-state solution nor a continuation of the status quo will change that. Given their proximity to Israel, the Palestinians are likely to be among the few Arab winners in the water race.Israel\u2019s self-sufficiency in water goes beyond irrigation, drilling, desalination and reclaimed water. It is also dependent on a sophisticated legal and regulatory structure, market mechanisms, robust public education, an obsession with fixing leaks and efforts to catch rainwater and reduce evaporation, among many other tools. Natural plant-breeding methods have raised crop yields with salty, high-mineral brackish water of the kind found, but mostly thought of as worthless, all over the Middle East. Israel has transformed water from a struggle with nature to an economic input: You can get all you want if you plan and pay for it.No one should wish for a water crisis anywhere. But as water problems grow, one hopes that ideology will give way to pragmatism and may open a door to an Arab and Islamic outreach to Israel. A partnership that starts with engineers and extends to farmers could contribute to deal making, even reconciliation, among leaders. Rather than seeing Israel as a problem, Israel\u2019s antagonists would be wise to see it as a solution. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With President\u2019s Departure, Ukraine Looks Toward a Murky Future", "Date": "2014-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 As ranks of riot police officers, Interior Ministry troops and even the president vanished from the capital, Ukraine slipped, with often-eerie calm after months of tumultuous protests and a week of bloody mayhem, into the hands of revolution.Gone on Saturday, along with President Viktor F. Yanukovych, who had fled to eastern Ukraine, was any trace of a Friday peace deal that had sought to freeze the country\u2019s tumult by trimming the powers of the president while allowing him to stay in office until the end of the year.At the president\u2019s mist-shrouded residential compound just outside the capital in Mezhgorye, Sergey Belaus, a major in Ukraine\u2019s State Protection service, said he had handed over control of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s living quarters and his tennis court to the head of a small band of antigovernment militants at 9 a.m.\u201cHe came. We talked, and we agreed that he would now be in charge,\u201d said Mr. Belaus, recounting that helicopters and cars had fled the compound, on a bluff overlooking the Dnieper River, overnight. He said he did not know where Mr. Yanukovych had gone.Also unknown is what now fills the vacuum left by Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s departure: perhaps an orderly new leadership headed by established opposition parties, perhaps a chaotic cacophony of voices driven by the passions of the street or, most ominously of all, perhaps the establishment of two or more rival power centers pushing the fractured nation into a Yugoslav-style disintegration.Fear of the establishment of rival power centers gained ground on Saturday when Mr. Yanukovych, having left the capital, popped up on television from Kharkiv, a Russian-speaking and strongly pro-Russian city in the east of the country near the Russian border. He said he had not resigned, had no plans to do so and was consulting with supporters in the east about what to do next.\u201cI am a legitimately elected president,\u201d he said defiantly. \u201cWhat is happening today, mostly, it is vandalism, banditism, and a coup d'\u00e9tat.\" Kharkiv has strong ties to Russia. Early Soviet leaders \u2014 doubtful of Kiev\u2019s loyalty, fearful of Ukrainian-speaking regions farther west but determined to anchor Ukraine under Moscow\u2019s control \u2014 chose Kharkiv as the capital of their newly established Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, a nominally autonomous entity but entirely controlled by Moscow.Southern Ukraine, especially the region of Crimea, also has strong ties to Russia. Pro-Russian politicians in Crimea have been demanding autonomy from Kiev and even \u201cprotection\u201d for their aspirations from Moscow, which has a large military presence in the Black Sea region, notably in Sevastopol, a port city with a huge Russian naval base.With the riot police in Kiev having disappeared, protesters claimed to be in charge of security for the Ukrainian capital.If Mr. Yanukovych sought to rally the east of Ukraine to his side, the west of the country, long a bastion of fierce Ukrainian nationalism, would almost certainly respond by mobilizing its own forces to protect the idea of a single nation.All this presents an unwelcome distraction for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has been busy at the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi trying to present a softer, friendlier image of his country to a suspicious world. But, with the Olympics set to end on Sunday, Mr. Putin will no doubt turn all his attention to a drama that has driven a key Russian ally from Kiev and now threatens to install a new government dominated by people Moscow has characterized as extremists, terrorists and even Nazis.The east-west divide has bedeviled Ukraine since it first emerged as an independent state after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. In each election since, voters have split along a line running roughly through the middle of the country.But these divisions have grown into a gaping chasm in recent months as the Ukrainian-speaking west has rallied unambiguously behind protesters in Kiev\u2019s Independence Square while many in the east, their views shaped in part by doom-laden reports on widely watched Russian television, have recoiled in horror at what they saw as an attempt to oust a legitimate, democratically elected leader viewed as one of their own.Mr. Yanukovych built his political career in Donetsk, an eastern coal-mining and industrial center whose bleak Soviet-era urban landscape is a world away from the elegant and proudly European splendor of western cities like Lviv.These stark divisions, rooted in history, language and culture, have put Ukraine on a fault line that has shaped not only the country\u2019s domestic politics but also a geopolitical struggle between Russia and the West at the heart of Ukraine\u2019s current tumult. The protests in Independence Square began in November after Mr. Yanukovych rejected a sweeping trade and political deal with the European Union and turned to Moscow for help.Looming over this struggle, and over the prospects of survival for whatever government emerges in Kiev, is a stark question: Who will help fill the depleted coffers of a country on the brink of bankruptcy and crippled by arguably one of the most troubled economies in the world?Russia was willing back in December, offering $15 billion and cheap natural gas. But the price Moscow exacted in return, a future in the Russian orbit, only inflamed the protests. A rejection of Russian aid seems to have been one of the conditions set by European diplomats who helped mediate the now-moribund political deal on Friday between Mr. Yanukovych and three opposition leaders.Russia\u2019s envoy at the talks, unlike the Europeans, refused to sign the final agreement. And while Washington and European capitals cheered the accord as a breakthrough that could end a lethal spiral of violence, Moscow raised niggling legal points about constitutional changes.Europe\u2019s determination to force a deal was captured by a television camera that filmed Radoslaw Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, giving a blunt warning to opposition leaders. \u201cIf you don\u2019t support this, you will have martial law, the army,\u201d Mr. Sikorski said as he hurried out of a room at the presidential administration. \u201cYou\u2019ll all be dead.\u201dWith protesters now in control of the presidential compound in Mezhgorye and the government district of Kiev, the deal lies in ruins. It is now Mr. Yanukovych who risks being killed if he shows his face in Kiev. But the economic mess that drove much of the anger against him remains, only now it is Europe and America that must help Ukraine.The agreement signed Friday did not explicitly reject money from Russia, but Europe and the United States have been leaning heavily on Kiev to accept that only a Western aid package led by the International Monetary Fund can rescue Ukraine\u2019s economy.\u201cThe United States view \u2014 and I believe this view is shared by our European allies and partners \u2014 is that the only viable route back to sustainable economic health for Ukraine goes through the I.M.F.,\u201d said a senior state department official speaking on the condition of anonymity on Friday.To this point, however, neither Washington nor Brussels has figured out how exactly to come to the aid of one of the most corrupt and inefficient economies in the world without being dragged into the sinkhole with it.\u201cNobody wants to end up owning all the problems that Ukraine faces,\u201d said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe country is bankrupt, it has a terrible, broken system of government and insane levels of corruption.\u201dWith this in mind, Europe and the United States have largely subcontracted the job to the I.M.F., which has been negotiating with Kiev for months over an aid package that, unlike the money offered by Moscow, has numerous strings attached, notably requirements that Ukraine scythe a thicket of bureaucratic regulations and cut subsidies that keep domestic energy prices low \u2014 and cripple the government\u2019s finances.American and European officials have indicated that the I.M.F. might be ready to relax conditions that, if imposed on Ukraine\u2019s new government, would only stoke public anger and jeopardize the survival of what is likely to be a very fragile and fractious leadership.After three months of chanting \u201cbandits out,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s protesters appear to have finally achieved their goal. But whoever now comes in will inherit a country bereft of money, political consensus, a unifying culture and even rudimentary agreement among citizens on what their nation is.Andrew E.

{"Headline": "In Stockholm, a Residential District Is Reborn", "Date": "2014-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTOCKHOLM \u2014 For generations the Old Town district of Stockholm has been home to Sweden\u2019s monarchy and old money elite while the island of Sodermalm, to the south, was a more working class environment, often the first stop for the country\u2019s immigrants.But now, spurred by an increase in the number of local and foreign young professionals seeking comfortable homes, the island has been transformed into a sprawling neighborhood of about 110,000 residents \u2014 and real estate prices have doubled since 2000.Sodermalm, which locals call just \u201cSoder,\u201d has the parks, bike lanes and quick access to the water that has made Stockholm famous as a livable city. Its housing stock varies greatly, including 16th-century wooden homes, colorful neo-Classical manors and numerous blocks of modernist midrises.Sodermalm\u2019s rebirth as a creative-class enclave actually began about a decade ago, when structures from the area\u2019s rich 19th-century industrial past began to be converted into spacious apartments and offices for start-up media and technology companies.New amenities followed, including numerous galleries, cocktail bars and organic eateries. In Hornstull, an area on the island\u2019s western tip, it was the renovation of a food market that has been credited with the surrounding revitalization.Statistics Sweden, a state agency, does not break down prices by neighborhood. But local real estate agents say the average price per square meter in Sodermalm is about 63,000 Swedish kronor, or $903.85 per square foot, although features like proximity to the waterfront or views of it can boost prices considerably.Despite its growing cachet, the island\u2019s residential prices are still significantly less than more prestigious downtown neighborhoods like Vasastan, where sale prices average 73,000 kronor per square meter, and Ostermalm, home to diplomats and bankers, 75,000 kronor per square meter.Sweden\u2019s rental market is tightly regulated. In Stockholm, nearly half the rental apartments are owned by a handful of public corporations owned, in turn, by the city, and rates are negotiated between landlords and the Swedish Union of Tenants. There usually is a two-year wait \u2014 and sometimes much longer in a desirable area \u2014 for these rent-controlled units. (Swedes call these first-hand contract properties because the agreement is between the owner and the renter; a so-called second-hand contract is used for subleases.)The imbalance between the limited supply and persistent demand has created a very tight rental market, prompting most foreigners to buy rather than wait.Across Stockholm, a vibrant economy combined with low borrowing costs and an absence of significant new residential construction have contributed to real estate market gains. Indeed, fears exist that a bubble may be inflating in the city\u2019s heated market, where sale prices these days often significantly exceed asking prices.Sodermalm is part of that picture, but with a different cast of characters than other areas. \u201cAt first it was artists and actors who were buying in Soder, and that got a lot of attention,\u201d said Niklas Berntzon, managing director with the real estate agency Eklund Stockholm New York. \u201cBut the transformation of the area has been wider than that and more democratic.\u201dWith its multinational vibe, many younger Swedes say they are drawn to the locale because it is one of the few neighborhoods where the country\u2019s pervasive class structure is not pronounced and its reputation for reserved behavior is not immediately apparent. Features like the country\u2019s first mosque and the commonplace use of English, Farsi, French and Arabic on the streets also attest to Sodermalm\u2019s cosmopolitan atmosphere and popularity with foreign buyers.There are no restrictions on foreign buyers, although local banks usually want proof of employment. Agents say that in the past few years the largest groups of foreign buyers in Soder have been English, American and German professionals who have been sent to Sweden for their jobs.Anecdotal evidence also suggests a strong presence in the area of \u201clove refugees\u201d \u2014 foreigners who met Swedes abroad, followed them to Scandinavia and then either stayed together or, equally common, chose to remain in the country after the relationships ended. The phrase is used often in Stockholm, and the situation so commonplace that there are friendship groups and language services for such foreigners.Claire Duffy, a 30-something television and film writer from England, is a slightly different kind of love refugee.She first came to Stockholm several years ago to take a Millennium Tour, a trek to sites featured in \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\u201d and the two other novels in the popular crime novel series by Stieg Larsson. More than half of the sites in the books, including the homes and offices of the main characters, are in Sodermalm.After arriving in the midst of a March snowstorm, Ms. Duffy said she fell in love with the city. She moved here several months later; her career allows her to work remotely.But finding a home took awhile. She said she spent three months looking for an apartment, visiting more than 30 properties during open houses. She settled on a 37-square-meter unit on the fourth floor of a walkup building, paying 2.3 million kronor in cash.\u201cI\u2019m not a classic love refugee,\u201d Ms. Duffy said. \u201cFor me it was the cosy artsy cafes with candles, the friendly neighborhood vibe and the tall athletic blonde men that swayed me.\u201dA picture with this article was posted in error. It showed Ostermalm, not Sodermalm. The picture has since been replaced with a photograph of Sodermalm.\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Engagement Rings, Love Meets Budget", "Date": "2014-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyIlona Kaprovsky, a 24-year-old New Yorker who works in finance, said she didn\u2019t initially think she wanted a diamond as the centerpiece of her engagement ring \u2014 a lab-grown stone like a white sapphire, or even cubic zirconia, would be just fine. Besides, who would know the difference?But she eventually warmed to the idea when she and her boyfriend, Justin Veach, 28, started to talk about it more seriously. \u201cDuring the process of buying the ring, we both were weighing what the value of the ring is,\u201d said Mr. Veach, who is studying at Carnegie Mellon for his master\u2019s in business administration and will probably finish with about $80,000 in loan debt. \u201cIs it real? Does the diamond matter?\u201dIn the end, it mattered, as it does for the many American couples who collectively spend billions on diamond engagement rings each year. In 2012 alone, they spent nearly $11 billion on diamond engagement and wedding jewelry, according to Olya Linde, lead author of Bain & Company\u2019s 2013 Global Diamond Industry Report. At a time when many young people are facing big student debts, a weak job market and rising housing costs, this luxury purchase still appears to be firmly planted on many ring fingers across the country.The amount spent does tend to rise and fall with the broader economy, however, as it did in the latest boom and bust.Couples paid an average of $4,000 on engagement rings in 2012 (and another $1,000 for her wedding band, and $500 for his), according to a 2013 report from Jewelers of America, a trade group, using data from a variety of jewelers. That is about 25 percent less than the average spent on engagement rings in 2006, or $5,317, before the economy collapsed, according to another report by the group. In 2011, couples spent $3,538 on average.But arriving at the right amount to budget is something that many young people continue to struggle with, and retail analysts say that more people are beginning to use the credit programs offered by the largest national jewelry chains. Thinking about how that money might work harder for you invested elsewhere clearly saps all the romance out of the process. And as someone who grew up spending summers working in her family\u2019s small jewelry store, I am not opposed to celebrating the occasion, within reason, with something sparkly.If you invested an amount equal to the average ring price, or $4,000, the money would be worth nearly $8,800 after 20 years and almost $13,000 after 30 years.Of course, euphoric couples in love aren\u2019t thinking about supply and demand (or that the growing middle classes in China and India are driving growth in the latter), nor do they view the ring as an investment. Even if they did, it\u2019s not a terribly efficient value proposition, at least when you generally buy at retail and must sell at wholesale (and nobody initially plans to sell anyway).A ring with a 0.7 carat diamond that cost $4,895 on Blue Nile, an online jewelry retailer, might sell for 20 to 25 percent more at an average brick and mortar retailer, while the same size and quality ring could command at least 40 to 50 percent more at Tiffany or Cartier, said David Wu, a luxury goods and beauty analyst at the Telsey Advisory Group in New York.But what is interesting is that given how much has changed over the decades \u2014 men now snoop on their girlfriends\u2019 Pinterest boards for clues about what they really like, and couples often shop together \u2014 the fact that it\u2019s a purchase loaded with expectations persists.I spoke with about a dozen 20- and 30-somethings in the market for a ring, with budgets ranging from $1,500 to $25,000, and many of them, mostly men, admitted that they were concerned about appearances, which factored into their budget: I feel like I should keep up with people in our circle, said one. Her family is wealthier than mine, wrote another. The perception is that I earn a lot of money and should be able to spend in the same way, added another, who is earning a healthy salary now but has been in debt in the past.And the most popular refrain: She is going to wear it for the rest of her life.It is a purchase that is \u201cheavily driven by the heart and expectations,\u201d said Holly Wesche, owner of Wesche Jewelers in Melbourne, Fla., and whose family has been in the jewelry business for three generations. \u201cThey are not thinking about their college debt or the house. They are trying to make it happen.\u201dMany of the young and men and women I spoke with sounded relatively levelheaded about their spending plans \u2014 and the jewelers said that people tended to come into their stores highly educated on the topic and with a budget.But others seemed to set budgets arbitrarily. One 27-year-old graduate student based his number \u2014 $1,500 to $3,000 \u2014 on what he could afford to pay off on credit. A 31-year-old lawyer decided to spend half his monthly income, or $5,000.\u201cI found that coming up with a budget is difficult,\u201d said a 28-year-old consultant in Los Angeles, who wanted to remain anonymous because he had not yet proposed and did not want to make his concerns public. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to discuss.\u201dFor Ms. Kaprovsky and Mr. Veach, it was an open discussion. The couple thoroughly educated themselves on the \u201cfour C\u2019s\u201d \u2014 cut, clarity, color and carat weight \u2014 that factor into a diamond\u2019s value. They visited retailers in Pittsburgh, ranging from Zales to Tiffany, but ultimately bought a ring through Blue Nile: an elegant, hand-engraved platinum setting, which will showcase a round diamond, slightly shy of one carat.\u201cWe found our money values are pretty aligned,\u201d Ms. Kaprovsky said. \u201cWe are both relatively thrifty and do our research when making large purchases.\u201dIt is a powerful symbol. Even Mr. Veach joked about what wearing a cubic zirconia would say about their union. \u201cA diamond is a 10 on the Mohs scale,\u201d he told Ms. Kaprovksy, referring to the scale of mineral hardness, when making his case for buying the real thing. \u201cC.Z. is an eight. What am I saying \u2014 our relationship is only strong as about an eight out of 10?\u201dThat underscores the notion that the industry really isn\u2019t in the business of selling diamonds, as Martin Rapaport, publisher of the Rapaport Diamond Index, recently said. \u201cWe sell the idea behind diamonds.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indonesia Reports Biggest Trade Surplus in 2 Years", "Date": "2014-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Indonesia posted its third straight monthly trade surplus in December and its biggest in two years, data showed Monday, in a welcome sign for Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest economy amid turbulence in other emerging markets.The trade surplus in December totaled $1.52 billion, the largest since December 2011, the country\u2019s statistics bureau said. That followed a revised $790 million surplus in November.Indonesia\u2019s rupiah \u2014 one of the so-called Fragile Five emerging market currencies \u2014 slid more than 20 percent last year, stricken by investor unease about the country\u2019s high current account deficit and the effect of a reduction in the United States monetary stimulus.But the rupiah has held largely steady so far in 2014, helped in part by the Indonesian central bank, which has raised interest rates aggressively since June. The rupiah pared earlier losses and traded at 12,215 per dollar after the data on Monday.\u201cDefinitely, this is positive for sentiment in the markets, and it will be interesting how much of an impact this latest number will have on the current account data for\u201d the fourth quarter in 2013, said Gundy Cahyadi, an economist at DBS Bank in Singapore. \u201cWe have forecasted the current account deficit at 3.4 percent of G.D.P. in 2013, but now see some chance of it coming in slightly narrower than our expectations.\u201dBank Indonesia, the central bank, estimated that the overall 2013 current account deficit would be below 3 percent of gross domestic product, because of improving demand in the fourth quarter.Exports in December surged 10.33 percent from a year earlier, versus analysts\u2019 expectations for a 1.8 percent rise, while imports fell 0.79 percent, against a forecast 3.6 percent drop. For 2013, exports fell 3.92 percent and imports dropped 2.64 percent.Meanwhile, Indonesia\u2019s consumer price index rose 8.22 percent in January from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said Monday, after torrential rain and natural disasters disrupted activity. That marked the seventh straight month that annual inflation has stayed above 8 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Health Law Goals Face Antitrust Hurdles", "Date": "2014-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneWith the midterm elections fast coming into focus, politics in Washington will remain consumed by health care for months to come.The ruling against St. Luke\u2019s Health System\u2019s 2012 purchase of the Saltzer Medical Group underlined a potentially important conflict between the nation\u2019s antimonopoly laws and the Affordable Care Act. The new law has encouraged the creation of big, broad accountable care organizations, which are paid to keep patients healthy rather than for individual services.\u201cWe want to be providing a more coordinated product that delivers health care at a lower overall cost to the community we serve,\u201d Christine Neuhoff, general counsel at St. Luke\u2019s, told me. She suggested the hospital would most likely appeal the decision. \u201cThis was part of our implementation of that vision,\u201d she added.Paradoxically, Judge B. Lynn Winmill seemed to agree. In his decision, he noted that the merger, had he let it stand, would probably have improved patient outcomes: \u201cSt. Luke\u2019s is to be applauded,\u201d he wrote, \u201cfor its efforts to improve the delivery of health care in the Treasure Valley,\u201d which stretches west from Boise.Still, he slapped it down because the merged group, he reasoned, would be able to demand higher reimbursement rates from health insurers and raise rates for services like X-rays, pushing up health care costs for consumers. \u201cThere are other ways\u201d to obtain the desired efficiencies that \u201cdo not run such a risk of increased costs,\u201d he concluded.St. Luke\u2019s is not alone in pursuing this strategy. In the last few years, hospitals have been merging and snapping up physician networks to improve their bargaining power with health insurers and to capture a larger share of the patient pool. The new health care law provided extra motivation and a potential justification to boot.\u201cConsolidation has gone up a lot in the wake of the A.C.A.,\u201d said David Cutler, an economist at Harvard who specializes in the study of health care. \u201cA good deal of that is because the idea is to foster coordination within the health system, and coordination is often easier within a firm than between firms.\u201dTen years ago, hospitals owned a quarter of the physician practices in the country. By 2011, they owned half. A substantial majority of hospitals are now part of health systems, a trend that continues apace: 247 hospitals merged in 2012, according to the American Hospital Association, three times as many as in 2008.The urge to merge is bending many doctors out of shape. Marc Silver, an orthopedic surgeon in Stamford, Conn., said his practice declined to be absorbed by Stamford Hospital partly because it would mean a loss of freedom. Now he worries over lost referrals as the hospital moves everything in house. \u201cTheir rationale is all to feed the home base,\u201d he said.Herbert Coussons, an obstetrician and gynecologist in Green Bay, Wis., had similar concerns after the Bellin Health Systems took over a rival practice. \u201cThey think the only way to control the cost of health care is to employ everybody and manage it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether the hospital wants to work with independent groups any more.\u201dA family practice doctor under contract with a hospital in central Pennsylvania was too afraid to talk freely to me for attribution. \u201cI need to be very careful with issues that might be interpreted as a breach of my contract that could result in my termination with associated punitive consequences,\u201d he said.The relevant question, though, is whether this process will prove benign. Will it push the health care industry from the expensive fee-for-service model to one that does a better job at rewarding good outcomes while keeping a lid on costs? Or will it spawn oligopolies that can squash smaller rivals and charge whatever they want for care?\u201cIt\u2019s certainly true that the consolidation of physician groups and hospitals can lead to greater market power and higher charges to insurance companies,\u201d said Jonathan Skinner, a health care economist at Dartmouth. \u201cBut the insurance companies are creating narrower networks of providers. So providers who try to charge more risk getting dropped entirely from the now narrower network.\u201dThey contended that the consolidation of hospitals and doctors\u2019 practices, mostly aimed at increasing hospitals\u2019 bargaining clout, \u201chas not led to either improved quality or reduced costs.\u201dThey urged new policies to foster the quick replacement of fee-for-service models with bundled payments that encourage cost saving. And \u201cif there is no other way to obtain good care except through monopoly organizations,\u201d they wrote, policy makers could directly \u201cregulate prices or total spending.\u201dEmail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unemployment Filings Fall, Signaling Steady Job Gains", "Date": "2014-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, suggesting that the labor market continues to steadily improve despite severe weather that could hold back hiring again this month.Nevertheless, cold weather continues to damage the economy, with other reports on Thursday showing a surprise decline in factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region this month and a spike in electricity and heating fuel prices in January.\u201cWeather has definitely been a factor in keeping things slow,\u201d said Alan MacEachin, an economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Va. \u201cLooking at everything right now, I don\u2019t know how we can get a good picture for probably at least a couple of months.\u201dInitial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 336,000, the Labor Department said. The claims data covered the period for February\u2019s nonfarm payrolls count. Snowstorms slammed parts of the country last week, which could have kept some workers at home, and possibly held back payroll growth in February.Bitterly cold weather was blamed for a sharp slowing in hiring last December and for January\u2019s marginal rebound. But claims have consistently ranged from 325,000 to 348,000 this year, suggesting no fundamental shift in labor market conditions.The cold also is straining household budgets. In another report, the Labor Department said strong gains in the price of household energy had accounted for most of the 0.1 percent increase in its Consumer Price Index in January. The index advanced 0.2 percent last December. In January, electricity prices rose 1.8 percent, the largest gain since March 2010. Natural gas prices surged 3.6 percent. That was the largest increase since last April. The cost of heating oil jumped 3.7 percent, the biggest increase since September 2012.Over all, the figures showed inflation remained contained.

{"Headline": "Ukraine Rushes to Shift Power and Mend Rifts", "Date": "2014-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by9 PhotosKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukrainian lawmakers moved swiftly on Sunday to assert control over the government, racing to restore calm after a week of upheaval and bloodshed that ended in President Viktor F. Yanukovych\u2019s flight and ouster on Saturday, and in sudden fears that the country might fall into civil war. On Sunday, a series of bureaucratic events \u2014 a session of Parliament and the continued running of government institutions \u2014 seemed to pull the country back from the brink. As Parliament acted, even Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s party denounced him for the deadly crackdown on protesters. And the military vowed to support the new government rather than rallying to the ousted president\u2019s side. In its emergency session on Sunday, the Parliament granted expanded powers to its new speaker, Oleksandr V. Turchynov, who now has the authority to carry out the duties of the president of Ukraine as well. During his first formal address to the nation, in a recorded video that was broadcast on Sunday evening, Mr. Turchynov sought to soothe any remaining fear of the police and security services after clashes in Kiev last week left 82 people dead \u2014 the worst violence in Ukraine since its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. \u201cThe law enforcement structures are no longer threatening the life, health and security of the citizens of Ukraine,\u201d he said, wearing a dark blazer and black turtleneck and standing next to a Ukrainian flag outside the Parliament building.Mr. Turchynov, a veteran lawmaker who served previously as acting prime minister and as head of the security service, noted that Parliament had appointed an acting interior minister, who is in charge of the police, and had designated lawmakers to oversee the general prosecutor\u2019s office, the Defense Ministry and the security service. There were still some signs of unease on Sunday. The whereabouts of Mr. Yanukovych, who insisted in a statement on Saturday that he was still president, remained unknown. In several cities in eastern Ukraine, including Donetsk, which is Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s hometown, and Kharkiv, pro-Russian demonstrators took to the streets to denounce the developments in Kiev. The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, continued to insist that Ukrainian opposition leaders had \u201cseized power\u201d illegally, and the Kremlin recalled its ambassador to Kiev, citing chaos. Mr. Lavrov spoke by telephone with Secretary of State John Kerry, continuing a high-level dialogue on Ukraine, though Mr. Kerry voiced support for the Parliament\u2019s actions. But in a broader sense, there was still an easing of fears that a deepening schism could fracture Ukraine between the Russian-leaning east and south and the pro-European West. First, Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions even turned against him, issuing a strongly worded statement that said he was responsible for the deaths last week and accusing him of betraying the country. \u201cThe country finds itself deceived and robbed, but even this is nothing in comparison with the grief that dozens of Ukrainian families, who have lost their relatives, are feeling,\u201d the party wrote in a statement on its website. \u201cUkraine has been betrayed. Viktor Yanukovych and his team are responsible for this.\u201d Further assurance that stability had been re-established came from the military. A statement posted Saturday on the Defense Ministry website after Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s departure, and attributed to the ministry and the military, reaffirmed a commitment to the Constitution and expressed sorrow over the deaths in Kiev. \u201cPlease be assured that the armed forces of Ukraine cannot and will not be involved in any political conflict,\u201d the statement said. In a separate statement, the military chief of staff, Yuriy Ilyin, just recently appointed by Mr. Yanukovych, said, \u201cAs an officer I see no other way than to serve the Ukrainian people honestly and assure that I have not and won\u2019t give any criminal orders.\u201d Mr. Turchynov said in his address to the nation that he expected Parliament to name an acting prime minister and fill out a unity government by Tuesday. Former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko, who was jailed by Mr. Yanukovych after losing the 2010 presidential election and was freed on Saturday, issued a statement saying she did not want to be considered for the premier\u2019s post. Still, it left open the possibility that she will run for president. The Parliament began its emergency Sunday session by adopting a law restoring state ownership of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s opulent presidential palace, which he had privatized. After the residence, which is in a national park, was abandoned and then opened to the public, visitors reacted with fury and dismay at the astonishing display of wealth and excess, including separate collections of modern and antique cars and a private zoo.The vote to reclaim the palace was 323 to 0, with at least 106 lawmakers absent, most of them from the Party of Regions. One of the party\u2019s leaders, Volodymyr Rybak, who was ousted from the speaker\u2019s post in a similarly lopsided vote on Saturday, issued a statement on Sunday saying he intended to return to the Parliament. Other officials seemed to have fled for good. Arsen Avakov, who was installed by Parliament on Saturday as acting interior minister, told reporters on Sunday that an investigation had been opened into 30 or more officials who may have been responsible for the violence last week in Kiev. He also said border guards on Saturday had prevented the departure of a plane in eastern Ukraine with Mr. Yanukovych aboard, making it most likely that he was still in the country. The center of Kiev is scorched and scarred. The streets are blackened from fires set during clashes with the police. On Sunday, people placed flowers and candles at makeshift shrines memorializing the dead. Outside the Cabinet of Ministers building, parents had their small children pose for photographs with victorious antigovernment fighters who are still armed with clubs and wearing helmets, but now stand guard over the government headquarters. Many had flowers attached to their metal shields. To be sure, Kiev has quite a long way to go before it will feel normal again. Instead of trained police, irregular bands of antigovernment fighters now control and provide security at main government buildings, including the presidential residence, and enormous barriers of tires, scrap wood and other debris still close off the main protest zone. In a series of votes on Sunday, the Parliament dismissed the foreign minister, Leonid Kozhara; the education minister, Dmytro Tabachnyk; and the health minister, Raisa Bohatyriova.Several lawmakers said recreating the government was particularly urgent given Ukraine\u2019s perilous economic situation. Russia had come to Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s rescue in December with a $15 billion bailout and an offer of cheaper prices on natural gas. A $2 billion installment of that aid was canceled as part of a deal reached on Friday between Mr. Yanukovych and opposition leaders, and while Western officials have said they hope to offer assistance, it was unclear how quickly that help might arrive.Among the reasons Mr. Yanukovych turned away from signing political and trade accords with Europe in November was his unwillingness to carry out austerity measures and other reforms that the International Monetary Fund had demanded in exchange for a large assistance package.On Sunday, the fund\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, said that there was concern about the political instability in Ukraine and that the fund could provide assistance only in response to a formal request. But she added that an economic program to help Ukraine had to be \u201cowned by the authorities, by the people, because at the end of the day it will be the future of the Ukrainian economy.\u201dFor the moment, though, Mr. Turchynov, the interim leader, said the priority was to restore a sense of normalcy and unity. \u201cOur first task today is to stop confrontation, renew governance, management and legal order in the country,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe have to rebuke any displays of separatism and threats to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Yanukovych fled Kiev on Friday night to denounce what he called a violent coup, as his official residence, his vast, colonnaded office complex and other once impregnable centers of power fell without a fight to throngs of joyous citizens stunned by their triumph.While Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s nemesis, former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko, was released from a penitentiary hospital, Parliament found the president unable to fulfill his duties and exercised its constitutional powers on Saturday to set an election for May 25 to select his replacement. But with both Mr. Yanukovych and his Russian patrons speaking of a \u201ccoup\u201d carried out by \u201cbandits\u201d and \u201chooligans,\u201d it was far from clear that the day\u2019s lightning-quick events would be the last act in a struggle that has not just convulsed Ukraine but has also expanded into an East-West confrontation reminiscent of the Cold War.She addressed those in the audience as \u201cheroes,\u201d and told them: \u201cI was dreaming to see your eyes. I was dreaming to feel the power that changed everything.\u201dThough obviously in poor health, Ms. Tymoshenko is widely expected to run for president in the coming election, if it comes off as scheduled.At the presidential residence a short distance from the capital, protesters carrying clubs and wearing masks were in control of the entryways Saturday morning and watched as thousands of citizens strolled through the grounds in wonder. \u201cThis commences a new life for Ukraine,\u201d said Roman Dakus, a protester-turned-guard, who was wearing a ski helmet and carrying a length of pipe as he blocked a doorway at the compound. \u201cThis is only a start. We need now to make a new structure and a new system, a foundation for our future, with rights for everybody, and we need to investigate who ordered the violence.\u201dWith the riot police they battled for days having disappeared, the protesters claimed to be in charge of security for the city. There was no sign of looting, either in the city proper or in the presidential compound.A pugnacious Mr. Yanukovych appeared on television Saturday afternoon, apparently from the eastern city of Kharkiv, near Ukraine\u2019s eastern border with Russia, saying that he had been forced to leave the capital because of a \u201ccoup,\u201d and that he had not resigned, and had no plans to. He said indignantly that his car had been fired upon as he drove away.\u201cI don\u2019t plan to leave the country. I don\u2019t plan to resign,\u201d he said, speaking in Russian rather than Ukrainian, the country\u2019s official language. \u201cI am a legitimately elected president.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat is happening today, mostly, it is vandalism, banditism and a coup d'\u00e9tat. This is my assessment and I am deeply convinced of this. I will remain on the territory of Ukraine.\u201d He also complained of \u201ctraitors\u201d among his own former supporters but he declined to name them.Regional governors from eastern Ukraine met in Kharkiv and adopted a resolution resisting the authority of Parliament. They said that until matters were resolved, \u201cwe have decided to take responsibility for safeguarding the constitutional order, legality, citizens\u2019 rights and their security on our territories.\u201dThe former nerve center of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s power, the huge compound of the presidential administration, just a few hundred yards from Independence Square, was empty Saturday aside from protesters who patrolled its courtyard and blocked off a nearby street to prevent residents from swarming into the building. Ukrainian flags flying outside had all been lowered to half-mast, in honor of those killed by police officers and snipers on Thursday.Mr. Yanukovych said in his television appearance that he would be traveling to the southeastern part of Ukraine to talk to his supporters \u2014 a plan that carried potentially ominous overtones, in that the southeast is the location of Crimea, the historically Russian section of the country that is the site of a Russian naval base.With nobody clearly in charge, other than the so far remarkably disciplined fighting squads, lieutenants of Ms. Tymoshenko moved to fill the power vacuum. With Oleksandr V. Turchynov, a former acting prime minister and close ally of Ms. Tymoshenko, presiding over the Parliament, her Fatherland party seemed to be in charge, at least temporarily.With a veto-proof majority of more than 300 of the 450 seats, Mr. Turchynov guided the Parliament through the constitutional process of declaring the president unable to fulfill his duties and setting a date for new elections.But with Mr. Yanukovych roaming around eastern Ukraine trying to rally support and with the economy in free fall, the country seemed certain to face severe new challenges in the months ahead. Adding to the combustible mix was uncertainty over the intentions of Russia, which now faces the loss of a key ally in a former Soviet republic and the prospect of a new government led by people it scorned as terrorists and fascists in what it considers a critical part of its own sphere of influence.It was possibly with the Kremlin in mind that the White House issued a statement Saturday welcoming the changes and stressing that, \u201cThe unshakable principle guiding events must be that the people of Ukraine determine their own future.\u201dAmerican officials said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia told President Obama in a telephone call on Friday that he would work toward resolving the crisis, but his foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, did not sound as conciliatory. In a telephone call, he told the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Poland, who helped mediate a short-lived peace deal agreed on Friday, that opposition leaders who signed the accord with Mr. Yanukovych had reneged on their commitments and were \u201cfollowing the lead of armed extremists and pogromists, whose actions pose a direct threat to Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and constitutional order.\u201dRussia\u2019s focus on the inviolability of Friday\u2019s accord, however, marks an abrupt change of direction as it had earlier distanced itself from the deal, with its envoy to the Ukraine negotiations refusing to join European diplomats in signing off on the accord.Anticipating the potential troubles, one of the president\u2019s oldest and most stalwart allies, the billionaire businessman Rinat Akhmetov, issued a statement stressing the need to keep Ukraine \u201cunited,\u201d an apparent rebuff to any schemes to establish a new power center in the east.\u201cMy position remains unchanged: I am for a strong, independent and united Ukraine,\u201d said Mr. Akhmetov, Ukraine\u2019s richest man. \u201cToday I place a special focus on the word \u2018united\u2019 as this has never been more important.\u201d Mr. Akhmetov and most other wealthy businessmen, who are known as oligarchs, have infuriated protesters by declining throughout months of protest to come out clearly against the president.Having amassed huge wealth under a deeply corrupt system headed by Mr. Yanukovych since his election in 2010, Ukraine\u2019s oligarchs could now face an angry backlash from the street. That could well drag in Oleksandr Yanukovych, the president\u2019s dentist-turned-businessman son, who is said to have amassed a fortune approaching $200 million since his father took office.The economy will remain the greatest problem facing the country, once the leadership questions are settled. The International Monetary Fund remains a potential source of financing to replace the $15 billion that Russia had made available before the protests. But that comes with an insistence on austerity and economic changes that will inflict considerable pain, and it is unclear if Europe or the United States will be willing to do more.\u201cNobody wants to end up owning all the problems that Ukraine faces,\u201d said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, \u201cthe country is bankrupt, it has a terrible, broken system of government and insane levels of corruption.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption in a slide show with this article misstated the location of the presidential palace. It is near the capital, Kiev, not within it.An article on Feb. 23 about the fall of President Viktor F. Yanukovych of Ukraine and his flight from the capital, Kiev, misstated the day of his departure. He left the evening of Friday, Feb. 21, not Saturday, Feb. 22.

Nor does Mr. Putin\u2019s rule face any foreseeable challenge, something even a determined critic like Mr. Navalny acknowledged. Mr. Putin\u2019s approval rating, bolstered by lavishly positive coverage on state television, remains as high as when he first came to office.Hosting the Olympics, however, seems to have lost some of the luster officials expected for Russia\u2019s prestige at home and abroad, much to the frustration of Mr. Putin\u2019s supporters.The Olympics have refocused international attention on the hard-line policies Mr. Putin\u2019s government has pursued since he returned to the presidency in 2012 after four years as prime minister, and prompted calls for protests and even boycotts.The list is long: Russia\u2019s support for Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, and its efforts to keep Ukraine out of the European Union; its prosecution of political opponents, real and perceived; its restrictions on foreign adoptions; the passage of a law last year banning the distribution of gay \u201cpropaganda\u201d to children; and its recent campaign to choke off the only independent television news channel on the pretext of questioning the Soviet Union\u2019s victory following the Siege of Leningrad, which ended 70 years ago.\u201cThe Games are supposed to be outside of politics,\u201d Aleksandr D.

{"Headline": "In Governors\u2019 Races This Year, Lessons for 2016", "Date": "2014-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADISON, Wis. \u2014 Three years after stripping public employee unions of the right to collectively bargain, Gov. Scott Walker began this election year by introducing workers who had found jobs since he took office. A dozen stood with him in the State Capitol, dressed for the workplace: a nursing assistant, an accountant, a maintenance technician at Milwaukee Valve.And with that election-year message, he was off last week to Dallas to collect contributions at the home of a real estate billionaire, Harlan Crow \u2014 a testament to the national profile his antiunion efforts, tax cuts and victory in a bitter recall election have gained him with major Republican donors.Mr. Walker is one of eight new Republican governors facing re-election who swept into office in 2010 in states that President Obama won two years earlier, driven by the Tea Party at the height of its influence. Mr. Obama clawed back in 2012 to win each state again.Two of the eight, Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico and Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada, so far do not have competitive opponents. Gov. Rick Scott of Florida and Gov. Paul R. Le Page of Maine look more vulnerable with low favorability ratings.But perhaps the most closely watched races will be in four Northern industrial states whose white working-class voters were once solidly Democratic but are now up for grabs. Besides Mr. Walker, the Rustbelt Four are Govs. Rick Snyder of Michigan, John R. Kasich of Ohio and Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania.Their aging industrial economies lag behind the rest of the nation. But compared with 2010, when recession-era unemployment spiked near double digits, the improved jobs picture in all four states will buff the incumbents\u2019 images. Organized labor, fighting in its traditional heartland, has identified the four as top targets this year.How the governors fare will say a lot about whether their conservative policies provide a template for their party\u2019s ability to appeal to independents and wavering Democrats in 2016, or whether those voters can be coaxed back to the Democrats.Mr. Walker argues that Wisconsin offers a lesson to his party nationally. \u201cThe perception of many across America is Republicans in Washington are the party of \u2018no,\u2019 they\u2019re just against things,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be about austerity. We should be about reform. We should spell out a clear message about how we\u2019re going to reform things. I think what voters are hungry for in battleground states is leadership.\u201dMr. Walker\u2019s likely Democratic opponent, Mary Burke, argues that his claims of rebuilding the state\u2019s job market are smoke and mirrors. \u201cThe fact is we\u2019ve actually been creating jobs at a slower rate than all of our neighbors,\u201d she said.In all, there are 36 governor\u2019s races this year, a map that is friendly to Democrats.\u201cThe one thing we know is Democrats are going to pick up seats,\u201d said Jennifer Duffy, an analyst with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. \u201cMaybe not as many as they like.\u201dNational Democratic groups hope to take back the four executive mansions held by Rust Belt Republicans by attacking on social and economic issues \u2014 the incumbents\u2019 cuts to education, their opposition to raising the minimum wage and abortion restrictions they signed into law.\u201cThey\u2019ve all fostered hostility and divisiveness despite running as moderate technocrats,\u201d said Danny Kanner, a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association, which bought its first television ads of the 2014 cycle in Michigan, attacking Mr. Snyder. \u201cOn the economy, they gave huge tax cuts to the wealthiest and corporations. They paid for it by raising middle-class taxes, and because that wasn\u2019t enough, they cut education.\u201dMr. Walker\u2019s bitter 2011 showdown with the unions made him a national figure. He remains a hero of the Republican grass roots and a favorite of wealthy donors like the billionaire David H. Koch, who founded a nonprofit group that contributed heavily to the governor\u2019s campaign to avoid a recall. That appeal to the party\u2019s base and its donor class has some conservative pundits and strategists banging the drum for a presidential bid.Mr. Walker, who insists that his focus is on 2014, seems to gain in stature each day that enthusiasm for Gov. Chris Christie, Republican of New Jersey, ebbs in the scandal over the closing of bridge lanes.But Mr. Walker has also helped polarize his battleground state. A Marquette University Law School poll last month showed his job approval reaching a high \u2014 of just 51 percent.Democrats are hoping that Ms. Burke, a former state commerce secretary and Trek bicycle executive, can rival the governor on business credibility and present a contrast on social issues. In the poll, Ms. Burke trailed 47 percent to 41 percent.The law that Republicans forced through to weaken teachers\u2019 and other public workers\u2019 unions, she argued, hurt the economy, slowing job creation.Even the Democratic mayor of Columbus recently said Republicans should consider Mr. Kasich as presidential material.Like other incumbents, he has a hefty fund-raising edge over his Democratic opponent, Ed FitzGerald, a former F.B.I. agent and the executive of Cuyahoga County.\u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about the poor, the weakest among them, you don\u2019t go down the path this governor has,\u201d said Chris Redfern, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party.Mr. Snyder cast himself as \u201cone tough nerd\u201d in 2010, a nonideological technocrat.He has put in place an emergency manager to take Detroit through its bankruptcy struggle. If he can win 20 percent of that city\u2019s voters, \u201cit would be game over,\u201d said Susan J. Demas, editor of Inside Michigan Politics.Mr. Schauer, a former congressman from Battle Creek who is little known in southeast Michigan, introduced himself in the Detroit media market through the recent ads paid for with $1 million from the Democratic Governors Association.Pennsylvania is the Rust Belt state where Democrats have the greatest prospects.Mr. Corbett, who has a transportation law that finances bridges and highways to his credit but has failed to advance other parts of his agenda, suffered from a job approval of just 23 percent in a recent Franklin & Marshall College Poll.Allyson Y. Schwartz, a congresswoman from the Philadelphia suburbs who is an early favorite among seven Democrats seeking Mr. Corbett\u2019s job, criticized the governor for failing to better regulate natural gas drilling, cutting education money and dragging his heels on Medicaid expansion.\u201cThe people are so ready for a change,\u201d she said.If the other Republicans in the Rust Belt are trying to moderate their message, Mr. Walker in Wisconsin argues that independent voters do not want Republicans to move to the center.It is the lesson he draws from the unusual 2012 electoral year in Wisconsin. In June, Mr. Walker won his recall election by 7 percentage points. A few months later Mr. Obama carried the state by the same 7 points. The governor calls these \u201cObama-Walker voters,\u201d independents who voted for both.\u201cI argue the way you win the center, which is key to winning battleground states, is not to run to the center; it\u2019s to lead, it\u2019s to be bold,\u201d he said.Ms. Burke, his opponent, has a different view of the Obama-Walker voters: they lean Democratic but thought Mr. Walker deserved to complete his term. \u201cWe\u2019re fair-minded in Wisconsin,\u201d she said. \u201cThere used to be more working across the aisle, finding common ground. I believe we can get back to that.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about the re-election campaigns of eight Republican governors who swept into office four years ago misstated the total number of governor\u2019s races this year.

{"Headline": "Encouraging Signs in Japan\u2019s Drive Against Deflation", "Date": "2014-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 The rate of core consumer inflation in Japan rose at the fastest pace in more than five years in December and the job market improved, encouraging signs for the country\u2019s central bank as it seeks to vanquish deflation with aggressive money printing.Factory output also grew in December, and manufacturers expect to keep increasing production, although some analysts fret about potential damage from the recent turmoil in emerging markets.The data released Friday point to an economy that continues to pick up momentum on strong domestic demand. But Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor of the Bank of Japan, expressed some caution about export demand, as many of Japan\u2019s Asian trading partners remain weak.Core consumer prices, which exclude fresh food but include energy costs, rose 1.3 percent in December from the same month a year earlier, the data showed, just above a median market forecast for a 1.2 percent gain. That followed a 1.2 percent increase in November, and was the fastest year-over-year gain since 1.9 percent in October 2008, the data showed.In 2013, Japan\u2019s core consumer prices rose 0.4 percent, the first increase in five years.In a further sign that price gains are broadening, the so-called core-core inflation index, which excludes food and energy prices and is similar to the core index used in the United States, rose 0.7 percent in December compared with the previous year, matching a high hit in August 1998.\u201cThe core consumer price index was stronger than expected, and durable goods prices seem to be rebounding,\u201d said Junko Nishioka, chief economist at RBS Securities. \u201cConsumer prices will likely continue moderate growth. I think the B.O.J. is unlikely to adopt additional easing because there is no reason to justify it given the positive macroeconomic environment.\u201dCore consumer prices, which exclude fresh food but include energy costs, rose 1.3 percent in December from the same month the previous year, data showed on Friday, just above a median market forecast for a 1.2 percent gain. That follows a 1.2 percent increase in November, and marks the fastest year-over-year gain since 1.9 percent in October 2008, data from the Japanese statistics bureau showed.In 2013, Japan\u2019s core consumer prices rose 0.4 percent, the first increase in five years.In a further sign that price gains are broadening, the so-called core-core inflation index, which excludes food and energy prices and is similar to the core index used in the United States, rose 0.7 percent in December compared with the previous year, matching a high hit in August 1998.Japan\u2019s industrial output rose 1.1 percent in December, suggesting that robust domestic demand is underpinning the economy as consumers rush to beat an increase in the national sales tax that is coming in April. The demand is making up for soft exports to emerging markets. The rise in industrial output roughly matched a median market forecast of a 1.2 percent increase, and followed a 0.1 percent drop in November.The jump in output is a welcome sign for an economy that has steadily recovered over the past year on the back of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s fiscal and monetary stimulus policies.Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expect output to rise 6.1 percent in January and increase 0.3 percent in February, data showed on Friday.Robust domestic demand, coupled with a weak yen that inflates import costs, helped Japan pass the halfway mark toward achieving the central bank\u2019s target of 2 percent inflation.However, a recent sell-off in emerging-market stocks and currencies has reminded investors that Japan still faces risks that a renewed downturn in overseas economies will sap demand for Japanese goods.\u201cOne reason Japan\u2019s exports have struggled to pick up momentum is that emerging Asean countries that Japan has a close relationship with have not recovered as quickly as expected,\u201d Mr. Kuroda, the central bank chief, told Parliament. \u201cThese economies are expected to recover, but we cannot say this will apply to every case.\u201dMr. Kuroda has expressed confidence that prices will reach the bank\u2019s target in the two-year time frame it pledged when adopting an aggressive stimulus policy last April. But an International Monetary Fund official has said Japan\u2019s economy is likely to take longer to reach the inflation goal, even though prices are rising steadily.Many analysts remain skeptical on whether price growth will accelerate, worried about an expected slump in consumption after the tax increase and the fading price support from the weak yen.Annual wage negotiations, which take place in the spring, will be an important test of whether labor unions can secure higher salaries needed to help consumer spending weather the tax increase.Advertisement"}

Crew or Banana Republic, and men can find that coveted perfect fit by using a height and weight calculator on his site that directs them to one of six sizes.\u201cIt\u2019s classic American sportswear for guys 5-foot-8 and under who are thin, stout or somewhere in-between,\u201d said Mr. Manning, who indicated that he has had 5,000 web orders and doubled his business in the second nine months after he started it. \u201cThe clothes are going to fit properly, and when that happens, you look taller, trimmer and just overall better.\u201dHis line is one of several new clothing companies designed for body types once considered marginal, including Willis & Walker for men 6-foot-2 and taller; Frame Denim, which has a line for statuesque women; and Fashion to Figure, for women\u2019s sizes 12 to 26.This kind of specialization isn\u2019t new \u2014 companies such as Lane Bryant for plus-size women and Destination XL Group, which has a slew of stores throughout the country for big and tall men, have been around for decades \u2014 but the ones today are less stigma, more style.Their success is also standing out in a saturated market, according to Pamela Danziger, the founder of Unity Marketing, a retail consulting firm in Stevens, Pa. \u201cThere are so many clothing companies out there, and one of the few ways new ones can have any leverage is by tapping into niches,\u201d she said.Marshal Cohen, the chief industry analyst for the NPD Group, a market research firm in Port Washington, N.Y., said that niche brands are the fastest growing in today\u2019s economy. \u201cThey have the biggest opportunity to make money,\u201d he said.One reason such brands are thriving, according to both Ms. Danziger and Mr. Cohen, is that unlike most shoppers who are overwhelmed by choice, the consumers who buy them have limited options and tend to be loyalists.George Stephanopoulos, for example, the co-anchor of \u201cGood Morning America\u201d who is 5-foot-6 and weighs about 150 pounds, said that Mr. Manning\u2019s sweaters, khakis, sport shirts and shorts are now his weekend staples.\u201cBefore, I would buy pants, and the waist might work but the length had to be taken up or with shirts, the neck was a perfect fit but the sleeves were too long,\u201d he said. \u201cPeter\u2019s clothes have it right without any tailoring, and they look good, too.\u201dAt a strapping 7 feet tall, Mr. Willis, 57, said that he couldn\u2019t even find the basics growing up. \u201cMy mom used to buy two pairs of pants, cut the bottoms off one and sew them on the other to make them long enough,\u201d he said. \u201cBut guys like me shouldn\u2019t have to fit the scraps.\u201dThe pieces, which are sold at Saks Fifth Avenue in Atlanta, Houston and Chicago as well as the Willis & Walker flagship boutique in Atlanta, range from $125 V-neck T-shirts to $1,500 suits, with jeans (in more than a dozen styles, including coated and distressed) being the best-selling category.Another retired N.B.A. player, the television commentator Charles Barkley, who is 6-foot-6, said he owns more than 20 pairs, which he wears several times a week. \u201cI like being comfortable and looking good,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd being a big guy, I never had the luxury of choice when it came to my wardrobe until now.\u201dMs. Fraser, a human resources assistant who lives in Springfield Gardens, Queens, is 5-foot-7 and wears a size 14. She said she visits the Fashion to Figure store at Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream, N.Y., at least once a month to buy tops, dresses and pants.\u201cUnlike other lines for fuller-figured women, which have no style, this one makes the same kind of clothing that\u2019s out there for smaller people,\u201d she said.Michael Kaplan helped found Fashion to Figure with his brother Nicholas after a childhood spent around the business; their great-grandmother was Lane Bryant, and their father became the chief executive of the company. The latest generation describes their venture as an H & M for plus-size women.The clothes are restocked daily and include recent fashion fads such as color blocking and Aztec prints. \u201cCutting-edge clothes for bigger women were sorely lacking, and that\u2019s what we offer,\u201d Michael Kaplan said.Hitha Prabhakar, the founder of AitchPe Retail Advisory, a firm that specializes in retail analysis and fashion commentary, says plus-size clothing for women is a category whose time has come. \u201cThere is great interest and demand for nice clothes in larger sizes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s already an existing market, and now it\u2019s branching out beyond plain-Jane type of clothes.\u201dThe numbers back her up: NPD data show that sales of all women\u2019s apparel grew one-half of 1 percent between December 2012 and November 2013, to $111.5 billion from $111 billion, while sales of plus-size women\u2019s apparel in that same time period increased roughly 7 percent, to $16.3 billion from $15.1 billion.They began to specialize after a conversation with the model Karlie Kloss over a dinner in Paris. In an email interview, they said that Ms. Kloss, a friend, told them she could not wear most denim because of her height, 6-foot-1, and they decided to collaborate on a line that they named Forever Karlie (Ms. Kloss has no financial investment in the line).The two styles, skinny and flare, have a 40-inch inseam compared with the industry average of 30 to 32 inches, and cost around $200 on Net-a-Porter, Barneys New York and Nordstrom. They have become a staple among that subset of fashion-forward women who resemble models.Chelsea Zalopany, 26, the market editor for Vogue.com, is close to 6 feet tall; she said that until she discovered Frame, every pair of jeans used to hit her ankle. \u201cI love to wear denim, and this is the first pair I\u2019ve worn where there is no compromise in fit and aesthetic,\u201d she said.To be sure, these types of niche companies still made up an insignificant part of the $355 billion that Americans spent on clothes last year, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t be profitable. \u201cEven a 2 percent market share represents lots of opportunity for these companies to make money,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.Eric Jennings, the men\u2019s fashion director for Saks, has faith that Willis & Walker will make money for the department store, too. It is the only niche name the store carries for men, although other brands offer long and short sizing and it performs \u201cespecially well\u201d when there is an event for it that Mr. Willis attends, Mr. Jennings said.But beyond the bottom line, at issue is what effect these clothes have for the people who wear them.Ms. Zalopany says that the Frame jeans have given her a newfound fashion freedom. \u201cThey are long enough that I can wear them with heels or roll up the bottoms for a more laid-back look, which used to be nonexistent options,\u201d she said.Garry Shaw, 43, a multimedia content creator in Greensboro, N.C., said that Mr. Manning\u2019s clothes have significantly improved his self-esteem, saved him hundreds of dollars in tailoring and won admiration from his wife.\u201cFashion has never been a priority for me because I couldn\u2019t play the game,\u201d Mr. Shaw said. \u201cNow for the first time, I feel confident and sexy. These were words that have never been in my vocabulary until now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Getting Stares on the Streets of Cambodia: Buses for the Masses", "Date": "2014-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2014 This city of nearly two million people has many of the amenities of a modern metropolis \u2014 broadband Internet, automated teller machines and fancy restaurants, to name a few. But until this month, the capital of Cambodia had no public transportation system. To get around, residents had to inure themselves to perilous rides on motorcycle taxis or dust-smothered commutes in open three-wheeled tuk-tuks.Now, in an experiment underwritten by the Japanese government, Phnom Penh is giving the relatively alien concept of public city buses a try. Ten buses are making their way up and down Monivong Boulevard, one of the city\u2019s main thoroughfares, for a month to see if they catch on with Cambodians.Egami Masahiko, representative of the Japan International Cooperation Agency, said that with Cambodia\u2019s economy growing steadily and the streets of Phnom Penh choked with traffic, the timing was right. Mass transit, he said, is \u201cfundamental infrastructure for a modern city.\u201dSince the buses began running Feb. 5, curious residents have been climbing aboard just for a test ride.\u201cWe don\u2019t know where we are going,\u201d said one rider, a 13-year-old high school student, staring out the window one recent morning. It was her first time on a bus, she said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a new experience.\u201dCambodia has plenty of private buses that ferry people across the countryside and connect provincial cities with the capital. But developing mass transit within Phnom Penh has until now ranked low on the priority list in a country where one-third of the population does not have running water.The genocidal rule of the Khmer Rouge, which ended in 1979, damaged the country\u2019s social fabric so badly that Cambodians came to assume that in many facets of life, including transportation, they were mostly on their own.Some riders on the new Japanese-sponsored buses in the capital said that the lack of a public transportation system was emblematic of a country where government assistance was rare and civic-mindedness in short supply.\u201cPeople here don\u2019t have a long vision,\u201d said Khem Vannary, an actress on Cambodian television and an enthusiastic adopter of the bus experiment. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand how a bus can improve their lives.\u201d Ms. Vannary lamented the unruliness she said she saw in the streets, where traffic laws are rarely enforced. She described Phnom Penh\u2019s traffic as a free-for-all, comparing it to \u201cchildren refusing to obey their parents,\u201d and wondered whether the bus service would prove effective. An earlier experiment, sponsored by Japan in 2001, ended after several weeks.The new experiment, relying on rented buses and temporary staff, appears to have rapidly won admirers. The buses are often packed at rush hour, and a supervisor of the line says that about 3,000 people are using them daily.Ticket collectors wear shirts that say, \u201cTake the bus for a better future of Phnom Penh.\u201d And yet the immediate future of public transportation remains cloudy. The government has yet to set many of the specifics, including the starting date, for a permanent service that will follow if the one-month experiment is deemed a success. Mr. Egami, the Japanese agency\u2019s representative, emphasizes the importance of low fares to lure customers. He said he doubted that a public transportation system could be run at a profit, at least in the early stages. \u201cIt will require a subsidy,\u201d he said.That appeared to be at odds with the city government\u2019s intentions. Long Dimanche, a spokesman for the Phnom Penh municipality, said that it had chosen a private company to run the buses and that \u201cthere will be no subsidy.\u201d The contractor \u201chas expertise,\u201d Mr. Dimanche said, but he declined to identify the company.\u201cIf everything works out,\u201d he said, a permanent service will begin this year.If it does, many city residents may need a quick primer on the ins and outs of bus riding.Khay Sovanvisal, a supervisor on the experiment, said he was constantly fielding questions from curious people who wandered past his white canvas tent at one terminus of the route. He hands out about 500 brochures a day, listing the fare \u2014 1,500 riels (less than 40 cents) \u2014 and declaring that it \u201cis not too expensive.\u201dA woman hurried up to Mr. Sovanvisal, apologized for interrupting and asked what time her relative, who had boarded the bus on the other side of the city, would arrive at this end of the line.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d Mr. Sovanvisal said patiently. \u201cThe bus comes every 10 minutes. It depends which one she\u2019s on.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Stimulus Tragedy", "Date": "2014-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive years have passed since President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \u2014 the \u201cstimulus\u201d \u2014 into law. With the passage of time, it has become clear that the act did a vast amount of good. It helped end the economy\u2019s plunge; it created or saved millions of jobs; it left behind an important legacy of public and private investment.It was also a political disaster. And the consequences of that political disaster \u2014 the perception that stimulus failed \u2014 have haunted economic policy ever since.Let\u2019s start with the good the stimulus did.The case for stimulus was that we were suffering from a huge shortfall in overall spending, and that the hit to the economy from the financial crisis and the bursting of the housing bubble was so severe that the Federal Reserve, which normally fights recessions by cutting short-term interest rates, couldn\u2019t overcome this slump on its own. The idea, then, was to provide a temporary boost both by having the government directly spend more and by using tax cuts and public aid to boost family incomes, inducing more private spending.What about positive evidence for the benefits of stimulus? That\u2019s trickier, because it\u2019s hard to disentangle the effects of the Recovery Act from all the other things that were going on at the time. Nonetheless, most careful studies have found evidence of strong positive effects on employment and output.So why does everyone \u2014 or, to be more accurate, everyone except those who have seriously studied the issue \u2014 believe that the stimulus was a failure? Because the U.S. economy continued to perform poorly \u2014 not disastrously, but poorly \u2014 after the stimulus went into effect.There\u2019s a long-running debate over whether the Obama administration could have gotten more. The administration compounded the damage with excessively optimistic forecasts, based on the false premise that the economy would quickly bounce back once confidence in the financial system was restored.In other words, the overall narrative of the stimulus is tragic. A policy initiative that was good but not good enough ended up being seen as a failure, and set the stage for an immensely destructive wrong turn. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Global Bond Frenzy Raises Concerns", "Date": "2014-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProspecting for oil in Brazil, manufacturing steel in Russia, erecting skyscrapers in China: Global bond investors have financed some of the grandest investment projects taken on by emerging economies in recent years.But as growth falters in a number of developing nations, economists and regulators have become increasingly worried about the consequences of this borrowing frenzy and the risk that the mutual funds and hedge funds that have largely replaced more stable commercial banks as global financiers might all decide to rush for exits at the same time.\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that the market got a little overexuberant,\u201d said Scott A. Mather, the head of global portfolio management at the mutual fund giant Pimco. \u201cMany years of private sector credit growth have created serious vulnerabilities.\u201dAnalysts point out that compared to the Asian financial crisis in 1997, the borrowing binge this time is being funded largely by global bond investors and includes companies outside Asia as well. Unlike two decades ago, governments of developing countries have built up substantial foreign exchange reserves and are better able to weather any crisis. Still, fears remain that any panicky selling of Chinese, Russian or Brazilian bonds could turn into a financial rout. And over a longer stretch, the broader question is the potential effect from a closing of the once-welcoming global bond market to borrowers in regions of the world that have been driving growth in recent years.The underlying problem, Mr. Mather said, is that bond investors with little or no experience in emerging markets piled in to pursue higher yields than they could get from safer government securities in the United States and elsewhere, snapping up the bond issues of companies with even riskier credit profiles.The stampede has led to a so-called mirage of liquidity in which many investors may have been misled into thinking that selling the securities will be as easy as buying them was.\u201cThe liquidity is much worse now than before the crisis,\u201d Mr. Mather said.Since the Federal Reserve began its aggressive bond buying program, driving interest rates in the United States to lows not seen in decades, high-yielding international bonds issued by nongovernment emerging market borrowers have doubled.Total bonds outstanding are now at a record high of $2 trillion, according to a new report by Merrill Lynch that warns of the consequences of this explosion in emerging market debt and the shift away from traditional bank loans.Bond market veterans like Petrobras, the Brazilian energy concern that has issued close to $30 billion worth of foreign currency bonds in the last four years, are still leading the parade.Petrobras is an investment-grade issuer; it issues bonds at relatively low interest rates because its oil and gas projects are considered to be ultrasecure.But more worrisome are the high-yield or junk bonds, issued by, among others, steel companies in Russia and property developers in China. One particularly popular borrower has been Country Garden, a Chinese developer that has issued $4.2 billion in bonds since late 2009.Most recently, in the autumn, the company raised $750 million by issuing seven-year bonds at an interest rate of 7.5 percent; the deal was so popular, bankers say, that it was oversubscribed by $18 billion. Like other risky bonds, Country Garden securities sold off aggressively in recent weeks, with the yield hitting 8.4 percent before regaining some strength in recent days.As growth disappoints and profits suffer, some of these borrowers are defaulting on their debts. Among the largest defaults was the implosion of OGX, a Brazilian energy conglomerate that went bust recently; others include Mexican home builders and Kazakh banks.\u201cI think this is definitely coloring the expectations of investors,\u201d said Richard Segal, an emerging market bond analyst at Jefferies in London.The report said that more than $1.5 trillion had flowed into bond funds in the last five years \u2014 far outpacing other segments like equities and money markets \u2014 and pointed out that large asset management entities such as Pimco, BlackRock, Capital Research and Fidelity had been the main beneficiaries of these inflows.By contrast, the agency\u2019s decision to highlight this risk factor has drawn the support of several influential economists, including Hyun Song Shin, a financial economist at Princeton and the incoming head of research at the Bank for International Settlements, the idea factory based in Basel, Switzerland, catering to global central banks.\u201cWe have never seen anything like this before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is unprecedented, and it is dangerous.\u201dMr. Shin also worries that regulators, in pushing hard for big banks to increase their cash reserves, are missing the more critical issue: Aggressive borrowers in some of the larger emerging markets have been relying on fickle bond investors to fund their investments. And those investors are becoming nervous about their exposure to these economies, threatening to choke off the funding pipeline.\u201cIt may not be an acute crisis,\u201d Mr. Shin said. \u201cBut it will be slow and simmering and the impact on global growth will be damaging.\u201dA picture caption on Thursday with an article about the consequences of a global borrowing frenzy misidentified the building that was shown.

{"Headline": "Fast Internet Is Chattanooga\u2019s New Locomotive", "Date": "2014-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySteve Clark, a senior vice president for the city-owned utility in Chattanooga that offers a fiber-optic Internet service to residents, which transfers data at one gigabit per second. \u201cGig City,\u201d as Chattanooga is sometimes called, has what city officials and analysts say was the first and fastest \u2014 and now one of the least expensive \u2014 high-speed Internet services in the United States.CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. \u2014 For thousands of years, Native Americans used the river banks here to cross a gap in the Appalachian Mountains, and trains sped through during the Civil War to connect the eastern and western parts of the Confederacy. In the 21st century, it is the Internet that passes through Chattanooga, and at lightning speed.\u201cGig City,\u201d as Chattanooga is sometimes called, has what city officials and analysts say was the first and fastest \u2014 and now one of the least expensive \u2014 high-speed Internet services in the United States. For less than $70 a month, consumers enjoy an ultrahigh-speed fiber-optic connection that transfers data at one gigabit per second. That is 50 times the average speed for homes in the rest of the country, and just as rapid as service in Hong Kong, which has the fastest Internet in the world.It takes 33 seconds to download a two-hour, high-definition movie in Chattanooga, compared with 25 minutes for those with an average high-speed broadband connection in the rest of the country. Movie downloading, however, may be the network\u2019s least important benefit.\u201cIt created a catalytic moment here,\u201d said Sheldon Grizzle, the founder of the Company Lab, which helps start-ups refine their ideas and bring their products to market. \u201cThe Gig,\u201d as the taxpayer-owned, fiber-optic network is known, \u201callowed us to attract capital and talent into this community that never would have been here otherwise.\u201dSince the fiber-optic network switched on four years ago, the signs of growth in Chattanooga are unmistakable. Former factory buildings on Main Street and Warehouse Row on Market Street have been converted to loft apartments, open-space offices, restaurants and shops. The city has welcomed a new population of computer programmers, entrepreneurs and investors. Lengthy sideburns and scruffy hipster beards \u2014 not the norm in eastern Tennessee \u2014 are de rigueur for the under-30 set.\u201cThis is a small city that I had never heard of,\u201d said Toni Gemayel, a Florida native who moved his software start-up, Banyan, from Tampa to Chattanooga because of the Internet speed. \u201cIt beat Seattle, New York, San Francisco in building the Gig. People here are thinking big.\u201dBut so far, it is unclear statistically how much the superfast network has contributed to economic activity in Chattanooga over all. Although city officials said the Gig created about 1,000 jobs in the last three years, the Department of Labor reported that Chattanooga still had a net loss of 3,000 jobs in that period, mostly in government, construction and finance.EPB, the city-owned utility formerly named Electric Power Board of Chattanooga, said that only about 3,640 residences, or 7.5 percent of its Internet-service subscribers, are signed up for the Gigabit service offered over the fiber-optic network. Roughly 55 businesses also subscribe. The rest of EPB\u2019s customers subscribe to a (relatively) slower service offered on the network of 100 megabits per second, which is still faster than many other places in the country.Some specialists say the low subscriber and employment numbers are not surprising or significant, at least in the short term. \u201cThe search for statistical validation of these projects is not going to turn up anything meaningful,\u201d said Blair Levin, executive director of Gig.U, a high-speed Internet project that includes more than three dozen American research universities. Mr. Levin cited \u201cSolow\u2019s paradox,\u201d the 1987 observation by Robert M. Solow, a recipient of the Nobel in economic science who wrote that \u201cyou can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.\u201dSuch is the case with many new technologies, Mr. Levin said. No one is going to design products that can run only on a one-gigabit-per-second network if no such networks exist, he said. But put a few in place, he added, and soon the supply of applications will drive a growing demand for the faster connections.Chattanooga\u2019s path to Gig City is part of a transformation that began long before most Americans knew the Internet existed. Named America\u2019s most-polluted city in 1969 because of largely unregulated base of heavy manufacturing, Chattanooga has in the last two decades cleaned its air, rebuilt its waterfront, added an aquarium and become a hub for the arts in eastern Tennessee. In more recent years, an aggressive high-tech economic development plan and an upgrade of the power grid by EPB moved Chattanooga toward the one-gigabit connection.In 2009, a $111 million federal stimulus grant offered the opportunity to expedite construction of a long-planned fiber-optic network, said David Wade, chief operating officer for the power company. (EPB also had to borrow $219 million of the network\u2019s $330 million cost.) Mr. Wade said it quickly became apparent that customers would be willing to pay for the one-gigabit connection offered over the network.Chattanooga has been joined in recent years by a handful of other American cities that have experimented with municipally owned fiber-optic networks that offer the fastest Internet connections. Lafayette, La., and Bristol, Va., have also built gigabit networks. Google is building privately owned fiber systems in Kansas City, Kan.; Kansas City, Mo.; and Austin, Tex., and it recently bought a dormant fiber network in Provo, Utah.The systems are the leading edge of a push for ever-faster Internet and telecommunications infrastructure in a country that badly lags much of the world in the speed and costs of Web connections. Telecommunications specialists say that if the United States does not keep its networks advancing with those in the rest of the world, innovation, business, education and a host of other pursuits could suffer.Even so, few people, including many who support the systems, argue that everyone in the country now needs a one-gigabit home connection. Much of the public seems to agree. According to Federal Communications Commission statistics, of the households where service of at least 100 megabits per second was available (one-tenth as fast as a gigabit), only 0.12 percent subscribed at the end of 2012. In Chattanooga, one-third of the households and businesses that get electric power from EPB also subscribe to Internet service of at least 100 megabits.But just as few people a decade ago thought there would be any need for one terabyte of data storage on a desktop computer (more than 200 million pages of text, or more than 200 movies), even the most prescient technology gurus have often underestimated the hunger for computer speed and memory.Fiber-optic networks carry another benefit, which is the unlikelihood that a potentially faster network will come along soon. Fiber optics can transmit data at close to the speed of light, and EPB officials say the technology exists for their network to carry up to 80 connections of 10 gigabits per second at once.Those who use Chattanooga\u2019s one-gigabit connection are enthusiastic. Mr. Gemayel, the Florida native who moved Banyan here from Tampa, first passed through Chattanooga in 2012, when he heard about an entrepreneurial contest sponsored by The Company Lab with a $100,000 prize. Banyan, which was working on a way to share real-time editing in huge data files quickly among far-flung researchers, won the contest. Mr. Gemayel returned to Tampa with his check.But once there he discovered that his low-bandwidth Internet connection was hampering the development of his business. By the beginning of 2013, he had moved to Chattanooga.Other companies have become Gig-related successes. Quickcue, a company that developed a tablet-based guest-management system for restaurants, began here in 2011 and over the next two years attracted about $3 million in investments. In December, OpenTable, the online restaurant reservations pioneer, bought Quickcue for $11.5 million.Big technology dreams do not always pan out, of course, and Chattanooga is familiar with failed experiments. The city spent millions of dollars in the last five years to build a citywide Wi-Fi network, known as the \u201cwireless mesh,\u201d intended for use by residents and city agencies. It sits largely unused, and its utility has largely been usurped by 4G wireless service.Few people here would say that the Gig has even begun to be used to its fullest. \u201cThe potential will only be capped by our selfishness,\u201d said Miller Welborn, a partner at the Lamp Post Group, the business incubator where Banyan shares office space with a dozen other start-ups. \u201cThe Gig is not fully useful to Chattanooga unless a hundred other cities are doing the same thing. To date, the best thing it\u2019s done for us is it put us on the map.\u201dFor all the optimism, many boosters are aware there are limits to how far the Gig can take the city, particularly as it waits for the rest of the country to catch up.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to be the next Silicon Valley,\u201d Mayor Andy Berke said. \u201cThat\u2019s not who we\u2019re going to be, and we shouldn\u2019t try to be that.

{"Headline": "Fewer Layoffs, but Not Much Hiring", "Date": "2014-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the Charts\u00a0FEWER people in the United States lost their jobs in 2013 than in any previous year this century, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported this week.The bureau said its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey \u2014 called Jolts \u2014 indicated that 1.8 million people were laid off or dismissed in December. That brought the total for the year to 19.4 million, 5 percent under the 20.5 million people the department counted in 2012.Since the credit crisis ended, fewer and fewer people are being fired, and fewer people are applying for unemployment insurance, as can be seen in the accompanying charts. But hiring has been slow to pick up.In addition to those laid off or dismissed, the bureau said 27.6 million workers quit their jobs, and an additional 4.4 million left for other reasons. That category includes retirements and transfers to a different office of the same company, as well as death and disability. In the charts, those figures are grouped together as \u201cvoluntary departures.\u201d In a typical year, a large number of American workers change jobs, both voluntarily and otherwise. To some extent, that is based on the nature of certain jobs \u2014 many construction jobs, for example, are short term and end when the building is completed \u2014 but job changes also represent how fluid the labor market is. Many people leave jobs to seek better ones, opening up positions for others.The credit crisis led not only to a rapid gain in the number of workers being let go, but also to a sharp reduction in the number of people choosing to leave jobs. For the first time since the government began the survey in 2000, more people were leaving jobs involuntarily than voluntarily. That is no longer the case, but the labor market has become more constricted after the crisis. Fewer people are being let go, but the number of people leaving jobs of their own accord has been rising very slowly, and remains below prerecession levels. That fact could help explain the difficulties faced by the long-term unemployed. With fewer lower-level jobs opening up as people get better jobs, there are fewer positions they can apply for.In the charts, the figures on annual hires and separations are expressed as a percentage of the number of people who were employed at the beginning of the year. The proportion of new hires has risen each year since 2009, but remains below 40 percent. Before 2008, the lowest figure had been 43 percent, in 2003.The rate of new claims for unemployment insurance has also declined in recent years, but remains higher than it was before the recession. Not everyone who is fired can claim unemployment insurance, and some who are classified as leaving voluntarily may be eligible to seek benefits.The fact that fewer people are being fired or laid off, even though unemployment remains high by historical standards, may help explain a change in public attitudes regarding the unemployed. During past downturns, Congress has usually been willing to vote for extended unemployment benefits, with the implicit assumption that most of those who cannot find jobs are unfortunate victims of a poor economy. That attitude presumably was reinforced for people who saw their friends and neighbors forced out of jobs.But now, with fewer people losing jobs, as opposed to failing to find new ones, the political climate has become less friendly. This year, Congress has refused to extend unemployment benefits, and some states cut benefits last year. Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The American Precariat", "Date": "2014-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen foreign visitors used to describe American culture, they generally settled on different versions of one trait: energy. Whether driven by crass motivations or spiritual ones, Americans, visitors agreed, worked more frantically, moved more and switched jobs more than just about anybody else on earth.That\u2019s changing. In the past 60 years, for example, Americans have become steadily less mobile. In 1950, 20 percent of Americans moved in a given year. Now, it\u2019s around 12 percent. In the 1950s and 1960s, people lived in the same house for an average of five years; now people live in the same house for an average of 8.6 years. When it comes to geographic mobility, we are now at historic lows, no more mobile than people in Denmark or Finland.Why is this happening? A few theories offer partial explanations, but only partial ones.It is true that we are an aging nation and older people tend to move less. But today\u2019s young people are much less mobile than young people from earlier generations. Between the 1980s and the 2000s alone, mobility among young adults dropped by 41 percent.It\u2019s also true that labor markets are getting more homogeneous. It used to be that the jobs found in Pittsburgh were different than the ones found in Atlanta. But now they are more similar, so there is less reason to move from one city to another. But that also fails to explain the tremendous drops over decades.No, a big factor here is a loss in self-confidence. It takes faith to move. You are putting yourself through temporary expense and hardship because you have faith that over the long run you will slingshot forward. Many highly educated people, who are still moving in high numbers, have that long-term faith. Less-educated people often do not.One of the oddities of the mobility that does exist is that people are not moving to low-unemployment/high-income areas. Instead they are moving to lower-income areas with cheap housing. That is to say, they are less likely to endure temporary housing hardship for the sake of future opportunity. They are more likely to move to places that offer immediate comfort even if the long-term income prospects are lower.This loss of faith is evident in other areas of life. Fertility rates, a good marker of confidence, are down. Even accounting for cyclical changes, people are less likely to voluntarily vacate a job in search of a better one. Only 46 percent of white Americans believe they have a good chance of improving their standard of living, the lowest levels in the history of the General Social Survey.Fifty percent of Americans over 65 believe America stands above all others as the greatest nation on earth. Only 27 percent of Americans ages 18 to 29 believe that. As late as 2003, Americans were more likely than Italians, Brits and Germans to say the \u201cfree market economy is the best system on which to base the future of the world.\u201d By 2010, they were slightly less likely than those Europeans to embrace capitalism.Thirty years ago, a vast majority of Americans identified as members of the middle class. But since 1988, the percentage of Americans who call themselves members of the \u201chave-nots\u201d has doubled. Today\u2019s young people are more likely to believe success is a matter of luck, not effort, than earlier generations.These pessimistic views bring to mind a concept that\u2019s been floating around Europe: the Precariat. According to the British academic Guy Standing, the Precariat is the growing class of people living with short-term and part-time work with precarious living standards and \u201cwithout a narrative of occupational development.\u201d They live with multiple forms of insecurity and are liable to join protest movements across the political spectrum.The American Precariat seems more hunkered down, insecure, risk averse, relying on friends and family but without faith in American possibilities. This fatalism is historically uncharacteristic of America.No one response is going to reverse the trend, but Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute believes government should offer moving vouchers to the long-term unemployed so they can chase opportunity. If we could induce more people to Go West! (or South, East or North) in search of opportunity, maybe the old future-oriented mind-set would return.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reversing Course, Japan Makes Push to Restart Dormant Nuclear Plants", "Date": "2014-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made its biggest push yet to revive Japan\u2019s nuclear energy program on Tuesday, announcing details of a draft plan that designates atomic power as an important long-term electricity source.The new Basic Energy Plan, which states that Japan will push to restart reactors that were closed after the disaster in 2011 at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, overturns a promise made by a previous government to phase out the country\u2019s nuclear reactors. The plan also leaves open the possibility of building new plants as well as restarting existing ones.Japan\u2019s minister for trade and industry, Toshimitsu Motegi, sought to play down the shift, telling reporters that Japan was still committed to \u201creducing its reliance on nuclear power.\u201d But he also criticized the earlier commitment, first made by Prime Minister Naoto Kan in the months after the Fukushima disaster, to forgo nuclear power entirely, a policy Mr. Motegi called irresponsible for a resource-poor nation.Still, the government\u2019s own energy plan was vague, setting no specific targets for the percentage of power to be provided by nuclear energy. Mr. Motegi said the country needed more time to figure out the best mix of energy sources, which would also include renewables like solar, wind and geothermal power.The Japanese have been struggling for three years to decide whether to return to nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster, which contaminated a vast area of northeast Japan and is still keeping tens of thousands of people from their homes as a cleanup effort continues. Mr. Abe has been promising to add nuclear power back into Japan\u2019s energy mix since soon after he took office in late 2012, but he has been unable to budge national opinion even as a renewed reliance on fossil fuels has increased energy costs and helped drive Japan\u2019s trade deficit to record highs.Polls show lingering public misgivings about the safety of nuclear energy and the government\u2019s ability to oversee it, with a majority of people supporting a gradual phaseout. The draft plan issued this week, the first under Mr. Abe, suggests that he plans to move forward despite a lack of agreement among citizens.To ease public jitters, an independent regulatory agency has been evaluating whether Japan\u2019s 50 operable reactors, which are all currently idle, can safely be brought back online. Even with regulatory approval, though, local opposition could still block or delay restarts. The national plan did not say when the government would begin trying to restart reactors, which are being upgraded to meet the agency\u2019s new safety requirements.The government is set to discuss the policy with opposition parties, but the cabinet can approve it at any time.Mr. Abe may feel empowered to move ahead in part because the country\u2019s organized opposition to nuclear power \u2014 which erupted in the months after the Fukushima accident into mass street rallies \u2014 has failed to materialize. In a closely watched governor\u2019s race in Tokyo this month, a fractured field of antinuclear candidates appeared to split the opposition vote, helping to return a pro-nuclear governing party candidate to office. That victory has given momentum to Mr. Abe\u2019s push.Mr. Kan, the former prime minister who led the country\u2019s response to the Fukushima crisis, blasted the turn back toward nuclear power.\u201cThis government has not learned the lessons of Fukushima,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cJapan was on the brink, but now we want to go back to nuclear for economic reasons. But what happens to the economy if another disaster hits?\u201dFears about nuclear safety were heightened on Tuesday by another mishap at the crippled Fukushima plant, where continued radiation leaks and errors have undermined cleanup efforts. The plant\u2019s operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, said a damaged power cable had shut down a vital cooling system, forcing workers to suspend the delicate process of removing spent nuclear fuel rods from a wrecked storage pool.The cooling system for the pool at Reactor No. 4 failed for about four hours on Tuesday before power was restored, Tokyo Electric Power said in an emailed announcement. It added that the pool temperature was stable and that it had not detected a rise in radiation levels at the plant.The country\u2019s new energy plan calls nuclear power an important \u201cbaseload\u201d electricity source \u2014 one that can produce energy at a constant rate and at a lower cost than alternatives like solar or wind power. Proponents of renewable energy argue that safety risks and the costs of handling nuclear waste make nuclear power less reliable and more expensive than other options.The plan also says that Japan will ultimately determine the appropriate size of its nuclear program after taking into account its future energy needs, as well as its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which have surged with the decline of nuclear power. That wording, Japanese news outlets noted, left the door open for the government to build new plants.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Promises New Aid to Jordan in Refugee Crisis", "Date": "2014-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. \u2014 President Obama announced during a meeting here Friday night with King Abdullah II of Jordan that he would seek to renew a five-year aid package to help Jordan bear the burden of the more than 600,000 Syrian refugees who have fled the civil war there.Mr. Obama, amid broader discussions with King Abdullah about the stalemate in Syria, also announced that the United States would guarantee $1 billion in loans to help keep Jordan\u2019s wavering economy afloat.\u00a0The president briefly outlined that aid package as he spoke to reporters at Sunnylands, the Southern California estate where Mr. Obama met with the king for 2 hours and 15 minutes over what the White House called a working dinner.Calling the Jordanians \u201cvery generous,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to make sure that we\u2019re supportive of the kingdom in accommodating all these refugees.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s discussions with the Jordanian king are part of an intensive diplomatic outreach to the Middle East over the next month, as the United States conducts risky negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, gropes for a political solution to the fighting in Syria, and tries to nudge the Israelis and the Palestinians toward a peace agreement.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel will make a trip the White House on March 3, and Mr. Obama is scheduled to meet with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and, possibly, other Persian Gulf leaders during a visit there.In their talks Friday, the president and Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah discussed a vast range of regional issues, including the Middle East peace process, administration officials said. But the dominant issue was Syria, whose civil war has placed heavy burdens on its neighbor.Jordan\u2019s economic problems have been made worse by militants\u2019 attacks on a natural gas pipeline from Egypt, which has been in upheaval since the Arab Spring uprising in 2011.It is not the first time that Mr. Obama has used Sunnylands \u2014 a 200-acre estate built by Walter H. Annenberg, the publisher, philanthropist and ambassador who died in 2002 \u2014 as a diplomatic backdrop.Sunnylands is \u201cconducive to a conversation\u201d between Mr. Obama and King Abdullah, \u201cgiven all the issues they face and given their warm relationship,\u201d said Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman.Mr. Obama will be staying at the estate through Sunday \u2014 the canary-yellow master bedroom is equipped with speakers that pipe in the songs of the birds outdoors.The president arrived at the Palm Springs International Airport about 7:30 p.m. Pacific Time on a day when the temperature hovered around 90 degrees.Hours earlier, Mr. Obama delivered remarks in Fresno, Calif., more than 300 miles to the north, about the federal response to California\u2019s severe drought. The water shortage has placed extra scrutiny on usage here in the Coachella Valley, where intensive irrigation has transformed the desert scrubland into lush lawns and golf courses.The president has no public events scheduled beyond the meeting with King Abdullah, and he is expected to spend much of the time golfing. (He does not have to go far for a quick fix: Sunnylands has a nine-hole course.)Sarah Wheaton reported from Rancho Mirage, Calif., and Mark Landler from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Covetous Scrutiny for Military Hardware in Singapore", "Date": "2014-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: AviationAgainst a background rattling of sabers, Asian air force chiefs are likely to be taking a more covetous look than usual at the military hardware on display at this week\u2019s Singapore Airshow. In the past few months, muscle-flexing by China has led to confrontations with the Philippines, South Korea and Japan in contested waters of the South and East China Seas.In November, China unilaterally declared an air defense zone for an area of the East China Sea containing a group of islands known as the Senkaku in Japanese, and the Diaoyu in Chinese, that Japan has controlled for decades; and in an area over a submerged reef called Ieodo in South Korea and Suyan Rock in China, that is controlled by South Korea. Japan already operated its own air defense zone over the Senkaku Islands. Korea, in response to the Chinese move, said in December that it was expanding its air patrol zone in the disputed areas.Meanwhile, Chinese and Philippine ships have been playing cat and mouse through much of the past year in the waters around the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.At stake is more than national pride and geopolitical assertiveness. The contested seabeds are believed to hold extensive reserves of oil and natural gas.Still, if the case for building air surveillance and defense capabilities is strong, financial pressures on emerging market economies mean that defense ministries in the region must cope with tight budgets. Maximum bang for the buck is the order of the day. A broad range of fighter and maritime surveillance aircraft is competing for sales to Asian governments. One leading contender is Lockheed Martin\u2019s new F-35 Lightning II, the product of the Joint Strike Fighter cooperative program that started in 1996. Since its plane\u2019s introduction in 2001, Lockheed Martin has delivered some 100 F-35s. The United States Marine Corps is scheduled to start deploying a short takeoff and vertical landing version in 2015, though recent reports say this may be delayed by software maintenance and reliability problems. Richard L. Aboulafia, a commercial and military aviation analyst at the Teal Group, in Fairfax, Va., puts the stealthy, technically advanced F-35 in a class of its own, describing it as \u201cthe only fifth-generation fighter program on the world market.\u201d It is, he says, a generation more advanced than possible rivals such as Boeing\u2019s F-15 Eagle and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, the Eurofighter Typhoon, the Dassault Rafale, the Saab Gripen, or Russian and Chinese counterparts. The F-35 program, however, is 70 percent over initial cost estimates and years behind schedule. It was roundly criticized last month by the Pentagon\u2019s procurement chief, J. Michael Gilmore. Still, Japan has said it intends to acquire 42 of the Lockheed Martin fighters, with the first four to be delivered by 2017. South Korea also has plans to buy 40, for delivery in 2018 to 2021, though a senior South Korean official said last month that further program delays would be \u201cproblematic.\u201d Australia, a partner in the program, plans to take about 100 aircraft. For potential buyers who are not members of the program partnership, however, there are significant negatives, said Alexandra Ashbourne-Walmsley, a military analyst and director of Ashbourne Strategic Consulting, in London. Export customers \u201cwill essentially receive a sealed box for a very high price,\u201d she said, since the United States is unlikely to supply the sensitive classified source codes for the F-35\u2019s advanced weapons and radar systems.While \u201cthe F-35 is clearly the most advanced manned fighter jet in production,\u201d Ms. Ashbourne added, \u201cthe downside is that it is likely to be unavailable to countries not already F-35 program partners before the mid-2020s.\u201dBoeing, meanwhile, is continuing to promote its long-serving F-15 \u2014 with production assured through 2018 \u2014 and its Super Hornet, operational since 1999. Boeing has orders for the Super Hornet through 2016 and has been wooing Malaysia as a potential buyer.Among other fighter offerings, the Rafale, from the French group Dassault, has met with little export success over the past 20 years, but it has a potential order for 126 planes from India, which could be signed in April. Of those, 108 would be built in India, but disagreements remain between the Indian government and Dassault over quality assurance and performance guarantees.Eurofighter\u2019s Typhoon has also had limited recent export success. At the end of last year, its production line was assured only through 2018.Sweden\u2019s Saab Gripen NG, the latest upgrade model in that program, recently signed a deal to sell 36 fighters to Brazil, a choice by the Brazilian government that Mr. Aboulafia described as highly rational, on three grounds. First, \u201cthe world fighter market is quite cost-sensitive,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond, Brazil faces no major strategic threats. The rest of South America consists of friendly nations or basket cases and the Brazilian Air Force needs only to control drug traffic and the Amazon Basin.\u201d \u201cThird, the Brazilian economy is in grim shape, and Gripen NG\u2019s operating costs are about one half of the F/A-18\u2019s,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia said.Chasing more orders after its Brazilian deal, Saab opened an Asia-Pacific office in Bangkok in September. In 2008 it sold 12 earlier versions of the Gripen to the Royal Thai Air Force, along with two Saab 340 AEW surveillance aircraft and an integrated defense system. In a telephone interview last month, Lennart Sindahl, the head of Saab\u2019s aeronautics business group, emphasized the Gripen NG\u2019s relatively low purchase cost and highly competitive operating expenses.Mr. Sindahl also said that his company was exploring a possible Sea Gripen variant that could be capable of operations from small aircraft carriers, building on the existing aircraft\u2019s short-airfield capability.Mr. Aboulafia, of the Teal Group, said a new working relationship between Saab and Embraer of Brazil, in the context of the Brazilian Gripen deal, was \u201canother intriguing development.\u201d Embraer\u2019s role \u201cas a kind of co-prime contractor\u201d for the Gripen NG program could be the seed of a wider collaboration, he suggested.Embraer itself will also be at the Singapore show. The company is developing its KC-390 medium-lift twin-jet transport, now starting prototype production, though no prototype is yet flying. Jackson Schneider, president of Embraer\u2019s defense and security unit, said that Indonesia had bought 16 of its A-29 Super Tucano light attack and reconnaissance turboprops, a plane that, like the Gripen, fits advanced electronics to a low-cost airframe. Boeing, meanwhile, will be showing its P-8, a maritime surveillance version of the ubiquitous 737-800 commercial transport plane, which recently entered service with the United States Navy. India has already ordered eight of the planes. In November, Boeing also announced a new, lower-cost maritime surveillance aircraft program, known as the MSA. Based on the Bombardier Challenger 605 business jet, it is fitted out with P-8 and AWACS-based surveillance systems. The MSA is being presented to potential buyers this year. In 2001, Japan opted to buy Boeing\u2019s KC-767 aerial refueling tanker, signing a contract for four in 2003. They could, for example, be used to refuel the short takeoff, vertical landing variant of the F-35 that might be operable from helicopter carriers \u2014 diplomatically never described as aircraft carriers \u2014 being built by the Japanese Navy.Airbus meanwhile has sold five A330 MRTT tanker/transports to Australia, and India has listed Airbus as a \u201cpreferred bidder\u201d for a six-plane tanker procurement deal. The Airbus A400M transport, too, will soon be flying in the region, with four bought by Malaysia that are due for delivery in 2015 and 2016.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slave No More", "Date": "2014-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySign of the TimesAs the runway revolves, one front-row fashion fixture ponders how practical dressing has come to feel like the most modern of ideas, and why designers haven\u2019t quite caught on.It is before dawn on a frozen Sunday in upstate New York, where I have come to pack up two bedrooms. A handyman is arriving to build a small closet in one, and then both rooms will receive a fresh coat of paint. I\u2019m sticking with the same colors \u2014 light green, a ballroom blue \u2014 that I chose 15 years ago, when the house was built. This decision to leave well enough alone, instead of hustling over to the paint store and driving myself nuts with choices, not to mention wasting my energy, seems more than sensible: It sums up everything I feel about style and comfort. Or should I say the revenge of comfort over style.Folded over the back of a chair in my room, under a mohair throw, is an old suede kilt I had meant to begin wearing again. For me, the kilt nourishes a sense of freedom from fashion. It\u2019s a classic, it\u2019s sentimental and it\u2019s one of the few garments I own that has truly improved with age. I hope I am wearing it at 90, tramping along in boots and a dog-haired sweater, the picture of civilized indifference.Although I like going to fashion shows, and appreciate the dedication of seamstresses and designers alike, I am not the right audience for most of what I see. But, then, how many women are? Who has the will \u2014 never mind the time and the money \u2014 to wear high fashion, at least as it has been conceived over the past decade, as something extreme, or \u201cspecial,\u201d in retail jargon? By now, I suspect, most people know that the purpose of runway shows is entertainment, and to create a feeling of desire. They understand that the main interest of high-fashion companies is economic rather than aesthetic. It\u2019s to sell products and capture new markets, much as Coca-Cola and Apple do.Notions like taste and practical chic are way too complex to sell today, when much of the world\u2019s population is consumed with either acquisition or basic survival. For that reason it\u2019s tough to talk about comfort and a moral economy of style without sounding grim or like one is trying to promote a car with three wheels (hey, but it drives!). On the other hand, this idea is not so far from something Coco Chanel offered when she arrived in New York, in March 1931. Asked by a reporter to define the fashionable woman, Chanel said, \u201cShe dresses well but not remarkably. . . . She disobeys fashion.\u201d Then, perhaps thinking of her rival Elsa Schiaparelli, Chanel added, \u201cBut she is not eccentric. I hate eccentricity.\u201d So she was extolling understatement and ease, yes, but also suggesting these choices reflected virtues like self-control and seriousness.Lately I\u2019ve noticed many more women, all of them in the zone of careers and complicated family routines, all of them with an eye for fashion, gravitating toward an almost boyish uniform of slim-cut trousers, pullovers and flat shoes. Or a leather jacket with bland layers underneath. They\u2019re hardly wearing makeup, so their complexions look fresh. (We all know that too much makeup ages everyone.) At the last round of shows in Paris, I noted that even my French sisters had begun to ditch their adored stilettos for low heels. That was quite a concession for them, I thought. Something must be up, because those women don\u2019t do anything on a whim.Of course, in the 1990s, Helmut Lang and Jil Sander led a revolution with plain tailoring, neutral colors and natural hair and makeup. Lang\u2019s style, in particular, proved popular with editors and buyers, many of whom had witnessed the sex gags of Jean Paul Gaultier and Thierry Mugler in the \u201980s, and were sickened or just bored by them. More than a decade earlier, Halston, Stephen Burrows and Calvin Klein had created a template of modern informality, with clean sportswear and lightly constructed dresses for a generation that wanted to go braless. Indeed, these styles reflected not only broad social change, but also the loosening of designers\u2019 grip on women\u2019s bodies. Yet, by the early \u201990s, with the exception of Marc Jacobs\u2019s grunge collection for Perry Ellis, along with Zoran and Joan Vass, New York was largely obsessed with the retro trappings of nouvelle society glamour, down to fur-trimmed pencil skirts and gloves. No wonder women sought the anonymity of Lang and Sander.What\u2019s changed since then? From my perspective, having written enthusiastically about the conceptual, art-inspired fashion of the past 20 years \u2014 whether by Martin Margiela, Miuccia Prada or Raf Simons \u2014 I can say we\u2019ve become increasingly weary of this approach. As the roles of women kept evolving during the \u201980s and \u201990s, it was easy, maybe necessary, to attach meaning to clothes. They were powerful, daring, etc. But, let\u2019s face it, much of the language around clothes today sounds forced. I was touched when, at the January men\u2019s shows in Milan, Prada talked about her rather straightforward tailoring, which included a few women\u2019s looks as well, saying, \u201cI wanted to make it real. And I like that now.\u201dSo do most women, though this wish doesn\u2019t strike them as a novelty. All the same, the desire to be comfortable is profound, shaping attitudes and markets. Witness the explosion of so-called lifestyle brands like Vince, which last year became a publicly traded company, an indication that the audience is hardly baby boomers looking for less complicated stuff. For the most part, with the exception of Stella McCartney, who makes a point of including stylishly executed casual looks like this spring\u2019s tapered track pants and tops, high fashion ignores this consumer.But things are changing. I perked up when I saw that Alber Elbaz based Lanvin\u2019s prefall collection around chic sweatpants, mixing them with wool cocoon coats and low-heeled pumps. I had the sense that he was keen to tackle the matter of comfort without sacrificing luxury, and he succeeded. Probably no one defines the modern sense of comfort with more authority than Phoebe Philo of C\u00e9line. Not long ago, she stunned loyalists with a loosey-goosey collection of long, frayed dresses, soft pajama-like pants and sandals lined with fur. Well, guess what? Other designers are still knocking off that collection. Although Philo has steered C\u00e9line somewhat away from that specific style, as you would expect of a designer eager to stay ahead of her competitors, she remains committed to its essence. For me, that collection captured something rare in today\u2019s world of anxious, self-created stars \u2014 and that is a woman of indeterminate age who knows what she likes and has shrugged off what she no longer has any use for, and maybe never did. If that sounds rather limited, that\u2019s the point. I\u2019ll stick with the same paint colors and my lovely old kilt, because, it turns out, there\u2019s a surprising amount of harmony in unremarkable choices.Advertisement"}

Sometimes we make decisions that appear irrational when viewed in isolation, but they make complete sense when viewed as part of our overall life.Buying houses at the wrong time isn\u2019t the only decision that may look irrational. There are times when renting instead of buying may not make financial sense, but some people value the nonfinancial asset of flexibility that comes with renting. Then there are the more personal decisions, like opting to be a stay-at-home parent even if we could easily earn far more than the cost of child care. The value a parent places on being at home doesn\u2019t fit on a balance sheet.These decisions and many, many others illustrate that we have quantifiable and qualitative lines on the balance sheet of life. The key is to recognize when this is happening.If we don\u2019t recognize it, then we\u2019re increasing the odds we\u2019ll make irrational decisions unconsciously, which can lead to pain versus balanced fulfillment. Instead, we can pursue what I call conscious irrationality. By acknowledging there will be moments when we won\u2019t act rationally, we can practice identifying when it\u2019s fine to act irrationally despite reams of evidence that say we shouldn\u2019t.We also need to test our irrationality. Have we given in because it\u2019s easier or because it\u2019s something that really matters to us? Mr. Mishkin put a house under contract because he knew it mattered to his wife, but he outlined in perfect detail the reasons he knew it might not prove to be the most rational decision.Can you say the same about your irrationality? Do you know the exact reasons that you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing, or are you relying on excuses? Many of our financial decisions will come down to finding a balance between the quantifiable and the qualitative. The odds of us finding the right balance go up significantly the sooner we realize the numbers won\u2019t always add up but might still make sense when we include the value of all the items on life\u2019s balance sheet.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Welfare Queen", "Date": "2014-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The British queen is down to her last pennies. Well, actually, her last millions of pennies.Last month, the Public Accounts Committee \u2014 Parliament\u2019s watchdog on public spending \u2014 published a damning survey of the state of the royal finances. The queen had spent down her \u201creserve fund,\u201d a savings account built up by years of surplus public subsidy, to \u201ca historically low level\u201d of only \u00a31 million ($1.6 million), from \u00a335.3 million in 2001. Trying to make sense of the royal finances is like trying to eat spaghetti with a spoon. Here\u2019s the puzzle: Queen Elizabeth II is often described, by some measures, as one of the richest people in the world. Among her private property is Balmoral Castle, her residence in the Scottish Highlands, which was purchased, together with a 50,000-acre estate, by Prince Albert for Queen Victoria in 1848. Queen Elizabeth also owns stud farms, personal art and fine jewelry. According to Forbes magazine, her personal worth is $500 million.If the queen is so wealthy, how can she be strapped for cash? In 2010, it emerged that the queen had even privately applied to a government fund normally reserved for low-income families to help with Buckingham Palace\u2019s heating bills. Turning the request down, a government official commented, \u201cI also feel a bit uneasy about the probable adverse press coverage if the palace were given a grant at the expense of, say, a hospital.\u201d Why is the queen reduced to acting as if she lived in public housing? The short answer is that she does live in public housing \u2014 just in an exceptionally grand manner.The queen does not own Buckingham Palace; the nation does. It follows that, wealthy as she is, the queen sees no reason to pay for the upkeep of the palace, since she lives there by virtue of her public duties.Behind this tussle over who pays for what is the fundamental ambiguity of a parliamentary democracy headed by a hereditary monarch. This historic anomaly is the key to unraveling the mysteries of the royal finances. It explains how we can have a queen who is privately so very rich, yet who publicly pleads poverty.The modern muddle began in 1760. King George III found himself \u00a33 million in debt \u2014 a colossal sum, equivalent to more than \u00a3500 million in today\u2019s money. To extricate himself, he surrendered to the government the management of, and revenues from, most of his property. In return, he received a fixed annual payment, known as the Civil List.This was, in essence, how the British government subsidized the royal household for 250 years \u2014 until 2012, when Parliament abolished the Civil List and replaced it with the Sovereign Grant. Ostensibly, this was to rationalize the royal finances: The Civil List was the main source of state funding for the royal family, yet it was supplemented by a host of other grants \u2014 to cover palace maintenance, communications and travel costs. The Royal Yacht Britannia, for instance, was separately funded to the tune of \u00a311 million a year, until it was retired by Prime Minister Tony Blair in 1997 as a cost-cutting measure.The Sovereign Grant was designed to sweep all that away. Rather than the queen\u2019s receiving the Civil List and a suite of subsidies, the level of the grant is simply set at a 15 percent cut of the profits from the Crown Estate. It is a remunerative new arrangement, which projects an income steadily rising to \u00a337.9 million this year, from \u00a336.1 million for 2013.Despite its name, the Crown Estate is a vast property portfolio that belongs to the crown as an embodiment of the state, and not to the reigning monarch as an individual. Among the assets held by the nation that the queen enjoys in her role as the sovereign are Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, the world-renowned royal art collection and the Crown Jewels. The queen could, if she so desired, sell Balmoral Castle tomorrow, as it is her private property. But she could not sell the Crown Jewels; she has no legal title to them.If the monarchy were abolished tomorrow, Buckingham Palace and the royal art collection would, as before, be public property. But the queen would not be obliged \u2014 as the humorist Sue Townsend imagined in her 1992 novel \u201cThe Queen and I\u201d \u2014 to live in a slum: Her personal wealth would enable her to keep company with Russian oligarchs and Saudi royalty indefinitely.The Sovereign Grant seemed to simplify things, but it did nothing to resolve the constitutional fudge. Many within the royal family clearly look upon the Crown Estate as their personal property. And in directly linking royal income to the estate, the grant appeared to some to legitimize the monarch\u2019s claim to it.And there are still hidden subsidies. The Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, for example, are huge property holdings \u201cheld in trust\u201d for the sovereign and the heir to the throne, respectively, and are distinct from the Crown Estate. Last year, the queen received \u00a312.7 million from the Duchy of Lancaster, and the Prince of Wales \u00a319.1 million from the Duchy of Cornwall. And both were exempt from business taxes. Such \u201clost revenues,\u201d argues the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, should be regarded as state handouts to the queen. On this basis, Republic estimates the total cost of the monarchy to the taxpayer is more than \u00a3200 million a year. In the background to such a lavish public subsidy of the monarchy is the austerity imposed by the government since 2010, a program that has generated considerable popular anger. There is hostility, too, toward the social privilege of government ministers.Yet, little of this fury has spilled over into outrage about royal funding. Fewer than one in five Britons wants a republic, a figure that has not changed for half a century. In contrast, a poll last year found that 45 percent of the British public showed \u201cstrong support\u201d for the monarchy, up from 27 percent in 2006.For royalists, who point to how the economy benefits from tourism through royal pageantry, the monarchy provides value for money. And it is better, they say, to have a nonpolitical head of state who can unite the nation, rather than an elected politician who would divide it. For some, the very idea that M.P.\u2019s should scrutinize the queen\u2019s finances verges on impertinence.Yet the notion of the monarchy as an apolitical institution is preposterous. Its very existence proclaims that an accident of birth matters more than the democratic will. If the royalists have a point, however, it may be this: Their contempt for democracy captures a public mood that is deeply cynical about politicians, who are seen as venal and corrupt. Some suggest that when Queen Elizabeth is eventually replaced by the far less popular Charles, support for the monarchy will plummet. But even when rage at the Windsors was at its height, in the wake of their cack-handed response to the death of Princess Diana in 1997, there was little enthusiasm for a republican alternative.In the past, reverence for the monarchy was rooted in a sense of deference and an acceptance of hierarchy. Today, deference has been replaced by cynicism \u2014 but as long as the public despises politicians and favors the royals, one of the richest families in the world will continue to live luxuriously at the taxpayers\u2019 expense.

{"Headline": "Big Cable Mergers in Europe Are Still Hard to Make", "Date": "2014-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 For many European analysts, the Continent\u2019s telecommunications industry is ripe for consolidation.In the United States, the fruits of consolidation are already being harvested.In Europe, such a pan-Continental service provider, for better or worse, would be hard to create. In the name of protecting consumers, antitrust officials have taken a hard line on approving takeovers of local cable, mobile phone and pay-TV companies. But that has also tended to stifle the multibillion-euro investments required to make communications networks in Europe on par with the most advanced systems in the United States and Asia.European Union regulators, and their counterparts in the 28 E.U. member nations, worry that a wave of consolidation might result in fewer options for consumers, leading to increased prices and less choice among large telecom operators like Vodafone of Britain and Telef\u00f3nica of Spain. The fact that many European cellphone and cable operators continue to face stiff competition from local rivals has kept costs low for consumers, but has not been able to satisfy their insatiable demand for data services from connected devices like smartphones and tablets.\u201cIn Europe, the emphasis has been to encourage competition, not investment, over the last 20 years,\u201d said Steven Hartley, who runs the industry, communications and broadband team at the consulting firm Ovum in London. \u201cThat has to change because it has become a saturated market.\u201dMany European companies say regulators\u2019 emphasis on preserving robust competition has not provided the right incentives to invest in much-needed infrastructure like high-speed cellphone and cable networks that European countries require to jump-start their flagging economies.Over the last decade, Europe has fallen behind the United States and major Asian economies in investing in fiber-optic broadband and so-called fourth-generation wireless networks. To keep pace, analysts and industry executives say, Europe needs large pan-Continental players that have the financial muscle to make those big investments.\u201cThe European Commission is hellbent on increasing competition,\u201d said Tom Phillips, chief regulatory officer of GSMA, a European telecommunications trade association. \u201cThe European Union isn\u2019t a single market. You need to remove national borders to allow for market consolidation.\u201dBut consumer advocates counter that the pro-competition stance by antitrust officials has given Europeans greater choice among providers, and lower costs, compared to their American counterparts. Europeans, for example, pay around $38 on average for their monthly cellphone contracts, according to figures from the GSMA. That is about half of what Americans are charged for the same service.And now the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s administrative arm, is pushing for additional regulatory changes in the telecommunications industry, including a drastic cut to roaming fees that carriers charge their mobile phone customers when they leave their home country.\u201cToo often, business models are still based on yesterday\u2019s services and yesterday\u2019s rip-offs,\u201d Neelie Kroes, the European commissioner who oversees the telecommunications sector, told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month. \u201cTelecom companies\u2019 ambitions are fitted to national markets, and constrained within national borders.\u201dStill, despite antitrust constraints, Europe\u2019s cable and cellphone operators are still forging ahead with deals when and where they can strike them, in hopes of achieving greater economies of scale. Companies like Deutsche Telekom of Germany are expanding their offerings to include single-price bundles of mobile phone, cable, fixed-line and pay-TV services to hold onto struggling European customers who are looking for ways to save money.Last year, Vodafone, which sold its 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless last year for $130 billion, bought the German cable operator Kabel Deutschland for $10.5 billion, and is considering a similar bid for the Spanish cable company ONO for around $10 billion.Vodafone, based in Britain but with operations across Europe and in emerging economies like India, has itself been seen as a potential acquisition target. The American giant AT&T has been looking into a number of European deals, although it took pains to announce in late January that it was not in talks to buy Vodafone.Telef\u00f3nica also has agreed to buy the German cellphone operator E-Plus for around $11.6 billion, while Deutsche Telekom has made several recent acquisitions across Central and Eastern Europe.And Liberty Global, the media company controlled by the American cable billionaire John C. Malone, announced a $13.7 billion cash-and-stock deal for the Dutch cable company Ziggo last month. It also bought Virgin Media, a British cable operator, for around $16 billion last year.Analysts say such deals are likely to continue as Europe\u2019s biggest telecommunications companies aim to acquire smaller companies in markets where they already have operations.Still, any efforts to create pan-European champions comparable to a combined Comcast-Time Warner, would probably lead antitrust officials to demand concessions aimed at ensuring a high level of competition across European countries.\u201cEurope will remain a fragmented market for the foreseeable future,\u201d said Robert Grindle, head of telecommunications at the investment bank Esp\u00edrito Santo in London. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different market structure compared to the U.S.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeking Balance Between Environment and Economy", "Date": "2014-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreen ColumnLONDON \u2014 Can the European Union\u2019s environmental aspirations coexist with industrialists like Lakshmi Mittal, the steel mogul? That question is very much influencing the debate about how Europe should go about combating climate change in the future.In January, the European Commission, the executive body of the 28-nation Union, published new proposals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions through 2030.The major elements of these proposals \u2014 a new target to reduce greenhouse gases by 40 percent from 1990 levels, as well as Europe-wide goals for renewable energy and measures to bolster flagging prices on Europe\u2019s carbon-trading market \u2014 are not as ambitious as some environmentalists would have liked. But they are still likely to increase energy costs and, thus, competitive pressures on heavy industry.One reason that the commission did not push for higher goals is that companies like ArcelorMittal, the Luxembourg-based steel giant that Mr. Mittal heads, had already started to warn that Europe\u2019s energy and environmental policies were threatening jobs and investment. ArcelorMittal employs about 100,000 people in Europe, many of them in sprawling mills that produce substantial amounts of pollution.At this point, the targets are just proposals. They may not survive in their present form, and it will probably be many months before they become binding.What is sure is that the stage is now set for an intense lobbying tug of war between those who say that Europe must continue to lead the world on climate change and others who say that Europe needs to rethink its priorities.Much will be on the line, including Europe\u2019s credibility on climate change and the thorny question of whether there is still a role in Europe for energy-intensive businesses like ArcelorMittal.The International Energy Agency forecasts that energy-intensive exporters on the Continent will lose about a third their global market share over the next couple of decades.Energy costs are a big issue for European industrialists. The rule of thumb is that natural gas, a major industrial fuel, is now twice as expensive in Europe as in the United States, contributing to higher electric power costs.In an interview, Robrecht Himpe, a top executive in ArcelorMittal\u2019s European steel business, said the company would save $1 billion annually if its European mills could somehow be powered by American energy.Mr. Himpe estimated that the European proposals, if implemented, would eventually add about 25 percent to the energy costs of producing steel, which he said were now about 126 euros, or about $170, per metric ton for steel that sells for about \u00a4440 per ton. Mr. Himpe also said after substantial investments by Arcelor to reduce its emissions, there was little more it could do.Under the recommendations, the price of pumping out one metric ton of carbon in Europe would rise from \u00a46 a ton currently to about \u00a470 a ton by 2030, according to a study by ThomsonReuters Point Carbon, a research firm based in Oslo.Mr. Himpe said that if the European Commission did not buffer these increases on steel and other big energy users, it would \u201crisk damaging these industries, which are a motor for the European Union\u2019s economic recovery.\u201d He also said that unless Europe adopted more industry-friendly policies, it would be difficult for companies like ArcelorMittal to make the long-term investments that they need to keep their plants going.Does it matter if heavy industry gradually fades away in Europe? Georg Zachmann, an analyst focused on energy and climate issues at Bruegel, a Brussels-based research organization, does not think so. \u201cIf you have high electricity prices, you lose energy-intensive industries, but at the same time the economy rebalances by increasing competitiveness in other products,\u201d he said.Disagreement about energy policies extends to the top levels of the European Commission. A few days after the Commission published its proposals, Europe\u2019s top energy official, G\u00fcnther Oettinger, who helped draft the proposals, suggested that Europe needed to think differently about itself.The European Union now accounts for about 11 percent of global carbon emissions, and that percentage will drop by more than half by 2030, Mr. Oettinger told a business group. \u201cTo think that with 4.5 percent of global emissions you can save the world is not realistic; it is arrogant or is stupid,\u201d he said.But European politicians have an easier time setting environmental targets than nurturing economic growth. In the mid-2000s, the European Union adopted binding targets for emissions reductions and for the use renewable energy sources that made the Continent the darling of the environmental movement.The problem is that much of the rest of the world did not follow. Europe will very likely succeed in meeting or surpassing its original goal of a 20 percent reduction in emissions from 1990 levels by 2020, but these policies may have encouraged investment and employment to shift elsewhere. Recent European Commission studies have shown that Europe\u2019s share of global foreign direct investment fell to 16.8 percent in 2012 from 30 percent in 2008. In roughly the same period, Europe lost 3.5 million manufacturing jobs.With the new proposals, Europe may be setting emission reduction targets without a full assessment of what sort of economy it wants to have and how it will get there.\u201cThis is another set of environmental targets that is not being reconciled with broader energy issues in Europe,\u201d said Fabien Roques, an analyst in Paris with the consulting firm Compass Lexecon. \u201cHow does this square with other objectives like competitiveness, keeping the lights on and power market design?\u201dThe key is for Europe to persuade countries like the United States and China to adopt similar policies. There may be more hope of that happening: Many businesses, including some oil companies, are preparing for a global policy shift that would be more in line with what Europe is pursuing.But until that change happens, companies like ArcelorMittal may be endangered species in Europe.An earlier version of this article misstated a target in new European Commission proposals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The proposals aim to reduce greenhouse gases by 40 percent from 1990 levels \u2014 not from 2020 levels \u2014 through 2030.Advertisement"}

Not quite. The show was a corporate musical introducing Chevrolet\u2019s 1957 product line.In almost every respect, the Chevy show resembled a Broadway production, with a book, new music, a full cast of professional actors and an orchestra. But it would never be seen by the general public. Midwestern dealers, Chevy executives and Chevy employees attended the main production in Detroit, while touring actors traveled to perform for dealers farther afield.The run was intentionally short. Very short. Opening night would also be closing night. Mr. Beebe got the job, which turned out to be his first in a long list of industrials, the corporate entertainments that companies including the Big Three automakers, Coca-Cola and Westinghouse produced by the hundreds from the 1950s to the early 1980s. All over the United States, conventions and business meetings echoed to the sounds of tap-dancing feet, ringing choruses and catchy lyrics celebrating tail fins, shower heads and mouthwash.This, he recognized, was comic gold. The plot, about a leprechaun who takes a utility executive and his wife back in time to get advice from Benjamin Franklin, was surreal. So were the songs, written around subjects like direct current and power distribution management. He began buying recordings of industrials, amassing a collection of more than 200 albums.\u201cIt started as something to make fun of,\u201d Mr. Young said. \u201cI thought, \u2018How pathetic, an insurance musical.\u2019 But then I wondered why, three days later, I was still singing these songs. They\u2019re still funny to me, but mixed in with this is a respect for the creative people who were doing something they knew was ephemeral, but doing their best work.\u201d Mr. Murphy, a collector of offbeat Americana, crossed paths with Mr. Young after buying a stack of records at a Salvation Army store and coming across \u201cPenney Proud,\u201d a 1962 musical produced by J. C. Penney for its 60th anniversary. Delighted with songs like \u201cMay I Have Your Penney Charge Card, Please?,\u201d he began buying industrials on eBay, only to be outbid, again and again, by Mr. Young. Frustrated, he contacted his rival. The two men met, pooled their knowledge and their records and began delving into the topic, buoyed by the conviction that they were charting undiscovered territory.Their new book groups by decade about a hundred industrial albums, many displaying period-snazzy cover graphics. Each show is annotated, turning the spotlight on figures like Lloyd Norlin and Michael Brown, giants of the genre unknown to the wider world. \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the last corners of 20th-century American culture that had been left unexplained, sort of like the Valley of the Kings in Egypt in the 1920s, which everyone thought had been fully explored, but then Howard Carter uncovered the treasures of King Tut,\u201d Mr. Young said. The pay was good. In 1963, the minimum salary on Broadway was $117.50 a week. Industrials paid $199.30 a week for shows running two weeks or more, or a daily rate of $76.60 the first day, and $51.10 for each additional day.The 1956 Chevy show cost $3 million, while \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d opened on Broadway with a budget of $500,000. Big budgets attracted top-drawer talent. \u201cGo Fly a Kite\u201d was written by John Kander and Fred Ebb, the team behind \u201cCabaret\u201d and \u201cChicago.\u201d Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock wrote \u201cFord-i-fy Your Future\u201d for the tractor and implement division of Ford, as well as the songs for \u201cFiorello!\u201d and \u201cFiddler on the Roof.\u201d Bob Fosse was already at work on \u201cThe Pajama Game\u201d when he toured with \u201cThe Mighty \u2018O\u2019,\u201d a 1953 Oldsmobile show.For every big-budget musical with a souvenir recording, there were hundreds of lesser productions. In many a hotel conference room, two or three singers belted out labored parodies of popular songs to a piano accompaniment. \u201cThey were written to keep the audiences awake during all the speeches,\u201d said Patt Stanton, a Chicago-based singer who performed in many industrials in the 1960s and 1970s. \u201cWe started at 8 in the morning, singing and dancing, then we\u2019d come out and do a skit, or a skit and a song and a dance. We were interspersed throughout the meeting.\u201dBig-budget or no-budget, the industrials shared common goals: to lift morale and energize the sales force. \u201cHit \u2019em hard, hit \u2019em often, hit \u2019em right between the eyes,\u201d a line from the 1957 Westinghouse musical \u201cThe Shape of Tomorrow,\u201d captures the spirit.Most industrials came and went, leaving no trace. Only a small percentage spawned albums, making the records that Mr. Young and Mr. Murphy collect rarities. \u201cThey were produced in very small numbers for the attendees, who went home and threw them in the trash,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cThat\u2019s why, when you come across one, it\u2019s usually in mint condition, because no one ever listened to them.\u201dThe annual shows presented by the Milliken textile company between 1956 and 1980 at the Waldorf-Astoria never made it to vinyl, despite their roster of big-name stars. By 1975, headliners included Juliet Prowse, Tommy Tune and Dom DeLuise. Chita Rivera did many of the Milliken shows. Sarah Jessica Parker appeared in the 1976 version.Top talent could use the industrials for a quick payday. Lesser fry got a chance to play bigger roles. \u201cA lot of these kids were gypsies, in the chorus,\u201d Mr. Linden said. \u201cBut in an industrial, they might get the lead. They could work on their craft. I got to sing a big love ballad. Of course, I sang to a car.\u201dThat beats singing to a toilet, as Ms. Stanton did on the cast recording of \u201cThe Bathrooms Are Coming!\u201d a 1969 musical produced by American Standard. By the late 1970s, the industrials were in decline, done in by changing tastes, new technology and a tough economy. \u201cThe industrial musical was no longer the novelty it had been in the 1950s and 1960s,\u201d Mr. Young said. \u201cAnd whenever there was a downturn, the first thing to go was an expensive musical. The thinking was: We don\u2019t need to create an original show with orchestra and full cast. We can just do a laser show. Or hire the Who. \u201cAdvertisement"}

Yet examining his investment success is another matter, and far less prickly. Although this is a largely unknown side of his life, Keynes, while scourging Wall Street and advocating public spending to create jobs, was creating several fortunes by managing money. This part of his life should be of great value to anyone interested in creating and managing wealth. The Keynes whom history knows best was the guiding light behind the many New Deal job-creation programs and several Keynesian stimulus programs since then, including the Obama stimulus plan of 2009. He was the intellectual father of the Bretton Woods postwar economic accords. He was also a bon vivant at the heart of the quasi-bohemian Bloomsbury group, a patron of the arts and a philosopher. While he was extolling what eventually became known as \u201cKeynesian economics,\u201d he was also managing money for himself, as well as King\u2019s College at Cambridge, his Bloomsbury friends and family, two British insurance companies, and investment funds that we would call hedge funds today. After a few near-catastrophic market turns, he became one of the most innovative investors ever, inspiring investors and economic thinkers from Warren E. Buffett to Robert J. Shiller.Most of what Keynes did in terms of investment innovation has been intricately documented by David Chambers, a professor at the Judge School of Business at Cambridge, and Elroy Dimson, emeritus professor at the London Business School. \u201cDiscovering a high degree of overlap with his personal stock portfolio,\u201d Professor Chambers notes, the two researchers took an incisive look at Keynes\u2019s portfolios at the King\u2019s College endowment he managed from 1922 to 1946, when he died. Keynes vaulted into professional investing with a cocksure insider\u2019s attitude. He had been an adviser to the British Treasury during World War I \u2014 until he walked out of the Versailles Treaty talks. Although he maintained and enhanced his Treasury and London financial district connections, he would publicly denounce the Versailles reparations forced upon Germany. Keynes correctly predicted that the treaty would lead to catastrophic economic instability in Germany, which he detailed in his classic \u201cThe Economic Consequences of the Peace.\u201d After the war, Keynes speculated heavily in currencies, but lost most of his capital in 1920 when several European currencies he was betting against recovered. Undaunted, he broadened his portfolio to commodities and eventually common stocks, which at the time was a rarity for institutional investors, who preferred safe bonds and real estate. Although he was building wealth for his own account and the institutional funds throughout the 1920s, he did not see the 1929 debacle coming and was almost cleaned out again.The 1929 crash and resulting Great Depression left Keynes intellectually shellshocked, so he changed his strategy. Professor Chambers and Professor Dimson discovered that sometime in the early 1930s he backed away from short-term trades and commodities and focused on stocks. No longer would he pay attention to overarching economic theories or short-term sentiment: The \u201canimal spirits\u201d of the market\u2019s unpredictable pixies could not be trusted. He sensed that security prices were not true indicators of company values.\u201dKeynes anticipated Eugene Fama, the 2013 Nobel Economics Prize co-winner, in that he clearly did not believe that stock prices must be good indicators of fundamental value,\u201d Professor Chambers said in a recent email. \u201cConsequently, there could be periods when the irrational behavior of investors and what he called animal spirits play a significant role in determining prices on both the upside and downside.\u201d Unlike millions of modern investors, who latch onto every headline and interview on business television shows to gauge market sentiment, Keynes went about-face in the early to mid-1930s to concentrate on a company\u2019s \u201centerprise\u201d value, which is also known as \u201cbook\u201d or \u201cbreakup\u201d value. This intrinsic view of a company\u2019s true worth stripped out the overly emotional component that is often reflected in stock prices. As a result, he often picked companies that had promising futures, but were unloved at the time.When Keynes adopted his new investment strategy \u2014 which paralleled work by Benjamin Graham, a Columbia University professor and mentor to Mr. Buffett \u2014 he did quite well. Even with setbacks in 1929-30, 1937-38 and the early years of World War II, Keynes managed a 16 percent annualized return in the Cambridge discretionary portfolio, which mirrored his other holdings. That compares with 10.4 percent for a basket of British stocks over the same period, Professor Chambers and Professor Dimson found.Considering that Keynes was investing during some of the worst years in history, his returns are astounding. How did he do it?In addition to focusing on bargain-priced small and midsize stocks, Keynes carefully evaluated managements. Could they prosper long term? Did they have a plan for when the economy turned around? \u201cI get more and more convinced that the right method in investment is to put fairly large sums into enterprises which one thinks one knows something about and in the management of which one thoroughly believes,\u201d Keynes wrote in 1934. Shades of Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett, and the whole school of value investing. Keynes also loved dividend payers, some of which were paying up to 6 percent during the deflationary 1930s. His portfolios were full of old-line companies in mining, railroads and shipping. Although they were perhaps boring and suspect choices at the time, he bought more shares when they became cheaper and predicted they would be worth more when the general economy recovered.Ultimately, Keynes was vindicated, building wealth for all of his institutional clients, and he built a personal fortune worth more than $30 million in 2013 dollars at the time of his death, which did not include a tally of his extensive collection of artwork and rare manuscripts. Keynes was not only an investment innovator, but one of the richest economists ever.While Keynes was most likely the recipient of price-sensitive information during his career, it is hard to discern if he profited from it. Insider trading was not broadly restricted in Britain until 1980. It is also hard to pin down whether Keynes invested along the lines of his famous economic theories, although it is clear that his investment activities informed his view of economics. Nevertheless, one of Keynes\u2019s most important insights was one that most investors still ignore: A prudent plan does not include timing the market, but focuses on long-term value and total return. It is a view that has not only worked for millions of investors who now invest in index funds \u2014 and do not time the market \u2014 but is also the foundation of a long-term strategy. Although Keynes\u2019s economic persona may still be the St. Sebastian of intellectual debate, Keynesian investing has proved to be a solid way to build wealth over time. John F.

He observed that where democracy was weak, newspapers that criticized the government would pay dearly for their audacity. \u201cCareful with the Leviathan,\u201d he said. He quoted John Adams: \u201cThe jaws of power are always open to devour, and her arm is always stretched out, if possible, to destroy the freedom of thinking, speaking and writing.\u201dThis heavy-handed government, which has been mum about my dismissal, reminds me of 1974, when I interviewed Mr. Wicker. Gen. Francisco Franco was still in power, but Spain\u2019s collective desire for freedom and democracy had taken on a life of its own. He died the next year, and the press was pivotal in the transition from dictatorship to democracy. Newspapers linked to the old regime had no credibility. Opportunities suddenly opened for journalists of my generation. In 1980, at age 28, I was named editor of the newspaper Diario 16. It was a crash course in journalism and democracy.In just a few years we endured seemingly all of the nerve-racking situations that a new democracy could possibly experience. We categorically opposed attempts by Franco\u2019s former generals to undermine the new government. We opposed the terrorism of Basque separatists \u2014 but also the death squads that Prime Minister Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s Socialist government assembled to fight the separatist group, known as ETA.In 1988, after our investigative reporting linked the Spanish government to the death squads\u2019 killings in the south of France, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez intercepted me in a corridor at the Parliament and asked me to stop publishing \u201cthose terrible things.\u201d I refused, and a few months later I was fired. The owner of the newspaper had succumbed to political pressure.Dozens of journalists quit and joined me to found El Mundo, \u201ca new newspaper for a new generation of readers.\u201d It was a rapid success. We quickly occupied a center-right political space, with a strong base of readers among young urban professionals. We resumed our investigation into the death squads.Previous prime ministers, including Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, Mr. Rajoy\u2019s Socialist predecessor, accepted press criticism. But everything changed when Mr. Rajoy, the leader of the conservative People\u2019s Party, came to power. Though we had endorsed him on three occasions, once in power he exhibited hostility toward uncomfortable truths and indifference to public opinion.As elsewhere, journalism in Spain has been under economic pressure. Newspaper advertising fell by two-thirds in six years, and print circulation by more than one-third. El Mundo is a leading newspaper online in Spain, with 7.2 million monthly unique users of its main website and 127,000 digital subscribers, but online revenues are not enough to balance the books. So the political pressure from the government, and its effect on advertising, came at a vulnerable moment.Spain has been in serious trouble since the property bubble burst in 2008. Unemployment has been hovering around 25 percent, and the economy is barely out of recession. Mr. Rajoy\u2019s governing party lacks internal democracy. The independence of the judiciary has been weakened. The monarchy has been tarnished by a spending scandal. Add in the attack on the press, and it seems clear to me that democracy might be more fragile now than at any point since Franco died in 1975. I plan to keep writing about it.Pedro J. Ram\u00edrez was the editor of El Mundo from its founding in 1989 until Saturday. This essay was translated by Kristina Cordero from the Spanish. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Violence in Ukraine Creates Deepening Clash Between East and West", "Date": "2014-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The two sides in what is developing into an East-West clash over Ukraine hardened their positions on Wednesday, with Russian officials denouncing what they called a coup by right-wing extremists, even as the United States and Europe threatened to impose sanctions on those responsible for the violence that has erupted in the capital, Kiev, and spread to other cities.The starkly divergent reactions underscored the deepening confrontation between Russia and the West over Ukraine\u2019s fate, with each side accusing the other of interference and disputing even the facts of what was happening.Expressing alarm at the escalating death toll, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France blamed the security forces of President Viktor F. Yanukovych and made it clear that they supported a political transition that would allow Ukrainians to elect a new government. After meeting with Mr. Hollande in Paris, Ms. Merkel said the convulsion of violence resulted from a \u201cdeliberate delaying tactic\u201d by Mr. Yanukovych to avoid a compromise and preserve his place in power.Russia, by contrast, vowed to use all its influence to support Ukraine\u2019s government and joined Mr. Yanukovych in accusing his opponents of trying to seize power in what amounted to a coup. In one of its most pointed statements since the political crisis in Ukraine began, the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry even evoked the Brown Revolution that brought the Nazis to power in Germany in 1933, blaming \u201ccriminal activities of radical opposition forces\u201d for causing the bloodshed and denouncing European countries for failing to acknowledge that.Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, accused the West of \u201cencouraging the opposition to act outside of the law.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want to impose ourselves, as some of our overly zealous Western partners are trying to do,\u201d he said in televised remarks from Kuwait. A senior State Department official dismissed the charge that the United States was meddling in Ukraine\u2019s affairs, saying that Washington had been open about its efforts to encourage a power-sharing government.The official threw the meddling charge back at Moscow. \u201cThey have not been transparent about what they\u2019ve been doing in Ukraine,\u201d the official said. \u201cI would put the question back to the Kremlin, \u2018What would they support?\u2019\u00a0\u201dPresident Obama, on a visit to Mexico, interrupted his opening meeting with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to tell reporters that \u201cthe United States condemns in the strongest terms\u201d the violence that has claimed lives in the last two days. He pointedly warned the Ukrainian military on Wednesday to stay out of the political crisis that has already ravaged the streets of Kiev and said the United States would hold the government responsible for further violence.The president\u2019s decision to address the Ukrainian situation without being asked reflected the growing concern by the White House that the standoff between the government and demonstrators in the street had spiraled out of control. \u201cWe have been watching very carefully, and we expect the Ukrainian government to show restraint, to not resort to violence in dealing with peaceful protesters,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThere will be consequences if people step over the line.\u201dThe substance of that threat became clear on Wednesday evening, when the Obama administration said it had imposed a visa ban on 20 senior Ukrainian officials whom it accused of playing a role in the government\u2019s crackdown on Tuesday. The State Department declined to say which officials were on the list, but a senior State Department official said it included \u201cthe full chain of command responsible for ordering the violence last night.\u201dIn a news conference Wednesday evening, Mr. Obama said the violence was not a proxy for the struggle for influence between Russia and the United States. He said his government\u2019s approach was \u201cnot to see this as some Cold War chessboard in which we are in competition with Russia.\u201d He also promised to \u201ccontinue to engage all sides in Ukraine.\u201dThe foreign ministers of France, Germany and Poland are scheduled to travel to Kiev on Thursday to press for a compromise, but given the deep divisions between Russia and the West there appeared to be little room for one.That has raised the prospect that what began as a political crisis in Ukraine could deteriorate into an armed confrontation. Some political figures in Moscow were warning of a repeat of the disintegration of Yugoslavia.Aleksei K. Pushkov, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of Russia\u2019s lower house of Parliament, said the most radicalized opponents of Mr. Yanukovych no longer sought a compromise but rather had taken up arms. \u201cNow there is a radical element that is not fully controlled by the opposition,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a political process anymore. It\u2019s a quasi-civil war.\u201dThe ferocity of the violence in Kiev appeared to stun Europe\u2019s leaders, leaving them scrabbling for an effective response to a crisis that began last November when Mr. Yanukovych rebuffed a plan to deepen political and economic ties with the European Union.A satellite image showing the site of the protests in Independence Square in Kiev, Ukraine.In Brussels, the European Union began the work of drafting sanctions that could impose travel bans and freeze the bank accounts of individuals who were found responsible for repressive acts. Such sanctions have become a standard reflex of the bloc\u2019s foreign policy, though their effectiveness is debated and it remains unclear who exactly set off the latest violence in Kiev.Secretary of State John Kerry, who was visiting Paris, warned that the United States would join the Europeans in imposing sanctions but also stopped short of pledging to do so. He said there was still time for Mr. Yanukovych to negotiate a resolution.\u201cOur desire is for Mr. Yanukovych to bring people together, dialogue with the opposition, find the measure of compromise and put the broad interests of the people of Ukraine out front,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.The West has threatened sanctions in recent weeks to little if any apparent effect, and Mr. Yanukovych and his government were certainly aware of the past threats when riot police officers attacked the protesters in Kiev.In Russia, officials also sought to influence events. Russia has pledged $15 billion in financial assistance to help Ukraine avert a default and released a second installment of $2 billion on Monday, helping set off the latest protests by those who fear the terms of Russia\u2019s aid would push the country further into the Kremlin\u2019s embrace.On Wednesday, however, Ukraine officials said the payment was being held up for \u201ctechnical reasons,\u201d Reuters reported.President Vladimir V. Putin spoke by telephone with Mr. Yanukovych overnight, but Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, declined to detail the conversation except to say that Mr. Putin was not trying to dictate the terms of any settlement.\u201cIn the president\u2019s view, all responsibility for what is happening in Ukraine rests with the extremists,\u201d Mr. Peskov told reporters, according to the Interfax news agency. At the same time, Mr. Peskov deflected questions about the continuation of Russia\u2019s loans, which the Kremlin froze for a period last month when the confrontation appeared to be worsening. \u201cWe cannot give more into the air,\u201d Mr. Pushkov said. \u201cThere should be a responsible government. Otherwise, it would just disappear.\u201dIn Russia, as in Europe, the crisis seemed a pivotal moment for the Continent and its dividing lines. \u201cWe Poles,\u201d Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland said, \u201cwill not remain indifferent to these events because we know that the developments in Ukraine will decide the history and the future of the whole region.\u201dReporting was contributed by Peter Baker from Toluca, Mexico; Alissa J.

{"Headline": "In Signing Farm Bill, Obama Extols Rural Growth", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEAST LANSING, Mich. \u2014 President Obama signed the $956 billion farm bill on Friday at Michigan State University, where he extolled the benefits of a thriving agricultural sector for the nation\u2019s overall economy.Standing in front of a tractor and other farm equipment, Mr. Obama said the legislation \u201clifts up our rural communities\u201d and would give more Americans \u201ca shot at opportunity\u201d in the years ahead.\u201cWe\u2019ve had the strongest stretch of farm exports in our history,\u201d Mr. Obama told about 500 farmers and local officials in a horse barn at the university. \u201cWe are selling more stuff to more people than ever before,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWhat we grow here and what we sell is a huge boost to the entire economy, but particularly the rural economy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen how hard it can be to be a farmer,\u201d he said. Big corporate farms are doing well, the president said, but \u201cthere are even more small farms, family farms, where folks are just scratching out a living.\u201dThe president arrived with several Democratic lawmakers and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on Air Force One just after noon on Friday and was greeted by the mayor of Lansing. The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said that about 50 lawmakers \u2014 including many Republicans \u2014 were invited to the bill signing, but that no Republicans accepted.The Democrats aboard included: Senators Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Debbie Stabenow and Carl Levin of Michigan. Also on board were Representatives Marcia L. Fudge of Ohio and Dan Kildee of Michigan, both Democrats.\u201cEveryone invited has to speak for himself or herself about their decision to attend or not attend,\u201d Mr. Carney told reporters. \u201cLook, this was a bipartisan effort and everyone involved in it deserves credit. The president is happy to share credit for that. The members that are on board today were deeply involved in helping this come about, and the president is very glad to have them join him.\u201dIn his remarks, Mr. Obama announced a new \u201cMade in Rural America\u201d initiative that he said would help rural businesses market their goods abroad. White House officials also announced five regional forums on rural exports and an \u201cinvesting in rural America\u201d conference. Mr. Obama directed the White House Rural Council to host sessions in all 50 states to train Department of Agriculture staff members on how to promote rural exports.The president called the farm bill a \u201cjobs bill,\u201d an \u201cinnovation bill,\u201d a \u201cresearch bill\u201d and a \u201cconservation bill.\u201d But he said two main benefits of the bill would be to help rural communities and provide food assistance to poor families and children.He noted that the legislation would provide the money for the nation\u2019s food stamp program, which helps poor families buy groceries even as it provides an important market for the nation\u2019s farmers.\u201cMore than half of all Americans will experience poverty at some point during their adult lives,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cFor more than half a century, this country has helped Americans put food on the table when they hit a rough patch or when they\u2019re working hard but aren\u2019t making enough money to feed their kids. They\u2019re not looking for a handout, these folks, they\u2019re looking for a hand up.\u201dSome advocates for the poor criticized the new farm bill, saying that spending cuts in the food stamp program will reduce the amount of money that poor families receive for food. Margarette Purvis, the president of the Food Bank For New York City, said in a statement that she was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d in the bill.\u201cWhatever the justifications being touted, we are left with the reality that hundreds of thousands of low-income families will face new hardship when they see their food assistance cut,\u201d she said.Mr. Obama has pledged to spend the next year focused on increasing economic opportunity for the middle class and confronting growing income inequality. But the president usually talks about the challenges for suburban and urban families. The appearance in Michigan on Friday gave him a chance to speak to the issues that many of the country\u2019s rural families face.The White House released a report Friday from Mr. Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers that said farm income had risen significantly since the president took office in the depths of the recession.\u201cThe past five years represents one of the strongest periods in our nation\u2019s farm economy,\u201d the report notes. \u201cNot only does American agriculture put food on the table of American families at affordable prices and provide raw material for a range of vital purposes, it also supports one out of every 12 jobs in the economy. The hard work done on the farm is felt throughout our economy, particularly when agriculture is thriving.\u201dThe report says that farm income is expected to total $131 billion in 2013, a 46 percent increase since 2008. Most of the increase is attributed to improved productivity, and the report notes that the values of livestock and crops are rising.One of the most contentious elements of the farm bill was the elimination of $5 billion in direct subsidies to farmers for their crops, whether they grew them or not. The subsidies were replaced by an insurance program that will help farmers only when they need it.The Council of Economic Advisers\u2019 report said the legislation would help provide \u201cprograms that finance investments in broadband, telecommunications, distance learning and telemedicine, entrepreneurship, and business development and growth.\u201d And it said that the legislation would continue an \u201cemphasis on small-business development, job creation and growth\u201d in rural areas.An earlier version of this article stated incorrectly one of the people who met President Obama when he got off Air Force One in Michigan. It was the mayor of Lansing, Mich., not the mayor of East Lansing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hard Times at Howard U.", "Date": "2014-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cFor her,\u201d Dr. Frederick explained, \u201cHoward was an almost mystical place, which had done so much for our country.\u201dWayne Frederick was afflicted with sickle cell anemia, which is often accompanied by long-term pain and fatigue and can lead to early death. That, too, shaped his path. He was in a race against time. Graduating one year ahead of his high school class, he enrolled at Howard and received both his undergraduate and medical degrees in six years. He remembers mentors like the legendary Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall, who embraced and encouraged him during his surgical residency.\u201cMy early teaching made me hopeful about the future,\u201d said Dr. Frederick in a barely detectable lilt of Trinidad. \u201cHoward wrapped me in an audacity by believing in me and creating an environment that made me comfortable.\u201dWearing a conservative pinstripe suit, white shirt and dark tie, Dr. Frederick was taking an early-morning break in the boardroom next to the president\u2019s office, recently vacated by Sidney A. Ribeau, who retired suddenly amid trustee unhappiness and friction that had gone public.Dr. Frederick, who was provost until this appointment, wants to ensure that Howard remains true to its mission: preparing African-Americans to be leaders. The Mecca, as students refer to this epicenter of black scholarship, has produced more African-American Ph.D.\u2019s, lawyers and architects than any other institution. But Dr. Frederick must confront a complex of uncomfortable realities, some brought on by the economy, some by financial mismanagement and board infighting, and some by the nation\u2019s diversifying landscape.Historically black colleges and universities, known as H.B.C.U.\u2019s, once held a monopoly. Today, they struggle to compete with elite colleges that have stepped up recruiting for the best and brightest black students. Howard admitted almost 60 percent of applicants last year; among current freshmen, the top 25 percent in SAT math and reading scored 1190 and up; 15 years ago the threshold was 1330.Other uncomfortable realities include new restrictions on the federal loans that many students depend on (89 percent of Howard\u2019s receive some sort of financial aid). Howard\u2019s teaching hospital has also been a drain on resources; once the sole choice for middle-class patients in a segregated society, it is now used mostly by those who cannot afford to pay elsewhere. And Howard has been hit with a downgrade of its credit rating by Moody\u2019s Investors Service that makes fund-raising even more difficult. This week, the university announced it is cutting about 200 staff positions.Howard is not unique in the constellation of private and public H.B.C.U.\u2019s, or even in the overall higher education community. Earlier this year, Moody\u2019s put out a negative outlook on the entire higher education sector.But as the saying goes, when white America catches a cold, black America catches pneumonia.In my case, the University of Georgia had the only journalism school in the South \u2014 my dream was to be Brenda Starr, having read the exciting exploits of the comic strip character from an early age. Hamilton Holmes, who was also part of the lawsuit against the State of Georgia, had gone to Morehouse, the men\u2019s H.B.C.U. in Atlanta, for almost two years before our victory. But the University of Georgia had more laboratory facilities than Morehouse, and Hamp, as he was known to his friends, wanted to be a doctor, so he chose Georgia.The lawsuit made it possible for me and other students to pursue our dreams in places that had always been closed to African-Americans. Little did any of us realize the price many black colleges would pay for equal opportunity.Take Fisk University, a leading black college in Nashville that graduated an army of freedom fighters who risked their lives to bring about equality and change in the South, as well as the lead attorney in my case in Georgia, Constance Baker Motley. Enrollment reached a little over 1,500 in the \u201970s. Today, Fisk has 645 students. And like other H.B.C.U.\u2019s whose enrollments are 1,000 or less, the prognosis for survival is not good.The economic issues that bedevil higher education in general are even more disruptive in the H.B.C.U. community, in part because many of the students are first in their families to go to college. Forty-six percent of students at historically black colleges come from families with incomes lower than $34,000, and half qualify for federal low-income Pell grants, according to the United Negro College Fund, which finances scholarships for 37 private black colleges. The organization also manages a Gates Foundation scholarship program that allows disadvantaged students to choose any institution. Only 19 percent of the recipients have chosen black colleges.But damage has been done. Denials have led to some 17,000 fewer students attending black colleges, costing the institutions more than $150 million in revenue, according to the United Negro College Fund. Howard lost 585 students, though about half were readmitted thanks to an intense fund-raising campaign.Enrollment at Howard has fallen from a high of 11,321 students in 1980 to 10,297 today, although this fall the university attracted the second-largest freshman class in 15 years.Founded by church organizations and white philanthropists in 1867, Howard had a mission: to educate newly freed blacks after the Civil War. As a result, though it is a private university, Howard has enjoyed special appropriations from the federal government \u2014 about $200 million a year over the last decade. But as a result of congressionally mandated, across-the-board cuts \u2014 a.k.a., the sequester \u2014 Howard lost $12 million last year.As Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington\u2019s congressional representative, put it: \u201cBecause of its historic reliance on government funds, that made Howard better off, but now, with the sequester, Howard, which was better off, is now worse off.\u201d\u201cDo you run AARP like Howard University?\u201d one sign read. And others: \u201cDon\u2019t tweet about it. Be about it.\u201d \u201cSave the Mecca.\u201d \u201cStop Outsourcing Jobs\u201d (a reference to the chief financial officer, an independent contractor).Glynn Hill, editor of Howard\u2019s student newspaper, The Hilltop, summarized the mood on campus for me this way: \u201cStudents and the alumni that we\u2019ve engaged on Twitter are both anxious and on the edge of their seats to see how the university continues to move forward.\u201dHoward has been in turmoil for several years over its fiscal direction as well as a series of public relations blunders, notably the news of bonuses to high-level administrators amounting to $1.1 million amid cost-cutting and tuition increases. In a letter to trustees last June, Howard\u2019s academic deans \u2014 at the moment, 6 of the 13 are interim \u2014 charged that \u201cfiscal mismanagement is doing irreparable harm\u201d to the university, and urged they remove the C.F.O. (he and the university parted ways in November).\u201cYou cannot grow a university by overly cutting,\u201d Dr. Walters told me recently. \u201cPoor decisions made in terms of staffing have come back to haunt us. You will drain the life out of the faculty.\u201dIf the pot was boiling at the Mecca, it was stirred by Renee Higginbotham-Brooks, a Howard graduate, lawyer and vice chairwoman of the board, who last April sent a letter to trustees with a dire warning: Unless some \u201ccrucial decisions\u201d were made promptly, the university would be gone in three years. She called for the dismissal of Mr. Rand and Dr. Ribeau, citing poor fiscal management and blasting expenditures like $107 million for two new dorms, although they were funded by bonds.The letter somehow went public, leading to board \u201chiccups,\u201d as one trustee put it. (Members would talk only anonymously because of this sensitive time of transition at Howard. Mr. Rand and Dr. Ribeau did not respond to repeated requests for interviews. Ms. Higginbotham-Brooks said she had nothing more to say on the matter.)While board hiccups are not exclusive to Howard, it is not often that an institution\u2019s internal politics hit the fan and the news media. And when they did, Mr. Rand countered in a statement that the university had balanced its budget for the past four years and restored its endowment of more than $500 million to prerecession levels. The bonuses had been decided under the previous president but awarded under Dr. Ribeau.Some faculty members, like Greg E. Carr, chairman of the Department of Afro-American Studies, said Dr. Ribeau had done a reasonably good job, given that he had come in during a recession and from a predominantly white institution, Bowling Green State University, that didn\u2019t have the same issues, or students, as did Howard.He praised Dr. Ribeau for setting in motion a plan to raise $25 million in scholarship funds and the biggest \u201cacademic renewal project\u201d in the university\u2019s history.The project\u2019s goal, supported by Dr. Frederick, was to become more competitive nationally by strengthening popular degree programs and shedding underpopulated ones, some with as few as a half-dozen students. Of 171 programs, 21 are being restructured, and 25 have been cut, including German studies, classics, art history, fashion and a master\u2019s in public administration, as STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering and math) are being built up.That plan, too, was controversial. After protests erupted, the university backtracked on some cuts, including retaining a B.A. in philosophy and in African studies.\u201cIf you have a mandate to bring Howard into the 21st century, you have to be cognizant of the politics on the ground,\u201d Dr. Carr said. \u201cYou can have that understanding, but you have to be able to leverage that understanding to build consensus to move forward.\u201dNot long after Dr. Ribeau\u2019s departure, the board held its annual retreat to discuss the state of Howard and the way forward. Some former board members and big contributors attended, but one of those present said that less than half of the 33 trustees showed. Several told me that they are intent on reinventing the board. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved on, toward building board unity,\u201d one said. \u201cWe will be rebuilding expectations of the board members and weeding out people who don\u2019t have time.\u201dAlready, two historically black colleges are now predominantly white \u2014 West Virginia State and Bluefield State, also in West Virginia \u2014 and one, St. Philip\u2019s College in San Antonio, is predominantly Hispanic.As a sign of things to come, Mr. Hollis recently journeyed to Brazil and worked out an agreement in which the Brazilian government will pay for 1,000 of its students to attend H.B.C.U.\u2019s for two years.\u201cIt is foolish to think that significant change can\u2019t come to a sector like H.B.C.U.\u2019s,\u201d said John S. Wilson Jr., president of Morehouse. \u201cIt is happening now and there is no guarantee that we will all survive.\u201d Dr. Wilson, a 1979 graduate of Morehouse, points to the example of women\u2019s colleges.\u201cWhen I was at Morehouse in the late \u201970s,\u201d he continued, \u201cthere were 250 to 300 women-only colleges and now there are 47. Similarly, in the 1970s, somewhere between 75 and 85 percent of African-Americans in higher education were being educated inside H.B.C.U.\u2019s.\u201d Today, of African-American students in higher education, only about 9 percent are attending historically black colleges.As Dr. Harvey of Hampton points out, \u201cH.B.C.U.\u2019s are not monolithic, just like white schools.\u201d The Department of Education lists 100, including community colleges and religious schools. Some, like Hampton and the women\u2019s college Spelman, have enjoyed enrollment growth and relative financial stability.\u201cThe strongest and best colleges that will not only survive but thrive are the ones that can further clarify and amplify their value proposition,\u201d Dr. Wilson said. At Morehouse, \u201cwe have to tout a stronger, clearer value proposition that can attract more of the best and most driven students. We are going to have to give them an experience on this campus that is so powerful that our pool of applicants will expand well beyond African-American men and beyond our borders.\u201dStill, it is likely to be a tough row to hoe. Morehouse, whose graduates include the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Dr. David Satcher and Spike Lee, lost 500 students between 2009 and 2013.When he arrived at Morehouse in 2013, Dr. Wilson said, it was in deep financial trouble. Dr. Wilson, who has a master\u2019s and a doctorate in administration, planning and social policy, cut $5 million in administrative costs, eliminated 75 positions and closed one residence hall. He calls the current time at Morehouse \u201ca period of repair.\u201dDr. Wilson, who is 56, is an example of what many argue is needed now to rescue black colleges: a new breed of leader who has an allegiance to the H.B.C.U. culture \u2014 the caring, almost familial culture that nurtured a young Wayne Frederick \u2014 but who can prepare students for a technology-based future and embrace new business models. Among the younger generation of presidents often cited are Walter M. Kimbrough, the 46-year-old president of Dillard in New Orleans (his Twitter name: @Hip HopPrez), and Dr. Frederick.Dr. Frederick is confident that Howard can move forward. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot of hard work and elbow grease,\u201d he said, adding, however, that if budget cuts continue to be enforced and no changes are made to the Plus program, the road is going to be tougher.\u201cI don\u2019t know what families are going to do,\u201d he said in a clearly despondent whisper.His priorities include the things most agree need urgent attention simultaneously: a financial literacy program for students and their parents; more support for students early on, including fortifying academic advising, to help turn around a four-year graduation rate of 42 percent (63 percent within six years); and the development of new revenue streams and diversification of current ones, concentrating on what most H.B.C.U. presidents say is a major weakness: alumni giving.That last goal, Dr. Frederick said, is \u201ca complicated issue.\u201d Howard graduates traditionally give to institutions in their community, he explained. \u201cThey tend to support local churches and local groups. They give not just of their money but of their time.\u201dDr. Frederick, who also has an M.B.A., acknowledges that he has to take a hard look at Howard\u2019s business model. \u201cWe have to diversify that revenue stream, including monetizing our real estate assets, reducing dependence on tuition and growing our endowment,\u201d he said. He is working with a financial services company to try to reverse the declining fortunes of Howard\u2019s teaching hospital, where cost overruns amounted to $21 million in the fiscal year 2012, cutting deeply into Howard\u2019s overall budget. And like wealthier traditional institutions that are attracting students with low- or no-cost online courses, Howard is beginning to offer courses online.When asked if Howard should wean itself from federal support, Dr. Frederick politely objected to the word. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as weaning,\u201d he said. \u201cThe federal government appropriation is not just a support for Howard but is a support that\u2019s in the national interest. Students at H.B.C.U.\u2019s account for approximately 3 percent of all students enrolled at colleges and universities in the United States, but account for 18 to 20 percent of African-American college graduates. So they represent a very important pipeline. Also, a large number of Ph.D.\u2019s in STEM are coming from H.B.C.U.\u2019s, of which Howard is the No. 1 producer. So it\u2019s definitely in the national interest. No doubt about that.\u201dDr. Frederick plans to visit states already sending students to Howard \u2014 Maryland, New York and California \u2014 as well as go where there is potential, like Florida and Pittsburgh. He also hopes to marry Howard\u2019s traditional mission with one that looks at the country\u2019s changing demographics.\u201cWe\u2019ve fulfilled our mission around a lot of black students, but our charter was never really created solely for black students,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the future, as we become a more global society, we will always be in a position to embrace the world around us.\u201dMr. Hill, the student editor, who has been at Howard three years, said he already feels he is a part of the \u201clast of vintage Howard.\u201d\u201cWe had a serious Afrocentric feel to the campus,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now it\u2019s fairly obvious that the campus has gotten a little lighter. Nowadays, you can\u2019t count the number of white kids, and I had never seen Asians before now. Students are even playing Frisbee!\u201dStill, 93 percent of undergraduates at Howard are black, and African-Americans are likely to remain the majority for years to come, even as Howard and other black institutions grapple with \u201cmaking a way out of no way,\u201d to borrow the civil rights mantra.During my visit to campus, students talked about how they had realized their dreams by coming to Howard. I met Jamila Mitchell, who wants to be an optometrist, and Miajah McGraw, a Spanish major, both from Virginia, at a popular coffee shop.Ms. Mitchell, ranked fifth in her high school class, said she chose Howard because of the scholarship it offered covering tuition for four years and because, having attended a predominantly white school, she sought a different experience. Howard\u2019s diversity \u2014 \u201call kinds of different black people, especially the international aspect\u201d \u2014 came as a surprise, she said. \u201cI learned to work with different groups of people on all sides of the spectrum.\u201dBoth women said they felt academically prepared, but they complained that there were not enough chairs or spaces to study, and many of the classrooms were in need of renovation. In too many, Ms. McGraw said, \u201cyou burn up in summer and freeze in winter.\u201dIsabella Hazell El-Diery, a freshman from Massachusetts, has not been following the melodrama over Howard\u2019s president. Certainly there was room for improvement, she said, but she has learned more than classroom lessons here. She had visited Howard three times before finally making her decision, swayed by her interest in international affairs and internship possibilities in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cI felt it was somewhere I could learn to do great things,\u201d she said. \u201cAmazing people are always coming to Howard to speak.\u201dThere was something else that was important to her identity, coming as she did from a mostly white high school. Her mother is Jewish, her father black. \u201cI didn\u2019t learn about slavery until I got here,\u201d Ms. El-Diery said. \u201cIt\u2019s also about being black here, and that\u2019s important because you are learning about where you came from.\u201dThese students, Dr. Frederick said, embody Howard\u2019s sacred trust as well as his hope for Howard\u2019s future. \u201cOur contributions are still groundbreaking,\u201d he said, \u201cand are absolutely key to contributing to a more complex society.\u201dAn article on Page 18 this weekend about the challenges facing Howard University contains several errors.The university\u2019s federal appropriation was cut by $12 million, not by $2 million.The chief financial officer, Robert Tarola, did not recommend bonuses for high-level administrators because he was not affiliated with Howard when the bonuses were approved.The company that downgraded Howard\u2019s credit rating is Moody\u2019s Investors Service, not Moody\u2019s Investor Service.And though Howard says that it has produced more African-American engineers than any other institution, no statistics exist to support that statement.An article last Sunday about challenges facing Howard University misstated its federal appropriation. It was about $200 million a year over the past decade, not a total of $200 million during that time.Charlayne Hunter-Gault is a former reporter for The Times, NPR, CNN and PBS.

{"Headline": "France and Germany Lead Euro Zone to Higher Growth", "Date": "2014-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The euro zone economy grew slightly faster than expected in the last three months of 2013, an official report showed on Friday, bringing welcome news for the global economy amid signs of slowing in the United States and China.Although growth in the 18-nation currency union is still weak, at a 1.1 percent annualized rate, it was the euro zone\u2019s third straight quarter in positive territory, indicating that the bloc is well beyond the year-and-a-half recession that ended in mid-2013.The broader 28-member European Union also grew, though weakly, for the third consecutive quarter. The Union, with a market of 500 million consumers and an economy worth about 11.7 trillion euros, or $16 trillion, is one of the pillars of the global economy, and the extended weakness there has been a major source of concern for officials in the United States.Germany and France, the two largest euro zone members, led the upturn. The Netherlands broke out of recession, and the pace of growth picked up modestly in Portugal, Spain and Italy.\u201cThe most important point is that the recession really is over, and the periphery is growing again,\u201d J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said. And yet, he quickly added, the pace is inadequate to have a meaningful impact on Europe\u2019s biggest problem, the 26 million people without jobs.But the Eurostat report nonetheless came as a welcome surprise as more recent data from the United States, including a disappointing report on industrial production on Friday and a weak retail sales report on Thursday, were suggesting that a slowdown might be in the offing. China\u2019s economy, the second-largest in the world after the United States\u2019, appears increasingly fragile in the face of a push by the authorities in Beijing to deflate what is widely regarded as a giant credit bubble.The euro zone figures released on Friday might also have brought at least a small measure of relief to Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank. He and his colleagues on the bank\u2019s Governing Council have been watching the economic data for signs that ultralow inflation in the euro zone might be a sign of underlying weakness that could tip the bloc into outright deflation, a downward spiral of falling prices and economic torpor that can be hard to reverse.Mr. Kr\u00e4mer said the data on Friday was in line with the E.C.B.'s own forecasts and would merely confirm the central bank\u2019s expectation for a slow, steady recovery. It will want to see additional data before deciding whether to move on monetary policy, he said, with reports on inflation, money supply and bank lending, as well as a survey of purchasing managers, before the March 6 meeting of the Governing Council. The bank\u2019s own economists will also be making new forecasts next month, including the inflation outlook for 2016.\u201cThe likelihood of a further rate cut in March is lowered somewhat\u201d by the growth report on Friday, Mr. Kr\u00e4mer said. But if the coming reports \u201ccome in on the weak side, that would support the case for more action.\u201dThe acceleration in growth is reflected in the automobile industry, one of the sectors hit hardest by the slowdown in the euro zone. Ford Motor said on Friday that sales in its 20 most important European countries rose 9.2 percent in January compared with a year earlier. It was the eighth consecutive month of improving sales, Ford said, and followed several months of upturn in the overall car market.ArcelorMittal, the world\u2019s largest steel maker, said in the last week that it expected demand in Europe to increase as much as 2.5 percent this year, a welcome change from the steep slump the industry has endured since 2008.Financial markets met the news calmly, with the broad Stoxx Europe 600 index adding 0.6 percent on Friday and the euro ticking up 0.1 percent against the dollar to $1.3698.As welcome as the growth report might be, Europe\u2019s recovery remains fragile.Growth \u201cis likely to remain a long way short of the rates needed to tackle the problems of sky-high unemployment and crippling debt levels in many euro zone countries,\u201d Jonathan Loynes, an economist in London with Capital Economics, wrote in a research note. \u201cAnd with G.D.P. still almost 3 percent below its 2008 peak, the dangers of deflation in the currency union will persist.\u201dThe \u201cmodest expansion\u201d does not, he added, reduce \u201cthe urgent need for more policy action from the European Central Bank.\u201dGerman growth was the result of higher exports, the country\u2019s Federal Statistical Office said on Friday. In addition, German companies stepped up investment in construction projects as well as equipment.But German household spending dipped slightly in the fourth quarter compared with the third period, according to seasonally adjusted figures. The decline may come as a disappointment to those who hoped that Germans would help stimulate the euro zone economy by buying more products from their neighbors or taking more lavish vacations.Mohsen Sohi, chief executive of the Freudenberg Group, a German manufacturer, said that 2013 was \u201can exceptionally challenging market environment\u201d but that there were signs of improvement in the second half.The company, which makes a wide variety of products such as gaskets and sealers used in cars, \u201cexpects to see a slight recovery in the global economy in 2014,\u201d Mr. Sohi said in an email. \u201cIn our opinion, established economies will experience gentle growth.\u201d\u201cThis is obviously not enough,\u201d Pierre Moscovici, the French finance minister, told France 2 television, \u201cbut it well shows the strength of our economy.\u201dNicola Clark contributed reporting from Paris, and Jack Ewing and Stanley Reed from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade Issue Goes Untouched as Obama and Reid Meet", "Date": "2014-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama met with Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, at the White House on Monday but made no effort to change Mr. Reid\u2019s mind on the trade initiative that has divided them, according to Democrats briefed on the session.Last week, the day after Mr. Obama vowed to fight for additional authority to negotiate trade deals with Europe and Asia, Mr. Reid, the majority leader, effectively slammed the door on the idea and publicly warned the president not to push it. The White House said Mr. Obama would keep pressing for his initiative because it would bolster the economy and create jobs.But when Mr. Obama and Mr. Reid sat down on Monday, trade did not come up, according to the Democrats. Instead, the discussion focused on the coming midterm elections, in which Republicans could capture control of the upper chamber if they pick up six seats.Also present were Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and Guy Cecil, the committee\u2019s executive director. Democrats, who said the meeting had been scheduled before Mr. Reid\u2019s comments last week, are seeking political help from Mr. Obama. Despite the president\u2019s sagging poll numbers, he remains an effective fund-raiser and can motivate the party base in some parts of the country.The dispute over trade, though, highlights the challenges facing Mr. Obama as he tries to advance his agenda in a campaign year. As he negotiates trade pacts with Europe and Asia, he wants Congress to give him authority to submit agreements for up-or-down votes, as previous presidents have been able to do, rather than allowing lawmakers to amend them. So-called fast-track authority is viewed as essential to passing any agreements, and it is one area where the president and Republicans agree.But the Democratic base, particularly labor unions and environmental activists, has long been skeptical of such trade agreements, and Mr. Reid opposes giving the authority to the president. \u201cEveryone would be well advised just to not push this right now,\u201d he said the day after Mr. Obama\u2019s State of the Union address.Republicans have needled Mr. Obama about the schism. \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely right,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said of Mr. Obama on Monday. \u201cBut now the president\u2019s own party is now standing in the way of getting anything done. So if ever there was a moment for the president to use his phone, this is it.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s aides said he would continue to seek the authority. \u201cThese trade agreements would significantly boost our exports,\u201d Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said shortly before the meeting with Mr. Reid. \u201cAnd the president\u2019s going to push hard for this because he believes it\u2019s the right thing to do for our economy, the right thing to do for American workers.\u201dBut Mr. Obama did not make that case to Mr. Reid when he had the chance. White House officials are trying to avoid a public fight that they see as self-destructive. Asked before the meeting if the president would raise the issue, Mr. Carney suggested it did not have to come up on that particular day because Mr. Obama and Mr. Reid were in regular communication. \u201cThey talk all the time,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China's Growing Stake in Stability", "Date": "2014-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialChina\u2019s growing investment in industries worldwide chills those who see in it the specter of a global economic behemoth. But there could be more reason to welcome than fear this new role. By giving China a greater stake in global and regional stability and prosperity, these investments could ease the tensions created by China\u2019s geopolitical activities.China has had a major role in world financial markets for years. But investment in foreign businesses by its public and private companies could soon overtake foreign investment in China, said Shen Danyang, a Commerce Ministry spokesman. Direct investments abroad not only create employment and wealth in the recipient countries, but, if they are large enough, they can bind national economies and political interests, stabilizing relationships. The Lenovo Group, a major computer manufacturer, recently made acquisitions worth more than $5 billion to push into the smartphone business in the United States. The company is based in Beijing but has a hub in Morrisville, N.C. Xu Weiping, the creator of huge business parks in China, is investing $1.6 billion to turn the abandoned Royal Albert Dock in London into the main European hub for Chinese companies. He said more than 60 Chinese businesses had agreed to take space in the development. Last week, the French government and the Chinese state-owned Dongfeng Motor agreed to buy $4 billion in shares of the troubled French automaker PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn. The investment provides Dongfeng with technological upgrades and Peugeot with capital to restructure so it can become competitive again. The deal raises China\u2019s stake not only in Peugeot but in the health of the French economy and in its relationship with the French government. Chinese investment in Japan has been in the billions for several years, despite tensions over conflicting claims about islets in the East China Sea that some strategic analysts fear could lead to war. But it makes little sense to go to war while increasing investments that could be confiscated during a conflict. Even though China does not seem worried about stirring up this rivalry, further Chinese investment in Japan should motivate China to tone down its aggressiveness out of self-interest.Deepening economic integration can act as a counterweight to international political difficulties. Japanese and European governments should take heart in the flow of Chinese capital that provides the much-needed investment in their current struggles to fight deflation. Conversely, any nationalistic effort to restrict the flow of Chinese capital would heighten anxieties to no one\u2019s benefit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colombia\u2019s Warning for Mexico", "Date": "2014-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMEDELL\u00cdN, Colombia \u2014 Most everyone agrees: The only thing worse than killing is being killed. If our lives are threatened, we have the right to defend ourselves, with force if necessary. In a civilized society, that defense is delegated to the state. But not all of us, apparently, live in that kind of civilized society. Colombia in the 1990s saw the rise of vigilante self-defense groups. In its impotence and desperation at not being able to rapidly win the war against the guerrilla army (which was essentially a drug cartel) and against the drug lord Pablo Escobar\u2019s private army, the state gave the green light to these groups \u2014 called Convivir. They were made up of agricultural laborers, trained by soldiers, and financed by landowners and agribusinesses. When they began to extort money from the very businessmen who were financing them, they were declared illegal. But it was already too late. They had become clandestine paramilitary groups, using the same weapons as those they were fighting: kidnapping, murder of innocents, drug trafficking. What has been going on these last few months in Mexico, in the western state of Michoac\u00e1n, makes me fear that the same thing is happening there today. \u201cAutodefensas\u201d have organized to drive out the vicious local drug cartel, called the Knights Templar. After first demanding that the vigilantes disband, the government of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has now sanctioned them as part of the Rural Defense Corps \u2014 at least nominally under the control of the military. This is how it happens. The army, with the blessing of the central authorities, looks for an ally, a lesser evil among the local powers. Compared with the cruel and bloodthirsty Knights Templar, the self-defense groups have popular support and are allowed to operate. Meanwhile, the government ignores the fact that some of these vigilantes might be financed by the enemies of the Knights Templar \u2014 for example, rival drug gangs or another cartel from the neighboring state of Jalisco. The government allows the vigilantes to act for a while, but when it tries to come back in, the self-defense groups will have turned into a real armed power with whom the government will have to make a pact, for without them the state won\u2019t be able to assert its authority. Mexico, like several Latin American countries, is able to guarantee security and the rule of law only in certain zones. The lifeblood of law and order manages to flow near the heart of power, around the big cities, but the farther away we get, the weaker the pulse, and in some places there is none at all. Police officers are few and corrupt, judges live under threat from local despots and strongmen, and the legitimate authorities have been paid off by illegal ones. It\u2019s like the American Wild West, but with 21st-century armaments, private armies funded by the torrential flow of money from drug trafficking, and no prospect of a righteous sheriff riding in to restore calm.Sometimes the United States \u2014 which understands itself so well, but badly misunderstands Latin American realities \u2014 asks governments of its friendly southern neighbors to wage heroic battles. It asks for elimination of illicit crops, total war on drugs or extermination of guerrilla forces. The most obedient governments ignore what might be real solutions \u2014 like cutting off the source of the cartels\u2019 enormous wealth by legalizing drugs \u2014 and instead attempt to carry out these requests. They send their national armies to undertake the thankless task of fighting against their own compatriots. That\u2019s what Felipe Calder\u00f3n, Mexico\u2019s previous president, tried. But these wars to the death always fail. What they generate is local powers defending themselves by arming to the teeth, and outlying territories turning into battlefields where life is impossible for defenseless civilians. The legitimate economy and tourism disappear, death tolls soar (to around 80,000 in Mexico), and the final winner, inevitably, is not the state but some local narco-dictator with his own army of mercenaries.This is what we learned in Colombia: When the state is not present, it is local tyrants who take power and brutally impose their rules, which are nothing more than the defense of their privileges. The old Hobbesian concept, that the natural state of mankind is that man is a wolf to man, seems confirmed in these involuntary Latin American anarchist experiments. The strongest and richest wolf (from trafficking drugs or illegal mining) dominates the other wolves. Of course, every country is different. But I fear that today Mexico is making the same mistake Colombia did a quarter of a century ago. The vigilantes appear to be a cure \u2014 they are seen as saviors \u2014 but in reality they are part of the illness, one more illegal army, acting without restraints and financed by dirty money. In Colombia, the self-defense groups were eventually pursued until, in 2003, 25,000 of them were forced to demobilize. Since they were also drug traffickers, a few top paramilitary ringleaders ended up being extradited to the United States. But their legacy persists. Their descendants still live in Colombia and still have power: Now they\u2019re called criminal gangs, and they are still practicing extortion and murder financed by illegal mining and drug money. The vigilantes might begin by killing kidnappers, drug dealers and extortionists, but soon they begin killing their relatives, and then their friends, or those they think are their friends, and then the friends\u2019 families, until everyone is suspect and they might come knocking at your own door, as happened to us in Colombia \u2014 as happened to my own father, when he was gunned down in the streets of Medell\u00edn. To allow private armies, even if they are supposedly for self-defense, is to create a monster like the Hydra: If you cut off one head, two more grow back. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Border City on the Edge of the Law", "Date": "2014-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMong La JournalMONG LA, Myanmar \u2014 The smuggling route into this rebel-run jungle outpost just over the Chinese border begins on the back of a motorcycle that takes passengers through steeply terraced rubber plantations, and skirts the official crossing before ending at an outdoor market where bedraggled prostitutes mingle with Chinese tourists haggling over tiger claws, bear paws and desiccated squares of elephant skin.At $14 each way, the 20-minute ride is a relative bargain, although the price does not include payoffs to teenage Burmese insurgents at impromptu checkpoints along the way.Tucked into the verdant forests of Myanmar\u2019s eastern Shan State, Mong La is better known here by its Chinese name, Xiaomengla, in part because the vast majority of its residents are Chinese, as are most of the illegal day-trippers, drug mules, Christian missionaries and comely young croupiers who work in the city\u2019s 20 casinos, most of which are Chinese-owned.Mong La has a hilltop Buddhist temple and a picturesque colonial church, but vice and self-indulgence, not sightseeing, are the city\u2019s main draws. \u201cThere\u2019s not much to do here but gamble and eat wild animals,\u201d one Chinese matron said with a jaded sigh.Mong La runs on Beijing time, 90 minutes ahead of the rest of Myanmar, also known as Burma. Cellphone service and electricity are provided by China. The renminbi of China, not the Burmese kyat, is the only currency accepted at the city\u2019s roulette tables, storefront brothels and Sichuan-style restaurants.As Myanmar embraces democracy after decades of military dictatorship, Mong La, the domain of a former Communist rebel turned warlord-entrepreneur, is a glaring reminder of the challenges the Burmese government faces in taming the patchwork of rebel-held territories along its northern frontier.Sai Leun, the warlord who runs what is officially known as Special Region No. 4, employs several thousand armed men who, for the moment, peacefully coexist with Burmese troops and the ethnic Wa militia that controls a neighboring piece of territory.Despite its longstanding economic and historic ties to the region, China has a conflicted relationship with Mong La. A decade ago, alarmed by the legion of officials gambling away stolen public money, Chinese soldiers poured across the border to shut down the casinos. In response, Sai Leun simply orchestrated the construction of new gambling parlors 10 miles farther south of the border on a virgin tract of jungle.In 2012, when China severed cellphone service to the area in an effort to choke off Internet gambling, casino owners brought in satellite dishes to maintain the flow of money from those who prefer to bet from the comfort of Shanghai, Guangzhou and other Chinese cities.Analysts say the Chinese are reluctant to pull the plug entirely \u2014 something it could easily do by blocking cross-border traffic or by cutting off the electrical supply flowing south from adjacent Yunnan Province.\u201cIf we banned tourism entirely, it would harm more than just the casinos and hit a lot of businesses that support the local economy,\u201d said Zhu Zhenming, an expert on China-Myanmar relations at the Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences.Officially, at least, Beijing tries to limit access to the city by requiring its citizens to obtain special permits; outside each casino, large red signs remind Chinese citizens that they are forbidden to enter.In reality, Mandarin speakers fill nearly every seat at the baccarat tables and electronic slot machines. Few bother applying for a pass and instead sneak in, via motorbike or by climbing through large holes conveniently located on the border fence.Mong La thrives by appealing to humanity\u2019s more base desires. Hotel rooms are littered with palm cards hawking \u201cnewly arrived virgins,\u201d \u201cmother-daughter combos\u201d and \u201csassy 16-year-olds with large breasts,\u201d and hotel televisions broadcast round-the-clock Japanese pornography, along with Chinese historical dramas and South Korean soap operas. Crystal meth is widely available, as are handguns, stolen cars and a Noah\u2019s Ark of endangered wildlife \u2014 including owls, and tortoises \u2014 displayed in cages outside restaurants.The city\u2019s anything-goes ethos has turned Mong La into a magnet for wildlife traffickers eager to satisfy the medicinal and culinary cravings of its Chinese clientele. Stores openly sell Tibetan antelope heads, cloud leopard pelts and wild tiger limbs \u2014 items banned in China. At the live animal market, caged monkeys and pangolins, scaly anteaters whose meat is highly prized in southern China, await slaughter.Vincent Nijman, a zoologist at Oxford Brookes University in England, said Mong La has become one of Asia\u2019s largest markets for endangered wildlife. In recent years, he has cataloged about 40 rare and threatened species at the market, among them a hairy-nosed otter \u2014 an animal that until recently had been believed to have been extinct.At night, Mong La resembles a neon spaceship that crash-landed in the jungle. But the potholed streets are thick with desperation. \u201cI came here a rich man, and now I have nothing,\u201d said a 43-year-old cabdriver, a former businessman from Chongqing, who said he gambled away nearly 700,000 renminbi, or about $115,000, more than a decade ago. The driver, who gave only his surname, Zhang, said he longed to be with his family but could not leave until he earned enough money to regain his pride. \u201cI won\u2019t let my family come here, because this is no place for children,\u201d he said before turning his attention back to the poker game on his cellphone.Having borrowed money from loan sharks, some residents are trapped as they await money from relatives. Others are outlaws who have found refuge in a lawless land. Liu Qiao, 40, a blustery man, said he lost $1.6 million that belonged to his mining company in a gambling spree in Macau and fled here from China, in 2009.Fearing arrest if he returns home, he found work as a so-called casino agent, escorting wealthy gamblers to casinos and arranging cash advances through a company that gives him a small cut of each loan. Asked what happens to those who cannot repay their debts, Mr. Liu smiled uncomfortably. \u201cYou don\u2019t leave until you pay,\u201d he said.With many of his Chinese customers spending the Lunar New Year holiday at home with family, Mr. Liu was eager to accompany a group of Western visitors he mistook for high rollers. After a bone-rattling drive along the unfinished road that connects the city center to the gambling district, he showed off the Casino Lisboa, a Thai-themed gambling hall presided over by a large Buddha, and the Royal Casino, its brightly lit facade dressed in fluted columns and Roman centurions.Inside, the mood was quietly tense as chain-smoking gamblers hovered over their chips, making bets as high as $33,000. Sharing the tables were scores of young men and women with headsets. Their job: to play the hands of remote Chinese bettors who followed the action through live video feeds.Over dinner, Mr. Liu lamented that his gambling addiction had destroyed his family and the mining company, started with friends, that has since gone belly up. \u201cI\u2019ve lost all face,\u201d he said.But his mood brightened as he took one more stroll through the casino floor. He paused at a roulette table, threw down a 100-renminbi note bearing the face of Mao Zedong and waited. When the ball dropped, he picked up 200 renminbi from the table and walked out into the night, a smile on his face.An article on Feb. 25 about the transformation of Mong La, a city in Myanmar near the Chinese border, into a notorious hub of gambling and prostitution since the country emerged from decades of dictatorship referred incorrectly to the status of a wild animal for sale in a live market. The animal, the bamboo rat, is not endangered.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkey's Model Nation", "Date": "2014-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past decade, the Turkish government has received much praise for successfully melding Islam and democracy. Today, however, Ankara\u2019s continued reliance on tactics of confrontation and intimidation is threatening to overshadow the country\u2019s significant achievements. As Turkey attempts to construct a post-revolutionary order, it would do well to follow the example of one Arab country that has managed to avoid political gridlock: Tunisia.In 2011, protests led to the ouster of Tunisia\u2019s longtime dictator, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. The spirit of revolution soon spread to other Arab countries, albeit with less-impressive results. Libya suffered from bloody internal turmoil; Egypt reverted to brutal military rule; Syria continues to be ravaged by civil war. In Tunisia, however, the nascent democratic process has not been derailed. The country\u2019s new Constitution \u2014 the most liberal and democratic charter the Muslim Middle East has ever seen \u2014 remains the Arab Spring\u2019s crowning achievement to date.Ratified on Jan. 26, the Constitution is a strikingly \u201cWe the people\u201d document in a region where \u201cMe the state\u201d has long been the norm. It protects civil liberties, establishes a separation of powers, and guarantees women parity in political bodies. Though it declares Islam the country\u2019s official religion and refers generally to Tunisia\u2019s identity as an Islamic state, the Constitution protects religious freedom for all. This is a significant achievement, as things might have easily gone awry. Like most other countries in the region, Tunisia is deeply divided along secular and religious lines. The post-revolutionary ascendance of the Islamist Ennahda party has particularly troubled the secularists. In May 2012, ultraconservatives in Jendouba and Sidi Bouzid firebombed bars and stores selling alcohol; the following month, Salafists in a Tunis suburb rioted in protest of an art exhibit they considered insulting to Muslims. The violence soon spread to other areas around the capital. These and other repeated provocations by hard-line Salafist groups, including the assassination in 2013 of two prominent liberal politicians, Mohamed Brahmi and Chokri Belaid, have caused some to fear an Egyptian-style military coup against elected Islamists. Thus far, at least, reason has prevailed and Tunisians have been able to reach consensus. Ennahda, widely recognized as the most moderate of all Arab Islamist parties, has shown a remarkable capacity for compromise. Under the leadership of the liberal-leaning Islamic thinker Rachid al-Ghannouchi, Ennahda has stepped back from its earlier goal of establishing Tunisia as an Islamic state and enforcing Shariah law. Secularists saw this concession not as a sign of weakness (and an opportune moment for attack), but as a token of goodwill; the resulting sense of national unity gave rise to the new Constitution.I have been following the steady stream of good news out of Tunisia with admiration, if not envy. Paradoxically, Turkey\u2019s democracy, which is more than six decades old, and its economy, the world\u2019s 17th largest in 2012, are better-established and stronger than Tunisia\u2019s. But Turkey sorely lacks the consensus-making skills that Tunisians so clearly possess. Turkish politics is poisoned by bitter fighting between leaders who view compromise as cowardice. Quarreling political figures condemn one another for \u201chigh treason,\u201d and often resort to extravagant conspiracy theories to delegitimize opponents. The result is that confrontation is common, and agreement all too rare.This is why Turkey, still governed by a 1982 military Constitution, has not been able to pass a liberal democratic charter like Tunisia\u2019s. Military dominance has gradually eased in the past decade, but elected politicians have proven unable to agree on what a new document would look like. A parliamentary constitution-drafting committee was established in 2011 following general elections that saw the re-election of Mr. Erdogan to a third term. (Indeed, the passage of a new constitution had been one of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s main campaign pledges.) But the initiative was declared dead last December, largely because Mr. Erdogan\u2019s governing Justice and Development Party insisted on a regime that maximized presidential power at the expense of the legislature and judiciary, and incorporated few checks and balances. Turkey\u2019s main opposition party, the Republican People\u2019s Party, proved similarly rigid.In late January, the passage of Tunisia\u2019s Constitution was celebrated in that country\u2019s National Constituent Assembly by deputies from all parties, who hugged one another, sang and chanted \u201cMabrouk alina,\u201d or \u201cCongratulations to us all.\u201dJust days earlier, a markedly different scene played out in the Turkish Parliament, as vicious debates devolved into a full-fledged fist fight that left one member injured. It was the second time punches had been thrown in the Turkish Parliament that month. (In the earlier incident, a deputy had thrown an iPad, too.) Ultimately, the problem is not that one or another opposing faction is too religious, too secular, or too ideological; it is that everyone is too macho and power-hungry. Today, Turkey is a nation of rapid economic growth, declining inequality and heightened political participation. One of the world\u2019s top tourist destinations, it has invested heavily in infrastructure and public transportation. Turks do not need more high rises or shopping malls; we already have plenty of those. What we urgently need to build is a culture of dialogue, empathy and consensus \u2014 and Tunisia might be a good place to look for guidance. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Making College Pay", "Date": "2014-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIt seems logical: College graduates have lower unemployment and earn more than less educated workers, so, the thinking goes, the fix for today\u2019s anemic growth in jobs and wages is to make sure that more people earn college degrees. But that\u2019s a common misperception, deflecting attention from the serious work that has to be done to create jobs and improve incomes. But that doesn\u2019t mean that enough good jobs are, or will be, available for college graduates. Though joblessness for college graduates ages 25 and older looks tame, the jobless rate for those under 25 averaged 8.2 percent in 2013, compared with 8 percent in 2012 and 5.4 in 2007, before the Great Recession hit in full force. Pay, meanwhile, has stagnated for college-educated workers over the past 12 years. That\u2019s better than declining, as has been the case for less-educated workers. But it also shows that a college education, in and of itself, does not create good jobs at good pay. For that, a thriving economy is essential \u2014 including consistent pro-employment policies and investments by business and government. The bureau also ranked the occupations that are expected to grow the fastest from 2012 to 2022. Of the top 20, seven require a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, including jobs as interpreters, information security analysts and health care professionals; median pay for those jobs in 2012 ranged from $45,430 for interpreters to $90,930 for physician assistants. Of the 13 fast-growing jobs that do not require a degree, most are in health care or building trades, with typical annual pay of about $20,000 to $30,000. All of which means that a major challenge for policy makers and business leaders is to confront the obvious: that most new jobs are likely to be lower-wage jobs. That requires plans for creating pathways from low-wage work to better-paying jobs, say from home health aide to vocational nurse, as well as strategies to foster the development of higher-paying industries. The situation also demands support for policies and institutions that lift wages, including a robust minimum wage and unions. On its own, more college won\u2019t change the economy\u2019s low-wage trajectory. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tax Wilderness, Untamed", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Americans of a certain income level sit down to do their taxes this year, they may be in for an unpleasant surprise: The tax code, already byzantine, has grown even more complex \u2014 yet the prospects for a major improvement seem to have retreated into the distance.Major leadership changes to the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, combined with a reluctance in the House Republican leadership to confront the issue and an Obama administration focused only on the corporate tax code, add up to a consensus in Washington: It\u2019s virtually certain that there will be no comprehensive tax code overhaul this year, regardless of the promises that will surely ring out of the Capitol or the money that may keep flowing to Washington lobbyists promising their corporate clients that the time has finally come.For more than three years, Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the Democrat who was chairman of the Finance Committee, and Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, met at least weekly to plot out paths toward a comprehensive rewrite of the tax code. But on Thursday, the Senate confirmed Mr. Baucus as ambassador to China, and he gave up his crucial committee post. While Mr. Camp is determined to press ahead with his version of a simplified tax code, the cause is in limbo at best.\u201cThere isn\u2019t the appetite to do it right now,\u201d said Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee. \u201cWith Baucus leaving, it\u2019s almost impossible to do. That\u2019s where we are.\u201dBut the changes last year were not entirely straightforward \u2014 and certainly weren\u2019t part of a comprehensive overhaul. They did not merely raise taxes for higher-income people; they also made filing more complex. Single people with at least $250,000 in adjusted gross income \u2014 the threshold for married couples is $300,000 \u2014 were hit by new curbs on personal exemptions and on many popular deductions, such as those for state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable contributions.On top of those changes came the tax increases of the Affordable Care Act, billed as a way to pay for President Obama\u2019s health care law by tapping the pockets of the well-to-do. Individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000 saw an additional Medicare contribution tax of 0.9 percent on wages and self-employment income. And an additional tax of 3.8 percent on investment income \u2014 interest, dividends, royalties, annuities, capital gains, rents and income from passive business activities \u2014 will be calculated on whatever is less, net investment income or gross income above the $200,000 or $250,000 threshold.There were other changes, too. A total of 55 tax breaks expired \u2014 at least for now \u2014 including one that allowed teachers to deduct up to $250 in out-of-pocket costs for school supplies. A deduction for tuition and fees vanished, as did credits for installation of some energy-efficient home improvements. Of course, Congress could reinstate some of these tax breaks, especially if interest groups lobby hard for them.As for the changes that have already taken place, many of their effects won\u2019t become evident until taxpayers sit down with their accountants, their tax software or their old-fashioned tax forms. There is widespread agreement in Congress that the tax system needs a major overhaul.\u201cThe fact is, the federal tax code is a dysfunctional, broken mess,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who has replaced Mr. Baucus at the helm of the Finance Committee. \u201cAt a time when we want a tax system that encourages growth and innovation, what we have is this jerry-built creature where there have been thousands and thousands of changes since the last major reform.\u201dIn some circles, Mr. Wyden\u2019s outspoken criticism had led to a degree of optimism for change. For example, Representative Charles Boustany Jr. of Louisiana, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee, said the transition in the Senate shouldn\u2019t slow the cause of simplifying the tax code, which has been embraced broadly by House Republican backbenchers, though not deeply by the House Republican leadership. Mr. Camp still hopes to unveil a broad rewrite of the tax code in the coming weeks, and many House Republicans are eager to embrace the cause as a vision to take to voters \u2014 even if House leaders are reluctant.\u201cWyden\u2019s someone who is immersed in policy,\u201d Mr. Boustany said. \u201cI don\u2019t see the transition hurting us.\u201d But Mr. Wyden is careful not to overpromise. In an interview, he said he would press forward with an annual package of corporate tax breaks that he would like to pare back and streamline. That effort, he said, could be \u201ca bridge to broader tax reform.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t expect that to come soon.The Obama administration has given some lip service to the cause, but the Treasury Department has emphasized only one side of the equation: an overhaul of the corporate tax code that would lower the corporate income tax rate to 28 percent from 35 percent. The proposal wouldn\u2019t touch personal income taxes. \u201cBoth Democrats and Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here, and reward companies that keep profits abroad. Let\u2019s flip that equation. Let\u2019s work together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship jobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home,\u201d he said.But the president\u2019s proposal is anathema to congressional Republicans, who say a corporate-only tax overhaul would leave out too many businesses and expose members of Congress to accusations that they are helping the big fish and leaving out the little guy.Mr. Obama also suggested a tax overhaul to generate extra revenue to fund infrastructure programs. \u201cWe can take the money we save from this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging our commutes \u2014 because in today\u2019s global economy, first-class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure,\u201d the president said.But Republicans have been adamant that a tax overhaul should generate the same amount of revenue that the current tax code produces, and no more. No movement on the issue is evident.There is a long history of failed attempts to transform the tax code, and Mr. Wyden has been part of them in recent years. In 2005, he introduced a radically simplified graduated income tax plan. Called the Fair Flat Tax Act, it would have flattened six personal income tax rates into three \u2014 15 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent \u2014 and repealed special tax rates for dividends and capital gains, treating income from investment the same as income from wages. Rahm Emanuel, then a Democratic representative from Illinois and now the mayor of Chicago, introduced a similar measure the next year in the House. The bills went nowhere, however, gaining no Republican champions, because Republican orthodoxy has long held that investment income should face little to no taxation.The proposal was dropped, however, as wrangling over what became the Affordable Care Act swamped efforts at tax reform \u2014 Congress can do only one big thing at a time. The plan got another look during the deliberations of Mr. Obama\u2019s commission on deficit reduction, led by former Senator Alan K. Simpson and Erskine B. Bowles, a chief of staff in the Clinton White House. Then it faded.Mr. Gregg has since retired, and Senators Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana, and Mark Begich, Democrat of Alaska, have taken up that proposal\u2019s mantle as co-sponsors.Yet it has little support in the Senate Democratic leadership, which controls which bills move forward. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, has centralized power in his leadership suite, greatly diminishing the power of committee chairmen, and he has openly disparaged the cause of tax reform as a task too complicated for a Senate so gridlocked. Comprehensive change now seems far, far away. Mr. Wyden said his most pressing concern at the moment was to resurrect business tax credits for items like energy and research and development that expired at the end of 2013.\u201cWhat happened last November is, when the House leadership said the focus was going to be on Obamacare, the timetable changed,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to make sure renewable energy, research, some of these other priorities for the economy are not sacrificed on the altar of inaction on comprehensive reform.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Half of those teenagers were pregnant before getting married.So it is not sex outside of marriage, but the unmarried teenage pregnancy rate that has changed.The difference was that back then, a young man without a high school education could obtain a job that could support a family.Having run a center for young mothers for 10 years, I can attest to the fact (borne out by research) that a high number of these young women were physically or sexually traumatized as children, and realistically do not see an economic future for which to delay parenthood. They seek to find love in a child, and do.And what causes poverty? An economic structure that does not provide enough jobs with a living wage for all who need them, at the same time systematically shifting the vast majority of resources to the very, very wealthy.

Thank you, Katherine, for your kind words and for your service on our transition committee.Your decades of service to improving public health \u2013 particularly in the realm of women\u2019s reproductive health and combatting the spread of HIV-AIDS \u2013 has been instrumental in helping those in need \u2013 both here in New York and around the world.That advocacy on behalf of everyday people was a hallmark of your grandfather\u2019s tenure as mayor.He understood a bedrock principle of New York greatness, when he said, quote: \u201cOur city does not belong to any individual or set of individuals. It belongs to all the people.\u201dLaGuardia Community College in many ways represents that vision.It is a place where New Yorkers from all walks of life can find a path to a future with a good job and a shot at a better life.Every day, I sit behind the desk of Mayor LaGuardia, reminded of the courage we all must summon in our fight to make New York City work better for everyone.Now, we have some extraordinary New Yorkers in the audience today who also share that vision, including one who has inspired me with her intelligence, her drive, and her compassion for more than twenty years \u2013 a young woman who has recently agreed to share her love for this city by leading the non-profit Mayor\u2019s Fund to Advance New York City.Thank you for being my guiding light, Chirlane \u2013 or, as you\u2019re apparently now sometimes known, #flonyc.Thank you to my fellow elected officials in attendance: Public Advocate Letitia James, City Comptroller Scott Stringer, and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark Viverito.Thank you to the Members of Congress, the City Council, and the State Legislature who have joined us as well. And thank you to Mayor David Dinkins for being here.You are all dedicated and able public servants, true allies in the cause of social and economic justice.And thank you, most of all, to my fellow New Yorkers.We are here to discuss the New York City that we live in today; to lay out our vision for where we will take it in the weeks and months to come; and to discuss something larger \u2013 the core values we share as New Yorkers pursuing progressive change.This has already been quite a year.In one month\u2019s time, our city has weathered three major snowstorms with typical grit and fortitude.In fact, we\u2019ve faced more snow last month than any new administration since January of 1978, when Mayor Ed Koch led this city.Beyond the recent snowstorms, the first few weeks of 2014 have been quite busy.We\u2019ve played regional host to the Super Bowl, giving a strong economic boost to New York City at a critical time \u2013 a tremendous coordination between all city agencies to make sure these events came off without a hitch.Through Vision Zero, we have begun putting into place ambitious new policies to end the tragic and unacceptable rash of pedestrian deaths on our city streets.Of course, none of this would be possible without the bravery and of the people who make up our city work force.I want to particularly single out the men and women of the Sanitation Department, NYPD, FDNY, and EMS \u2013 who did so much to help us during the storms.I know that these speeches have at times been used to attack the motives of our public employees.Today, I want to recognize the hard work and commitment of those men and women \u2013 and to say how proud I am of them. The services you provide every single day in neighborhoods across New York have made us the safest and strongest big city in America, and you deserve our deep gratitude and respect.Our public employees represent a thread that runs through this Administration \u2013 a belief that public service is a noble calling \u2013 that part of what makes New York special is helping our neighbors navigate life\u2019s challenges, big and small.New York\u2019s drive and diversity are unparalleled in this country, and we have appointed a City Administration that proves it \u2013 putting our best women and men in charge of delivering city services with efficiency and integrity.This is a team that knows how to execute its core responsibilities \u2013 while never losing sight of the fact that we\u2019re called to be part of a larger mission as well.Because the truth is, the state of our city, as we find it today, is a Tale of Two Cities \u2013 with an inequality gap that fundamentally threatens our future.It must not, and will not, be ignored by your city government.A little more than five years ago, the Great Recession hit our city economy \u2013 and our neighborhoods \u2013 with a furious blow to New Yorkers rich and poor.But more quickly than most predicted, our financial sector has come back.Wall Street has not only rebounded above its pre-recession levels, but at present hovers near historic highs.And in some of our neighborhoods, the streets are consistently safe and opportunity consistently flows.That is a good thing. We celebrate that success.Yet for millions in this city \u2013 New Yorkers living in all five boroughs \u2013 the economic rebound hasn\u2019t just been slow in coming. It seems a distant fantasy \u2013 with the ladder up to the good life stretching farther and farther out of reach.Good jobs that pay decent wages are all too scarce. Access to the best health care seems, to many, to be a privilege that cannot be earned. To countless New Yorkers, affordable housing is an oxymoron.And a quality education \u2013 the most powerful tool we know for lifting one\u2019s life chances \u2013 has become a promise broken too many times to tally.All the while, 46 percent of our city\u2019s residents live at or near the poverty line.Our middle class isn\u2019t just squeezed; it\u2019s at risk of disappearing altogether.That disparity, that inequality crisis, is the greatest risk to our New York promise.In past decades, working people built our city, and for their hard work they were rewarded \u2013 not always with great wealth, but with a fundamental assurance\u2026the knowledge that hard work could pull them from modest means into a growing middle class.Today, that assurance is missing\u2026that sense of economic justice is gone. And that is what we aim to address.There are some who have taken issue with our commitment to this cause \u2013 who say that income inequality is just a fact of life, and that attempts to remedy it are simply sowing the seeds of class warfare.But we know better. We understand that allowing the income gap to stretch further isn\u2019t simply a threat to those at the bottom \u2013 but to every New Yorker.And we also know this: New Yorkers\u2019 personal commitment to tackling inequality knows no boundaries of geography or income.Many wealthy New Yorkers are committed to healing those divisions \u2013 not out of mere altruism not due to feelings of guilt, or pity. They know that a Gilded City isn\u2019t the New York they signed up for \u2013 even if they currently find themselves doing quite well.They want all New Yorkers to succeed because it enriches all of our lives, including their own \u2013 with vibrant neighborhoods and quality schools and fairly-treated workers building a better and stronger city.And make no mistake about the motives of those in our most hard-pressed communities.They don\u2019t typically look to the rich with anger, they aren\u2019t consumed with jealousy or spite. They are simply in search of the city that they signed up for \u2013 one that rewards not just wealth, but work.A city that honors the notion that a single mom taking the subway to her job as a housekeeper deserves to see her efforts rewarded, just as readily as the family who owns the home she cleans.That the young man who stocks the shelves deserves the same respect and chance at a decent life as the executive who owns the store.New York will only work when it works as one city. And here\u2019s why:Despair does not dissipate. Those who are discouraged \u2013 even hopeless \u2013 about their future\u2026cannot contribute their labor or energy or values to their neighborhoods, or to the neighborhoods that sit just a short subway ride away.It\u2019s as simple as this: the American dream does not work without hope. The dream that New York has always been\u2026does not function if people believe their chance at a better future is out of reach.Mayor LaGuardia said, quote: \u201cA mayor who cannot look fifty or seventy-five years ahead is not worthy of being in City Hall.\u201dWe must lay the foundation now for the strength and stability of New York\u2019s future\u2026a future of greater equality and opportunity.We demand a city that lifts the floor for those struggling day to day\u2026that offers every New Yorker a fair shot\u2026because that is the city that we all signed up for.Mayor LaGuardia called for \u201cgovernment with a soul.\u201d He saw beyond the numbers in a budget\u2026understood that those numbers represented real people who were just trying to live their lives, and asked only for a little help.And that is what we resolve to do.But before we talk about the measures we will take to reach this goal, it is important that we are honest with New Yorkers about our current fiscal situation.We are in the midst of a budgetary challenge that is unprecedented. We are faced with a federal government in gridlock that\u2019s never been more severe. The state budget contains many unanswered questions. And we have over 150 municipal labor contracts that are unsettled.When you take all of these factors into account, we are facing an uncharted path.In the face of this situation, we will be honest with New Yorkers about their government.We will navigate towards a future that is progressive and fiscally responsible.It will not be easy.But we will not turn away from the challenge.Even with these impediments before us, we\u2019ve begun the fight to lift the floor for all New Yorkers\u2026to improve the life conditions of those who struggle with great determination -- not to get ahead -- but merely to keep their heads above water.And we\u2019re fighting to give everyone a fair shot, so that city government doesn\u2019t set its priorities by the needs of those at the very top\u2026while ignoring the struggle of those born under a less lucky star.In the first month of this Administration, we have forged an agreement with this City Council that will provide a right to Paid Sick Leave to 500,000 additional New Yorkers.New Yorkers like the woman I heard from right here in Queens. Kathy Delahoz made a good living, earning $50,000 a year at her job as a computer technician for a company with 11 employees.After suffering a car accident, she refused medical treatment and instead went back to work the next day because she was afraid of losing a day\u2019s pay - or even losing her job.After her doctor urged her to take a day off to recuperate, she agreed \u2013 explaining the situation to her supervisors. A short time later, she was forwarded a text that read simply: \u201cJust tell her the job is not for her.\u201dUnder the expanded Paid Sick Leave legislation, New Yorkers like Kathy won\u2019t lose pay just because they put their health, or the health of their kids, first.Esmeralda Valencia, a restaurant owner from Brooklyn knows why that\u2019s important.That\u2019s why even before the new law passed, she offered paid sick leave to her employees \u2013 because she knows that a healthy workforce is a more productive workforce.But expanding Paid Sick Leave is just one part of our effort to lift the floor for our city\u2019s middle class and working poor.This month, we will extend the reach of living wage standards \u2013 ending a City lawsuit that stood in the way of expanding that important legislation\u2026and issuing an executive order to set the expansion in motion.And we will work with the City Council to increase the number of living wage jobs offered by employers that the City subsidizes \u2013 reaching tens of thousands of additional New Yorkers.We want to ensure that New Yorkers aren\u2019t relegated to the ranks of the poor when putting in a full week\u2019s work.Next week, we will ask Albany to give New York City the power to raise the minimum wage in all five boroughs. In the process, we will send a powerful signal to the people of New York \u2013 that we honor work\u2026and that we are committed to making work pay.We will lift the floor for New Yorkers crushed by skyrocketing rents\u2026by requiring developers to build affordable homes for everyday people rather than simply multi-million dollar condos for the most fortunate among us.Let me be clear. We want to work with the real estate industry to build. We MUST build more to achieve our vision. But the people\u2019s interests will be accounted for in every real estate deal made with the City.In total, we pledge to preserve or construct nearly 200,000 units of affordable housing \u2013 enough to house between 400,000 and 500,000 New Yorkers -- to help working people by literally putting a roof over their heads.On Friday and Saturday, we announced a top-flight team of housing and planning experts, and their first charge is to create and implement a plan to reach this goal \u2013 which will be released by May 1st.And while we lift the floor, we will also offer New Yorkers a fair shot.We have already taken bold new steps to reform the overuse of stop-and-frisk.We announced a settlement in the case of Floyd vs. the City of New York \u2013 an acknowledgment of the wrongs spurred by a broken policing policy and a message to New Yorkers of every background that we will respect equal protection under the law.We continue working to build a bond of trust between law enforcement and the neighborhoods they serve\u2026to ensure that New Yorkers see their safety and their rights protected. And to protect our police officers, who want and need community partners as they work so hard to root out crime.And it because of the hard work of our police officers \u2013 working with community partners \u2013 that shootings are down 17 percent from where they were at this point in 2013.Protecting the safety of all New Yorkers includes protecting the health of all New Yorkers.For months, I joined with deeply concerned neighborhood residents to stop the closures of our community hospitals in Brooklyn. Many days, it seemed like we might not prevail. But we did.We made it clear that we will no longer accept a reckless pattern of closing hospitals without regard to the people who need the medical services they provide.Instead of watching hospitals shuttered and simply sold off to the highest bidder, we will continue the battles we\u2019ve won over the last several months \u2013 requiring alternatives that put the health of our people ahead of profits.And on that, we will not retreat.We will protect the almost half-million undocumented New Yorkers, whose voices too often go unheard. We will reach out to all New Yorkers, regardless of immigration status -- issuing municipal ID cards available to all New Yorkers this year -- so that no daughter or son of our city goes without bank accounts, leases, library cards\u2026simply because they lack identification.To all of my fellow New Yorkers who are undocumented, I say: New York City is your home too, and we will not force ANY of our residents to live their lives in the shadows.La ciudad de Nueva York es el hogar de todos los que vivimos aqui. No dejaremos que ninguno de nuestros residentes viva en las sombras.We\u2019ll offer a fair shot to the workforce of tomorrow\u2026changing a mindset that focuses on tax breaks for big corporations rather than making it easier for our people to earn the skills they need to land jobs at those companies.We know the soaring cost of CUNY makes higher education harder and harder for everyday New Yorkers to afford.And we understand that higher education is the path to a better life\u2026the great equalizer\u2026the key to lifting oneself into the middle class.To that end, we will focus on the training and skills that individuals need to meet the demands generated by large and small employers of our city.And we\u2019ll not only fight to shift resources from corporate subsidies to tuition assistance, we\u2019ll work to connect higher education to the jobs that the 21st Century workforce requires.CUNY has always been the engine that drove New York\u2019s economy, making sure that our great industries had the workforce they needed to thrive.Today, new industries are driving an economic future with jobs we could not have envisioned just a few years ago.And CUNY is going to help us fill those jobs with New Yorkers who are educated and ready to work.We will forgo big giveaways to a select few companies and instead pursue a city economic strategy that grows whole sectors of small businesses in emerging industries \u2013 from technology, to green jobs, to food exports, to advanced manufacturing \u2013 companies that can generate good jobs at decent wages in all five boroughs.We will create an Entrepreneurship Fund for low-income New Yorkers and a Fashion Manufacturing Fund -- which will leverage private capital to ensure small business growth and fashion manufacturing across all five boroughs.As we celebrate Fashion Week, we plan to grow this industry to the benefit of New Yorkers from all walks of life.And we\u2019ll create jobs for young people who are growing up in this city\u2026 who have always called this home.Here\u2019s how:First, we will advance a dedicated Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math program at CUNY\u2026to start preparing more graduates of our public high schools for jobs in the city\u2019s tech industry.To that end, our aim is that within eight years, the majority of skilled technology-related jobs in New York City are being filled by those educated in New York City schools. We will look to the innovation economy not just to grow companies, but also to put New Yorkers to work.Second, as our health sector continues to rapidly grow, we will prepare more of our unemployed, and our young people, for middle-skill, middle-class jobs: by scaling-up innovative programs like the Bronx\u2019s Health Education and Research Occupations High School that connects New Yorkers to CUNY and to relevant work experience at Montefiore Hospital.Third, for people without a college degree, we will reinvent our maze of overlapping and often-ineffective job training programs -- and invest in industry-linked apprenticeship programs that directly connect New Yorkers to jobs in emerging industries such as green building innovation, information technology, and telecommunications.Fourth, we will connect city high schools to colleges, apprenticeship programs, or industries that correspond to the skills our students must learn. We will reverse the trend of importing engineers, nurses, and other skilled workers to fill New York City jobs -- and start in-sourcing good jobs for those who live here now, and are desperate for work.While we continue to invest in and expand our new businesses, we won\u2019t lose sight of the industries that have made us the center of commerce and culture. We will pursue a five-borough economic agenda that integrates new industries with the traditional drivers of job growth in our city.Finally, we will not forget our obligations to the people of this city still recovering from the aftereffects of super-storm Sandy.We are resolved to make the efforts underway function more effectively and efficiently.In the aftermath of the storm, I personally made it my mission to see the devastation in those neighborhoods myself. The people I met in Staten Island, and the Rockaways, and Coney Island, and Lower Manhattan suffered unimaginable dislocation of their lives.I made a promise that if elected Mayor, I would make this recovery a focus of my administration.In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll make good on the pledge with a comprehensive review and updated plan to help those for whom the effects of Sandy are still an everyday reality.And above all, we will give a fair shot to those who deserve it most \u2013 our children \u2013 all of them.We will offer every child, from every borough of this city, truly universal, full-day Pre-K.We will provide quality extended learning programs for every middle-schooler.And for this, we won\u2019t wait. We have a detailed plan to put this program into effect this September.And we will do this by asking those who make more than a half-million dollars a year to pay a little more in taxes.For those making between $500,000 and a million dollars a year, that means an average of about 970 bucks. But to the young minds that we help shape, the pre-teen lives that we keep safe, the generation of working New Yorkers that we put on a path to success; it will be priceless. Now, I know this last part has been the subject of some debate in recent weeks. And I know that people of good conscience can have different plans for how to achieve better outcomes for our kids.So let me take just a moment to make MY case for why our plan is the way to make that promise to our young people a reality.There are some who say that Albany shouldn\u2019t approve our plan because the state government simply cannot raise any taxes right now.But that is not the debate. We\u2019re not asking Albany to raise the state income tax by a penny to pay for universal Pre-K and after-school programs here in New York City.We\u2019re simply asking Albany to allow New York City to tax itself \u2013 its wealthiest residents\u2026those making a half-million or more a year.Raising taxes on the rich makes our commitment to our kids more than just words. It makes that commitment REAL. It makes that commitment fair. And it offers a promise to our kids that they can count on.If there are extra resources in the state budget, we must remember that the State Court of Appeals ruled \u2013 in the landmark Campaign for Fiscal Equity decision several years ago -- that the children of this city deserve billions more in educational resources, and now is the time to provide it.When it comes to Pre-K and after-school, we have a detailed plan, and it\u2019s on the table \u2013 one that\u2019s real; that\u2019s fair; that\u2019s reasonable.So let\u2019s dedicate the funding we need to do what New York City must \u2013 and let\u2019s tap the wealthiest New Yorkers to do so.This is about the children of New York, and just how strong of a commitment we are willing to make to their futures and our own.And that is a commitment I hear every day -- not just from middle class, working class, and low-income New Yorkers \u2013 but from good people from every income bracket \u2013 people who know that for New York to move forward, we must ask those who have achieved great success to give a little back to ensure that stories like theirs are possible for the next generation.As I said in my inaugural address, we do not do this to punish success. We do it to create more success stories.Study after study shows that children who access Pre-K programs are more likely to stay on a path to a productive life.Middle-schoolers who access after-school programs are less likely to fall victim to gangs and street violence\u2026more likely to graduate and go on to college or the world of work\u2026to have hope for lifting themselves out of a cycle of poverty and into a world of possibility.Consider the story of Rocio Espada, a single mother of four \u2013 two teenagers, and two little ones \u2013 from Bushwick, Brooklyn.Instead of taking her four-year-old to full-day Pre-K \u2013 a program that she says would give her child a better start on life \u2013 she\u2019s forced to rely on her mother and her friend to watch after her child while she goes to work.Her teenagers leave school at the end of day with keys to their apartment in their hands \u2013 headed home, Rocio hopes, and not falling victim to the negativity of the streets. Pre-K and after-school programs give mothers like Rocio more than just peace of mind that her kids are safe. They give her the promise that her kids are on the right path \u2013 and staying there.Mayor LaGuardia was nicknamed the \u201cLittle Flower.\u201d And he spoke for, and fought for, families all across New York City who would have otherwise gone without a voice.What we wish for New York City is to nurture our own Little Flowers \u2013 children from every borough and background \u2013 to let them grow to their fullest potential.That is what we want for New York City.To lift the floor.To offer every New Yorker a fair shot.Fighting to end the Tale of Two Cities \u2013 not just because it\u2019s moral and just but because it makes all of our lives richer.We cannot wait for Washington to act. We will not let the gridlock there \u2013 or the limits of Albany \u2013 to serve as an excuse for New York City to roll over and ignore our mission.New Yorkers don\u2019t look at government as federal and state and local. They look at it \u2013 at all of us \u2013 as their elected representatives; the people they are counting on to make a difference in their lives.And we here in New York City government have many tools at our disposal to make good on that promise, on that responsibility, and we will use them.We find ourselves at a fork in the road. We can look down the path that we\u2019ve been on for far too long. We can see it as the easier trail to traverse, and fool ourselves into thinking it\u2019s our only option.Or we can take the other road, the path to closing the inequality gap, that very New York option of taking on big challenges and getting results.That\u2019s what Mayor LaGuardia did \u2013 making the New Deal come alive in New York City and ensuring that New York responded to the urgent challenge of his time.That\u2019s what so many women and men of great vision and compassion, of strong values and quiet struggle, of fierce determination and relentless action have done throughout New York\u2019s history.That\u2019s the path I choose today. I ask my fellow citywide elected officials, members of this City Council and the State Legislature \u2013 and all New Yorkers \u2013 to join me.We\u2019ve one got one chance to get this right. Let\u2019s seize it.Thank you, and God bless the people of New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Trade Growth Beats Forecasts", "Date": "2014-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s trade performance zoomed past forecasts in January, as import growth hit a six-month high, data showed Wednesday, confounding earlier analysis suggesting that the economy was mired in a deepening slowdown.The value of China\u2019s total exports climbed 10.6 percent in January from a year earlier, the Customs Administration said, more than five times market forecasts of a 2 percent rise.Analysts who had expected the Lunar New Year holiday to hurt trade flows cautioned, however, that the data might have been inflated by fake transactions, in which traders forge deals to sneak cash into the country past capital controls.The value of imports jumped 10 percent from a year ago, a pace not seen since July, handily beating market predictions of a 3 percent gain. Imports of crude oil, iron ore and copper all hit record highs, according to customs data.The country\u2019s trade surplus rose to $31.9 billion, well above forecasts of $23.7 billion and the $25.6 billion surplus in December.\u201cThis should allay some fears about a slowdown, but I\u2019m also not sure how much comfort we can take from these numbers,\u201d said Louis Kujis, an RBS economist in Hong Kong. \u201cWe know that a year ago there was some massive invoicing taking place. If you think about the incentives for over-invoicing, they are again very strong because of the interest rate differentials.\u201dA run of underwhelming economic data from China in recent weeks had led investors to prepare for another disappointment on Wednesday.Fears of a sharper-than-expected loss of momentum in China were believed to be one contributing factor in a fierce global financial market sell-off in January, with emerging markets hit particularly hard.Four purchasing managers\u2019 indexes had shown China\u2019s factory and services sectors sliding to multimonth or multiyear lows in January, as celebrations for the Lunar New Year, China\u2019s biggest annual holiday, reduced the number of work hours. Many factories and offices close during the festivities.A resilient Chinese economy is good news for the world, particularly for major commodity exporters like Australia.Already the world\u2019s biggest exporter, China may overtake the United States to be the world\u2019s largest importer this year, HSBC Bank has predicted.Economists expect China\u2019s economy to grow at its slackest pace in 14 years this year at 7.4 percent. But even at that rate it is expected to add twice as much demand to the world economy as the United States, HSBC said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Solid Jobs Data Is Tempered by Report on Weak Exports", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, bolstering the labor market outlook and the broader economy.The upbeat news, however, was undermined somewhat by data on Thursday showing a slump in American exports in December. Economists said trade probably contributed a bit less to fourth-quarter economic growth than previously thought. Even so, the labor market recovery appeared to remain on track after some recent data raised concerns about the economy\u2019s health. Economists said the government\u2019s January employment report, scheduled for release on Friday, should send a similar signal.\u201cThe underlying momentum in the labor market remains positive, and it is very likely that this is the narrative that we get from tomorrow\u2019s employment report,\u201d said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 20,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 331,000, the Labor Department said. While the data has no direct bearing on January\u2019s employment report, as it falls outside the survey period, it bodes well for the jobs market.Hiring is expected to have accelerated in January after being held down by unusually cold weather the previous month. That would offer confirmation that the economy continued to expand after robust growth in the second half of 2013 that was driven by consumer spending, inventory accumulation and trade.Also on Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit widened by 12 percent in December to $38.7 billion, in part because of the largest decline in exports since October 2012. When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit rose to $49.5 billion.Last week, in its first estimate of the nation\u2019s fourth-quarter gross domestic product, the government said trade accounted for 1.33 percentage points of the economy\u2019s 3.2 percent annual growth pace during the period. But the trade deficit in December was bigger than the government had assumed, and economists said fourth-quarter G.D.P. growth would probably be lower when a revision is published this month.\u201cThe net contribution from trade will be much smaller than the first estimate and could dial back the pace of fourth-quarter growth by as much as half a percentage point,\u201d said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo. The trade deficit last year was the smallest since 2009, helped by record exports and the first drop in imported goods in four years.A separate report showed that the nation\u2019s productivity rose 3.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter after an even brisker 3.6 percent in the third quarter as businesses stepped up output sharply while keeping a lid on hiring and hours worked.Still, the underlying trend remained soft. For all of 2013, productivity rose just 0.6 percent, the smallest gain since 2011.The rise in fourth-quarter productivity helped keep down unit labor costs \u2014 a gauge of the labor-related cost for any given unit of output. They fell 1.6 percent rate, showing no wage inflation pressures in the economy.\u201cDeclining labor costs combined with faster growth in worker productivity suggests little pressure to add workers,\u201d said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial.

{"Headline": "Spying by N.S.A. Ally Entangled U.S. Law Firm", "Date": "2014-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe list of those caught up in the global surveillance net cast by the National Security Agency and its overseas partners, from social media users to foreign heads of state, now includes another entry: American lawyers. A top-secret document, obtained by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden, shows that an American law firm was monitored while representing a foreign government in trade disputes with the United States. The disclosure offers a rare glimpse of a specific instance in which Americans were ensnared by the eavesdroppers, and is of particular interest because lawyers in the United States with clients overseas have expressed growing concern that their confidential communications could be compromised by such surveillance. The Australians told officials at an N.S.A. liaison office in Canberra, Australia, that \u201cinformation covered by attorney-client privilege may be included\u201d in the intelligence gathering, according to the document, a monthly bulletin from the Canberra office. The law firm was not identified, but Mayer Brown, a Chicago-based firm with a global practice, was then advising the Indonesian government on trade issues. On behalf of the Australians, the liaison officials asked the N.S.A. general counsel\u2019s office for guidance about the spying. The bulletin notes only that the counsel\u2019s office \u201cprovided clear guidance\u201d and that the Australian agency \u201chas been able to continue to cover the talks, providing highly useful intelligence for interested US customers.\u201d The N.S.A. declined to answer questions about the reported surveillance, including whether information involving the American law firm was shared with United States trade officials or negotiators. Duane Layton, a Mayer Brown lawyer involved in the trade talks, said he did not have any evidence that he or his firm had been under scrutiny by Australian or American intelligence agencies. \u201cI always wonder if someone is listening, because you would have to be an idiot not to wonder in this day and age,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never really thought I was being spied on.\u201dA Rising Concern for LawyersThe N.S.A. is prohibited from targeting Americans, including businesses, law firms and other organizations based in the United States, for surveillance without warrants, and intelligence officials have repeatedly said the N.S.A. does not use the spy services of its partners in the so-called Five Eyes alliance \u2014 Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand \u2014 to skirt the law. An N.S.A. spokeswoman said the agency\u2019s Office of the General Counsel was consulted when issues of potential attorney-client privilege arose and could recommend steps to protect such information. \u201cSuch steps could include requesting that collection or reporting by a foreign partner be limited, that intelligence reports be written so as to limit the inclusion of privileged material and to exclude U.S. identities, and that dissemination of such reports be limited and subject to appropriate warnings or restrictions on their use,\u201d said Vanee M. Vines, the spokeswoman. Another dispute involved Indonesia\u2019s exports of shrimp, which the United States claimed were being sold at below-market prices.The Indonesian government retained Mayer Brown to help in the cases concerning cigarettes and shrimp, said Ni Made Ayu Marthini, attach\u00e9 for trade and industry at the Indonesian Embassy in Washington. She said no American law firm had been formally retained yet to help in a third case, involving horticultural and animal products. Mr. Layton, a lawyer in the Washington office of Mayer Brown, said that since 2010 he had led a team from the firm in the clove cigarette dispute. He said Matthew McConkey, another lawyer in the firm\u2019s Washington office, had taken the lead on the shrimp issue until the United States dropped its claims in August. Both cases were underway a year ago when the Australians reported that their surveillance included an American law firm. Mr. Layton said that if his emails and calls with Indonesian officials had been monitored, the spies would have been bored. \u201cNone of this stuff is very sexy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just run of the mill.\u201dHe and the other Mayer Brown lawyers do most of their work on the trade issues from Washington, he said. They also make occasional trips to Jakarta, Indonesia\u2019s capital, and Geneva, where the World Trade Organization is based. Mr. Layton said most of his communications with officials in Jakarta had been done through email, while he also talked by phone with officials at the Indonesian Embassy in Washington. The N.S.A.\u2019s protections for attorney-client conversations are narrowly crafted, said Stephen Gillers, an expert on legal ethics at New York University\u2019s School of Law. The agency is barred from sharing with prosecutors intercepted attorney-client communications involving someone under indictment in the United States, according to previously disclosed N.S.A. rules. But the agency may still use or share the information for intelligence purposes. Andrew M. Perlman, a Suffolk University law professor who specializes in legal ethics and technology issues, said the growth of surveillance was troubling for lawyers. He helped create the bar association\u2019s ethics code revisions that require lawyers to try to avoid being overheard by eavesdroppers. \u201cYou run out of options very quickly to communicate with someone overseas,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the difficulty of finding anything that is 100 percent secure, lawyers are in a difficult spot to ensure that all of the information remains in confidence.\u201d\u00a0In addition to its work on trade issues with the United States, Mr. Layton said, Mayer Brown was representing Indonesia in a dispute with Australia. He said Indonesia had been arguing that Australia\u2019s requirements for plain packaging for tobacco products under its antismoking rules were excessive. Economic EspionageEven though the Indonesian issues were relatively modest for the United States \u2014 about $40 million in annual trade is related to the clove cigarette dispute and $1 billion annually to shrimp \u2014 the Australian surveillance of talks underscores the extent to which the N.S.A. and its close partners engage in economic espionage. American intelligence officials do not deny that they collect economic information from overseas, but argue that they do not engage in industrial espionage by sharing that information with American businesses. China, for example, is often accused of stealing business secrets from Western corporations and passing them to Chinese corporations. The N.S.A. trade document \u2014 headlined \u201cSUSLOC (Special US Liaison Office Canberra) Facilitates Sensitive DSD Reporting on Trade Talks\u201d\u2014 does not say which \u201cinterested US customers\u201d besides the N.S.A. might have received intelligence on the trade dispute. Other documents obtained from Mr. Snowden reveal that the N.S.A. shares reports from its surveillance widely among civilian agencies.

{"Headline": "With Market Gyrations, Japanese Stocks Lose Darling Status", "Date": "2014-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 For all the headline-grabbing news about emerging market troubles over the past few weeks \u2014 a dramatic currency slump in Argentina and a huge interest rate increase in Turkey \u2014 one of the world\u2019s most volatile stock markets is that of one of the world\u2019s largest economies: Japan.The Japanese market had been a darling among investors for over a year as the government took bold action to stimulate the economy, but investors have grown more wary over fears that the plan will not produce the desired effects. The worries have created fluctuations in the market.The Nikkei 225-share index has plunged 8.9 percent since the start of the year \u2014 far more than Wall Street, or even the key market gauges in Turkey or Ukraine, where political unrest has tested investors\u2019 nerves in recent weeks. But on news from the Japanese central bank on Tuesday, stocks rose 3.1 percent.While the Nikkei has fallen over all this year, India and Indonesia, both under big pressure last year, and the rest of Asia have held up relatively well. Stocks in India were down just 2.5 percent this year, and the Jakarta stock market has risen about 6.6 percent so far in the same period. Both countries\u2019 currencies have remained fairly steady despite the turmoil that has roiled emerging markets elsewhere.On Tuesday, the Japanese central bank said it would increase funds available to banks for lending to businesses. The bank also maintained its crucial economy-bolstering tool of increasing the country\u2019s monetary base through an unprecedented asset purchase program. The move on the loan facilities underlined the view that the bank is determined to support the economy, though it remains unclear whether the bank will act more aggressively later in the year if growth does not pick up speed.\u201cIf risks materialize, we will not hesitate adjusting policy,\u201d Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor of the Bank of Japan, said after the bank\u2019s regular policy meeting, according to Reuters. \u201cBut for now Japan\u2019s economy is on track and moving in line with our forecasts.\u201dThe Bank of Japan\u2019s stance of expanding stimulus contrasts with the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s tapering, underscoring the weakness of the world\u2019s third-largest economy after the United States and China. On Tuesday, the Chinese central bank also drained funds from money markets for the first time since June in an effort to keep rates from going too low.In late 2012, investors began to pile into Japanese stocks in the hope that the incoming government of Shinzo Abe would succeed in shaking the country\u2019s economy out of its decades-long torpor. Over the last six weeks, though, the Nikkei has struggled.Some investors remain hopeful that the market will recover this year, and many say that to some extent the recent drop in Japan was merely an inevitable correction after the previous rally. Between mid-November 2012 and its peak at the end of 2013, the Nikkei soared 88 percent as investors cheered the new government\u2019s spending plans and efforts by the central bank to prime the economy by flooding it with low-interest money.\u201cEveryone but everyone was overweight Japan,\u201d said Garry Evans, global head of equity strategy at HSBC. \u201cYou had a lot of funds out there that were \u2018maximum bullish.\u2019 \u201dHigh stock market valuations and a slightly firmer currency also contributed to the market\u2019s recent fall. A strong yen can sap the competitiveness of Japanese exporters by making their goods more expensive for buyers abroad. The currency\u2019s strength in 2011 and 2012 was a source of pain for many of the country\u2019s exporting behemoths.Starting in late 2012, as markets factored in hopes for stimulus under Mr. Abe, the currency weakened to 105 per United States dollar at the end of 2013 from about 79 yen per dollar. This provided just the relief that the government had hoped for \u2014 and it has manifested in corporate earnings. Toyota, Sony and many others cited the weaker yen as a big reason for the improved earnings they reported for the past quarter.Since the start of this year, however, the yen has firmed again, to about 102.5 per dollar, as investors have sought refuge in the relative safety it offers during uncertain times. Although small, the move was enough to help set off the recent stock market drop. Data released Monday showed that the economy grew less vigorously than expected during the final three months of 2013 and served as a stark reminder of the challenges ahead.On the upside, any drop in the yen could help lift sentiment again. Vivek Misra, a strategist with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said he expected the Japanese currency to weaken again in the coming months, in part because the central bank in Tokyo is likely to step up its monetary support of the economy.The prospect that the Bank of Japan will further ease its monetary policy will give the Japanese stock market a \u201cleg up\u201d in the first half of this year, Mr. Misra said. His team sees the Nikkei at 17,750 points by the end of June \u2014 from 14,843 on Tuesday \u2014 and at 18,000 by the end of the year.The big question now is how forcefully and rapidly Mr. Abe will be able to deliver the remaining ingredients in his growth program: overhauls to the country\u2019s rigid labor rules, for example, steps to improve productivity and measures to get more women to join the work force.Many analysts worry that without speedy progress on such overhauls, Japan\u2019s recent economic acceleration could dissipate, leaving it vulnerable to the tremendous demographic challenges that are building up as its already old population grays further.\u201cThe market has very high expectations of Mr. Abe, but the fact is that he has an uphill task to get growth going again,\u201d said Peter Elston, head of Asia-Pacific strategy at Aberdeen Asset Management in Singapore. \u201cYou have a population that is declining and you have, as in every other developed economy, low productivity growth. Those headwinds are very hard to counteract.\u201dThe most immediate challenge will come in April, when the national sales tax will rise to 8 percent from 5 percent. The increase is seen as crucial to reining in the country\u2019s huge debt burden and combating the deflation that has plagued Japan for years. But it could also set back growth by denting household consumption.\u201cIt\u2019s lead in the saddlebag \u2014 it will weigh down spending,\u201d said Matthew Sherwood, a senior analyst at Perpetual, a fund management company in Sydney, Australia. \u201cEvery economy in the world has suffered a slowdown when it has raised consumption taxes. I don\u2019t think Japan will be an exception.\u201dAt the same time, wage growth \u2014 which could help offset the pain of higher prices \u2014 has been stagnant so far. In fact, because inflation has crept up, real wages are falling and are \u201cunlikely to turn to positive territory in the near future, especially after the consumption tax rate hike,\u201d said Masamichi Adachi, an economist at JPMorgan Chase in Tokyo.On the upside, some analysts believe that a poor performance in the Japanese markets could have a positive effect, in that it could strengthen the argument for more determined action on the much-needed structural overhauls.The stock market also could get a big lift if Japanese investors themselves start to buy into the Japan story.\u201cThe rally so far has been foreign investor driven,\u201d Kathy Matsui, chief Japan strategist at Goldman Sachs, said during a media briefing in Hong Kong last week. Japanese institutional investors, she said, have been slow to raise their exposure to stocks. Retail investors, by contrast, have started to see the attraction of investing in stocks, rather than leaving their savings parked in low-yielding government bonds or bank accounts \u2014 a sign, perhaps, of more inflows to come.This leaves many investors and analysts positive on Japan, despite the headwinds.\u201cWe\u2019re very confident on Japan,\u201d said Gemma Godfrey, head of investment strategy at Brooks Macdonald Asset Management in London. The recent sell-off \u201cis a healthy correction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt had been a very crowded trade \u2014 this now provides a more attractive entry point.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Argentine Peso Falters, President Keeps a Low Profile", "Date": "2014-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 As Argentines stew over a currency crisis that has shaken markets around the world, many residents here are asking the same question: Where is the president?Then, after the steepest drop in the Argentine peso since the country\u2019s economy collapsed over a decade ago, Mrs. Kirchner steered clear of the turmoil yet again, flying to Cuba for a summit meeting. Once there, she avoided mentioning the simmering crisis almost entirely, opting to send Twitter messages about meeting Fidel Castro\u2019s grandchildren. Only later did she post a few Twitter messages attributing Argentina\u2019s market upheaval to \u201cspeculative pressures\u201d by unnamed economic groups and banks.\u201cThe president does not feel she owes any explanation to the citizenry as a whole,\u201d said Federico Finchelstein, an Argentine historian at the New School for Social Research in New York.The problems in Argentina have quickly turned it into a symbol of the economic pressures building on developing countries, stirring fears that the trouble could spread if global demand for commodities wanes and investors look for better bets in the United States.The peso plunged 15 percent on Jan. 22 and 23, from around 6.9 pesos to the dollar to 8 pesos, according to Bloomberg News, and has since stablized. It closed on Friday at 8 pesos to the dollar. It weakened by a total of 19 percent in January.Many economists say that the trouble here stems from the decisions Mrs. Kirchner and her government have championed for years. She describes her politics as \u201cnational and popular,\u201d referring to efforts to promote national interests and industry, and to put in place policies that reach out to the masses.Generous social spending after the economic collapse, like freezing household electricity rates, has widened Argentina\u2019s budget deficit, encouraged energy consumption and increased the country\u2019s dependence on energy imports, eroding the central bank\u2019s hard currency reserves. Inflation is so high that it has become a heated political issue, with economists saying it exceeded 28 percent in 2013 and officials insisting it was 10.9 percent.Now Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s recent absences from Argentina\u2019s political scene have left her without much of a public defense and fueled a debate over whether a power vacuum is emerging \u2014 a striking contrast to her strong presence during the rest of her presidency. Until recently, Argentines have grown accustomed to her appearing extensively around the country, speaking regularly on television and expressing herself prolifically on Twitter about everything from the quality of Argentine beef to the importance of asserting influence in Antarctica.\u201cIt\u2019s at this time when a strong presence is needed, but presidential communication is in a stage of strategic retreat,\u201d said Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, a political communications researcher at the Society for International Development here, which studies global development.In a barrage of more than 20 Twitter messages early on Friday morning, Mrs. Kirchner again stayed away from the turmoil in Argentina\u2019s currency markets, striking out instead at influential news organizations that have criticized the infrequency of her public appearances in recent weeks. Then on Friday night, she appeared in televised images greeting Prince Akishino of Japan in the presidential palace here.With Mrs. Kirchner largely avoiding the public eye and leaving explanations of the abrupt economic policy shifts to her aides, many Argentines are fuming.\u201cShe puts the blame on everybody else, but she\u2019s the one running the country,\u201d said Iv\u00e1n Orozco, 53, a travel agent. \u201cShe sees a reality that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dEven before the currency tumult, polls showed support for Mrs. Kirchner falling sharply. Her approval rating plunged to 27 percent in January, from 42 percent in November, according to a nationwide survey by Management and Fit, a polling company that interviewed 1,600 people across Argentina shortly before the peso tumbled against the dollar.\u201cThis is this government\u2019s most important crisis,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Casullo, an expert on populist politics at the University of Buenos Aires.Mrs. Kirchner took office in 2007 and still draws support from her base, including many poor voters who have benefited from social welfare programs that she and her husband, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, who preceded her in the presidency and died in 2010, put into effect after the financial collapse of 2001 and 2002. Her supporters, who point out that Argentina\u2019s economy is still expected to grow modestly this year, have also assembled an array of pro-government news organizations in an attempt improve perceptions of her in a highly critical media landscape.Cynthia Garc\u00eda, a panelist on 678, a pro-government news debate program, rejected the notion that Mrs. Kirchner was avoiding discussing the currency crisis.\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t use the words that represent neoliberal interests, they say she\u2019s silent,\u201d Ms. Garc\u00eda said, referring to the market-oriented economic policies that prevailed here in the 1990s. \u201cBut she is by no means a coward.\u201dThe decline in economic growth from the boom years until 2011 is also exposing Mrs. Kirchner to greater criticism about her own wealth, which has skyrocketed since 2003, the year her husband came to power, according to sworn declarations presented to the federal anticorruption office.The Kirchners were worth about $2.3 million a decade ago, largely the result of property dealings in Patagonia, their political bastion. In 2010, their fortune had grown to approximately $18 million, including debt, according to Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s sworn declaration, during a period in which she was a senator before her election as president.It is thought that Mrs. Kirchner inherited half of Mr. Kirchner\u2019s estate, with the other half going to their two children. Subsequently, in 2011, her declared wealth dropped to about $9.4 million before growing again to about $10.5 million in 2012, according to her most recent submission of documents to the anti-corruption office.She declared 25 percent and 50 percent ownership stakes in 26 properties in Buenos Aires and the Patagonian province of Santa Cruz, where Mr. Kirchner was governor for over a decade.When a student asked her about the rise in her wealth after a televised speech at Harvard University in 2012, Mrs. Kirchner said that judicial investigations had not revealed any irregularities. \u201cWe had, and I have, a certain economic position, which is the product of the fact I have worked my whole life and I have been a very successful lawyer,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m also a successful president.\u201dAs many Argentines resort to buying dollars in the black market here, her expanding wealth and near silence as the currency tumult unfolds are opening Mrs. Kirchner to greater criticism.\u201cShe used to speak every day and now it\u2019s once every 45 days,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez Montero, 65, a baker. \u201cShe\u2019s looking out for her own interests, her own money. The country is going backward.\u201dStill, the crisis has not fazed her staunchest supporters. \u201cShe\u2019s a capable lady, an honest lady,\u201d said Jacinta Gim\u00e9nez, 68, a retired saleswoman. \u201cI\u2019d vote for her until the very end.\u201dAn article on Feb. 1 about criticism of the Argentine president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, over her absence from the political scene during Argentina\u2019s currency crisis referred incorrectly to the subsidy she spoke about as the currency began to slide. It is for college-age students, not for schoolchildren.Fabi\u00e1n Werner contributed reporting from Montevideo, Uruguay.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Rest of Economy Weakens, Chinese Exports Surge", "Date": "2014-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUANGZHOU, China \u2014 The vast steel mill here on the south bank of the Pearl River was supposed to have closed more than three years ago, its labyrinth of rusty chutes and sheds bulldozed and its huge cranes with gigantic steel claws dismantled for scrap.But the Guangzhou Steel mill continued churning out millions of tons of steel for construction projects across Southeast Asia all the way through last September, when the antiquated complex, built on Mao\u2019s orders in the late 1950s, finally began shutting down. Even now, a fraction of the previously 6,000-strong work force continues to shape specialty products for export and the domestic market, while furnaces at a much newer mill to the south churn out higher-grade steel.The recent history of the old mill underlines two troubles in the Chinese economy: its dependence on construction in recent years and the return, at least temporarily, of a need for exports to help offset weakness in the domestic market.Chinese stocks continued their slide Tuesday on concerns that the country\u2019s debt-fueled real estate boom is finally slowing \u2014 and with it, the sprawling construction industry that accounts for nearly a fifth of economic output.The falling currency, which could weigh on corporate profit, is only adding to the economic anxiety.In the last two days, the CSI 300 index of big companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets has lost more than 4.5 percent, with even steeper declines among real estate developers.The weakness follows the government announcement on Monday that real estate prices are not rising as quickly and the state media reports that banks are limiting or delaying some categories of real estate loans.As worries have accumulated about the real estate sector, exports have leapt this winter despite a continued rise in blue-collar wages. As economies in the West start to recover, executives like Jim He, export manager of the Foshan Monalisa Industry Company, a ceramic tile manufacturer on the western outskirts of Guangzhou, once again see the future in overseas markets.\u201cAround 80 percent of our sales are to the domestic market, and we have seen a decline in our business recently, given the slowdown in construction projects,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are now expanding our export business to countries in Southeast Asia and in South America.\u201dRising Chinese exports may be helping to offset emerging signs of weakness across the broader Chinese economy.But strengthening Chinese exports may lead to further trade tensions, particularly ahead of midterm congressional elections in the United States in November.\u201cAs their economy slows, they are going to flood the U.S. with more and more of their excess capacity,\u201d said Leo Gerard, the president of the United Steelworkers union. \u201cThat will be felt all across the country, and politicians in steelmaking districts this election year will have to answer for why their government isn\u2019t doing more.\u201dChina\u2019s central bank has begun quietly helping the country\u2019s exports. It has unsettled traders by intervening heavily in currency markets for the last week, pushing the renminbi down steadily.On Tuesday, the fall continued, bringing the currency\u2019s loss against the dollar for the year so far to 1 percent. By comparison, the renminbi rose 3 percent against the dollar last year. The recent decline also interrupts what had seemed to be a steady rise in the Chinese currency, which had been eroding the competitiveness of Chinese exports.The gain in exports last month from a year earlier was particularly surprising because exports a year ago had been overstated. Many Chinese companies inflated the value of their shipments to bypass currency controls and bring capital covertly into the country.But Chinese government officials and Western economists say they believe that excessive invoicing has since faded.\u201cWe cannot rule out the possibility that a few companies conducted illicit transactions, but on the whole, the export growth number is reasonable and logical if you look at breakdown figures for different commodities and destination markets,\u201d Shen Danyang, the Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman, said at a recent news conference.China\u2019s exports to the United States have been rising this winter in many categories, including steel, apparel, kitchen cabinets and toys. Shipments to the European Union have risen for goods like shoes and smartphones.China\u2019s overall exported tonnage of structural steel for buildings, including products made at the Guangzhou Steel mill, leapt 18.9 percent in December from the same month a year earlier, the most recent month for which data is available. The biggest recipient of that steel was the Bahamas, where Chinese companies are building large hotels and other projects. Chinese exports of structural steel also increased sharply to Japan, the United States and Indonesia.While exports are important to many companies, growth in overseas sales cannot fully offset slower growth in investment spending, which has expanded to almost half the economy as the state-owned banking system and a loosely regulated shadow banking system have churned out loans over the last five years at a blistering pace. Many industrial companies in China complain that excess capacity from previous overinvestment is now stunting their profitability.\u201cOrders are down due to more competitors coming into the field \u2014 we can only get orders if we give very attractive pricing, but this in effect puts even more pressure on our margins,\u201d said Tom Zhao, a salesman at the Renqiu North Communication Equipment Company, a satellite dish manufacturer in Renqiu, near Beijing.China\u2019s leaders hope that consumer spending can start to replace investment projects. But consumer spending depends at least partly on perceptions that apartments, the main asset of middle-class and wealthy families, are continuing to increase in price or at least hold their value. Any doubt on that assumption quickly sends shivers through the economy.A national survey of prices in 70 cities released on Monday showed that prices fell in January compared with December in six cities for new homes and in 13 for existing homes. In the rest, prices continued to rise but tended to do so a little more slowly than in previous months. In Beijing, for example, new-home prices rose 0.4 percent last month from the previous month, after climbing 0.6 percent in December from November. Prices for newly built residential real estate are still up 14.7 percent from a year ago.But prices are already so high that first-time buyers are largely excluded from the market. Even a one-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of a large city can cost two decades\u2019 worth of salary for a young engineer. White-collar salaries have been stagnant or falling because of a glut of college graduates.Optimists in China say that construction will continue and can absorb the output of a steel sector that has grown tenfold in the last 12 years, to the point that China now consumes half the world\u2019s iron ore.Harley Seyedin, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in South China, said he was driving on the outskirts of Guangzhou last month and found himself traveling parallel to an eight-lane highway and a light-rail system under construction.\u201cWhere the stations will eventually be, I saw these mini cities popping up,\u201d he said, adding that although he was an hour\u2019s drive from the city center, \u201cwith that light-rail system, you can be in downtown Guangzhou in 15 minutes.\u201dYet steel prices have also been sliding slowly but steadily in China since last August, a sign that supply is outpacing demand. The tonnage of Chinese steel exports to the United States was flat through most of last year, but it leapt 31 percent in December compared with a year earlier as American steel prices stayed relatively high and the United States economy began gathering steam.A strengthening American economy makes it harder for companies to bring anti-dumping or anti-subsidy complaints. Winning such cases requires companies to show harm, and this is difficult when businesses are profitable.Mr. Gerard, the union president, predicted it would take a while for the latest increase in Chinese exports to bring a legal response in the West. \u201cBy then,\u201d he said, \u201ca lot of the damage will have been done.\u201dHilda Wang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Study Details Graft in European Union ", "Date": "2014-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Despite its relatively clean image, the European Union is losing at least 120 billion euros a year to corruption, and more than three-quarters of citizens believe that the problem is widespread in their countries, the bloc\u2019s home affairs commissioner said on Monday.The awarding of government business and political party financing are two areas dogged by shady dealings, Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for home affairs, said during a news conference in Brussels. But she said that less obvious sectors also had problems, including health care, where some patients were forced to pay under the table to obtain necessary treatments.She said there were \u201csome indications that the crisis has boosted\u201d corrupt practices at the local level, but that the commission did not have sufficient historical data to be certain.The commission study found that 56 percent of Europeans believe that corruption has increased in their countries, an increase from 47 percent the last time such a study was conducted, three years earlier. And more than four out of five Europeans believe \u201ctoo-close links between business and politics\u201d are a major source of problems.The report calls on member states to increase accountability and transparency, particularly in public procurement, which accounts for about 20 percent of the European Union economy. The ownership of bidders for public contracts is rarely checked, the report said, and at least one country allows public contracts to be awarded to companies with anonymous shareholders.The commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, is seeking to encourage information-sharing among national governments and civil society organizations in the hope that more openness will help Europe clean up.Ms. Malmstrom said the commission\u2019s estimate that corruption costs Europe \u20ac120 billion, or roughly $162 billion, annually was almost certainly too conservative. The figure is equivalent to about 1 percent of the \u20ac11.7 trillion gross domestic product of the 28-nation European Union.

{"Headline": "Scottish Oil and Gas an Issue in Vote on Independence", "Date": "2014-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 They have disagreed over whether an independent Scotland could retain the British pound as its currency. They have sparred over whether Scotland would remain in the European Union if it votes in September to leave the United Kingdom. And on Monday, two of the most prominent advocates of the arguments for and against Scottish independence \u2014 Alex Salmond, Scotland\u2019s first minister, and David Cameron, the British prime minister \u2014 turned to another crucial economic issue at stake in the battle: the future of the still-substantial oil and gas reserves in the North Sea.In a staged but striking symbol of their differences, Mr. Cameron brought the British government\u2019s cabinet to Aberdeen, a once gritty fishing and shipping port that is now the wealthy hub of North Sea oil and gas, only the second time in 90 years the government had met in Scotland. He announced a new investment to support the energy industry and asserted that Britain\u2019s economic size and clout were vital to keeping the profits flowing from oil and gas in the decades to come.\u201cThe broad shoulders of one of the top 10 economies in the world has really got behind this industry,\u201d he said of North Sea oil and gas, adding that being part of Britain also reduced the impact of sudden drops in energy prices.In nearby Portlethen, Mr. Salmond met separately with the Scottish government\u2019s cabinet ministers. He suggested that an independent Scotland could follow the example of Norway, which has built a large sovereign wealth fund from its natural resources. He also highlighted his knowledge of the energy industry, noting that he was an oil analyst in the 1980s when Mr. Cameron was still at Eton, the elite English college \u2014 a continuation of political attacks on Mr. Cameron as elitist and out of touch with average voters.With a referendum on Scottish independence scheduled in September, Mr. Cameron has rationed his visits to Scotland knowing that, as an Englishman leading a Conservative Party that is unpopular with Scots, he is not the most effective advocate for the anti-independence campaign.But at stake in the vote is the future of the United Kingdom, its place on the world stage and the reputation of Mr. Cameron, who does not want to become the prime minister who presided over the breakup of Britain.Because of its wider ramifications, the referendum is being watched in other regions in Europe with aspirations for independence, like Catalonia in Spain, and questions have been raised over whether Scotland would remain in the European Union if the referendum passes and what currency it would use.Most opinion polls show the majority of Scots want to stay part of Britain, though the gap may be narrowing.While he appealed to sentiment in one recent speech, Mr. Cameron hopes that hardheaded economics will prove decisive in September\u2019s vote, in which those who are at least 16 and who live in Scotland can participate.Mr. Cameron\u2019s message on Monday boiled down to the idea that Britain could better manage the remaining North Sea oil and gas reserves than an independent Scotland. The British government on Monday announced a 100 million pound investment, or $167 million, in a gas-fired carbon-capture and storage facility at Peterhead. It also promised a new energy regulator and a change so that licenses for exploitation would be awarded in order to maximize the recovery of remaining energy supplies.But supporters of Scottish independence say that resources have been poorly managed in London, and Mr. Salmond told the BBC that there had been 16 tax changes affecting the industry in 10 years and that 14 different ministers had been in charge of policy in 17 years.The day of announcements began with Mr. Cameron visiting an oil rig where he appeared for TV cameras in an all-weather jacket and a safety helmet. He did not meet Mr. Salmond let alone hold the face-to-face TV debate that Mr. Salmond has demanded.Both men know that the economy is a crucial battleground, and Scots have been warned by Britain\u2019s three main political parties that they would lose the pound as their currency if they opt for independence. Mr. Salmond disputes that and has accused his critics of bullying. He also argues that an independent Scotland would automatically remain a member of the European Union \u2014 though that assertion has been rejected by Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission.Though that may alarm voters, some pollsters believe that such warnings may backfire by making the campaign against independence seem negative.Most of Britain\u2019s remaining oil and gas resources lie off the northern part of the country in the North Sea or even farther north around the Shetland Islands. Lindsay Wexelstein, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, an Edinburgh-based market research firm, estimates that 85 percent of Britain\u2019s remaining oil and gas lies under Scottish waters.One Scottish government study estimates that Scotland would have been entitled to 94 percent of the oil and gas tax receipts, or about $18 billion, for the 2011 and 2012 fiscal years.While an estimated 42 billion barrels has already been produced, there may still be as much as 24 billion barrels left, which could be worth more than $2 trillion.Whoever gains control of this will still be managing an industry in decline, as a report published Monday by the British government makes clear. The study, led by Ian Wood, the retired founder of the Wood Group, a large Aberdeen-based oil services company, noted that while investment was at record levels, production had fallen by close to 40 percent since 2010 and that exploration in the last two years had produced poor results \u2014 less than 150 million new barrels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poll Suggests Crushing Loss Awaits India\u2019s Governing Party", "Date": "2014-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Two months before Indians vote in national elections, a new poll suggests that India\u2019s dominant political party and family may suffer one of their worst defeats in the country\u2019s 67-year history.Seventy percent of Indians say they are dissatisfied with the way things are going in India today, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. And 63 percent of those polled said they would prefer that the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party lead the next government, compared with just 19 percent who picked the governing Indian National Congress party, which is led by Sonia Gandhi and her son, Rahul Gandhi.\u201cThis poll affirms what most of us suspected,\u201d said Shekhar Gupta, editor in chief of The Indian Express, a daily newspaper published in Mumbai. \u201cBut what it doesn\u2019t tell us is who will lead the next government.\u201dThe pollsters interviewed 2,464 randomly selected adults between Dec. 7 and Jan. 12 in states and territories that are home to roughly 91 percent of the Indian population. The poll has a margin of sampling error of four percentage points.Perhaps the most important finding was the popularity of Narendra Modi, the official prime ministerial candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a Hindu nationalist political organization. Pew found that 78 percent of those polled had a favorable view of Mr. Modi, with just 16 percent holding an unfavorable view.But Mr. Modi has softened his image in recent months, and the Bharatiya Janata Party has undertaken an outreach to Muslims, who make up about 14 percent of the country\u2019s population. Mr. Modi has presided over an economy in Gujarat that is among the strongest in India, and he has promised to bring to the rest of the country his economic expertise and ability to build good roads.Still, Mr. Modi\u2019s support in a national poll may not translate into his election as prime minister. No single party has won a parliamentary majority since 1989, and none is likely to do so this year, political analysts say.\u201cWhether Modi becomes the next prime minister will come down to 10 to 20 seats in Parliament,\u201d said Hartosh Singh Bal, the political editor of Caravan magazine.Indeed, three women from the crucial states of West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu lead political parties that may each earn enough seats to block Mr. Modi from his goal. And speculation is rife about how these three \u2014 Mamata Banerjee, Mayawati and Jayalalithaa, the last two of whom go by one name \u2014 will play their cards.Pankaj Pachauri, a spokesman for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, dismissed the Pew results. \u201cIndia is too big and complex a country for pollsters to predict anything by talking to 2,500 people,\u201d Mr. Pachauri said. Nonetheless, there is widespread agreement that the Gandhis, India\u2019s dominant political family for most of its history, will face a crushing defeat. The governing coalition has been tarnished by repeated corruption scandals, and a slowing economy has added a sense of gloom.Hari Kumar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The Obama administration said at the time the agreement was reached that Iran\u2019s oil exports would not increase, remaining around one million barrels a day.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.The International Energy Agency, a group based in Paris that represents 28 energy-importing countries, including the United States, said China accounted for most of the Iranian increase, at 95,000 barrels a day. Small increases in imports by Japan and India were offset by small reductions in imports by South Korea, Taiwan and Syria.The Iranian data compiled by the agency is a closely watched barometer of the effect of sanctions on Iran, which suffered a huge drop in oil industry revenue in the past few years.Most Western sanctions against Iran remain in force, including a European oil embargo and extensive prohibitions on international banking transactions. The Obama administration has warned repeatedly that the temporary agreement should not be interpreted as a signal that these sanctions will be dismantled.The agreement between Iran and the so-called P5-plus-1 group of countries, comprising the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council \u2014 Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States \u2014 plus Germany, was intended to allow negotiators more time to reach a permanent accord on the disputed nuclear program, which Iran says is peaceful but other nations suspect is a cover for achieving the ability to make atomic bombs.The first talks on a permanent accord are scheduled for next Tuesday in Vienna.videoAdvertisement"}

The commission doubled Spain\u2019s 2014 growth outlook to 1 percent. Its high unemployment rate, however, is expected to fall only slowly below 26 percent this year. For the euro zone as a whole, the jobless rate is seen as staying flat around the current record high of 12 percent, falling to 11.7 percent next year.The economy in the wider 28-nation union, which includes members like Britain and Poland that do not use the euro currency, will grow by 1.5 percent this year and 2.0 percent in 2015, according to the commission forecast. That outlook is also revised upward by 0.1 percentage points each.Over all, solid growth in major trading partners will help Europe by increasing its exports, Mr. Rehn said.\u201cThe recovery in the European Union will be supported by the advanced economies, notably the U.S.,\u201d he said, while the emerging markets will fare unevenly.Still, Mr. Rehn urged European governments to keep strengthening their economies\u2019 competitiveness and to trim their deficits, saying the recovery remains modest and cannot be \u201can invitation to be complacent.\u201dThe only countries forecast to remain stuck in recession in 2014 are Cyprus, whose economy is expected to shrink by 4.8 percent, and Slovenia, where a contraction of 0.1 percent is expected.In Greece, which has lost about a quarter of its economic output over a six-year recession, the commission continues to predict a timid return to growth this year, of 0.6 percent.

She packed up and crossed the border into Sudan with her six children.\u201cThe rebels would come into homes, kill men, boys, take mobile phones, money, and now they are even killing women,\u201d said Ms. Akuoch, 43, a secondary-school teacher who left her husband behind in South Sudan. \u201cEven inside the church,\u201d she added.So, like most of her neighbors, she decided it was time to leave Malakal, the capital of the oil-rich Upper Nile State. About 14,000 people have crowded into this remote Sudanese outpost, just a small fraction of the nearly 900,000 people who have fled their homes across South Sudan since the civil war began in December.Between all the deaths and the grinding halt to the economy that have resulted from the fighting, \u201cwe have returned to point zero,\u201d said Oteem Akuy Obuk, 33, another teacher taking refuge here.The medical aid group Doctors Without Borders said Wednesday that patients had been killed in their beds at the Teaching Hospital in Malakal. Across South Sudan, medical equipment has been looted and wards burned to the ground. In one instance, an entire hospital was destroyed.\u201cAssaults on medical facilities and patients are part of a broader backdrop of brutal attacks on towns, markets and public facilities,\u201d Raphael Gorgeu, head of mission for Doctors Without Borders in South Sudan, said in a statement. \u201cThese attacks show a complete lack of respect for medical care and deprive the most vulnerable of lifesaving assistance just when they need it most.\u201dThe group\u2019s staff found 14 bodies at the Teaching Hospital compound, with several showing signs that they had been shot in their beds. More than 50 patients remained in the hospital.Patients who sought shelter at the United Nations base on the outskirts of town described armed groups entering the hospital and shooting people who had neither money nor cellphones to give them. They raped women and young girls, the group said.\u201cMalakal is deserted, with houses burned throughout and countless dead bodies strewn in the streets,\u201d Carlos Francisco, the Doctors Without Borders emergency coordinator in Malakal, said in a statement. \u201cI can find no words to describe the brutality in Malakal, which has left in its wake a ransacked city and a thoroughly traumatized people.\u201dMartin Nesirky, spokesman for the United Nations secretary general, said Tuesday that a peacekeeping patrol this week found \u201cthe town was still deserted of civilians, with the presence of a very small number of opposition forces.\u201dIn the town of Leer, Doctors Without Borders described equipment and buildings burned to the ground, drug vials crushed and surgical equipment broken.\u201cThe freezers and the fridges where we used to keep the vaccines cold were just melted white blobs,\u201d Sarah Maynard, the group\u2019s project coordinator for Leer, said in a statement. \u201cThe emergency room had been gutted by fire. The operating theaters had been thoroughly ransacked and one of them extensively burned, including the operating table.\u201dSimilar scenes have unfolded across the war-torn country, with news reports of killings at the hospital in Bor, the capital of Jonglei State and scene of some of the fiercest fighting. John Prendergast, a co-founder of the Enough Project, an antigenocide organization, described seeing mass graves filled with hundreds of bodies there.\u201cThe atrocities committed in Bor are just one example of brutality unfolding across the country at the hands of both national army and antigovernment forces,\u201d he wrote in a recent report after his visit.Witnesses and human rights groups said that government forces had rounded up and killed members of Mr. Machar\u2019s ethnic group, the Nuer, in Juba. Deadly attacks against Dinka, the country\u2019s largest ethnic group and Mr. Kiir\u2019s community, have occurred as well, especially in Bor.But the suffering transcends ethnic groups, as much of the country has slipped into chaos. Ms. Akuoch, who fled Malakal, is neither Nuer nor Dinka, but a member of the Shilluk ethnic group. She described a horrible scene in Malakal, watching dogs eat bodies in the streets as the overwhelming stench of death left her nauseated.\u201cThe older soldiers are O.K., but the younger ones, teenagers in plain clothes, are horrible,\u201d Ms. Akuoch said. Her family took a car eight hours to the city of Rank, then got on a truck filled with dozens of others fleeing the fighting that brought her to Sudan. About 171,000 people have left South Sudan for other countries since the fighting began, according to the United Nations.Here in Kilo 10, named that way because it is 10 kilometers from the closest sizable town, water and shelter were quickly becoming a problem.

{"Headline": "Steel Maker ArcelorMittal Narrows Its Net Loss", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Not long after Lakshmi Mittal formed ArcelorMittal through the takeover of Arcelor in 2006, the financial crisis dragged global demand for steel sharply down, hitting the company\u2019s European base particularly hard. ArcelorMittal, the world\u2019s largest steel maker, has been on the ropes ever since, running losses in some years and struggling with an outsize debt burden.Now Mr. Mittal and the company seem to be springing back to life, putting money into new facilities, looking for deals and issuing upbeat forecasts for this year. Mr. Mittal, despite reporting on Friday a narrower earnings loss for the fourth quarter, said he expected demand for the company\u2019s products to grow by 3 percent this year as the American economy picked up and even sickly Europe started returning to health.\u201cWe have started this year in a stronger position,\u201d he told reporters.Investors responded positively, sending shares up 1 percent.His view that steel demand will grow even in Europe has its detractors. \u201cWe do not share the market\u2019s view of a significant increase in E.U. steel production,\u201d Carsten Riek, an analyst at UBS in London, wrote in a recent research note. Mr. Riek said that sectors like autos and construction would most likely remain lackluster, and European steel exports were expected to fall sharply because of the appreciation of the euro against the dollar.Mr. Mittal spent the economic slowdown hunkered down, cutting costs and trimming debt, which at year\u2019s end was at a longtime low of $16.1 billion. What little capital he did have to spend went to his mining operations, which he considered a better bet than steel.Now, he is starting to invest in steel. He is building new steel units in Brazil and Argentina, at a joint venture in China and at the company\u2019s Dofasco complex in Canada.\u201cThe improvement in the overall economic situation led us\u201d to begin expanding some steel operations, Mr. Mittal said.Mr. Mittal, who in the early and mid-2000s was a prolific deal maker, is also back on the prowl. In November, he made his first major steel acquisition in years, buying a finishing mill in Alabama from a rival, ThyssenKrupp, in a $1.55 billion joint venture with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal. His intention is to supply auto plants and the energy industry in the southern part of the United States.His strategy is starting to yield results.ArcelorMittal\u2019s net loss of $1.2 billion for the last three months of 2013 was an improvement on the $3.8 billion loss the company reported in the same period in 2012. The company said that large write-offs in Europe attributed to cost-cutting, as well as in China and South Africa, played a big role.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization \u2014 the metric most closely watched by steel investors \u2014 was up 23 percent at $1.9 billion, compared with the fourth quarter of 2012 and was slightly ahead of analysts\u2019 forecasts. Mr. Mittal said he expected that metric to improve further this year to $8 billion, compared with $6.9 billion in 2013.Jeff Largey, an analyst at Macquarie in London, said the better-than-expected results \u201cconfirm that the steel market is stabilizing and is getting better.\u201d He also said ArcelorMittal was reaping the benefits of cost-cutting and previous investments in iron ore operations.ArcelorMittal benefited from its operations in the United States. Shipments and prices rose in the Americas for the flat steel business, which supplies material for car bodies, and operating income increased more than fourfold to $270 million.There were some signs of improvement even in Europe, where the steel industry has endured a long, hard winter. The company\u2019s steel shipments there rose by 12 percent. Falling prices undercut some of the gain, however, giving weight to the argument that Europe still has too many steel mills.Mr. Mittal said the company\u2019s cost-cutting in Western Europe was sufficient. Having closed weak operations in Belgium and France, all of the company\u2019s blast furnaces in the region are operating. \u201cWe have completed our optimization plan; there is no further capacity to be taken out by us,\u201d he said.Eastern Europe, he indicated though, could still be subject to cuts if warranted. Mr. Mittal also complained that European regulations, like recently published proposals to curb carbon emissions that may raise energy costs, \u201cwill reduce the attractiveness of investing in Europe.\u201dThrough layoffs and plant closings, the company narrowed its operating losses in Europe to $75 for every metric ton of flat steel for autos and appliances that it shipped in Europe in the quarter, compared with almost $500 per ton a year earlier. Actual cash flow in Europe was positive, the company said.The cost-cutting inevitably leads to write-offs, like the $379 million hit that ArcelorMittal took in the quarter for curtailing operations in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium. But if Mr. Mittal has done enough cutting, then those write-downs may be drawing to a close.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nobel Winner\u2019s Frank Advice to China\u2019s Leadership", "Date": "2014-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 A. Michael Spence won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 2001 for esoteric research on how people make decisions when critical information is hard to obtain. But by that time, after more than a decade and a half as an academic dean at Harvard and Stanford, many of Mr. Spence\u2019s colleagues had begun referring to him as a \u201cformer economist.\u201dMr. Spence, who turned 70 last year, begs to differ: He learned to become a better, \u201colder\u201d economist, he countered.With his background in studying information, he began thinking about how the Internet, compressing time and distance, would strengthen supply chains around the world. In 2005, the World Bank asked him to give the keynote talk at its annual conference on poverty reduction. Worried that he had little useful to contribute, he balked. \u201cWhy would you want me?\u201d he recalled asking.As it turned out, that talk, which \u201cseemed not to bomb,\u201d led his career in a new direction, prompting the World Bank to name him chairman of its Commission on Growth and Development in 2006. He chose 19 former planning ministers, finance ministers and business leaders to join the group \u2014 but only two economists, the Nobel laureate Robert M. Solow, who \u201cprobably knew more than anyone else about growth,\u201d he said, \u201cand me, who didn\u2019t.\u201dHe seems to have learned fast. In recent years, Mr. Spence has become something of an expert on the Chinese economy after being invited by Beijing, along with Edwin Lim, a former chief World Bank representative in China, to put together an unaffiliated advisory group, supported by the Cairncross Economic Research Foundation. The group has met intensively with the Chinese government\u2019s key planning and economic officials and conducted what those officials have called an unprecedented study of China\u2019s development challenge.While Mr. Spence has come away impressed with how \u201ccurious and open\u201d Chinese officials are, he also doesn\u2019t mince words about how serious China\u2019s problems are.With the global economy increasingly dependent on China, the danger is that the nation is \u201con a collision course with its own growth model,\u201d he said in an interview. The Chinese must move beyond low-wage exports and \u201cgenerate a fair amount of demand domestically, or they\u2019ll fail.\u201dChina faces a daunting challenge called the middle-income transition, where developing nations have repeatedly stumbled. Since Japan rebuilt after World War II, only the Asian Tigers \u2014 South Korea and Taiwan and the city-states of Singapore and Hong Kong \u2014 have made it from middle-income status generating, in today\u2019s dollars, some $10,000 in economic activity per person to high-income status of $20,000 and above.In the modern era, poor nations have often found that the most effective strategy to jump-start their economies is to specialize in low-wage exports, tapping vast global demand. But the middle-income transition, Dr. Spence argues, requires a much more sophisticated economic policy, with nations gradually moving up the ladder of producing more complex industrial goods, and, importantly, strengthening domestic demand for consumer goods.Moreover, an export-led strategy no longer can rely on nearly insatiable demand from the United States, as the Asian Tigers could through the end of the 20th century. Stagnant economies in Europe and Japan limit global demand even more. China therefore faces unusually harsh pressures to increase the buying power of its own consumers if it wants to make the leap to a truly prosperous nation.This is a fairly conventional Western view of the Chinese economy. But what was surprising is that it was a central theme of the no-nonsense 2011 report prepared under Mr. Lim and Mr. Spence \u2014 and that Beijing published it not just in English but in Chinese for domestic consumption. Further discussions in 2013 helped Liu He, a top economic adviser to President Xi Jinping, and his colleagues formulate major reforms approved at a Communist Party plenum in November.Barry J. Naughton, professor of Chinese economy at the University of California, San Diego, says that Mr. Spence deserves some credit as he \u201chas encouraged top Chinese advisers, and maybe even helped them think up these ideas.\u201dThe 2011 report (another based on the 2013 discussions will be published) details a host of problems: steadily worsening income inequality and a reduction in the amount of economic activity going to wages from two-thirds of G.D.P. in 1980 to barely half today. It laments an \u201cenormous\u201d three-to-one disparity between urban and rural wages, and worse disparities in health care provision, a fragmented school system and poor social services.The report calls for reversing these troubling trends, thus both strengthening domestic demand and pressuring firms into more innovative, productive sectors. It also calls for exposing huge public sector banks and often inefficient state-owned companies, controlling more than half of China\u2019s fixed investment, to more market pressure.Though the Lim-Spence group includes many economists, its recommendations step outside well-known economic models. Those models say plenty about exposing firms to market pressure and something about supporting short-run demand. But they say nothing about the long-term global demand deficit that Mr. Spence worries about or China\u2019s need to deliberately shift the composition of demand.Nonetheless, these are coherent ideas based on experience, Dr. Spence argues. The need to tap long-run demand can be seen at work in poor countries that export into the global economy, and they surely apply in different ways to advanced nations. But clarifying such ideas in formal models belongs very much on economists\u2019 \u201cto do\u201d list, he says.But just because top officials in China have endorsed an economic reform agenda doesn\u2019t mean they will actually adopt it. Lots of Chinese are saying, \u201cwe\u2019ll believe it when we see it,\u201d Mr. Spence said with a sigh. China\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan (2006-10) also called for strengthening domestic demand, but it weakened instead. In 2000, private consumption accounted for 46 percent of G.D.P., but by 2012, it had fallen to a mere 36 percent of G.D.P.The November party plenum called for some 20 percent of the Chinese population to migrate from rural to urban areas, where wages and social services are far better. But cities are starved for taxes, so they increasingly turn to real estate ventures and borrowing via \u201cfinancial vehicles,\u201d notes Anthony J. Saich, a China expert at the Harvard Kennedy School. Cities will not even provide schooling for children of millions of rural migrants who lack official residency permits, and they resist issuing more permits.The profits of state-owned firms, today almost wholly reinvested, would seem to be a natural revenue source. The November plenum called for channeling 30 percent of profits into government coffers. But the managers of those firms are fiercely resistant to any incursions on their independence.\u201cThe mountains are high, and the emperor is far away,\u201d Mr. Saich said, echoing an ancient proverb that suggests that China hasn\u2019t changed as much since the Communist Revolution as it might seem.For all the fears elsewhere of the emergence of a powerful China, the whole world has a positive stake in its ability to develop into a successful advanced economy, according to Charles Kenny, who has published a new book, \u201cThe Upside of Down: Why the Rise of the Rest Is Good for the West.\u201dBut it is still not clear whether China can negotiate the treacherous path from middle-income to high-income status. Beyond the economic challenge, political obstacles abound. A rising middle class inevitably seeks a larger role in decision-making. Mr. Spence doubts that officials think China immune to such pressure, but they do not yet deem the time right for moves toward democratization.The traditional Chinese alternative has been \u201ca rather small civil service surrounding the emperor,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a meritocracy, selected by examination.\u201d These are the talented, Western-educated officials the Lim-Spence group has come to know.With its thousands of years of centralized decision-making, China may never resemble a Western democracy. But the elite recognizes it must sustain popular support, Mr. Spence said. \u201cIf the party does not deliver real progress to the vast majority of Chinese \u2014 it\u2019s a very inclusive concept \u2014 they will fail.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernanke Starts New Role as Yellen Takes Fed Helm", "Date": "2014-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For the last eight years, on most weekdays and many weekends, Ben S. Bernanke was driven to work as chairman of the Federal Reserve. On Monday, he drove himself to a new job as an economic studies fellow at the Brookings Institution, a research group about a mile north of his old office.Mr. Bernanke will work on a book about his time at the Fed, and Brookings said he would contribute to an initiative on government economic policy.\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to helping Mr. Bernanke with the book he plans to write, and to getting his advice as we work to improve public understanding of fiscal and monetary policy and improve the quality and effectiveness of those policies,\u201d said David Wessel, director of the institution\u2019s new Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy. Shortly after Mr. Bernanke\u2019s 8 a.m. arrival at his new job, Janet L. Yellen was sworn into office as chairwoman of the Fed in a quiet ceremony in the central bank\u2019s boardroom. She was acting chairwoman during the weekend interregnum.Mr. Bernanke\u2019s installation as Fed chairman in 2006 was a public event. President George W. Bush spoke \u2014 the occasion was only the third time a president had visited the Fed. The audience included congressional leaders and former Fed chairmen.Ms. Yellen\u2019s installation was not even televised. The Fed released a picture of the administration of the oath by Daniel K. Tarullo, the longest-serving member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors. Ms. Yellen did not issue a public statement.She is expected to make her first public appearance next week, when she delivers the Fed\u2019s twice-a-year report on monetary policy to House and Senate committees. The Fed under Mr. Bernanke started a slow retreat from its efforts to stimulate the economy. Under Ms. Yellen, it must determine the pace at which that retreat will continue.Fed officials are optimistic about economic growth in 2014, but early economic reports have been disappointing. Manufacturing activity was weaker than expected in January, the Institute for Supply Management said on Monday. The Fed\u2019s retreat also appears to be contributing to volatility in emerging markets, which in turn is weighing on domestic stock markets. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down almost 5 percent this year after falling 41 points to close at 1,741.89 on Monday.\u201cAgainst this nervous global backdrop all eyes will be on this Friday\u2019s January employment report,\u201d Julia Coronado, chief North America economist at BNP Paribas, wrote in a note to clients. \u201cThe report will likely set the tone, either easing concerns or deepening worries.\u201dFed officials also are debating how much of the damage from the recession can still be repaired. The share of adults with jobs shrank sharply during the recession, and has not recovered. The Fed, to avoid pushing too long or too hard, must decide how many of those who lost jobs are no longer willing or able to work.Officials also are watching inflation. The usual concern among central bankers is that prices will rise too quickly, but now the greater concern is that prices are not rising fast enough. The sluggish pace of inflation may be impeding necessary economic adjustments, for example, by making it harder to repay debts. It is confounding the Fed\u2019s official forecasts and standard economic models.Ms. Yellen, formerly the Fed\u2019s vice chairwoman, also inherits from Mr. Bernanke a long list of incomplete changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act to strengthen financial regulations.Mr. Bernanke\u2019s decision to join Brookings was not a surprise. He had said he planned to stay in Washington, and he made his final public appearance as Fed chairman last month at the opening event for the Hutchins Center, which is financed by $10 million from the family foundation of Glenn Hutchins, a private equity investor and vice chairman of the Brookings board of trustees. Mr. Bernanke\u2019s predecessors as Fed chairman, including Alan Greenspan and Paul A. Volcker, mostly came from the business world and returned to it. But Mr. Bernanke has never worked in that world. He was a professor of economics at Princeton University before he joined the Fed\u2019s board of governors in 2002. At Brookings, Mr. Bernanke will be reunited with his friend Donald Kohn, who was the Fed\u2019s vice chairman during Mr. Bernanke\u2019s first four-year term. \u201cBrookings scholars have a well-established reputation for contributing innovative ideas and trenchant analysis to economic and other public policy debates,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said in a statement released by Brookings. \u201cI welcome the opportunity to engage in that vibrant community through research and writing.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Big Deal", "Date": "2014-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s less well known that the administration\u2019s international economic agenda is also stalled, for very different reasons. In particular, the centerpiece of that agenda \u2014 the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, or T.P.P. \u2014 doesn\u2019t seem to be making much progress, thanks to a combination of negotiating difficulties abroad and bipartisan skepticism at home.And you know what? That\u2019s O.K. It\u2019s far from clear that the T.P.P. is a good idea. It\u2019s even less clear that it\u2019s something on which President Obama should be spending political capital. I am in general a free trader, but I\u2019ll be undismayed and even a bit relieved if the T.P.P. just fades away.Implicit protection of services \u2014 rules and regulations that have the effect of, say, blocking foreign competition in insurance \u2014 surely impose additional costs. But the fact remains that, these days, \u201ctrade agreements\u201d are mainly about other things. What they\u2019re really about, in particular, is property rights \u2014 things like the ability to enforce patents on drugs and copyrights on movies. And so it is with T.P.P. Meanwhile, opponents portray the T.P.P. as a huge plot, suggesting that it would destroy national sovereignty and transfer all the power to corporations. This, too, is hugely overblown. Corporate interests would get somewhat more ability to seek legal recourse against government actions, but, no, the Obama administration isn\u2019t secretly bargaining away democracy.What the T.P.P. would do, however, is increase the ability of certain corporations to assert control over intellectual property. Again, think drug patents and movie rights.Is this a good thing from a global point of view? Doubtful. The kind of property rights we\u2019re talking about here can alternatively be described as legal monopolies. True, temporary monopolies are, in fact, how we reward new ideas; but arguing that we need even more monopolization is very dubious \u2014 and has nothing at all to do with classical arguments for free trade.Now, the corporations benefiting from enhanced control over intellectual property would often be American. But this doesn\u2019t mean that the T.P.P. is in our national interest. What\u2019s good for Big Pharma is by no means always good for America.In short, there isn\u2019t a compelling case for this deal, from either a global or a national point of view. Nor does there seem to be anything like a political consensus in favor, abroad or at home.So what I wonder is why the president is pushing the T.P.P. at all. The economic case is weak, at best, and his own party doesn\u2019t like it. Why waste time and political capital on this project?My guess is that we\u2019re looking at a combination of Beltway conventional wisdom \u2014 Very Serious People always support entitlement cuts and trade deals \u2014 and officials caught in a 1990s time warp, still living in the days when New Democrats tried to prove that they weren\u2019t old-style liberals by going all in for globalization. Whatever the motivations, however, the push for T.P.P. seems almost weirdly out of touch with both economic and political reality.So don\u2019t cry for T.P.P. If the big trade deal comes to nothing, as seems likely, it will be, well, no big deal. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Flirts With Deflation", "Date": "2014-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialDeflation is a pernicious and self-reinforcing phenomenon that debilitates economies, as Japan experienced for much of the past 15 years. When prices fall broadly, consumers put off purchases and businesses see little value in investing for the future, creating a downward spiral. Deflation also makes it more difficult for governments and other borrowers to repay their debts.The central bank\u2019s inaction is particularly disconcerting because it is the only public institution that could provide a boost to the weak euro-zone economy. Under pressure from Germany, governments across the euro zone have committed to cutting spending and raising taxes in a counterproductive effort to reduce their fiscal deficits.Ideally, the central bank and European governments would work together to revive the economy of the euro zone. But since that is unlikely, it is up to the central bank to act when it meets again next month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Detroit\u2019s Immigration Solution", "Date": "2014-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe governor of Michigan, Rick Snyder, wants to fix Detroit with smart immigrants. He proposes to attract 50,000 of them over five years using a visa program for people with advanced degrees or exceptional abilities in the sciences, arts or business. But it\u2019s possible to welcome Mr. Snyder\u2019s creative immigration plan while acknowledging there\u2019s something unsettling about it. For one, Detroit is not a blank homesteader\u2019s prairie. It\u2019s a mostly African-American metropolis, done in by disastrous economic trends and epic mismanagement, but also by white abandonment. Its spiral into desolation has left many people trapped, with poor schools, few jobs and blighted futures. There\u2019s something oddly defeatist about saying: Our citizens have been done wrong for so long, let\u2019s bring in Chinese and Indians. It seems strange, too, to pin immigration policy \u2014 a federal matter \u2014 to one well-meaning municipal project: Why just Detroit? Why not Baltimore or Brownsville, Tex.? And awarding site-specific visas creates an enforcement problem, if the people who take them move, say, to Chicago at the first opportunity. No one is going to tell them: Welcome to the Motor City; here\u2019s your green card and your electronic bracelet. Such a limited visa program might also reinforce the misguided belief that highly skilled immigrants are the only ones worth the trouble. This is putting a velvet rope beside the Golden Door and saying: We\u2019ll take you, you and you \u2014 not you. World-class entrepreneurs and scholars come from poor and blue-collar families, too. Some of our most important, economy-sustaining labor is done by the workers who expertly pick our crops, and by the nannies and housekeepers without whose labors many white-collar households would cease to function. Those who support Mr. Snyder, including Detroit\u2019s mayor and many in its business community, have ready answers to objections like these. They say that immigrants\u2019 success does not have to come at the expense of the native-born. They say that the city\u2019s research-and-development sector is thriving and that many high-tech jobs are going unfilled. They argue that an elite class of newcomers would build and attract jobs and investment for the benefit of all. Mr. Paparelli\u2019s proposal, like Mr. Snyder\u2019s, is worth thinking about. And it is conceivable that the Obama administration might be willing to make a city like Detroit a laboratory for immigration innovation. Mr. Paparelli says a president with \u201cexecutive chutzpah\u201d could achieve this through regulation, bypassing Congress.But why should a president have to? What if, in fact, Congress were to enact a far more ambitious plan to unleash the energy and skills of millions of immigrants, not just thousands? Not just for one city, but across the 50 states, boosting not just fields in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, but also the mom-and-pop businesses that are the backbone of our downtowns, and the industries and occupations most Americans avoid?The plan should be carefully drawn to earn the support of business leaders, labor unions, legislators and American public. It should grease the wheels of entrepreneurship and investment while also upholding the core American commitment to family-based immigration.The good news: There is such a plan. It passed the Senate in June.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Easy Reset for Japan's Power Plants", "Date": "2014-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside AsiaTOKYO \u2014 Hundreds of technicians and engineers are camped out in Tokyo hotels trying to revive Japan\u2019s nuclear industry, which was shut down after the Fukushima Daiichi power plant disaster almost three years ago.It is proving a hard slog. A new, more independent regulator is in place, asking difficult questions and seeking to impose tougher safety rules on powerful utilities that were largely their own masters for the past 50 years.The Nuclear Regulation Authority was created in 2012 and set new safety guidelines last July. It now has four teams vetting reactors at nine nuclear power stations on a list of those seeking to restart. A deadline to complete the checks has been missed, and the authority is still asking for reams of information. No one is able to predict when the first of 48 reactors will be turned back on.The delays are biting the utilities, which must spend billions of dollars to import fossil fuels to keep the power on, pushing Japan into a record trade deficit and putting at risk Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s economic polices aimed at ending years of stagnant growth.\u201cAll the utilities are in a similar situation, and, unless outstanding issues are resolved, we can\u2019t judge that they are in compliance with the standards,\u201d said Tomoya Ichimura, a director at the authority.The regulator and staff from the utilities and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, a leading supplier of nuclear plant equipment, are plowing through mountains of paperwork on the technical specifications of reactors and their vulnerability to natural disasters like the earthquake and tsunami that knocked out the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in March 2011.All lack experience in carrying out such detailed safety checks because regulations that existed before Fukushima were lax.\u201cOnly the framework of the safety criteria was decided, not the details, so the dialogue between the N.R.A. and power companies to work out the specifics is taking time,\u201d said Seiichi Nakata, a project leader at the policy, communication and international affairs unit of the Japan Atomic Industry Forum.And once the checks are done, reactors must undergo inspections \u2014 which took as long as two months under the previous regulations \u2014 and get approval from the local authorities before the reactors can be turned back on. The plants are being treated as if they have just been built and are seeking certification to start operating for the first time.Interviews with utility and nuclear industry staff members, regulators and government officials show a climate of uncertainty, frustration and long hours.A task force of about 90 inspectors with the Nuclear Regulation Authority dispatches orders and requests to hundreds of employees from the regional utilities. As many as 2,800 employees at Mitsubishi Heavy are involved in dealing with the utilities\u2019 requests on specifications and other data, the company said.The Kyushu Electric Power Company, Hokkaido Electric Power Company, Kansai Electric Power Company and Shikoku Electric Power Company say they have stationed scores of employees in Tokyo to respond to queries from the regulator.A typical working day for them lasts from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. They stay in inexpensive business hotels within a quick commute of the authority headquarters in a leafy district of Tokyo. One of those, the Hotel Unizo in Shimbashi, a bustling district of bars and restaurants, charges 11,000 yen, or $110, a night. To keep costs in check, some companies offer their employees a daily allowance of as little as \u00a51,500 for meals and no laundry, said one person close to the safety review process, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation.Any downtime not spent returning home to visit families is used to prepare for more meetings with the regulator.\u201cEveryone involved in the safety reviews is irritated, and it is mentally draining,\u201d said one employee at a regional utility, who has been stationed in Tokyo since July and has missed important dates on his children\u2019s school calendar. The employee was not identified because he was authorized to speak to the news media.\u201cI can\u2019t read books or watch TV. There\u2019s no time to relax,\u201d he said, adding he rarely had time even to wash his clothes. \u201cI have 20 sets of underwear and socks bought from convenient stores, rolled up like sushi in my office.\u201dUtilities must submit thousands of pages of documents outlining their compliance and readiness on a checklist of 27 main items required by the authority, including earthquake protection and their plans for emergency responses. Kyushu Electric, which has applied to restart four reactors, has submitted more than 10,000 pages of documents to the regulator, said Hiroki Yamaguchi, a spokesman for the utility.The regulator is still feeling its way and often changes the criteria for compliance, forcing utilities to submit more documentation, people in the industry said. The utilities then take their requests to Mitsubishi Heavy, which is struggling to meet deadlines.\u201cMitsubishi Heavy basically handles safety assessments of the plants, and the utilities vie with each other to get help from them, creating a bottleneck,\u201d said the person involved in the checks at a regional utility.Mitsubishi Heavy declined to comment on claims that it was the reason for some delays.The cost to Japan\u2019s economy and the utilities\u2019 finances is heavy. Japan imported a record 87.5 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas last year, at a cost of $69 billion, according to customs-cleared import data. Imports of thermal coal were also at record levels.\u201cThere\u2019s a growing consensus from a purely economic perspective that Japan needs to restart as many reactors as it can in order to build out the diversification of its power sources and reduce fuel prices,\u201d said Tom O\u2019Sullivan, founder of Mathyos Japan, an independent energy consulting firm.Forecasts that the first nuclear reactor would be back in operation by the middle of this year are misplaced, said Tetsuo Yuhara, a director at the Canon Institute of Global Studies, who previously spent 30 years at Mitsubishi Heavy.\u201cI have no forecast for restarts,\u201d Mr. Yuhara said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same situation as a year ago, as two years ago. Nothing has changed.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rachel Kushner: By the Book", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy the BookWhat\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve read recently?\u201cTwelve Years a Slave,\u201d by Solomon Northup. An incredible document, amazingly told and structured. Tough, but riveting. The movie of it by Steve McQueen might be the most successful adaptation of a book ever undertaken; text and film complement each other wildly. I also recently read Michelle Alexander\u2019s \u201cThe New Jim Crow\u201d and can\u2019t quit promoting it. That and \u201cGolden Gulag,\u201d by Ruth Wilson Gilmore, are important books that assess with deep and careful thought how we came to be a society of mass incarceration of people of color.When and where do you like to read?My most recent, best reading experience was a vacation last summer that involved reading feverishly in a friend\u2019s 16th-century stone cottage in the Corr\u00e8ze, and doing same in a cheap but airy hotel room overlooking the Corniche in Marseille. At home, I dedicate occasional whole days to reading as if I\u2019m a convalescent. The ideal place for this is the bath, where the body floats free. Books go a little wavy, but they\u2019re mine, so who cares. Currently I\u2019m deep in \u201cKippenberger: The Artist and His Families,\u201d in this manner. It\u2019s very good. None of the usual biography clich\u00e9s (\u201cAnd yet his greatest disappointments were still to come. .\u2008.\u2008.\u201d). And if you want to understand the art world, and cult of personality, it is a very instructive read.What books do you find yourself returning to again and again?I am a rereader. Quality is variety if you wait long enough. Barthes, Baudelaire, Benjamin, C\u00e9line, Duras, Faulkner, Fitzgerald, Melville: There is so much to revisit. \u201cIngrid Caven,\u201d by Jean-Jacques Schuhl, is always in rotation. I used to read \u201cMorvern Callar,\u201d by Alan Warner, every year \u2014 I adored that book. This past fall I reread the first two volumes of Proust (new Penguin translations). It was my third reread. I was teaching a Proust seminar at Syracuse, to M.F.A. students of writing. To read for the purpose of leading a class called for a different way of looking at the volumes, more systematic. What I felt every week was that the system, the structure of metaphysical themes and concerns, was right there in the text, so natural to locate. In preparation I read, among other things, Edmund White\u2019s sweet and short biography of Proust and was so impressed by it. Edmund White might be a rare person of letters in an old-fashioned sense.Who is your favorite novelist of all time?For all time, two: Marcel Proust and Marguerite Duras.Sell us on your favorite overlooked or underappreciated writer.I am just getting into Zora Neale Hurston, who is possibly a much better writer than the critics and rivals who tried to erase her from history, resulting in a life in which she worked as a maid and died in a welfare nursing home. She\u2019s clever. She does something modern to the sentence. Her race politics (outlined in her memoir, \u201cDust Tracks on a Road\u201d) are a bit over my head, a bit strange, but fascinating. Alejo Carpentier is so important to me that I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s famous or not, he\u2019s huge in my own private world of greats. \u201cThe Lost Steps,\u201d \u201cThe Chase\u201d (Sartre\u2019s favorite), \u201cReasons of State\u201d \u2014 his prose is spare and baroque at the same time, brutal and comic and full of historical rage and intricate human achievement. \u201cKingdom of This World,\u201d about the Haitian Revolution, is a singular work of art. Famous in the hipper poetry circles but perhaps not the wider world, Ariana Reines is something special, and her book \u201cMercury\u201d is a shining achievement. I revere it.What kinds of stories are you drawn to? And how would you describe the kinds of books you steer clear of?What kinds of characters draw you in as a reader? And as a writer?I tend to like the complicated antihero: Charlus, from Proust. Balzac\u2019s Vautrin. Bola\u00f1o\u2019s Hans Reiter/Archimboldi, in \u201c2666.\u201d Shrike, from \u201cMiss Lonelyhearts.\u201d The Judge from \u201cBlood Meridian.\u201d Recktall Brown from \u201cThe Recognitions.\u201d If I could write a character like one of those? Well. I should be so lucky.Which books might we be surprised to find on your bookshelves?Maybe those in my country and western section \u2014 the Larry McMurtry novels, an amazing picture book of the Grand Ole Opry, and a history of frontier prostitution lamentably titled \u201cSoiled Doves.\u201d Also, I have always collected books on cars and racing. I have a book that\u2019s just a glossary of terms from the world of gas dragsters, and another on the Czech-built Tatra, the most beautiful make of car the world has ever seen. And I am a completist about the photo books of the \u201cporn auteur\u201d Elmer Batters. If only I collected books on marijuana I could have a shelf called \u201cAss, Gas or Grass: Nobody Reads for Free.\u201dWhat kind of reader were you as a child?Supposedly I went into my room with \u201cAlice in Wonderland,\u201d which was given to me when I was 5, and didn\u2019t come out until I was done. I was an early reader but I don\u2019t think that says much. Having a child and being around them, it\u2019s apparent to me that there\u2019s some kind of clock that goes off at different times for different kids. Mine went off early, and I didn\u2019t like to sleep. So my mother let me stay up as late as I wanted looking at books, and she says I stayed up all night doing that starting at age 3. My best years are way behind me.What were your favorite childhood books? Do you have a favorite literary character?What children\u2019s books have you enjoyed discovering (or rediscovering) through your 6-year-old son?We read a lot of books that were mine when I was little, saved all these years: \u201cHigglety Pigglety Pop!,\u201d by Maurice Sendak. \u201cThe Wedding Procession of the Rag Doll and Broom Handle,\u201d by Carl Sandburg, illustrated by Harriet Pincus. \u201cThe Slightly Irregular Fire Engine,\u201d by Donald Barthelme. Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cFables and Folktales for Children\u201d \u2014 so simple, and wonderful, if slightly dark. They remind me that a children\u2019s story doesn\u2019t need to pander in order to entertain. (The problem with so much recent children\u2019s literature: It panders, and yet is often inappropriate for children). Two new discoveries that are profound works of children\u2019s literature: \u201cPaddle-to-the-Sea,\u201d by Holling C. Holling, and \u201cThe Animal Family,\u201d by Randall Jarrell.Which novels have had the most impact on you as a writer?I studied the novels of Joan Didion and Don DeLillo, who seemed deft and worldly in a way I hoped to someday be. More recently, I have grown deeply impressed by the verve and erudition of \u201cThe Recognitions,\u201d by William Gaddis. It is a work that, to me, fulfills the ambition to apprehend the writer\u2019s own moment as history \u2014 that is the goal, to my mind. I don\u2019t care to read about present-day America unless the writer truly has something to say about these times \u2014 uses the contemporary, rather than gets used by it. The whole idea of \u201coffering up a mirror\u201d is not enough. I want more.Is there a particular book that made you want to write?Cormac McCarthy\u2019s \u201cBlood Meridian\u201d is without question the book that made me want to try to be a fiction writer as an actual serious undertaking.If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?Given who our president is, this is like a trick question. I have serious problems with Obama. But Obama is not poorly read; that is not his problem. He\u2019s extremely well read. He\u2019s still got a drone program. He lets bankers run our economy. Allows Guant\u00e1namo to remain open. It would be foolish to pretend I could recommend some enlightening text and he\u2019d scratch his chin and then go for a policy makeover.What does your personal book collection look like? Do you organize your books in any particular way?Subject areas for nonfiction. Literature is alphabetical, except I keep poetry on its own set of shelves, but some poets go with fiction for reasons that remain mysterious to me, such as Anne Carson, Francis Ponge, Rimbaud. And I have a \u201chot\u201d bookcase where I keep what I\u2019m looking at for a novel I\u2019m writing. On the fiction shelves, in front of more dormant areas, I place images of girls and women reading, maybe that\u2019s precious, it\u2019s just a habit that got started at some point: postcards of paintings by, for instance, Tamara de Lempicka, Gerhard Richter, Lucian Freud, and Cindy Sherman as ing\u00e9nue-librarian, reaching up.Disappointing, overrated, just not good: Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?I set aside books without finishing them all the time, but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t like them. Take, recently, \u201cLiving Currency,\u201d by Pierre Klossowski, or the \u201cHypnerotomachia Poliphili,\u201d or Xenophon\u2019s \u201cAnabasis\u201d \u2014 I dip in, and in 30 pages I have a taste of something important that I don\u2019t have the training to really benefit from reading to completion anyhow.

{"Headline": "Nationalistic Remarks From Japan Lead to Warnings of Chill With U.S.", "Date": "2014-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 A series of defiantly nationalistic comments, including remarks critical of the United States, by close political associates of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has led analysts to warn of a growing chill between his right-wing government and the Obama administration, which views Japan as a linchpin of its strategic pivot to Asia.Rebuttals from the American Embassy in Japan have added to concerns of a falling-out between Japan and the United States, which has so far welcomed Mr. Abe\u2019s efforts to strengthen Japan\u2019s economy and military outreach in the region to serve as a counterbalance to China. The comments, which express revisionist views of Japan\u2019s World War II history, have also led to renewed claims from Japan\u2019s neighbors, particularly China and South Korea, that Mr. Abe is leading his nation to the right, trying to stir up patriotism and gloss over the country\u2019s wartime history.One of the most direct criticisms of the United States came this week, when Seiichi Eto, a governing party lawmaker and aide to Mr. Abe, posted a video online in which he criticized the Obama administration for expressing disappointment in the prime minister\u2019s recent visit to a shrine. The visit to the shrine, which honors the war dead including war criminals, stoked anger in South Korea and China, which both suffered under Imperial Japanese rule.\u201cIt is I who am disappointed in the United States,\u201d said Mr. Eto in the video on YouTube, which was removed on Wednesday as the prime minister\u2019s office sought to control the diplomatic damage. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t America treat Japan better?\u201d he added.The disconnect between Washington and its strongest Asian ally comes at a time of rising regional frictions that Mr. Abe has likened to Europe on the eve of World War I. The disputes over history and territory have complicated the United States\u2019 already fraught attempts to persuade Japan and Korea to present a united front to a more confident China, while also trying to avoid antagonizing the Chinese.American officials express frustration that Mr. Abe is not doing enough to allay fears in South Korea, a crucial American ally in Asia, about a conservative agenda they worry includes rolling back the apologies that Japan made for its early 20th-century empire-building. American officials also fear he could undermine his own efforts to restore Japan\u2019s standing in Asia by playing into what they call Chinese efforts to paint the Japanese as unrepentant militarists.Analysts say such concerns are behind the United States Embassy\u2019s taking the unusual step of publicly criticizing Mr. Abe\u2019s trip to the shrine.For their part, Japanese officials express their own exasperation that the United States does not take a clearer stand in favor of Japan in its continuing dispute with China over the control of islands in the East China Sea. They also complain that the Obama administration has not rewarded Mr. Abe enough, despite his self-proclaimed efforts to improve ties with Washington by taking such politically difficult steps as pushing to restart a stalled base relocation in Okinawa.\u201cPrime Minister Abe feels frustrated,\u201d said Yuichi Hosoya, an expert on United States-Japan relations at Keio University in Tokyo. \u201cHe feels he is not being thanked enough for expending his political capital to strengthen the alliance.\u201dMr. Hyakuta\u2019s comments came days after the new president of NHK, who was chosen last month by a governing board including Abe appointees, raised eyebrows in Washington by saying that Japan should not be singled out for forcing women to provide sex to Japanese soldiers during the war, saying the United States military did the same. Most historians say the Japanese system of creating special brothels for the troops, then forcing tens of thousands of women from other countries to work there, was different from the practice by other countries\u2019 troops in occupied areas who frequented local brothels.The Japanese discontent with treatment by the Obama administration goes back to early last year, when a newly elected Mr. Abe tried to arrange an immediate trip to meet the president, only to be told to wait a month. More recently, Japanese officials have appeared hurt that Mr. Obama wants to spend only one night in Japan during a visit to the region in April.Some analysts say this feeling of being held at arm\u2019s length may be driving some of the recent criticisms of the United States.\u201cThis is one of the most dangerous moments in U.S.-Japan relations that I have seen,\u201d said Takashi Kawakami, an expert on international relations at Takushoku University in Tokyo. \u201cJapan is feeling isolated, and some Japanese people are starting to think Japan must stand up for itself, including toward the United States.\u201dAnalysts note that many of the comments are being made by relatively minor figures, and not members of Mr. Abe\u2019s cabinet. They also say that Japanese public attitudes remain overwhelmingly favorable toward the United States, which has been the guarantor of Japan\u2019s postwar security with its 50,000 military personnel stationed in the country.At the same time, the analysts say, frustrations on both sides are real. In the United States, they reflect an ambivalence toward Mr. Abe, as some worry that he is returning to the agenda he pursued the last time he was prime minister \u2014 trying to revise the country\u2019s pacifist Constitution and downplay wartime atrocities in the name of restoring lost national pride.\u201cI think the Yasukuni visit was a turning point in U.S. attitudes toward Abe,\u201d Daniel C. Sneider, associate director for research at the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University, said of the visit to the shrine. \u201cIt was a reminder that he is still trying to push his patriotic remake of postwar Japan.\u201dThe Yasukuni Shrine visit, and the American criticism of it, also appeared to unleash the current wave of revisionist statements.American analysts and officials have faulted Mr. Abe for failing to sufficiently distance himself and his administration from the nationalistic statements. Instead, his government\u2019s spokesman has merely said the statements represented the speakers\u2019 \u201cpersonal views\u201d without criticizing them, though the spokesman did say the administration had asked Mr. Eto to remove the video expressing disappointment in the United States.Visiting members of Congress have also warned that revisionist statements as well as Mr. Abe\u2019s visit to Yasukuni would only benefit China. They added, however, that the American relationship with Japan is still sound enough to be easily fixable.\u201cThere are always unfortunate statements and unfortunate comments even among the best of friends, and this is something that is going to have to be worked out and gotten over with,\u201d said Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who was part of a group of visiting Congress members in Tokyo who met on Wednesday with Mr. Abe. \u201cIt is important that we have an economically vibrant and strong Japan to act as a counterbalance to China.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Naming of Officials in Ukraine Reflects Homage to Power of the Street", "Date": "2014-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 Oleh Musiy, a prominent doctor who last week coordinated the improvised field hospitals that treated wounded and dying protesters during clashes with the police, is now the health minister of Ukraine, a nation of 46 million people.Dmytro Bulatov, the leader of a group that organized caravans of cars to carry out protests outside government buildings and the homes of some senior officials, is now minister of youth and sports. Yevhen Nyschuk, an actor who became more famous as the M.C. on stage in Independence Square, a sort of Ryan Seacrest of the Ukrainian civic uprising, is culture minister.And Tetyana Chornovol, a journalist, activist and crusader against public graft, who first won renown in 2012 when she scaled the walls of President Viktor F. Yanukovych\u2019s residential compound and spent several hours peeking at the trappings of luxury before being arrested, will be the head of a new federal anticorruption bureau, which does not even exist yet.As the Ukrainian Parliament approved an interim government on Thursday, the inclusion of these popular figures from the protest movement reflected a concerted effort to pay tribute to the role of the street in dislodging Mr. Yanukovych from power and to bolster the legitimacy of more established officials in the cabinet who are the object of deep public suspicion and mistrust.More seasoned public officials acknowledged that some of the choices were unorthodox, but said that the protest leaders had earned the right to a strong voice in the new government.\u201cFirst of all, we should give the benefit of the doubt,\u201d said Hryhoriy Nemyria, a Parliament member and former deputy prime minister. \u201cAlso, we\u2019re in extraordinary circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cBusiness as usual is not something we can expect.\u201dFor many participants in the three-month uprising, however, the provisional leadership in Parliament and the interim government named on Thursday include far too much business as usual: veteran politicians like the acting prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, who have served in government for many years.A crowd of several hundred demonstrators gathered outside Parliament on Thursday to make that point, many carrying flags of the nationalist party Svoboda. Someone even parked an armored car on the plaza, where it remained for much of the day.While an early presidential election has been set for May 25, the demonstrators said they also wanted early parliamentary elections, giving them an opportunity to sweep the legislative branch clean as well.In a gesture of deference and respect to the street protesters, officials announced the choices for the new cabinet on stage in Independence Square on Wednesday night before a crowd of tens of thousands. The reaction was mixed, with cheers for the people most closely associated with the protest movement, and jeers for others.Oleh Matyushenko, 22, a medical student from western Ukraine, said he was disappointed that Mr. Yatsenyuk had not stayed to answer the crowd\u2019s questions, but had vanished as the Ukrainian anthem was played. \u201cYou can\u2019t make people shut up with an anthem,\u201d Mr. Matyushenko said outside Parliament on Thursday.\u201cWe have to teach politicians to work, to make sure they know that they are under surveillance of the people,\u201d he said.While Mr. Yatsenyuk is viewed warily by people on the street, especially because he is a top official in Fatherland, the party of a former prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, his appointment has been greeted enthusiastically by Western officials, who regard him as experienced, technically competent and someone they can work with as a partner.On Thursday, he received a call from Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who assured him \u201cthe United States will offer its full support\u201d as Ukraine undertakes needed reforms, the White House said. Mr. Yatsenyuk is a former foreign minister, economics minister and acting head of the central bank. In a speech to Parliament on Thursday just before he was officially appointed acting prime minister, he said he would revive the sweeping political and free-trade agreements with the European Union that Mr. Yanukovych scrapped in November, setting off the unrest.With Ukraine facing an economic crisis, Mr. Yatsenyuk said the country should quickly take steps to meet the requirements of the International Monetary Fund for a large economic rescue package, which will include some painful austerity measures and other changes.\u201cThe new government should immediately start negotiations with the I.M.F.,\u201d Mr. Yatsenyuk said.In working toward fixing the economy, Mr. Yatsenyuk will have the help of Stepan Kubiv, whom Parliament appointed this week as chairman of the Ukrainian National Bank.Mr. Kubiv has some experience for the central banker post: he is a former chief executive of KredoBank, a Ukrainian retail bank. But he became far better known for his work during the protests as commandant of the occupied Trade Unions Building, which had served as an unofficial headquarters of the opposition right on Independence SquareThe building operated around the clock, with a kitchen that helped feed protesters, as well as offices where politicians would meet opposition leaders, and even a makeshift press center. The building was set on fire and gutted last week during the worst clashes between demonstrators and the authorities.In an interview in the Parliament building on Thursday, Ms. Chornovol acknowledged that she had no government experience and that she would face challenges in running an anticorruption bureau that must be developed from scratch.Perhaps the most unorthodox figure in the new government, however, is Mr. Bulatov, who will be minister of youth and sports, but who rose to fame as the leader of AutoMaidan, a group that carried out protests using caravans of vehicles.Mr. Bulatov, 35, who owns a garage in Kiev, was kidnapped last month, apparently by men connected to the authorities, and abused. He said that he was held in a dark room and beaten, and that his hands had been nailed to a door. An ear and a cheek were cut with a knife.Speaking from the stage in Independence Square on Wednesday night, Mr. Nyshchuk, the actor chosen for culture minister, made a crowd-pleasing promise \u2014 not for some renewed national dedication to the arts or music, but simply no corruption. \u201cNo one will steal,\u201d he said. Steven Erlanger and Oksana Lyachynska contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He was 74.He died of prostate cancer, his wife, Gertje Utley, said.From the battlefields of Vietnam and Iraq to the Soviet-led invasion of Prague, Mr. Utley was a forthright interviewer of troops and commanders in the field and of presidents and diplomats in the halls of power.Fluent in Russian, German and French, he reported from about 75 countries in a multifaceted career that included 30 years at NBC. He was a bureau chief in London and Paris for the network, chief foreign correspondent, weekend news anchor and substitute for John Chancellor and Tom Brokaw on \u201cNBC Nightly News.\u201d He also hosted magazine programs and moderated the Sunday morning program \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d He later worked for ABC News and CNN.Mr. Utley began his career auspiciously, rising from office clerk to Vietnam War correspondent in one year. In 1964 he became one of the first network reporters based in Saigon, joining newspaper and wire service correspondents. Like some of his colleagues, he strived for meaningful reporting, offering longer perspectives on political issues and battlefield developments and bringing a little-known war home vividly to Americans.In 1968, Mr. Utley covered the invasion of Czechoslovakia as Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces crushed the so-called Prague Spring political reforms. He covered the 1973 Yom Kippur war, interviewed the Nazi leader Albert Speer in 1976, reported on the Cold War from Berlin and Moscow and, in 1987, interviewed the dissident physicist Andrei D. Sakharov as he emerged from years of internal exile. He covered a summit of Presidents George H. W. Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall that same year and the Persian Gulf war in 1991.Mr. Utley was no swashbuckler in a trench coat: He was a gangly 6-foot-6 scarecrow with gentle eyes and a wry smile who slouched beside his small German-born wife. He loved opera and for years was the host of the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts on PBS. He was also a workhorse on assignment, an aggressive voice in the studio and a critic of the networks when they cut back international news coverage and in-depth reporting.Serious television reporting has largely been replaced by \u201cinterminable talking heads,\u201d he told The New York Times in 2004, when he joined a State University of New York graduate program in international relations in Manhattan. \u201cSince television can now report live from anywhere in the world, television reporters sometimes become color commentators who narrate news events rather than carrying out in-depth news reporting.\u201dAfter Army service and graduate studies at the Free University in Berlin, Mr. Utley joined NBC in Brussels in 1963 on the recommendation of a family friend, the correspondent Mr. Chancellor, who became his mentor. Mr. Utley was soon covering the war in Indochina.In 1973 he married Gertje Rommeswinkel, an art historian and author who sometimes accompanied him on assignments. Besides his wife, he is survived by two brothers, Jonathan and David.In the early 1970s, he anchored Saturday evening news programs in New York before being succeeded in 1973 by Mr. Brokaw, then a rising NBC star. For the rest of the decade Mr. Utley was the network\u2019s London bureau chief and senior European correspondent.Returning to New York, he wrote and anchored \u201cNBC White Paper: America \u2014 Black and White,\u201d on the black experience since the civil rights era, in 1981. He was NBC\u2019s chief correspondent in the 1980s, covering foreign and domestic affairs, including presidential campaigns.He moderated \u201cMeet the Press\u201d from 1989 to 1991 and anchored weekend news programs from 1988 to 1993. He left NBC in 1993 and until 1996 was ABC\u2019s London-based chief foreign correspondent. From 1997 to 2002 he reported for CNN; he co-anchored the network\u2019s coverage of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.His memoir, \u201cYou Should Have Been Here Yesterday: A Life in Television News,\u201d was published in 2000, almost simultaneously with his wife\u2019s book \u201cPicasso: The Communist Years.\u201dMr. Utley won a Peabody Award and the Overseas Press Club\u2019s Edward R.

{"Headline": "An Uneasy Market Ends Tightly Mixed ", "Date": "2014-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWeak earnings from Procter & Gamble and the tobacco company Lorillard helped end a rally in the stock market on Wednesday.Shares of Procter & Gamble, the world\u2019s largest household products maker, fell after it lowered its sales and earnings forecasts. Lorillard, maker of Newport cigarettes, fell after its profit slipped as higher costs offset increased revenue on both conventional and electronic cigarettes. The losses were relatively small. Before Wednesday\u2019s drop, stocks had gained for the previous four days, mitigating some of the market\u2019s weakness in January. That sputtering was caused by signs of slowing growth in China and doubts over the strength of the American economy.\u201cAt this point, boring is good,\u201d said Kate Warne, an investment strategist at Edward Jones, an advisory firm. \u201cPeople are a bit tired of the ups and downs we\u2019ve seen, and a relatively flat day would be a sign of confidence.\u201d The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 0.49 point, or less than 0.1 percent, to close at 1,819.26. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 30.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 15,963.94.The Nasdaq composite index, however, rose 10.24 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,201.29, bolstered in part by gains in TripAdvisor.Makers of consumer staples, a category that includes products like soap, diapers and cigarettes, fell the most of the 10 sectors in the S.&P. 500.Lorillard had the biggest drop of any company in the S.&P., falling $2.48, or 5 percent, to $47.47 after its earnings disappointed investors.Procter & Gamble was the biggest loser in the Dow, falling $1.35, or 1.7 percent, to $77.49 after the company said it would be hurt by declines in emerging market currencies against the dollar. Concerns over the outlook for emerging markets shook the stock market in January. Those losses have continued as investors have added to them after some lackluster economic reports in the United States. But stocks have rebounded in the last week, and they jumped on Tuesday after Janet L. Yellen, the new chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, said she would continue the central bank\u2019s market-friendly, low-interest rate policies.The S.&P. 500 was down almost 6 percent for the year as of Feb. 3, but it has since pared that loss to 1.6 percent thanks to gains in health care and technology stocks. Both sectors have jumped 4.5 percent in the past week.For the market to advance from here, investors will want to see further evidence that the economy is improving, said Cameron Hinds, a regional chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank. While the economic reports have been weak, many economists say they believe the cold winter has been a factor.\u201cPeople are going to start looking for strength in the economy to get the market going,\u201d Mr. Hinds said.TripAdvisor was among the day\u2019s winners, posting the biggest gains in the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq 100 index. The online travel company gained $6.07, or 7.2 percent, to $90.27 after posting stronger than-expected fourth-quarter revenue that led RBC Capital Markets to upgrade its rating on the stock. Among the stocks on the move, Amazon.com fell $12.54, or 3.5 percent, to $349.25 after analysts at UBS lowered their rating on the stock to neutral from buy on concern over revenue from the Internet retailer\u2019s \u201cPrime\u201d customers. Amazon was among the biggest decliners in the S.&P. 500.DaVita HealthCare Partners, the kidney dialysis provider, jumped $2.02, or 3.1 percent, to $66.35 on news of an agreement to resolve a government investigation, and a 36 percent rise in its fourth-quarter income.Interest rates edged higher. The yield on the Treasury\u2019s 10-year note rose to 2.76 percent, from 2.73 percent, while its price fell 10/32, to 99 28/32.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.M.F. Study Details Perils of Iranian Economy", "Date": "2014-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe International Monetary Fund issued a sobering appraisal of Iran\u2019s economy on Wednesday, warning that years of government mismanagement aggravated by the impact of the West\u2019s antinuclear sanctions had left the country vulnerable to anemic growth and rampant inflation that require urgent attention.The I.M.F. appraisal was the organization\u2019s first on-the-ground assessment of the Iranian economy in nearly three years. It was issued as Iran is seeking to undo the Western sanctions through negotiations on its disputed nuclear program.Mr. Cerisola said difficulties with the Iranian government\u2019s attempts to reduce subsidies for fuel and food, inadequately funded social programs and \u201ca marked deterioration in the external environment stemming from the intensification of trade and financial sanctions, have weakened the economy.\u201d\u201cInflation and unemployment are high, while the corporate and banking sectors show signs of weakness,\u201d he said. \u201cThese shocks have exposed structural weaknesses in the economy and in the policy framework.\u201dMr. Cerisola, who led a delegation to Tehran from Jan. 25 to Feb. 8, said that the authorities in the administration of President Hassan Rouhani, which took over last summer, \u201care well aware of these challenges and the need to advance reforms, and have begun the preparatory work in many of these areas.\u201dHe said a more comprehensive Iran report would be prepared by late March.To some sanctions advocates, the I.M.F. assessment suggested that the effects of the temporary agreement to ease sanctions reached last November in Geneva may have helped to stabilize the economy. Mr. Cerisola said the I.M.F. expected the economy to grow 1 percent to 2 percent this year after having declined in 2012 and 2013. \u201cI actually think Iran\u2019s economy has stabilized and is on a path to a modest albeit fragile recovery due in no small part to sanctions relief and shifts in market psychology as a result of the Geneva agreement,\u201d Mark Dubowitz, executive director of Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based group that supports more sanctions, said in an email.Mr. Cerisola\u2019s statement said the inflation rate had fallen from a 45 percent annualized rate in July to below 30 percent as of last December, partly because the currency, the rial, had stabilized after a prolonged decline. Still, it said, \u201cexternal shocks\u201d could undermine the rial\u2019s stability. The statement also said that while the economic outlook may have improved partly because of the temporary nuclear agreement and the plans for negotiations on a permanent agreement, the prospects for Iran\u2019s economy \u201cstill remain highly uncertain.\u201dThe I.M.F.\u2019s tone contrasted sharply with the optimism about the economy espoused by Iran\u2019s government, which has contended that the temporary agreement on the nuclear issue had caused fatal fractures in the regimen of Western sanctions and that they would eventually collapse.The Obama administration also has expressed annoyance over news reports that Russia may be negotiating a deal with Iran to trade goods for $1.5 billion worth of Iranian oil per month, which would substantially increase Iran\u2019s oil exports. American officials have said such a deal would violate sanctions and undermine the negotiations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Talk of Economy, Obama Turns to \u2018Opportunity\u2019 Over \u2018Inequality\u2019", "Date": "2014-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWashington MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Like so many political fights, the one between President Obama and Republicans over income inequality has become a battle over language. Is it about inequality of incomes or of opportunity? On this question, the president and his party have moved in Republicans\u2019 \u2014 and voters\u2019 \u2014 direction.To Republicans, talk of income inequality smacks of class warfare and redistribution of wealth, of taxing the rich to give to the poor. They prefer to emphasize opportunity and upward mobility, and Democrats, too, have come to see that frame as more appealing to middle-class voters in this midterm election year.\u00a0For years, Mr. Obama has spoken of gaps in both income and opportunity between the privileged and everyone else in a changing economy. But his emphasis has shifted. In his State of the Union address last week, he spoke 10 times of expanding \u201copportunity\u201d and twice of income inequality. That ratio was roughly flipped in his signature speech on the topic in Osawatomie, Kan., just over two years ago.\u201cOpportunity and mobility are the right things to be talking about,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and now a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cI think the word \u2018inequality\u2019 means different things to different people. We always have inequality, and in America we\u2019re not that upset about inequality of outcomes. But we are upset about inequality of opportunity.\u201d\u201cHowever salient reducing income inequality may be,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit is demonstrably less important to voters than any number of other priorities\u201d \u2014 including reducing poverty.The differences are not just a matter of politics, but of policies, too. For both parties, their emphasis in talking about opportunity over income inequality matters because it affects the outcome of what the government might do, and what Democrats and Republicans can possibly agree on.The president should \u201csteer this debate\u201d away from income inequality and \u201cin a direction where we can find some unity,\u201d said Vin Weber, a Republican strategist and former congressman from Minnesota. \u201cI would not, if I were him, hit hard on income distribution, because everybody goes to their ideological corners right away and we\u2019re at war.\u201dIn his State of the Union address, Mr. Obama, with a glance toward Republicans in the House chamber, said that he was open to any \u201clegislation to expand opportunity for more American families.\u201d\u201cOpportunity is who we are, and the defining project of our generation must be to restore that promise,\u201d he said.Republicans generally argue that government should do little; a free market and a growing economy will create opportunity. Their ideas to overhaul education, job-training and safety-net programs often double as budget-cutting initiatives.Democrats have the political advantage on policy prescriptions. Polls show strong support for some of Mr. Obama\u2019s ideas, such as investing more in education from preschool through college, increasing the minimum wage and raising taxes on the highest earners.Still, the influence of national polls on the debate is limited when Democrats are thinking in regional terms, given the trouble spots they face for the 2014 midterm elections. They are defending Senate seats in places such as Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina with strong conservative leanings.\u201cIn Senate races, they\u2019re stuck talking to an audience that\u2019s predominately Republican or right-leaning independents,\u201d said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cSo it\u2019s not shocking to me that the Senate Democrats are adopting the more conservative language.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s pollster, Joel Benenson, in a year-end analysis of voter attitudes on the economy, never used the word \u201cinequality.\u201d Instead he wrote about the desire of voters, including independents, for the government and private sector to invest together in areas that would help them and their children get ahead.The president often emphasizes that children born into poverty are increasingly likely to remain there, lacking the family resources, quality education, health care and mentors needed to escape.

{"Headline": "Health Care Law Projected to Cut the Labor Force", "Date": "2014-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A Congressional Budget Office analysis released Tuesday predicted that the Affordable Care Act would shrink the work force by the equivalent of more than two million full-time positions and recharged the political debate over the health care law, providing Republican opponents fresh lines of attack and putting Democrats on the defensive.The nonpartisan budget office\u2019s analysis, part of a regular update to its budget projections, was far more complicated than the Republican attack lines it generated. Congressional Republican leaders called the findings \u201cdevastating,\u201d \u201cterrible\u201d and proof that the health care law was a job killer.The report did say that the law would reduce hours worked and full-time employment, but not because of a crippling impact on private-sector job creation. With the expansion of insurance coverage, the budget office predicted, more people will choose not to work, and others will choose to work fewer hours than they might have otherwise to obtain employer-provided insurance. The cumulative reduction of hours is large: the equivalent of 2.5 million fewer full-time positions by 2024, the budget office said.The report \u201crightfully says that people shouldn\u2019t have job lock,\u201d said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader. \u201cWe live in a country where we should be free agents. People can do what they want.\u201dHe continued: \u201cRepublicans talk about losing millions of jobs. That simply isn\u2019t true.\u201d But Republicans, even those versed in the nuances of the budget reports, did not hold back. Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the Republican leadership, acknowledged the administration\u2019s position: that the coming decline in the work force could be the result of workers\u2019 choosing different career paths. But, he noted, the budget office previously projected a far smaller impact.\u201cNo matter how you calculate this number or how the administration tries to explain it away, it\u2019s about two and a half times as high as the number was when they looked at it the first time,\u201d Mr. Blunt said. \u201cThey can say anything they want, but this number is a lot worse than anybody thought.\u201dRepublicans seized on the report as evidence of the health care law\u2019s adverse effect on the economy.\u201cFor years, Republicans have said that the president\u2019s health care law creates uncertainty for small businesses, hurts take-home pay and makes it harder to invest in new workers,\u201d Speaker John A. Boehner said. \u201cThe middle class is getting squeezed in this economy, and this C.B.O. report confirms that Obamacare is making it worse.\u201dDemocrats clearly understood the political damage the report could have. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat facing a tough political environment for her re-election bid in New Hampshire, told reporters, \u201cYou guys are going to politicize it no matter what happens.\u201dSenator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, who has embraced a number of bills to tweak the health care law, called disappointing enrollment figures and work-force declines the law\u2019s \u201cWaterloo.\u201d\u201cPretty soon the numbers don\u2019t line up and the math doesn\u2019t equal out, and you have to make some adjustments,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do it every day in your life. The government\u2019s got to do it.\u201dBut it will also have an effect on businesses, the report said, including by encouraging them to reduce employee hours to avoid the \u201cemployer mandate.\u201d The overall demand for labor would not change, in other words, but businesses might arrange their workers\u2019 schedules differently to avoid having to provide them with health care.The report stressed that there seemed to be no effect on part-time employment yet; the law\u2019s penalties on businesses that fail to provide insurance for workers do not hit until 2015.The White House pushed back against the Republican attacks, arguing for the nuance contained in the budget office report.\u201cClaims that the Affordable Care Act hurts jobs are simply belied by the facts,\u201d said the White House press secretary, Jay Carney. \u201cThe report itself says that there is \u2018no compelling evidence that part-time employment has increased as a result of the A.C.A.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe budget office also estimated that about a million fewer Americans than expected would receive health insurance coverage this year through the marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act, primarily because of the troubled rollout of the exchanges. It also revised its estimates of the number of people receiving coverage through Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Plan coverage, lowering it by about one million.The budget office now estimates that six million Americans will enroll through the exchanges in their first year, rather than seven million, and that expanded Medicaid and other public programs will enroll eight million Americans, rather than nine million.But the long-term effect of the problems with the rollout remains unclear, the budget office said, declining to alter its coverage projections for later years.\u201cOver time, more people are expected to respond to the new coverage options, so enrollment is projected to increase sharply in 2015 and 2016,\u201d the budget office said in its report. It estimates that as of 2017, about 25 million Americans will obtain coverage on the exchanges.The news in the report is not all bad for Democrats. The office also sees the budget deficit falling to $514 billion in the 2014 fiscal year, or about 3 percent of economic output, from $1.4 trillion in 2009. Many economists consider deficits of that size to be sustainable in the long term.The budget office sees the deficit continuing to drop in the 2015 fiscal year, to $478 billion, or about 2.6 percent of economic output. From there, though, it anticipates that the deficit will rise again as government spending picks up, absent congressional action.An earlier version of a headline accompanying this article on the home page was incorrect. The health law is projected to result in a voluntary reduction in the work force equal to 2.5 million full-time workers, according to the Congressional Budget Office, not two million fewer jobs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mumbai\u2019s Empty Parlor Games", "Date": "2014-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionGOA, India \u2014 THERE was a time, only a few years ago now, when I prided myself as a host of parties \u2014 soirees, as some plummy guests called them. Before one such gathering, I was asked: \u201cAre you having another sorry this week?\u201d Rather than correct my guest\u2019s French, I simply furnished the time, and the usual address: my sparse studio in the north Mumbai enclave of Juhu, overlooking a pond and a parking lot dotted with identically hooded black and yellow rickshaws.This was to be a Sunday brunch, for an artist from Delhi. Around 30 guests appeared, a miscellany of writers, socialites, artists, publishers, venture capitalists and tag-along out-of-towners. As the afternoon wore on, though, I felt a creeping sense of unease. I overheard a middle-aged photographer offer a young model a pro bono \u201cportfolio shoot,\u201d and she rolled vixen eyes. A moment later, she accepted his offer, the trade of pictures for sex implicit.An interior designer boasted to an art collector of having designed the home of one of our pre-eminent business magnates. Since I happened to personally know this magnate, I knew that the designer had been summarily fired from the job, on account of the heroic scale of his unprofessionalism, including a penchant for fielding prospective clients at the under-construction apartment without either the homeowner\u2019s knowledge or permission. But the art collector only listened, entranced by the decorator. The two agreed to meet later over lunch to discuss a work proposal, a proposition that made me very nervous. Who had I just unleashed on the innocent collector?Presently, a guest \u2014 someone I hadn\u2019t invited \u2014 was introduced to me as a \u201clifestyle expert.\u201d I caught her tweeting images of the pond outside my apartment, the sight of which I held beloved and private. \u201cYou could be anywhere!\u201d the lifestyle expert said, as if this was a compliment. \u201cYou know, the minimal d\u00e9cor of your apartment makes me feel like I\u2019m back in New York!\u201d I suppose she could not see the slum bordering the pond \u2014 70 percent of Mumbai lives in slums \u2014 for the smog outside the window was industrial strength. Indeed, her Instagram filter made the pond, the slum and the hills in the backdrop appear like an impressionist painting: From a distance, this country was awfully pretty.At various points during the brunch, guests at my studio had expressed moral outrage against the various scams afflicting modern India, the scale of which ran like a parallel economy. This lot of middle and upper-middle class Indians railed against our political classes and their corruption. As a cozy counterpoint, there was fiery talk about supporting Arvind Kejriwal, an anti-corruption activist whose political affiliation, the Aam Aadmi Party (the Common People\u2019s Party), had dominated the 2013 polls in Delhi.But such drawing-room rage and social media moralizing registered in me with great suspicion. Our middle classes \u2014 originally pegged, in 2007, at 250 million strong, but recently revised to reflect reality down to around 70 million \u2014 and especially our elite were probably guilty of the same kind of dodgy brokering that they publicly reviled. The wheeling, the dealing, the fooling, the fabricating \u2014 it was all on at my brunch, but at a modest farmers\u2019-market scale, and veiled in new India\u2019s urbane cool.So why was this lot shocked, even surprised, by our epic scams? In a sense, the government officials who extorted big bribes, or the sleazy politicians caught watching porn in Parliament, were only their peers, but with one key difference: Their trade magnificently dwarfed the minor-league operators at my brunch.Still, I nursed no moral superiority. This party, and others like them, had happened in my own home, after all, both in the small, contained sense of my residence, and the larger, expansive sense of the country I lived in. What I indicted, indicted me.It was only last November, when the magazine editor Tarun Tejpal was charged with sexually assaulting a young colleague, that the revulsion and disbelief I\u2019d nursed in quiet fermented into sadness. Mr. Tejpal had founded Tehelka, a left-leaning magazine that covered the hot-button topics that guests at my studio animatedly debated, including an impassioned cover story on Jyoti Singh Pandey, the young woman gang-raped outside Delhi in December 2012. Mr. Tejpal, once the Indian intelligentsia\u2019s poster boy of public morality, is now living on rice and daal in a Goan jail. (A court deferred his plea for bail on Tuesday.)The outrage Indians feel in this case has been spurred by the perception that Mr. Tejpal has tried to cover his tracks: He claimed the incident had been consensual. But his strategy was dubious; he had already apologized over email to the woman for his \u201cmisconduct.\u201d Still, he continues proclaiming his innocence. Mr. Tejpal\u2019s defiance made me believe the bug of duplicity I\u2019d encountered in my studio was actually a widespread and deep-rooted malaise in India.After the Sunday brunch, I\u2019d rung my sister to express helplessness about the company I\u2019d begun to keep. I was bored with Mumbai, worn out by people raiding my address book, disillusioned by friendships failing thanks to an institutionalized fraudulence that, quite frankly, everyone at my studio that day was guilty of, and no one knew quite how to repair.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Barons of Broadband", "Date": "2014-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo let me ask two questions about the proposed deal. First, why would we even think about letting it go through? Second, when and why did we stop worrying about monopoly power?The point is that Comcast perfectly fits the old notion of monopolists as robber barons, so-called by analogy with medieval warlords who perched in their castles overlooking the Rhine, extracting tolls from all who passed. The Time Warner deal would in effect let Comcast strengthen its fortifications, which has to be a bad idea.And there are good reasons to believe that this isn\u2019t a story about just telecommunications, that monopoly power has become a significant drag on the U.S. economy as a whole.At first, arguments against policing monopoly power pointed to the alleged benefits of mergers in terms of economic efficiency. Later, it became common to assert that the world had changed in ways that made all those old-fashioned concerns about monopoly irrelevant. Aren\u2019t we living in an era of global competition? Doesn\u2019t the creative destruction of new technology constantly tear down old industry giants and create new ones?The truth, however, is that many goods and especially services aren\u2019t subject to international competition: New Jersey families can\u2019t subscribe to Korean broadband. Meanwhile, creative destruction has been oversold: Microsoft may be an empire in decline, but it\u2019s still enormously profitable thanks to the monopoly position it established decades ago.Moreover, there\u2019s good reason to believe that monopoly is itself a barrier to innovation. Ms. Crawford argues persuasively that the unchecked power of telecom giants has removed incentives for progress: why upgrade your network or provide better services when your customers have nowhere to go?It\u2019s time, in other words, to go back to worrying about monopoly power, which we should have been doing all along. And the first step on the road back from our grand detour on this issue is obvious: Say no to Comcast.An earlier version of this column misstated the target of a deal announced by Comcast. It plans to acquire Time Warner Cable (not Time Warner, from which Time Warner Cable was spun off in 2009).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taking Aim at Android, After a Jilting at Nokia", "Date": "2014-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHELSINKI, Finland \u2014 Marc Dillon still remembers the sick feeling that overcame him when Nokia announced it was scrapping a software project that he and hundreds of other developers had spent years creating.It was early 2011, and Nokia, the Finnish cellphone giant, was struggling to compete with the sudden rise of Apple and Samsung in the global smartphone market. In response, Nokia\u2019s chief executive, Stephen Elop, ended the company\u2019s plans for its own operating system and joined with Microsoft to focus on building Windows-based phones.\u201cI almost threw up when I heard the news,\u201d said Mr. Dillon, an American engineer living in Finland, who was laid off after the company\u2019s strategy shift. \u201cNokia did a lot of great things for a long time. We didn\u2019t want to see this part of the story end.\u201dSo Mr. Dillon and three other former Nokia executives took it upon themselves to prove their onetime bosses wrong.Over the last three years, with the help of around $20 million in outside investment, they have built Jolla, a 100-employee company of mostly former Nokia engineers, to develop the operating system that Nokia discarded. Their goal is to compete with Android, Google\u2019s dominant mobile software. Late last year, they finished the first part of the effort, releasing a smartphone powered by its open-source software, Sailfish.The ambitions for Jolla \u2014 Finnish for dinghy \u2014 are twofold.By releasing its custom-built handset, the company wants to demonstrate a demand for the device by pitching it to consumers, primarily in Western markets, eager to try the latest gadget.Though it is still a small player in the global smartphone market, Jolla\u2019s long-term hopes are pinned on talking up its Sailfish software to other cellphone manufacturers, which the Finnish company hopes will lead to licensing agreements.\u201cThe phone shows the world that we can make a product,\u201d said Sami Pienimaki, another Jolla co-founder, at the company\u2019s development office in Tampere, a two-hour train ride north of Helsinki, Finland\u2019s capital. \u201cBut the operating system is where the true value lies.\u201dTo other phone makers, particularly those selling phones in fast-growing markets like China, the pitch is simple: We\u2019ll help you stand out from the crowd.\u201cEveryone is looking for alternatives because few manufacturers are making money from Android,\u201d said Stefano Mosconi, Jolla\u2019s Italian co-founder and chief technology officer, at the company\u2019s offices in central Helsinki, which previously housed a Nokia research lab. \u201cWe know we can\u2019t ship 200 million handsets overnight. But phone makers need something new, and we can offer that.\u201dDespite Jolla\u2019s ambitious plans, it faces an uphill challenge. The global smartphone market has become a duopoly of Google\u2019s Android and Apple\u2019s iOS, which represented almost 95 percent of the one billion handsets shipped last year, according to the research company Strategy Analytics. And Microsoft, another technology giant, is doubling down on smartphones, putting the final touches on a $7.4 billion deal to buy Nokia\u2019s handset business.Several other software makers are also trying to compete for a piece of global smartphone sales. They include Mozilla, the nonprofit company behind the Firefox web browser, which has introduced its own software for low-cost phones. Tizen, a rival open-source operating system backed by Samsung and Intel, is expected to introduce the first handsets powered by its new software this year.\u201cIt will be very tough for these operating systems to compete,\u201d said Roberta Cozza, a research director at the analysis company Gartner in London. \u201cThey have to offer a level of smartphone apps that users have come to expect, and most just don\u2019t have that.\u201dConfronted with stiff competition, Jolla is facing some of these challenges head-on. The company has opened its own app store for developers, but its software also allows customers to run popular Android programs like WhatsApp and Twitter.That arrangement includes a partnership with the Russian web giant Yandex, which gives Jolla users access to its app store with more than 80,000 Android programs. Jolla, however, has yet to reach a similar deal with Google\u2019s larger Play store.\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have access to Android, no one would have bought our device,\u201d said Mr. Mosconi of Jolla. \u201cWe can show people they can use the same apps available on other phones.\u201dMuch like its more established rivals, Jolla is aiming its software at consumers in developing economies who are only now upgrading from their cheap handsets to more sophisticated devices. Markets like China and India are expected to report double-digit growth in smartphone sales this year, mostly from low-cost Android devices.But analysts say local operators like China Mobile are looking for ways to differentiate their handsets and services from those of their rivals. The use of new operating systems may help to attract customers who have yet to become accustomed to Android or iOS.Jolla\u2019s software experience is markedly different from those of its bigger rivals.The Jolla phone is designed for swiping across the screen to move between apps; the operating system does not use a home button for navigation. Drop-down menus in each program offer short cuts to popular functions like sending a text message or checking email.And open programs \u2014 displayed as mini-icons on the home screen \u2014 update automatically. That allows users to change songs on the handset\u2019s music player or find a contact\u2019s phone number without opening the app itself. The phones also have technology built into interchangeable rear covers that will alter software features.\u201cThe biggest market for us is China,\u201d said Mr. Pienimaki, adding that Jolla expects to start licensing its operating system and selling its handsets there by the second quarter of the year.\u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity for a new product-based simple Finnish design.\u201dIn Western markets, the company is pursuing deals with supermarkets and other brands that want to reach mobile customers through more than a downloadable app.For the typically stoic Finns, Jolla offers a possibility to regain some pride, since the country is about to lose control of Nokia\u2019s once-proud handset business to Microsoft.While the cellphone start-up has sold fewer than 100,000 handsets worldwide since the model was released late last year, many in Helsinki\u2019s technology community say Jolla\u2019s operating system and device, which retails for around $550, show that Finland\u2019s telecommunications industry can still compete on a global stage.When Jolla started selling its phones in November, for instance, a line of expectant customers snaked around the company\u2019s pop-up store in central Helsinki despite freezing temperatures.And Peter Vesterbacka, part of the management team at the Finnish game maker Rovio, has proudly showed off his Jolla handset complete with a bespoke Angry Birds case. Angry Birds is a Rovio game.\u201cA lot of people want them to succeed,\u201d said Pekka Koponen, a former Nokia executive who now runs a technology advisory firm in Helsinki. \u201cI want to believe there\u2019s still innovation left in Finland.\u201dAn earlier version of an online summary of this article misstated the relationship of Intel and Mozilla to a new smartphone using open-source software that was built by former employees of Nokia. The two companies are running rival efforts; they did not help finance the Finnish group\u2019s effort.Advertisement"}

Arvizu, the chief executive of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the chairman of the National Science Board. \u201cEmerging economies understand the role science and innovation play in the global marketplace and in economic competitiveness and have increasingly placed a priority on building their capacity in science and technology,\u201d he said.The biennial report from the National Science Board \u2014 which governs the federally funded National Science Foundation and advises the White House and Congress \u2014 shows the heady rise of newly industrializing nations in Asia more than it does stagnation or decline in the United States.The United States remains the single biggest investor in research and development, spending about $429 billion a year, compared to $208 billion for China and $147 billion for Japan.But the share of annual global research spending in the United States has declined sharply, to 30 percent in 2011 from 37 percent a decade before. For Europe, the decline was to 22 percent from 26 percent.At the same time, the share of research done by Asian countries grew to 34 percent from 25 percent, with China\u2019s share alone growing to 15 percent from 2 percent in 2000.As a result, the Asian economies now perform a larger share of global research and development than the United States does. China carries out about as much high-tech manufacturing as the United States does, the report found.But the report also highlights some important market sectors where the United States appears to be falling behind. For instance, emerging economies invested about $100 billion in clean energy in 2012, with China alone investing more than $60 billion. The United States spent only $29 billion.More worryingly, the report finds that the United States might be lagging in the research and development spending that scientists say is the most important fuel for future innovation.Moreover, many countries spend larger and faster-growing proportions of their economic output on research.\u201cThe United States remains the world\u2019s leader in science and technology,\u201d said Ray M. Bowen of the National Science Board. \u201cBut there are numerous indicators showing how rapidly the world is changing and how other nations are challenging our predominance. As other countries focus on increasing their innovation capacities, we can ill afford to stand still.\u201dThe report found that United States research took a hit from the recession, with businesses cutting back sharply during the downturn, though the federal government\u2019s stimulus did buffer the effects. But it did not analyze the effects of the sharp, long-term budget cuts known as \u201csequestration.\u201d Congress eased some of those budget cuts in a recent bipartisan deal.But uncertainty and concern about cutbacks remain for the National Institutes of Health and other major research facilities. That has led to widespread worries about brain drain from industries that rely heavily on federal funding, especially biomedical research.About one in five said they were considering leaving the country for the benefit of their careers.The new spending deal \u201cfalls short of restoring funding for lifesaving National Institutes of Health biomedical research,\u201d said Carrie D. Wolinetz, the head of United for Medical Research, an advocacy group.The package, she said, \u201cwon\u2019t adequately reverse the damage done by last year\u2019s budget sequester and ensure the nation\u2019s biomedical research enterprise makes continued progress in lifesaving research and development.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Hardship Hurts Vodafone\u2019s Sales", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Vodafone reported weak quarterly sales figures on Thursday, confirming that the British cellphone carrier was still suffering from Europe\u2019s financial problems.The company said its service revenue, when adjusted for foreign exchange movements and other one-time charges, fell 4.8 percent to 9.9 billion pounds, or roughly $16.1 billion, in the last three months of 2013, compared with the same period a year earlier. Service revenue refers to sales from voice, data and messaging services.The financial update did not include a report on Vodafone\u2019s profit, though the company said it still expected to generate operating profit of \u00a35 billion for its full year, which ends in March.Vodafone, which is expected to complete the $130 billion sale of its 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless later this month, said its European operations continued to struggle as a result of the Continent\u2019s economic woes, particularly in southern Europe, where countries like Spain are grappling with double-digit unemployment.In contrast, Vodafone\u2019s smaller but fast-growing businesses in emerging markets like India reported increases in quarterly revenue, as a rising number of consumers spent more on voice and data packages for their cellphones.\u201cIn Europe, conditions are still difficult,\u201d Vodafone\u2019s chief executive, Vittorio Colao, said in a statement. \u201cOur emerging market businesses are growing strongly, supported by consistent execution and accelerating demand for data.\u201dWhen adjusted for one-time costs and currency changes, Vodafone\u2019s service revenue in Europe fell 9.6 percent, to \u00a36.5 billion, in the last quarter of 2013. The company\u2019s service revenue in emerging economies rose 5.5 percent, to \u00a33.2 billion, over the same period.Vodafone, one of world\u2019s largest cellphone carriers, and its European rivals, like Orange of France, are facing regulatory challenges as policy makers push for increased competition among the Continent\u2019s operators.In Germany, Vodafone\u2019s largest market, the company\u2019s service revenue fell 7.9 percent to \u00a32.1 billion, as competing carriers vied to attract consumers, who are increasingly looking to spend less on their cellphone and cable packages.The British operator agreed last year to buy the German cable company Kabel Deutschland for 7.7 billion euros, or $10.4 billion, to increase its broadband and pay-television offerings to compete with the likes of Deutsche Telekom.Vodafone also is reported to be in talks to acquire the Spanish cable operator ONO in a deal that could be worth around $10 billion.Last month, AT&T, the American telecommunications giant, squashed speculation that it was in talks to buy Vodafone.Despite the weakened performance in the fourth quarter, Vodafone said it expected an increase in its revenues during 2014 as consumers switch to faster \u2014 and more expensive \u2014 high-speed data networks.The British company has announced plans to spend billions of dollars over the next two years to upgrade its infrastructure to so-called fourth-generation networks.The French-American telecommunications firm Alcatel-Lucent is one of the companies that manufacture 4G infrastructure. It reported a \u20ac134 million profit on Thursday for the three months through Dec. 31.That compares with a \u20ac1.4 billion net loss for the same period last year. Alcatel-Lucent is carrying out a restructuring plan that includes cutting an estimated 10,000 jobs from its global work force.As part of that strategy, the company said it had agreed to sell its networking and services business aimed at corporate clients to the Chinese firm China Huaxin for \u20ac268 million. Alcatel-Lucent said it would retain a 15 percent stake in the company and the deal was expected to close in the second quarter.Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s shares had jumped 8.4 percent in afternoon trading in Paris on Thursday, while Vodafone\u2019s stock price had risen 3.1 percent in London.Advertisement"}

Yanukovych appeared finally to surrender, but also in Venezuela, where the batons and tear gas of riot police officers failed to quell anti-government demonstrations, and in Thailand, where the police engaged in bloody efforts to clear sites occupied by protesters since late November.The images of fires and riot police officers pummeling demonstrators contrasted with those from Sochi of swirling skaters and daredevil skiers. But it was not all celebration in the melting snows of the Caucasus, as a few surprise results brought some kvetching not in keeping with the Olympic spirit.Peace in Ukraine, for NowThe three-month occupation of central Kiev that began when Mr. Yanukovych canceled a deal that would have drawn Ukraine closer to the European Union erupted in a paroxysm of violence this past week, taking at least 75 lives and raising fears that the country was headed for civil war. After nightlong negotiations with opposition leaders and three European Union foreign ministers, the embattled Ukrainian president agreed Friday morning to the formation of a coalition government, a reduction in presidential powers and presidential elections no later than December.The agreement was essentially a total surrender by Mr. Yanukovych. But even if the deal does put an end to the violence, huge problems lie ahead.Ukraine remains bitterly divided. It is not certain that the fragmented citizenry, radicalized by rebellion, will follow the opposition leaders. The most experienced, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, is closely allied with the imprisoned former prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko; Vitali Klitschko is a former heavyweight boxing champion who entered politics relatively recently on an anticorruption platform; Oleg Tyagnibok is a fiery ultranationalist who was expelled from his parliamentary faction in 2004 for a speech denouncing \u201cthe Moscow-Jewish mafia ruling Ukraine.\u201dThe ranks of the triumphant opposition may soon be increased by the return of Ms. Tymoshenko. In yet another reflection of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s fall from power, the Ukrainian Parliament voted overwhelmingly to clear the way for the release of his rival from prison, where she has been held since August 2011. Then there\u2019s the Ukrainian economy, which is already in tatters and could be torn to shreds by a vindictive Moscow. President Vladimir V. Putin must be furious that the Ukrainian crisis came to a head during an Olympic production he intended as a showcase of his new Russia; he is probably even more livid at what he perceives as a European victory in the tug of war for Ukraine.Mr. Putin will not take this setback graciously. He will certainly not pay out any more of the $15 billion in aid he promised Ukraine in December. He could also demand higher energy prices and choke off trade.All this poses a challenge for the West. The role of the foreign ministers of Poland, Germany and France in mediating the peace deal is undoubtedly a source of satisfaction for the European Union. But it and the United States will now be under intense pressure to prop up Ukraine\u2019s foundering economy.The Barricades AbroadThe battles in Venezuela and Thailand had different causes and captured fewer headlines, but they followed a similar trajectory of escalating violence.In Venezuela, what began as student protests against a list of festering problems, from rampant crime to shortages of basic goods, has grown into a revolt against a government that under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and even more under his successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has choked off dissent. The protests turned violent in recent days: Four people have been shot dead, dozens wounded and scores arrested. Mr. Maduro\u2019s response has been to crack down even more, expel three United States diplomats and arrest an opposition politician, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez. In Thailand, at least four people were killed when the police tried to reclaim sites in Bangkok occupied by protesters since late last year. The clashes are a continuation of a long-festering power struggle between rural, conservative supporters of the ousted prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, and younger, educated middle-class Thais. Mr. Thaksin has stayed out of Thailand since 2008, but his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is the current prime minister. Anti-Thaksin forces took to the streets in November when Ms. Yingluck proposed an amnesty bill that they thought was an attempt to bring her brother back.Sore Losers in SochiAs the weather in Sochi turned ominously warm, the main Olympic story line was what ABC\u2019s \u201cWide World of Sports\u201d called the \u201cagony of defeat.\u201dThere was the Russian men\u2019s hockey team, which had been charged by no less than President Putin to restore glory to the host country after 22 years without hockey gold. The team seemed invincible, with more N.H.L. stars even than Canada. And yet it was eliminated 3-1 by Finland.The reaction on Russian websites was hot enough to melt what remained of the Caucasus ice, and much of it focused on Coach Zinetula Bilyaletdinov\u2019s failure to turn a batch of superstars into a team. Mr. Bilyaletdinov, it will be recalled, played on the 1980 Soviet team that lost to the United States in the legendary \u201cMiracle on Ice,\u201d so the grilling at the postgame news conference must have been especially painful: \u201cWhat future, if any, do you see for your own work and for your coaching staff? Because, you know, your predecessor was eaten alive after the Olympics...\u201d \u201cWell then, eat me alive right now.\u201dBut then the Russians also enjoyed victory when one of their figure skaters, 17-year-old Angelina Sotnikova, came out of the blue to take the gold from the great Kim Yu-na of South Korea. Ms. Sotnikova seemed as surprised as everyone else, and all the old questions about the arcane and secretive judging of a sport that is also an art were raised again. But Ms. Kim took it graciously.Which cannot be said for fans of the Canadian ice dancing pair Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir. Their second-place finish to the Americans, Meryl Davis and Charlie White, set off a chorus of indignation in the Canadian media. To my utterly untrained eye, the Americans were simply a bit better, but fans of the Canadians did not agree and turned their ire on the coach, Marina Zoueva, who, incredibly, is shared by both pairs. \u201cWe felt like sometimes she wasn\u2019t in our corner,\u201d Mr. Moir said in one interview, a quote that quickly grew into a case against Ms. Zoueva. In something as subjective as figure skating, explained Paul Wylie, the 1992 Olympic silver medalist, a lot has to do with winning the crowd. Figure skaters have to simply \u201clearn to live\u201d with that.Serge Schmemann is a member of the editorial board of The New York Times. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Students Flock to Universities in Northern Cyprus", "Date": "2014-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational EducationThe Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, unilaterally proclaimed on the northern third of the island by its Turkish community three decades ago, is recognized by no country in the world except Turkey. It is diplomatically, politically and economically isolated from the world by international trade sanctions and travel embargoes. Yet thousands of young people from more than 100 countries study at its international universities, making education the leading sector of its economy.Uchechi Owhonda, 26, a management information systems major, shrugged off the inconvenience of the flight embargo, saying that she would make use of the break to study. Ms. Owhonda said she came to Northern Cyprus because frequent strikes at her Nigerian university in Port Harcourt had been hampering her progress. \u201cMy experience here has been awesome,\u201d she said, adding that she now hoped to graduate from her four-year program by the end of her third year, this summer.Northern Cyprus, with a population of 300,000, has nine universities and a 10th is in the works, according to the Higher Education Council, or Yodak, the government body charged with overseeing them.A total of 63,000 students are enrolled in these universities, of whom only 13,000, about 20 percent, are Turkish Cypriots. An additional 35,000 are from Turkey, and 15,000 international students come mainly from countries in Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia.\u201cWe just hit a new record of 110 nations this year,\u201d Yodak\u2019s president, Huseyin Gokcekus, said in an interview in Nicosia last month. After Turkey and Northern Cyprus, Nigeria sends the most students to Northern Cyprus, followed by Iran, Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. The main language of instruction is English, with academic staff members from 60 countries.Students from Turkey are generally placed in Northern Cyprus by the Turkish higher education board, which has integrated the Northern Cypriot colleges into its own roster and assigns students on the basis of a points system that leaves them limited control over where they study. International students, in contrast, come of their own accord, and many have worked hard for it.\u201cI placed among the top three in nationwide exams in Nigeria for a scholarship to come here,\u201d said Sandra Obiora, a business administration major at Cyprus International University, on her way to class under palm trees on an elaborately landscaped campus outside Nicosia.International students interviewed at various campuses said they had come for the quality of the education and for the international experience.\u201cThe system is so much better than back home \u2014 the modern library, the discipline, the study atmosphere, the lecturers,\u201d said Frederick Amodu, 25, another Nigerian, from Abuja. \u201cIf you are interested in learning, you will definitely learn more here in Cyprus.\u201d But like everything else in Northern Cyprus, the universities exist in a political limbo, unresolved since the outbreak of inter-communal violence between Greek and Turkish Cypriots soon after the island\u2019s independence in 1960.The Greek Cypriot government of the Republic of Cyprus, which is in the island\u2019s south and is internationally recognized, asserts that the northern universities are unlawfully operating on territories occupied by the Turkish military and accredited by institutions of an \u201cillegal\u201d state. \u201cConsequently they cannot be accepted by international educational organizations or members of the international community in general,\u201d its Foreign Ministry argues on its website.Northern Cypriot government officials hold that Turkish Cypriots are within their internationally recognized rights in running their own universities.\u201cIn 1960, when the Republic of Cyprus was established between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots jointly, education was left to the communities,\u201d the Turkish Cypriot foreign minister Ozdil Nami said in an interview in Nicosia.The universities of Northern Cyprus are accepted as members by educational organizations like the European Association of Universities and the International Association of Universities, but they are blocked from participation in programs based on intergovernmental agreements, like the Bologna Process or the Erasmus Program.Most important, however, their diplomas and degrees are accepted by most universities around the world, thanks to their accreditation by the higher education board in Turkey, which certifies the Northern Cypriot documents.\u201cWe have no problem with recognition,\u201d Abdullah Y. Oztoprak, rector of Eastern Mediterranean University, said in an interview, pointing to a university newsletter item about an E.M.U. graduate who is now a research associate in bioinformatics at Oxford. \u201cOur students are pursuing their Masters or Ph.D.s at the very best universities of Europe\u201d as well as in the United States, he added.Students who have moved on to other countries confirmed that they had encountered few problems in the transition.\u201cFlagler College accepted all my credits from E.M.U., except math,\u201d Walter Antillon, a Costa Rican, emailed from Florida, where he recently completed a bachelor\u2019s degree in communications. His E.M.U. education had been \u201cmost definitely up to the standards of American universities,\u201d Mr. Antillon added.For many of the students, the universities of Northern Cyprus serve as a stepping stone to higher education in the western world.\u201cPeople use it as a link to other places,\u201d said Richard Alubari, 20, from Nigeria.He that student visas for Western countries were more easily obtainable on the basis of an undergraduate degree from a Northern Cyprus university. Mr. Alubari said he planned to move on to Canada for a master\u2019s degree after completing his bachelor\u2019s at E.M.U. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to get there from here,\u201d he said.The relatively low cost is another factor that attracts international students to Northern Cyprus. Tuition at E.M.U. runs $6,000 to $8,000 a year, with scholarships of 50 percent available to around 3,000 of the 16,000 students there, said Mr. Oztoprak, the rector.At Near East University, Northern Cyprus\u2019s largest university, with 22,000 students, tuition is $3,800 for most schools, while certain fields like medicine can cost as much as $17,500, said Irfan Gunsel, who heads the board of trustees and is son of the university\u2019s founder. The university offers packages that cover tuition at most schools, dormitory accommodation and three meals a day for $6,000 per year.While these rates may be low by international standards, they go a long way toward supporting an economy battered by decades of sanctions.Outside the gates of E.M.U., Famagusta\u2019s streets are lined with copy shops, travel agencies, cafes, exchange bureaus, fast food joints, bars, document translation services and other small service businesses.With students spending not only on tuition but also on food, transport, travel and entertainment, the universities have become the leading sector of the Northern Cypriot economy.The local trade chamber estimates that every student spends an average of $16,000 per year in Northern Cyprus, a sizeable contribution to an economy whose per capita gross domestic product was $15,555 last year, according to its Foreign Ministry.It is welcome revenue in a country that has virtually no other source of income.\u201cWe are not allowed to have direct flights from the rest of the world, we are not allowed to have direct shipping, we have heavy customs duties imposed on our export products,\u201d said Mr. Nami, the foreign minister. \u201cAs a result of this environment, we were forced to find an alternative means of earning revenue.\u201d Mr. Gokcekus, the Yodak president, estimates that education contributes $875 million to the government\u2019s $ 1.6 billion budget.Suat Gunsel, the founder of N.E.U., is on the Forbes list of the world\u2019s billionaires, estimated to be worth $1.1 billion by that magazine last year.Quite a bit of that money goes back into the university, which features a state-of-the-art hospital with advanced medical equipment that is unique to the island, drawing patients from the Greek south. The journalism department has its own television and radio studios, broadcasting 24-hour programs around the island. Sports facilities include an Olympic-size swimming pool.\u201cIn Northern Cyprus we don\u2019t have gold mines or petrol or factories,\u201d said Irfan Gunsel. \u201cWhat we have is education, and we are only as strong as our universities.\u201d Word is getting around, leading to a surge in admissions.At E.M.U. alone, the number of international students has almost quadrupled within the last four years to 5,500 this year. Mr. Oztoprak, the rector, estimates that international students will make up half the university\u2019s enrollment of 16,000 within three or four years.Ali Ahmet, a Sudanese industrial engineering major at E.M.U., said he had followed his brother to Northern Cyprus. \u201cMy brother graduated two years ago and got a job back home right away,\u201d he said. \u201cHis salary is fine, so now he has a wife and they are having a baby.\u201d Ilsat Fakudinov, 17, from Tatarstan in Russia, followed the internet buzz to come here. \u201cI surfed the internet,\u201d he said: \u201cI found this university, read about it in some chat forums and chose it.\u201d Across Northern Cyprus, international enrollment has jumped from 3,500 students in 2008 to 15,000 now, according to Yodak. The total number of students has also surged in that time, from 43,000 to 63,000.\u201cWe can reach 100,000 students within the next 10 years,\u201d Mr. Gokcekus, the Yodak chairman, predicted. \u201cWe will call ourselves University Island.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Study Finds Greater Income Inequality in Nation\u2019s Thriving Cities", "Date": "2014-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 If you want to live in a more equal community, it might mean living in a more moribund economy.That is one of the implications of a new study of local income trends by the Brookings Institution, the Washington research group. It found that inequality is sharply higher in economically vibrant cities like New York and San Francisco than in less dynamic ones like Columbus, Ohio, and Wichita, Kan.\u201cThe truth is, the state of our city, as we find it today, is a tale of two cities, with an inequality gap that fundamentally threatens our future,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said this month, echoing his campaign speeches. \u201cIt must not, and will not, be ignored by your city government.\u201dLocal officials here in Washington and in Boston, New Haven, San Francisco and Seattle have also seized on the issue.But in some cases, higher income inequality might go hand in hand with economic vibrancy, the study found. \u201cThese more equal cities \u2014 they\u2019re not home to the sectors driving economic growth, like technology and finance,\u201d said its author, Alan Berube. \u201cThese are places that are home to sectors like transportation, logistics, warehousing.\u201dHe added, \u201cIn terms of actual per capita income growth, these are not places that would be high up the list.\u201dThat does not mean that measures intended to mitigate inequality will necessarily reduce the vibrancy of a local community. But the study confirms what many others have shown: The country\u2019s big cities tend to have higher income inequality than the country as a whole. For instance, in the 50 biggest American cities in 2012, a high-income household \u2014 which the study measured at the 95th earnings percentile, putting it just into the top 5 percent \u2014 earned about 11 times as much as a low-income household, at the 20th percentile. Nationally, that ratio was 9 to 1.Some places tend to have much more intense income inequality than others. A high-income family might earn 15 or 16 times what a low-income family earns in San Francisco or Boston, compared with earnings multiples of six or eight in places like Virginia Beach or Wichita.Low-inequality cities, the study found, tend to be located in the South and the Midwest. They also tend to be geographically large, encompassing neighborhoods that in many other cities would be considered suburbs. Generally, the average for the top income group in such cities tends to be lower than it is in high-inequality cities \u2014 $150,000 to $200,000 a year, compared with $354,000 in San Francisco and $280,000 in Atlanta.The driving force behind spiraling inequality at a national level is the rich getting richer. But in many cases, the Brookings numbers indicated, poverty is as important a factor at the local level. In Miami, for instance, a household in the bottom 20th income percentile earned just $10,000 a year in 2012.Inequality in the 50 biggest cities grew modestly from 2007 to 2012, the study found. The effect was not primarily because of rapid income growth among the richest families \u2014 generally, earnings for the top 1 percent of the income distribution have not yet surpassed their prerecession peak. Rather, it was because poor families, saddled with debt and high unemployment rates, have suffered through the recession and the recovery.The single biggest increase in inequality over that period occurred in San Francisco, where earnings for the typical low-income household dropped $4,000 and soared $28,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars for a high-income household. But in most other places, inequality intensified because the poor got poorer, including in Cleveland, Sacramento, Tucson and Fresno, Calif.\u201cHigh-income households did not lose much ground during the recession,\u201d Mr. Berube of Brookings said. \u201cLow-income households lost ground and haven\u2019t gained it back. And the pressures around cost of living are higher at the low end than they are at the high end.\u201dResearchers say local inequality trends are related to national inequality trends, but are not the same. Any individual city\u2019s earnings ratios might be more defined by who can afford to and wants to live there \u2014 whether a family of relatively low-skilled new immigrants, or a computer programmer in high demand or a financier from abroad \u2014 than by tidal economic trends like unionization and technological change.But New York and many other cities have promised to tackle inequality, in part by shifting the tax burden, but also through initiatives aimed at attracting middle-class families with cheaper housing and better schools.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Italian Premier, in First Speech, Outlines Early Priorities for His Tenure", "Date": "2014-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Renzi, 39, the youngest prime minister in Italy\u2019s history, spoke for roughly an hour before the Senate, where his new government won a confidence vote early Tuesday. A second confidence vote is scheduled for Tuesday in the lower house, where Mr. Renzi\u2019s Democratic Party holds a comfortable majority and passage is considered a certainty.For Mr. Renzi, the former mayor of Florence who was sworn in Saturday after forcing out a sitting prime minister from his own party, Monday\u2019s speech was his first formal presentation of his early priorities. It also provided a taste of his jaunty, confident style. He seemed to relish verbally jousting with lawmakers of the opposition Five Star Movement and gave no hint of being awed by a chamber in which he has never served.\u201cOur country is rusty, bogged down,\u201d he said, \u201cimmobilized by an asphyxiating bureaucracy, by rules, norms and codicils that paradoxically don\u2019t eliminate illegality.\u201d He argued that the desires and ambitions of ordinary Italians had surpassed the performance of Parliament. \u201cIt is ahead of us, and it is up to us to catch up,\u201d he added.Focusing foremost on the economy, Mr. Renzi outlined four immediate priorities: repayment of unpaid government debts to private firms by using a state investment and loan fund; support for small and medium enterprises squeezed by the credit crunch; reductions in income and labor taxes; and a comprehensive overhaul of the justice system, including changes to make doing business easier.He also pushed for passage of a sweeping electoral overhaul package that he has already brokered with Silvio Berlusconi, the leader of Forza Italia, an opposition party, and a former prime minister. That package would change Italy\u2019s complex voting system to favor bigger parties and coalitions and better produce working parliamentary majorities. Mr. Renzi is also pushing to amend the Constitution to drastically reduce the powers of the Senate so that lawmaking authority is concentrated in the lower house.\u201cI\u2019d like to be the last prime minister to ask this chamber for a vote of confidence,\u201d he said.Perhaps that goal is one reason the assembled senators only occasionally broke into meaningful applause. Marco Damilano, a political commentator for the weekly magazine L\u2019Espresso, said that Mr. Renzi deliberately emphasized his role as an outsider to the political circles of Rome and that the radical changes he promised were the same things he has been talking about when he politicked nationally as mayor of Florence.\u201cHe acted as the mayor of Italy, but he\u2019s now prime minister in a ring where the rules have remained the same,\u201d Mr. Damilano said during a televised interview, arguing that the blas\u00e9 reception to the speech by many senators portended a bumpy ride.\u201cThey listened with a certain slyness: Sure, you can come and make all the promises you want, but you still have to pass through us,\u201d he said.Analysts say Mr. Renzi is likely to face difficulties in achieving every one of his goals, including his plans to rein in the entrenched managers of Italy\u2019s public administration. \u201cHe will face a significant opposition, by trade unions to begin with,\u201d said Stefano Manzocchi, professor of international economics at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. \u201cBut if he starts at the top levels, he\u2019d have a lot of popular support.\u201dMr. Renzi has been regarded as a rising star in Italian politics, especially after he was elected leader of the Democratic Party in a nationwide primary last December. But his ascension to prime minister came rapidly and unexpectedly, amid growing frustrations over the inability of the previous prime minister, Enrico Letta, and his coalition government to approve major overhauls.This month, Mr. Renzi called an emergency meeting of the Democratic Party, in which members voted to remove Mr. Letta, a party member, and replace him with Mr. Renzi. He must now push through his ambitious agenda with the same fractious coalition of left and right parties that at times stymied Mr. Letta.Mr. Renzi, a skilled communicator comfortable with social media and attuned to the power of television, has cast himself as a symbol of generational change in Italy. Last weekend, he named a 16-person cabinet evenly divided between men and women \u2014 a first in Italy \u2014 with an average age of 47. The youngest cabinet members, Maria Elena Boschi and Marianna Madia, are both 33.In his speech, Mr. Renzi cautioned that Italy\u2019s economic malaise is dragging down the country\u2019s younger generation \u201cwho can\u2019t afford to go out for pizza.\u201d He said gross national product had dropped sharply since 2008 while youth unemployment had nearly doubled to 41.6 percent.\u201cThese are the numbers of a crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the numbers of a collapse.\u201dHe also said that the country had an opportunity to send a signal to the rest of Europe, assuming Parliament can pass major overhauls before Italy assumes its rotational turn holding the presidency of the European Union in June. \u201cWe won\u2019t be credible if we aren\u2019t able to arrive at the European semester without sorting out the things we have to sort out,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Christie\u2019s Budget Proposes Sacrifices but No Big Solution to Labor Costs", "Date": "2014-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTRENTON \u2014 A diminished Gov. Chris Christie sought to reclaim the mantle of fiscal sobriety that helped catapult him to Republican stardom, releasing a budget on Tuesday that called for new sacrifices from public employees, offered a painful payment to New Jersey\u2019s indebted pension system and abandoned his cherished plan to cut the state income tax.In a speech that seemed to reach for an audience well beyond New Jersey, Mr. Christie described a national crisis of unfunded financial commitments for the health care and retirement of government workers from Michigan to California.\u201cThat is unacceptable conduct by people who like to call themselves leaders,\u201d he said.The governor warned legislators, who sat just feet from him in the State Assembly chamber, that without further action, \u201cwe are in danger of having these costs overwhelm our budget, monopolize our resources and threaten our ability to continue to fund the priorities that our citizens care about most.\u201dBut despite his emphatic tone and impassioned message, Mr. Christie offered no specific plans to reduce the state\u2019s long-term labor benefits, and Democrats vowed to block his path. Mr. Christie\u2019s speech, arriving at a low point in his governorship, appeared to betray the raw frustrations and new realities of a leader who has fewer available dollars and far less political good will than he envisioned for his second term. Time and again, he emphasized the constraints that his government faces.Joseph Seneca, a professor of economics at Rutgers University, called it \u201ca different genre of speech\u201d from Mr. Christie: \u201cIt laid out the problems but none of the big ideas and big solutions of past years.\u201dThe proposal emphasized Mr. Christie\u2019s signature issues, laying aside $159 million for higher education, 8 percent more than last year, and an increase of $600 million in what he called \u201ctax relief\u201d for businesses. But while he had hoped to cut income taxes, the best he could do in his budget plan was trumpet a fifth year of \u201cno new taxes.\u201d Over all, the $34.4 billion budget proposal represents a 3.5 percent increase in spending over the current year, much of it devoted to the state\u2019s staggering labor costs. If passed, it would be the largest budget in New Jersey history, which could complicate his message of financial restraint.In a way, the governor is a victim of his own success at tackling the state\u2019s financial troubles.It was Mr. Christie, working with Democratic lawmakers, who struck an unusual deal in 2011 to start paying down his state\u2019s giant pension debt, a problem long ignored by his predecessors. Next year alone, the Christie administration will make a $2.25 billion payment toward the system, roughly as much as the last five governors contributed over a 20-year period. The system still requires a $52 billion infusion. The 2011 pension deal earned Mr. Christie a reputation as a financial manager unafraid to confront politically toxic topics. But it has given him little room to maneuver within the budget.Mr. Christie lamented that 94 percent of the new spending was devoted to pensions, health care and the debts associated with them, a level he predicted would persist for years.\u201cAll of you have great ideas of what to do to make New Jersey stronger and more competitive \u2014 I do, too,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we do not get this tiger by the tail, none of it will happen.\u201dDemocrats, who parsed the speech to mean that Mr. Christie would soon call for bigger cuts in worker benefits, ruled out a wide range of changes to pension and health care plans.The State Senate president, Stephen M. Sweeney, who defied fellow Democrats when he struck the deal with Mr. Christie to lower the state\u2019s pension debts, said the governor needed to look elsewhere for savings.\u201cWe already did this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not going back to it.\u201dA procession of Democratic leaders, seemingly energized by Mr. Christie\u2019s political troubles over lane closings at the George Washington Bridge, sought to lay blame for lingering problems with the state\u2019s finances at his feet.The state\u2019s economy is in the midst of a relatively tepid recovery, its debt levels are among the highest in the nation, and its revenues are below projections this year by up to $400 million, according to the Legislature. A January report from a think tank at George Mason University ranked New Jersey last in fiscal health, which state Democrats eagerly relayed to the news media. Louis D. Greenwald, the Democratic majority leader in the Assembly, said the focus on pensions and health care \u201csounds to me like a gimmick to move us out of the real crisis, that we have failed to grow our economy.\u201d Mr. Christie seemed to anticipate the reaction. He repeatedly appealed to the bipartisan instincts of the Democratic-controlled Legislature, even invoking a political peacemaker.\u201cGandhi was a visionary,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cAnd while you wouldn\u2019t think of him as a budget expert, he was right about this, to: If we want a better future tomorrow, we must act today.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italian Premier\u2019s Latest Challenge Comes From His Own Party", "Date": "2014-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisROME \u2014 Like a pi\u00f1ata that has been battered but remains unbroken, Enrico Letta has demonstrated an unexpected resilience as Italy\u2019s prime minister. He took office in April amid predictions that his coalition government would quickly collapse. It did not. Then Silvio Berlusconi, the powerful former prime minister, vowed to bring him down. That did not happen, either.But now Mr. Letta, 47, is again fighting to save his government, and himself, except this time the pressure is coming from the leader of his center-left Democratic Party, the rising star Matteo Renzi. When Mr. Renzi became party leader in a nationwide primary in December, with a mandate to shake up Italy\u2019s ossified politics, his true ambition was presumed to be the prime minister\u2019s office. The only question was when he would make his move.The answer may come as soon as Thursday during an emergency meeting of the Democratic Party. After weeks of public sparring, Mr. Renzi and Mr. Letta met privately on Wednesday for what apparently was an inconclusive discussion about the government\u2019s future. Analysts point to three possible situations: Mr. Letta would step aside to make way for Mr. Renzi; Mr. Letta would remain in office but reshuffle his cabinet to include Renzi allies and push an agenda of broad overhaul; or the government will collapse, and early elections will be called in the spring.\u201cAnything can happen now,\u201d said Roberto D\u2019Alimonte, a political analyst. \u201cIt is on the edge.\u201dBut Mr. Renzi represents a different equation, in which the broader issues of Europe are far less in play. For weeks, Mr. Renzi has openly questioned whether Mr. Letta\u2019s government is too weak to push through changes needed to break Italy out of a two-decade slump. Political stability remains a virtue, but Mr. Renzi has warned that the government\u2019s inaction is becoming a serious liability.\u201cThe problem is a political one \u2014 that is to decide whether this parliamentary term can be one of change,\u201d Mr. Renzi told a gathering of Democratic Party lawmakers this week, according to the Italian news agency Ansa.Election overhaul had languished for years in Parliament, though it gained urgency after Italy\u2019s highest court recently declared much of the law unconstitutional. Italy\u2019s complex voting system has rarely produced workable majorities. Mr. Renzi\u2019s overhaul package is intended to reward bigger parties and strong coalitions with the majorities needed to govern effectively in Parliament. It will be debated in the lower house next week.Though the constitutional changes to the Senate will take more time, analysts say Mr. Renzi could try to quickly push through the electoral overhauls and then, with momentum, call elections to ask for a public mandate to govern. (Publicly, Mr. Renzi has played down this chain of events.) But that strategy could be derailed if deliberations slow in Parliament, which explains the speculation that Mr. Renzi may ask his party to move him into the top job so he can push through the changes.\u201cMost people think this is a risk he shouldn\u2019t take,\u201d said Mr. D\u2019Alimonte, who advised Mr. Renzi on some of the technicalities of the electoral changes. \u201cBut where we might see risks, he might see opportunity.\u201dItaly\u2019s economy needs a jolt. Unemployment is above 12 percent, and the country is suffering through a prolonged recession. Industrial production dropped in December, and business leaders have beseeched politicians to pass changes on labor and tax policy, as well as other measures.\u201cWe are worried that time is passing, and nothing is happening,\u201d said a spokesman for Confindustria, Italy\u2019s leading business association. \u201cWe will follow any government that pushes through measures that will assist Italy to get back to growth.\u201d Mr. Letta has argued that his government is making progress and that it is working to push through critical changes, even as he has acknowledged that his unwieldy coalition has made things difficult. Hours after his Wednesday meeting with Mr. Renzi, Mr. Letta held a televised news conference in which he denied rumors that he might resign. He said his administration would continue to prioritize job creation and other changes, points he said he would present during Thursday\u2019s party meeting.\u201cI am proud of what we have done in 10 months, which is much, given the conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I am sorry that those conditions haven\u2019t allowed us to do all the things that we have wanted to do.\u201dTo some degree, the infighting is typical fare for the Democratic Party, which has a history of factionalism and divisive internal rivalries. But party officials are concerned, especially with European parliamentary elections only two months away.\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of personal ambition, but of politics.\u201dElisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Federal Budget Deficit Falls to Smallest Level Since 2008", "Date": "2014-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Closing the books on a fiscal year in which the federal budget deficit fell more sharply than in any year since the end of World War II, the Treasury Department reported on Thursday that the deficit for 2013 dropped to $680 billion, from about $1.1 trillion the previous year.In nominal terms, that is the smallest deficit since 2008, and signals the end of a five-year stretch beginning with the onset of the recession when the country\u2019s fiscal gap came in at more than $1 trillion each year. As a share of the nation\u2019s economy, the budget deficit fell to about 4.1 percent, from a high of more than 10 percent during the depths of the Great Recession.The report comes days before the White House is scheduled to release a new budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 that avoids cuts in spending and focuses on ways to help spur the still-tepid recovery through additional government investment. Republicans, insisting that the budget deficit remains too large, have long said that President Obama has proved a poor steward of the economy, overseeing a period of sluggish growth and rising debt.But with Congress having agreed to a bipartisan budget deal last year \u2014 and with midterm elections looming in the autumn \u2014 the fiscal battles that have consumed Washington for the last three years have gone from a boil to a simmer.Growth in tax revenue from an improving economy accounted for much of the decline in the deficit. But increases in taxes and cuts in federal spending played a significant role, as did a surprising \u2014 and surprisingly long \u2014 slowdown in the pace of health spending.The numbers closely track those previously released by the White House budget office and the Treasury itself. The Treasury said revenue climbed $324 billion, to $2.8 trillion, from 2012 to 2013. That is growth of around 12.9 percent, reflecting both higher income tax rates and the strengthening economy. A year ago, the top marginal tax rate increased to 39.6 percent, from 35 percent. At the same time, a payroll tax holiday expired, bolstering government receipts.Over the same period, total government spending barely grew, rising to $3.9 trillion, from $3.8 trillion a year earlier, the Treasury said. (Federal budget outlays \u2014 the number most often cited as annual spending \u2014 were about $3.5 trillion in both years. The Treasury included a fuller accounting in this analysis, including costs incurred but not paid out.) \u201cThanks to the tenacity of the American people and the determination of the private sector we are moving in the right direction,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said in the report. \u201cThe United States has recovered faster than any other advanced economy, and our deficit today is less than half of what it was when President Obama first took office.\u201dOver the last year, outlays fell as a proportion of the economy to 20.8 percent from 22 percent, and receipts grew to 16.7 percent from 15.2 percent, narrowing the gap to 4.1 percent from 6.8 percent. The budget deficit is expected to continue to fall over the next few years, to under 3 percent of economic output. But it is projected to start rising again during the next decade under current policies, as health care spending and the retirement of the baby boomers add to the demands on the government to help finance the needs of an aging population.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Crossing Borders and Changing Lives, Lured by Higher State Minimum Wages", "Date": "2014-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byONTARIO, Ore. \u2014 Carly Lynch dreams of a life one day on the professional rodeo circuit, but for now she commutes 20 miles from Idaho to this small city in eastern Oregon to work as a waitress. There are restaurant jobs closer to home, but she is willing to drive the extra miles for a simple reason: Oregon\u2019s minimum wage is $1.85 higher per hour than Idaho\u2019s.\u201cIt\u2019s a big difference in pay,\u201d said Ms. Lynch, 20, who moved last summer from her parents\u2019 home in Boise, 30 miles farther east, to make her Oregon commute more bearable. \u201cI can actually put some in the bank.\u201dMs. Lynch is one of the many minimum-wage migrants who travel from homes in Idaho, where the rate is $7.25, to work in Oregon, where it is the second highest in the country, $9.10. Similar migrations unfold every day in other parts of Idaho \u2014 at the border with Washington, which has the highest state minimum, $9.32, and into Nevada, where the minimum rate tops out at $8.25.Their experiences underscore what many proponents of raising the wage assert: that even seemingly small increases in pay can galvanize people\u2019s lives, allowing workers to quit second jobs, buy cars or take vacations.And while some business owners along the border said raising the minimum wage could keep them from adding extra employees, they also said larger economic forces were more important. For example, minimum-wage service jobs in stores, restaurants and motels have boomed on the Oregon side, despite its higher rate, mostly because Oregon has no sales tax.The competition for workers has in turn forced many businesses on the Idaho side to raise their wages. \u201cI have to offer more to my employees to keep them,\u201d said Steven Lindsay, owner of Main Street Automotive, a repair shop in Payette, Idaho, six miles from Ontario. \u201cPeople are going to go to where the money is. You can\u2019t blame \u2019em. They have to make a living.\u201dBut opponents of raising the minimum wage can also point to evidence here of negative, or uneven, consequences. When wages go up, they say, prices do as well. And a question resonates here no matter what side you are on: Can any region dependent on the minimum wage ever fully prosper?Todd Heinz, who owns three coffee shops called Jolts and Juice with his wife, Vicki \u2014 two on the Oregon side, one in Idaho \u2014 likened the result to a treadmill when Oregon\u2019s wage went up Jan. 1 by 15 cents under an automatic system linked to the cost of living. (Oregon is one of 10 states that link their minimum wage to the Consumer Price Index.) After raising the pay for his 24 employees, he raised the prices for coffee, smoothies and beer to compensate.\u201cIt feels like a wash,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not the consumer that wins, because most businesses will pass their increase on to the consumer through higher prices. The business doesn\u2019t win, because they are forced to increase their prices to maintain proper margins to keep their doors open, thus affecting current customers and the potential of loss of new business. The employee doesn\u2019t win, because they are the consumer.\u201dMs. Lynch\u2019s story illustrates some of the competing narratives of the minimum wage debate. When she took her Oregon job last year, at an Irish-themed restaurant and bar called Mackey\u2019s, she got more hours at higher pay, allowing her to compete in more barrel racing events, her rodeo specialty. Two months ago, she even bought a second horse, a gelding paint named Blue Duck.But Mackey\u2019s owners also told her that she would have to work harder than before for that money. Higher labor costs meant getting rid of the dishwasher, for one thing, said Angena Grove, who owns the restaurant with her husband, Shawn. And whereas Ms. Lynch covered three tables at a time in her old Idaho job, Mackey\u2019s waitresses, with the owners helping out, cover five.\u201cYou work for the money,\u201d Ms. Lynch said.Jackie Heintzelman, 32, a bartender and server at the Little Palomino, another restaurant and bar in Ontario, also commutes from Idaho. She said the higher Oregon wages, and additional hours, had improved her life, allowing her to quit a second job cleaning houses during the day and to pay her bills on time.\u201cEverything is paid for, and that is a luxury in itself,\u201d Ms. Heintzelman said. She said she even managed to take a recent weekend trip with her boyfriend.Many low-wage workers in this region said that what mattered as much as, and sometimes more than, the actual wage was the number of hours worked. Angela Lowry, 41 and a single mother, recently landed a full-time minimum-wage job in a thrift store in Ontario, and said she was thrilled to have it. She will get a paid vacation for the first time in years, she said.But the job has trade-offs. As Ms. Lowry\u2019s income surges toward $18,000 a year, from about $10,000 at her previous part-time minimum-wage job at Kmart, the government assistance she receives \u2014 helping her pay for food, rent and after-school day care for her 7-year-old son, Darian \u2014 will all go down.\u201cYou make a little more, they take a little more away,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I understand that \u2014 it\u2019s got to be fair.\u201d She added, \u201cI am really fortunate and blessed.\u201dRegardless of the differences in the minimum wage, poverty rates have remained high for many years on both sides of the border. In Malheur County, which surrounds Ontario, 24.5 percent of the population lived in poverty in 2011, according to the most recent federal figures, up from about 19 percent in the late 1990s. In Payette County, Idaho, the poverty rate rose to 19 percent in 2011 from about 13 percent in 1999. A family of four earning about $24,000 or less is considered impoverished under federal standards.On both sides of the border, few question that life at the minimum wage is hard.Darin Hill, 39, has been a minimum-wage worker for 19 years on a farm and feed lot outside Ontario, supporting his wife, Cathy, and their two children on about $300 a week. He often gets lots of hours, sometimes 60 or more per week, and that helps, he said. So does the fact that his wife raises pigs. But the trick to getting by, he said, is learning to simplify one\u2019s needs and desires.\u201cYou can\u2019t have a lot of \u2018I wants,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Thai Police Clear Areas of Protesters as Their Numbers Ebb", "Date": "2014-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHundreds of Thai police officers on Friday began reclaiming intersections in Bangkok that a dwindling protest movement seized several weeks ago.The police cleared barriers that have blocked access to ministries and stopped the government from fully functioning and vowed to clear away a faction of protesters in front of a large government complex.Chalerm Ubumrung, a government minister overseeing security, said Thursday that the leader of the protests, Suthep Thaugsuban was \u201calmost finished\u201d and \u201cnearly destroyed.\u201dProtesters have failed to \u201cshut down\u201d Bangkok as they vowed last month, but a hard core of protesters number in the thousands and remain defiant.On Thursday, a Thai court ordered the release from detention of a prominent leader of the protest movement, a case that highlights the movement\u2019s influential backing.Sonthiyarn Chuenruethai-naitham, who has been described by the Thai media as an adviser to the Crown Property Bureau, the agency that manages the huge royal fortune, was arrested by the police on Monday for his role in organizing the protests.He was described by Tharit Pengdit, the secretary general of Thailand\u2019s Department of Special Investigation, as the \u201csecond-most important\u201d person in the protest movement.The court ruled Thursday that Mr. Sonthiyan should be released because the authorities had already obtained sufficient information from him. The government responded that it would continue to detain Mr. Sonthiyan on separate charges of rebellion.During three months of protests against the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, a powerful tycoon living in self-exile, it has never been fully clear who was backing the protest movement. The conflict has divided the country between supporters of the governing party in the north and its detractors in Bangkok and the south.The news media have published a list, which was described as a leak from the authorities, of backers of the protest movement that included a number of major Thai corporations. Mr. Tharit, whose department is the equivalent of the F.B.I., said that some of the names on the list were correct.The government says that Mr. Sonthiyarn was a major financial planner and strategist for the protests and that he could provide further insights into the efforts to overthrow Ms. Yingluck and her allies.\u201cMr. Sonthiyan is the person who contacts those behind the scenes who have not yet clearly been made public,\u201d Mr. Tharit said Monday. Protest leaders have said that the protests cost more than $100,000 a day, including the costs of the giant screens and audio amplification at major intersections that protesters are blocking in Bangkok.Protesters, who are allied with the opposition Democrat Party, blocked hundreds of thousands of people from voting in the general election earlier this month and said their goal was to seize \u201csovereignty.\u201d They are calling for the suspension of electoral democracy and for an appointed government on the grounds that the governing party is corrupt and has abused its majority position in Parliament.The protests have left Thailand, the second-largest economy in Southeast Asia, with an enfeebled government and the prospect of months of deadlock. In districts where protesters blocked voting, elections have been rescheduled for April.Although the number of protesters has gradually diminished in recent days the antigovernment movement has been encouraged by a number of rulings in the courts and state agencies.The anticorruption authorities have prioritized cases against Ms. Yingluck and the governing party, most prominently an investigation into a subsidy policy for rice farmers that has backfired on the government and may cost the country billions of dollars. There appears to be no disagreement on the notion of large-scale subsidies to farmers \u2014 both the opposition and the governing party support subsidies \u2014 but the opposition as well as many independent analysts say the current rice policy has been poorly managed and created wasteful stockpiles of rice.Some rice farmers have joined the antigovernment demonstrations while others have demanded that banks loan the government money to pay for the subsidies.The government, which is restricted in its spending because of its status as caretaker during the election period, says the unusual speed of the investigation into the program shows that it is politically motivated.The country\u2019s Constitutional Court has issued a number of controversial rulings favorable to the opposition in recent months, including a judgment this week that the protest movement, which has shut down a number of government buildings, was not an effort to \u201coverthrow\u201d the country\u2019s democratic system.But the court Wednesday also rejected a petition by the Democrat Party to nullify the election. The Democrats, the country\u2019s oldest party and one that represents the country\u2019s moneyed elite, boycotted the elections and risk being shut out of Parliament if the election is completed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Developer Envisions a Future for Abandoned London Docks", "Date": "2014-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetLONDON \u2014 Known for ambitious plans in China for business parks the size of cities, Xu Weiping says he cannot wait to start work on his first project abroad: turning an abandoned London dock into Europe\u2019s main hub for Chinese companies.\u201cI\u2019m a man with a vision and the ability to turn my dream into reality,\u201d said Mr. Xu, dressed in a yellow-and-white Versace shirt, a black velvet jacket and patent-leather shoes with gold buckles.Mr. Xu last year agreed to invest $1.6 billion to turn London\u2019s derelict Royal Albert Dock back into a vibrant global trading hub. But instead of ships he is betting on Chinese companies that are seeking a foothold in Europe.Mr. Xu said that more than 60 Chinese businesses, many already tenants of his empire in China, have signed up to take space in the development, about nine miles east of London\u2019s city center. Construction on what is planned as 4.5 million square feet of office space, to be done in phases through 2022, could start as soon as this summer.The plan has the backing of Mayor Boris Johnson, who welcomed the investment. Lying untouched since the dock closed in 1981, a hundred years after it was built for ships too big to dock farther up the Thames, the site is one of the largest undeveloped areas in London and has been a major headache for the city.Despite the initial investment, questions remain as to whether the project will succeed. Other plans for the area have failed, and some officials question how many local jobs the Chinese investment will create. Alex Foshay, a partner at the real estate agency Knight Frank in London, said he did not think Mr. Xu would have any problem filling office space. Rising demand from tenants as Britain\u2019s economy recovers, combined with a backlog of planned developments, is pushing up rents and creating a shortage of supply, he said.Standing on the Docklands Light Railway platform at the Royal Albert Dock station, it is hard to imagine that the windswept patches of grass, parking lots and concrete walkways below could one day be a bustling business center with restaurants, residences and a hotel.The area benefits from a large waterfront, an advantage when attracting Chinese companies because of its importance in feng shui, which holds that water can help the flow of energy. It is also a 10-minute train ride to the Canary Wharf financial district.Mr. Xu\u2019s business park is unlikely to face much opposition from neighbors, mainly because there are none. The existing residential developments are separated from the site by a busy highway, and many residents would welcome anything that would bring restaurants and stores to the area.\u201cIt\u2019s wasteland now, so it can only get better,\u201d said Kelly Newsome, who has lived in the area for more than four years. \u201cIf the project will create jobs and inject money into the area, that would be very welcome.\u201dMayor Johnson has said that Mr. Xu\u2019s plan would eventually add 6 billion pounds, or about $10 billion, to the British economy and turn what was once one of \u201cthe throbbing arteries of U.K. trade and commerce\u201d into \u201ca world-class international business district.\u201dMr. Xu said his company, Advanced Business Park, would provide 30 percent of the $1.6 billion investment to construct offices and public and retailing spaces. The rest would come from investors, banks and the presale of office units. The government plans to sell Mr. Xu the 35 acres of the Royal Albert Dock, though the sale price was not disclosed. The development, being in what is now a derelict zone, is eligible for tax advantages.But some of Mr. Johnson\u2019s critics have branded the project the latest example of what they see as his willingness to sell parts of London to the highest bidder too easily. Just west of the Royal Albert Dock, Mr. Johnson struck a sponsorship deal with the airline Emirates for a cable car across the Thames in 2012 and secured funds from Abu Dhabi for the ExCeL London conference center in 2008.The Financial Times reported last year that questions were raised in China about the source of Mr. Xu\u2019s finances for his developments and his links to the Chinese government.In an interview, Mr. Xu dismissed accusations of close government ties and said he made his money designing knitting machines and other appliances before setting up his real estate company.Advanced Business Park owns a business complex in Beijing and has two similar projects under construction. An additional project in Hangzhou Bay, close to Shanghai, is planned to be the size of central London, including a green space the size of Hyde Park.Mr. Xu\u2019s London plan is by far his smallest, but it comes with challenges. The airplanes taking off and landing at London City Airport just across the water interrupt any calm the waterfront might create. The council of the borough of Newham, which is in charge of the area, has imposed strict rules about a timetable for the construction and how many local jobs the project must create. Previous projects for the area, which included a floating village, failed because they fell afoul of local rules and ran short of developer financing.Sitting in his temporary office in the Royal Albert Dock, in a former storage space designed to keep beef shipments from Argentina dry and cool, Mr. Xu seemed unfazed. Speaking through an interpreter, he said he was not worried about Britain\u2019s bureaucratic hoops to gain building permission. \u201cThere is more structure in the U.K. system,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cBut the council of Newham is adapting to our speed.\u201dMr. Xu said his company expected to get planning permission in the coming months and to start construction of the business park this year.Patricia Holland, a member of the Newham council, said Mr. Xu\u2019s planning application was getting a good reception. Newham, a relatively poor borough that has been struggling to reduce unemployment, said it expected the project to create 20,000 jobs and increase employment locally by 30 percent. Some residents have questioned whether the new Chinese neighbors will indeed seek to employ local staff members without Mandarin language skills.But Ms. Holland also said residents were excited that the project would turn into \u201csomething that has more soul because people will care more about it, just like Canary Wharf.\u201dChinese companies that pledged to take offices in the Royal Albert Dock include the Eve Fashion Group, a male fashion brand; the China Water Group, a water and sewage treatment provider; and the Guangyao Oriental Group, a real estate development company.Even if the project goes ahead as planned, such regenerations can take decades to be successful, said Michael Edwards, a senior lecturer at the Bartlett School of Planning of University College London.Canary Wharf\u2019s initial developers went bankrupt in the commercial real estate collapse of the 1990s. It took decades and large sums of government investment to improve transportation links to attract the global businesses that now provide more than 100,000 jobs.Mr. Xu said he was attracted to the Royal Albert Dock because it fit with his company\u2019s strategy of acquiring land just outside major city centers. As cities grow, the properties will eventually become part of them, he said. His hope is that Canary Wharf will eventually expand eastward and link up with the Royal Albert Dock.But he said he was also attracted by the history of the site and the link the docks established between Europe and Asia. The Royal Albert Dock opened in 1880 and included warehouses and granaries that lined the quays, storing imported goods before they were delivered farther into London. The docks survived heavy bombing by the Germans during World War II but succumbed to transportation innovation when merchants started using larger container vessels that no longer entered the docks. The docks finally shut in 1981.A history buff, Mr. Xu said he was seeking to revive the dock\u2019s importance. \u201cIn the 19th century, the docks were an important trading connection between Asia and the U.K., and it made a good contribution to the economy of Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a new, highly educated generation of Chinese people now, and through this generation we can bring together the cultures of the West and East.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slalom for Russia as It Seeks to Invest in North Caucasus", "Date": "2014-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArkhyz JournalARKHYZ, Russia \u2014 Just over the mountains from where Russia\u2019s Olympic dream played out this month to a worldwide audience, Aleksei Grebennikov, a copper miner, glided down the bunny slope of a brand-new ski resort on the Abishira-Akhuba mountain ridge.As he stopped at the base for a cup of black tea, Mr. Grebennikov stood with his back to the concrete frames of buildings that will soon be transformed into hotels and restaurants. They are the modest beginnings of Russia\u2019s next huge-scale investment in this region, a $15 billion project to put a European-style ski area in each of the seven republics of the North Caucasus.The goal, perhaps quixotic, is to lure Russian tourists and foreign investors to a region better known for sheltering Islamic militants than skiers.In its search for a solution to the insurgency, Russia has often used a heavy hand, carrying out almost daily counterterrorism raids and courting strongmen like Ramzan A. Kadyrov in Chechnya to extend its will.But the development of an enormous infrastructure for winter sports, particularly at a time when the popularity of alpine skiing is in decline in much of the world, is a new and risky strategy to use soft power to break the cycle of poverty and violence.Russian officials, however, argue that the time is ripe.\u201cThe stars had to align,\u201d said Sergey V. Vereshchagin, chairman of Northern Caucasus Resorts, in an interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in a Moscow high-rise. \u201cYou need the resources. Decisions need to be made on the very highest levels of the federal government. And you needed a fairly calm situation in the territory.\u201dIt does not hurt that the resort is in Karachayevo-Cherkesiya, one of the safest republics in the North Caucasus.In December, the company opened a small portion of its resort just outside the dilapidated village of Arkhyz as a test site, advertising a bunny slope, a chairlift and a gondola imported from France, along with plans to install another gondola and open seven ski runs next season. A Russian magnate who won a large government contract for the Games in Sochi and will help coordinate preparations for the 2018 World Cup has built two modern, though hardly luxurious, hotels \u2014 called Romantik-1 and Romantik-2 \u2014 along the slopes.Some of the seven trails have already been cut through the evergreens that dot the mountain ridge, but they were closed last month because of light snowfall and exposed rocks. High above the tree line and the drop-off point for the gondola, the top of the mountain ridge beckoned with a thick cover of fresh powder. But it will remain painfully out of reach until, and unless, the second gondola is installed.For now, said Pavel Vedentsov, a 25-year-old transplant from St. Petersburg who manages the mountain staff members and ski patrol, skiers will have to content themselves with a single trail for beginners that closes at 5 p.m.\u201cThere isn\u2019t much to do at night,\u201d Mr. Vedentsov said. The bars have not yet been built.The resort has low prices to attract local residents: A day pass costs $30 and ski equipment rentals are just $14.Asked about the risk of terrorism in the region, Mr. Vereshchagin conceded that it was a concern but said the danger had been exaggerated. In more violent republics like Dagestan and Chechnya, he said, the company would provide transportation from regional airports directly to the resorts.Aleksandr Khloponin, the presidential envoy for the North Caucasus, told the editor of a Russian news site in an interview that Russian tourists were not easily intimidated.\u201cIs it less dangerous in Egypt?\u201d he asked, naming a popular destination for Russian vacationers. \u201cOr in Libya, or on the Moroccan coast? Nothing will scare away one of our tourists.\u201dGregory Shvedov, editor of The Caucasian Knot, a regional online news agency, said in an interview that he was skeptical of the returns Northern Caucasus Resorts would bring to local communities.\u201cIf it is all owned by the state, by huge companies based in Moscow, then I don\u2019t see the benefit in this,\u201d Mr. Shvedov said.He emphasized that increasing minority ownership and integrating small, local businesses into the plan could create thousands of jobs in a new tourism industry. \u201cBut are they doing all of this?\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see it.\u201dNeither, it seems, do residents. While the government money started flowing three years ago, they say they have seen little, if any, trickle-down effect.On a recent day in Arkhyz, just five miles from the resort, women were selling handpicked teas and luminescent honeys flavored with mint and barberry, but customers were few and far between.\u201cJust look how great things here are now,\u201d said Shamshiyat Batasheva, 53, who was offering hand-knit socks for sale. \u201cDoes it seem like people are working?\u201dResidents complained that the workers at the resort had been brought in from outside the region. \u201cWherever that money is going, it isn\u2019t coming to us,\u201d Ms. Batasheva said. \u201cWe can count on that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spain, Land of 10 P.M. Dinners, Asks if It\u2019s Time to Reset Clock", "Date": "2014-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Dipping into a bucket filled with Mahou beers, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez and his friends hunkered down on a recent Wednesday night to watch soccer at Mes\u00f3n Vi\u00f1a, a local bar. At a nearby table a couple were cuddling, oblivious to others, as a waitress brought out potato omelets and other dinner orders. Then the game began. At 10 p.m.Which is not unusual. Even as people in some countries are preparing for bed, the Spanish evening is usually beginning at 10, with dinner often being served and prime-time television shows starting (and not ending until after 1 a.m.). Surveys show that nearly a quarter of Spain\u2019s population is watching television between midnight and 1 a.m. \u201cIt is the Spanish identity, to eat in another time, to sleep in another time,\u201d said Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, 36, who had to get up the next morning for his bank job.Spain still operates on its own clock and rhythms. But now that it is trying to recover from a devastating economic crisis \u2014 in the absence of easy solutions \u2014 a pro-efficiency movement contends that the country can become more productive, more in sync with the rest of Europe, if it adopts a more regular schedule.Yet what might sound logical to many non-Spaniards would represent a fundamental change to Spanish life. For decades, many Spaniards have taken a long midday siesta break for lunch and a nap. Under a new schedule, that would be truncated to an hour or less. Television programs would be scheduled an hour earlier. And the elastic Spanish working day would be replaced by something closer to a 9-to-5 timetable.Underpinning the proposed changes is a recommendation to change time itself by turning back the clocks an hour, which would move Spain out of the time zone that includes France, Germany and Italy. Instead, Spain would join its natural geographical slot with Portugal and Britain in Coordinated Universal Time, the modern successor to Greenwich Mean Time. \u201cWe want to see a more efficient culture,\u201d said Ignacio Buqueras, the most outspoken advocate of changing the Spanish schedule. \u201cSpain has to break the bad habits it has accumulated over the past 40 or 50 years.\u201dFor the moment, Spain\u2019s government is treating the campaign seriously. In September, a parliamentary commission recommended that the government turn back the clocks an hour and introduce a regular eight-hour workday. As yet, the government has not taken any action.A workday abbreviated by siestas is a Spanish clich\u00e9, yet it is not necessarily rooted in reality. Instead, many urban Spaniards complain of a never-ending workday that begins in the morning but is interrupted by a traditional late-morning break and then interrupted again by the midday lunch. If workers return to their desks at 4 p.m. (lunch starts at 2), many people say, they end up working well into the evening, especially if the boss takes a long break and then works late.\u201cThese working hours are not good for families,\u201d said Paula Del Pino, 37, a lawyer and the mother of two children, who said an 8-to-5 workday would ease the pressure. \u201cSpanish society is still old-fashioned. The ones who rule are old-fashioned, and here, they like it like it is.\u201dThe national schedule can be traced to World War II, when the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco moved the clocks forward to align with Nazi Germany, as also happened in neighboring Portugal. After the defeat of Hitler, Portugal returned to Greenwich Mean Time, but Spain did not.At the time, Spain was a largely agrarian nation, and many farmers set their schedules by the sun, not by clocks. Farmers ate lunch and dinner as before, even if the clocks declared it was an hour later. But as Spain industrialized and urbanized, the schedule gradually pushed the country away from the European norm.\u201cPeople got stuck in that time,\u201d said Javier D\u00edaz-Gim\u00e9nez, an economist. \u201cEventually, the clocks took over.\u201dIn the early decades of his rule, Franco ordered radio stations to broadcast reports of news and propaganda twice a day to coincide with mealtimes at about 2:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. Television arrived in the 1950s and followed the same mandate, with daily programming on the lone government channel ending at midnight with the national anthem and a portrait of Franco.\u201cThen everyone would go to bed and procreate,\u201d said Ricardo Vaca, chief executive of Barlovento Communications, a media consultancy in Madrid.By the 1990s, with Spain\u2019s post-Franco transition to democracy underway, television also began evolving. Mr. Vaca said new private networks, eager for profits on popular shows, made programs longer and pushed prime time into the early morning hours. Now, he added, surveys show that 12 million people are still watching television at 1 a.m. in Spain.Changing the prime-time schedule is one of the recommendations bundled together by Mr. Buqueras, president of the Association for the Rationalization of Spanish Working Hours. At his office in Madrid, Mr. Buqueras burst into a conference room and immediately checked his watch.\u201cThank you for being on time!\u201d he declared.Mr. Buqueras argues that changing the Spanish schedule would be a boon to working mothers, allow families more free time together and help Spain\u2019s economic recovery. \u201cIf Spain had a rational timetable, the country would be more productive,\u201d he said.Whether an earlier, more regimented schedule will translate into higher productivity is a matter of dispute. Mr. Buqueras\u2019s group says Spanish workers are on the job longer than German workers but complete only 59 percent of their daily tasks. Measuring productivity is an imprecise science, and while many experts say Spanish productivity is too low, Spain actually outperforms many European countries in some calculations, according to Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistical agency.\u201cThese three-hour siestas don\u2019t exist,\u201d said Carlos Angulo Mart\u00edn, who oversees social analysis at the National Statistics Institute in Madrid. Nor are habits uniform across the country, he said, noting that in the Catalonia region, mealtimes and work schedules are aligned more with those of other European countries.Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngeles Dur\u00e1n, a leading sociologist with the Spanish National Research Council, is skeptical that changing the time zone will reverse low productivity, which she attributes more to the structure of the service-oriented economy and a lag in technology. But she agreed that normalizing the work schedule would help women: She cited a survey she conducted of female lawmakers in Europe, who complained that men deliberately scheduled important meetings in the early evening when women were under pressure to return home.\u201cFor men, this is perfect,\u201d Ms. Dur\u00e1n said. \u201cThey arrive home and the children have already had their baths! Timetables can be used as a sort of weapon.\u201dAt the Mes\u00f3n Vi\u00f1a bar, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez and his friends contemplated the Spanish clock. One friend, Miguel Carbayo, 26, was appalled at the notion of a nap-free lunch. He had worked as an intern in the Netherlands, where his co-workers arrived at 8 and left at 5, with a half-hour to munch on a sandwich for lunch, a regimen he found shocking.\u201cReduce lunchtime?\u201d he said. \u201cNo, I\u2019m completely against that. It is one thing to eat. It is another thing to nourish oneself. Our culture and customs are our way of living.\u201dBut, he admitted, a shorter nap might be acceptable. \u201cThey say 20 minutes is enough to boost productivity,\u201d he said.Patricia Rafael and Brenda Yastremski contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In West Bank Settlements, Israeli Jobs Are Double-Edged Sword", "Date": "2014-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMISHOR ADUMIM INDUSTRIAL ZONE, West Bank \u2014 The personal conflict that thousands of Palestinians face working for Israeli companies in the occupied West Bank is particularly stark for Hassan Jalaita, who for 18 years has repaired Israeli Army jeeps at the Zarfati garage here.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m not a human being \u2014 we are serving the occupation,\u201d said Mr. Jalaita, 47, a father of five, two of them university students. \u201cI am forced to work here because I have a house, I have a family. Tomorrow, if there is another place to work, if there is work in Palestine, I will do it.\u201dUnderlying the dispute is a complicated economic and political landscape of factories and farms that at once entrench the Israeli occupation and help feed the Palestinian families that oppose it. About 25,000 Palestinians work legally for Israelis in the West Bank, many in construction, building the settlements they hope will soon be dismantled.There are 15 other industrial zones like this one in territory Israel seized in the 1967 war. They have about 1,000 plants \u2014 sophisticated aluminum and food manufacturers as well as tiny textile and furniture workshops \u2014 that pump roughly $300 million into the Palestinian economy through salaries and, at the same time, take up vast acreage in what Palestinians see as their future state.\u201cI am not a settlement. I am an industrial area, an industrial area that gives hope for people,\u201d said Yehuda Cohen, the chief executive of Lipski, a plastics plant in the Barkan Industrial Park, 15 miles east of Tel Aviv. \u201cIf there will be any kind of peace agreement, even if they decide this area should be part of the Palestinian country, we should not destroy the industrial areas. We should increase them.\u201dDiana Buttu, a lawyer who has been studying West Bank work conditions, and other boycott supporters acknowledged that the settlement industry provided important economic opportunities for Palestinians even as it challenged their national aspirations. The deeper problem, she said, was that the Palestinian minimum wage was $410 a month, compared with Israel\u2019s $1,217, and most Palestinian workers lacked pensions, vacation days and disability insurance \u2014 factors she and others say are the fault of the Palestinian Authority as well as Israel.\u201cIt\u2019s imperative upon us, the Palestinians, and the international community as well, to make sure there is an alternative where people are working in decent, dignified, humane work,\u201d Ms. Buttu said.Israel opened an industrial zone in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Atarot, which had been Jewish before 1948, shortly after recapturing it along with the rest of the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 war. Mishor Adumim, created in 1976, now has 250 businesses that are a 20-minute drive from the center of Jerusalem. And Barkan was built in 1982, starting a decade-plus boom in which Israel provided financial enticements to move in as part of a push to strengthen the Israeli presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where 540,000 Jews now live.Mishor, Barkan and several other large parks are in so-called settlement blocks that Israeli leaders insist will become part of their state under any peace deal, but others are scattered deeper into the West Bank. Palestinians must be 18 to work in settlements; for jobs inside Israel, they must be 24, married and have at least one child.The Palestinian Authority began boycotting settlement products in late 2009, but stopped short of punishing people who helped produce them. Mohammed Mustafa, the Palestinian deputy prime minister for economic affairs, called the industrial parks part of an exploitative pattern of \u201cbusiness colonization\u201d that has blocked the authority from building a viable economy.He blamed Israeli land confiscation and control of West Bank water for agriculture dropping to 6 percent from 15 percent of the economy over the past decade. Napco, a state-of-the-art aluminum factory in Nablus, he said, has been unable to anodize because Israel blocks the required materials as a security risk.\u201cIf we have our land, if we have our resources, if we have independence, if we have control of our economy, then we will give them opportunities,\u201d Mr. Mustafa said. \u201cYes, they are paying them more, but who wants to be working in a settlement? This is, in a way, even worse than not giving them a job.\u201dThe Palestinian Authority cannot inspect these workplaces, and the Israeli Ministry of Economy has jurisdiction over only minimum-wage violations (a spokeswoman said it opened 10 investigations last year). Assaf Adiv, Maan\u2019s national coordinator, said many workers feared that complaining could jeopardize their coveted work permits.\u201cIt\u2019s a no man\u2019s land, a jungle law,\u201d said Mr. Adiv, whose intervention last summer at Zarfati led to wage increases and other changes. \u201cWhen you are under economic pressure, and you don\u2019t have choices, the employers can force upon you almost anything.\u201d\u201cThese people are fighting against my right to work,\u201d said Rashid Morra, 47, a father of five, who is the head of Lipski\u2019s packing department. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get peace through boycotts. You\u2019re not going to get peace through pressure. You get peace through working together.\u201dIbrahim Odi, 53, of Salfit, a West Bank city, and Vadim Zaslovsky, 49, a Russian-Jewish immigrant who lives near the Tel Aviv airport, have spent the last year working directly across from each other. They make molds and trade jokes; Mr. Odi has taught Mr. Zaslovsky a few words in Arabic.But they have never visited each other\u2019s homes: Mr. Odi lacks the required permit to cross into Israel, and it is illegal for Israelis to enter Salfit.\u201cThere are good people here, a good atmosphere, but after this building, there is a fence,\u201d Mr. Zaslovsky explained. \u201cWe work here, we\u2019re friends here. Not like normal friendship.\u201dAn article on Feb. 11 about a debate over whether Israeli companies operating in West Bank settlements do more to help or hurt the Palestinians they employ referred imprecisely to the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Atarot, where Israel opened an industrial zone after the 1967 war. While the Palestinians and most of the world consider it to be occupied Palestinian territory, Atarot was a Jewish village until 1948, and Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its capital.Irit Pazner Garshowitz and Said Ghazali contributed reporting from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Greater the Turmoil, the Stronger the Dollar. Again.", "Date": "2014-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesChronic problems have been flaring up in financial markets lately, and some of them may emanate from the United States. Yet none of these issues have seriously damaged the exalted status of what Washington Irving once called \u201cthe almighty dollar.\u201dIn fact, a familiar pattern has been emerging: When the world\u2019s financial system runs into trouble, the position of the dollar as the world\u2019s crucial currency becomes more formidable. In a conversation last week, Professor Prasad, formerly the head of the financial studies and China divisions of the International Monetary Fund, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a dollar paradox. You might think that after the global financial crisis \u2014 after the world experienced so much financial turmoil because of U.S. policy actions \u2014 that the dollar would be losing some of its importance. But the truth is the opposite of that. We\u2019re seeing this today as emerging markets run into trouble. It\u2019s just making the dollar stronger.\u201dIt\u2019s not that the dollar is universally viewed as an ideal linchpin for global finance, or that other countries believe that the United States should enjoy the \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d of minting the world\u2019s money. That\u2019s what Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing called it when he was French finance minister in the 1960s. Mr. d\u2019Estaing and Charles de Gaulle, the French president, sought unsuccessfully to reduce the dollar\u2019s clout. The United States, de Gaulle said, was using the dollar to expand American influence, making it cheaper for American companies to operate and for the American government to finance its activities. All of this, he said, amounted to hidden subsidies paid by the rest of the world. Professor Prasad takes the argument further: What we have been seeing lately is that even after a global system centered on the dollar has undergone the greatest stress since the Great Depression, the dollar has become more central in world affairs, not less so. And this happened as America\u2019s fiscal deficit soared, and as the federal government repeatedly flirted with a default of its sovereign debt \u2014 developments that might have reduced the dollar\u2019s international relevance. \u201cThe problem for the rest of the world,\u201d he told me, \u201cis that for safety and for ease of transactions, in many cases, there\u2019s really been nowhere else to go.\u201d Consider some of the issues that have grabbed headlines recently. For starters, turmoil has been erupting in a vast and diverse group of emerging-market nations. Countries like Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine and Venezuela have been struggling with shaky currencies, capital flight and plummeting stock markets. Local issues are at play, of course, and cause and effect is sometimes hard to pinpoint.Nevertheless, when searching for the immediate reasons for their current predicament, it\u2019s hard to exclude the announcements and actions of the Federal Reserve in Washington. In fact, the Fed has been moving markets worldwide for a very long time. After years of flooding the planet with liquidity, it is now ratcheting down its monetary policy. Until it began reversing course late last year, it had been explicitly encouraging investors to put their money into riskier assets, and some of the funds ended up in emerging markets. Now, investors are paring down risk and many emerging-market nations are hurting. In Argentina, while the stock market is up 5.3 percent so far this year in local currency terms, it\u2019s down 20.1 percent in dollars, reflecting the devaluation of the peso. After resisting for months and depleting its foreign exchange reserves, Argentina devalued its currency in order to combat capital flight and to account for some of the effects of rampant inflation. Undoubtedly, it brought some of its problems on itself. But the ebb and flow of global money, heavily influenced by the Fed, has exacerbated them. Investors have responded to global turmoil in a familiar way: by moving money from other currencies and asset classes to the United States dollar and to Treasury securities. Interest rates in the United States have been driven extraordinarily low. Ten-year Treasury yields, which move in the opposite direction as prices, have declined to 2.68 percent, from 3.03 percent on Dec. 31. Rates had been expected to rise because of the Fed\u2019s tighter monetary policies. Flight to safety investing explains at least some of this, and it has helped keep rates relatively low for several years.This \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d has been a mixed blessing for the United States. It has, for example, hurt retirees who rely on fixed-income investments, which are generating very little money. And it\u2019s allowed the government to operate with relatively little fiscal discipline, because foreigners have been ready and able to finance the debt. Still, it has made it easy to fund the federal budget deficit and has helped corporations, small businesses and homeowners who have been able to get loans and mortgages at very low rates. Richard Madigan, the chief investment officer of J.P. Morgan Private Bank, agrees that many of these developments have occurred because of a \u201cglobal dollar trap.\u201d\u201cPeople have moved money into Treasuries and made interest rates on U.S. government debt much lower than they probably ought to be,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s counterintuitive, but even when finances are unsettled in the United States, it\u2019s still the center of the global financial system and it\u2019s where people go for safety.\u201d It\u2019s where they go, even though in some ways the United States is a very odd place to seek financial security. On Friday, after all, the Treasury had to resume its now-familiar routine of taking \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to avoid a sovereign debt default. Yet investors were generally not alarmed. That\u2019s because the Treasury was repeating a frequent pattern of recent years, as Republicans in Congress have refused to raise the statutory limit on the federal debt ceiling in an effort to obtain concessions from the White House. In previous episodes, the ceiling has been raised, debt payments have been made and the dollar has remained strong. Still, this \u201cPerils of Pauline\u201d routine seems an unusual way to ensure the stability of the currency at the global system\u2019s core.Why it continues isn\u2019t simple, but Professor Prasad provides a very useful way of thinking about it. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t pretty, but it\u2019s the best system we have,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at the moment, until there\u2019s something better, the world just seems to be stuck with the dollar.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Way Ahead for Euro Zone Countries", "Date": "2014-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyThe euro zone may be out of the emergency room, but it is still recovering. As often with patients, the question is how to persuade governments to keep to a stiff exercise program, once the immediate danger is over.Germany has an idea. At the summit meeting in December, it got the rest of the zone\u2019s members to agree in principle to what are called \u201cpartnerships for growth, jobs and competitiveness.\u201d The idea is that governments will sign contracts committing them to do things like overhaul their labor markets, open up product markets and improve the efficiency of their public sectors. Countries like Greece and Cyprus, which are already in bailout programs, would not be covered.The snag is that the leaders have not yet been able to agree on what sort of carrot to give countries in return for signing these contracts. They have, though, set an October deadline to reach conclusions.One option would be to dust off an idea that was making the rounds at the peak of the euro crisis two years ago: Get countries with low interest rates to give some of the benefit they get from low-cost money to those with relatively high financing costs.Here\u2019s how such a program \u2014 call it \u201ceuro-rates\u201d \u2014 could work. At the end of each year, the euro zone would work out the average cost of all the bonds issued by participants during that year. There would then be a transfer of cash from those who had borrowed cheaply to those who had borrowed expensively. The transfer would be designed to cut but not eliminate the divergence between different countries\u2019 borrowing costs. The amount of money that low-interest countries, like Germany and France, put into the pot would depend on how cheaply they borrowed and how many bonds they issued. Conversely, the amount of cash that high-interest countries, like Italy and Spain, took out of the pot would depend on how expensively they borrowed, as well as their bond issuance.In the first year, the euro-rates program would cover only bonds issued that year. But in the second year, it would cover bonds issued in that year and the previous year. Each year it would accumulate so that by Year 7, for example, the cash transfer would cover seven years\u2019 worth of bond issuance.Euro-rates would have several attractions. First, there would be an objective way of calculating how much was paid into the pot and how much was taken out, based on countries\u2019 ability to pay. The difficulty of finding an objective mechanism was one of the factors that flummoxed leaders last December.Second, the program would show solidarity between countries without making them liable for each others\u2019 debts \u2014 a problem that has sunk ideas like euro bonds, under which governments would guarantee one another\u2019s borrowings.Third, because euro-rates would operate on a year-by-year basis, with the carrot growing bigger each year, there would be a strong incentive for countries to keep up their overhaul drives. If they did not, donor governments could take away the carrot.Fourth, countries like Germany probably enjoy low rates in part because they are seen as havens. In other words, they benefit from the travails of their neighbors. For example, the yield on Berlin\u2019s 10-year debt is only 1.7 percent, compared with Rome\u2019s 3.7 percent. Giving back part of the benefit would be fair.Fifth, countries in the periphery would get a double boost. Not only would they get money out of the pot each year, but financial investors would be willing to lend them money at a lower rate, knowing that they had signed contracts to overhaul their economies and that more fortunate countries were showing them solidarity.The final advantage is that euro-rates would not be that expensive. Suppose governments agreed to halve the gap in interest rates that countries paid. That would balance the need to show solidarity with the need to maintain some market discipline.Assume, too, that the governments agreed the program would run for seven years. That should be enough for overhauls to bear fruit. Imagine, also, that countries in the periphery were able to borrow money at half a percentage point less than they currently can because of the boost to market confidence.Given these assumptions, the cost of the euro-rates in their first year of operation would be just 1.2 billion euros, or $1.6 billion. Even by Year 7, the annual cost would be only \u20ac8.5 billion.The main beneficiaries would be Italy and Spain. Their cost of funds, after taking into account the subsidy and the market moves, would fall about 0.8 of a percentage point.The main sugar daddy would be Germany. It would contribute about 60 percent of the cost, followed by 18 percent from France and 12 percent from the Netherlands.Euro-rates could be seen as complementary to the European Central Bank\u2019s promise to do whatever it takes to stop the euro falling apart. That pledge led to a drastic convergence in borrowing costs paid by different euro governments. The euro-rates program would lead to a further convergence while encouraging countries to keep up their overhauls. It could be a nice carrot for Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel to dangle in front of Matteo Renzi when she meets Italy\u2019s new prime minister.Advertisement"}

He neither died in a blaze of glory nor managed another daring escape; persistence carried him away.The details of the operation, recounted by American and Mexican officials and witnesses here (most requested anonymity for their own protection) show that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s arrest, after countless near misses and narrow escapes, came down to a tight bond between the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Mexican navy, some well-kept secrets, and a fair amount of luck.Even as security cooperation between Mexico and the United States continued to be hampered by distrust at the highest levels of government, American agents and Mexican marines worked together for weeks, until the moment of capture here when they crashed through the door of a fourth-floor apartment overlooking the Pacific.It began with a meeting a few weeks ago. The D.E.A. presented a body of intelligence information to Mexican navy officials, including calls and contacts from cellphones used over the last few months. The Americans had worked closely before with the marines on successful operations but were not certain that their counterparts would take on the mission. Mexican security forces were focused on another problem \u2014 the battle between the Knights Templar cartel and self-defense groups in Michoac\u00e1n \u2014 and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto had made clear that the economy was his priority. Officials said there were local obstacles, too. Many Sinaloans considered Mr. Guzm\u00e1n as a kind of favorite rebel son. His cartel has deep roots across the state, with many arguing that his operation is relatively benign in comparison to some newer groups that rely more on extortion and kidnapping.\u201cIt\u2019s an old model of organized crime that\u2019s not predatory on the local population,\u201d said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst and former Mexican intelligence officer whose mother grew up in Sinaloa. Still, he added, \u201cFor all the talk of Chapo as a good narco, this is the person who was responsible for some of the worst violence \u2014 for the drug war in Tijuana and Ju\u00e1rez. That\u2019s thousands of deaths.\u201dMr. Guzm\u00e1n, though, seemed so immune to consequence that some here in Mazatl\u00e1n had even come to believe he might be protected, or at least tolerated, by elements of the Mexican and American governments. \u201cWe thought he was clean,\u201d one businessman said.But the marines, compelled by the intelligence gathered through wiretaps and informants \u2014 especially tips suggesting that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was showing up again in Culiac\u00e1n and Mazatl\u00e1n \u2014 agreed to move. They \u201csurged up,\u201d one American official said, at a base near Cabo, the southern tip of the Baja Peninsula, a short race across the water to Mazatl\u00e1n and the rest of Sinaloa.Starting roughly a month before Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s capture, they began to sweep methodically through Culiac\u00e1n, the Sinaloa state capital. They knocked down doors and recovered weapons, armored cars, drugs, cash.The drug operators scurried. On Feb. 13, three men were arrested on the road to Mazatl\u00e1n, including a man called \u201c19,\u201d believed to be the new head assassin for one of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s senior officers, Ismael (Mayo) Zambada. On Feb. 17, another senior leader was captured with 4,000 hollowed-out cucumbers and bananas filled with cocaine.A half-dozen others followed and with each arrest and seizure, Mexican officials made sure to emphasize that they were seeking Mr. Zambada. The true nature of the operation never leaked \u2014 in part because of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s legend. No one seemed to suspect that he would come down from his secret hiding spots in the mountains of Sinaloa, or further afield, in Guatemala or wherever else.And how much would it matter if he did? Experts suspected he had delegated much of the day-to-day work, and drugs have been moving north from this fertile region since World War II, when the American government needed opium for its wounded soldiers. With demand for heroin surging yet again, no one doubts that the trade \u2014 \u201cthe life,\u201d as some here call it \u2014 will go on.But with momentum building in Culiac\u00e1n, American officials said that the Mexican marines began to believe they might actually get the target that had slipped their grasp so many times before.A small team of American agents with the D.E.A. and the United States Marshals Service were embedded with the Mexican marines, American and Mexican officials said, and in their ranks, too, confidence was rising, and mixing with impatience. As days dragged to weeks, there was a sense that Mexican officials wanted to wrap things up \u2014 especially after a raid led to what appeared to be a near miss.Working on information from some of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s bodyguards, Mexican marines and American agents raided the home of his ex-wife on Thursday. After struggling to batter down the steel-reinforced door, according to the Mexican authorities, they were too late: instead of finding their prey, they discovered a secret door beneath a bathtub that led to a network of tunnels and sewer canals that connected to six other houses.The search continued, but the earlier arrests and intelligence were pointing south, to Mazatl\u00e1n \u2014 one of Mexico\u2019s first resorts.Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was not known to spend much time here; local businessmen with a lifetime of knowledge about Sinaloa\u2019s connections to the community said there were no known Chapo sightings, or serious rumors, over his many years in power.The building he chose, called the Miramar, was built about a decade ago, they said, and was filled with a mix of vacationers \u2014 Mexicans and American and Canadian retirees \u2014 who came and went through the year. Before dawn on Saturday morning, it seemed to be just another place to enjoy the view. But about 12 hours earlier, an intercepted phone call to Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s cellphone had already triggered the command to move. In the dark of night, neighbors heard knocks on the doors, according to interviews via apartment intercom. American officials said the teams did not know which apartment he was in. Then came a crash.By the time retirees down the block heard helicopters \u2014 \u201cI was waiting to hear the gunfire,\u201d one Canadian woman said \u2014 it was over.Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was arrested with one other man, Mexican officials said. Some reports said that the authorities also found a woman in the apartment and photos of the room show two pink children\u2019s suitcases on a bed, suggesting Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was with his wife and twin 2-year-old daughters who were born in Los Angeles County. But American officials said they were surprised by what was not there: a cache of weapons. Not a single shot was fired.Local residents cast doubt on the operation for that exact reason. \u201cEveryone thinks it was a negotiated capture,\u201d said one local business leader.That it happened just a few days after President Obama visited Mexico, during a week when official figures showed the economy grew by only 1.1 percent, has only added to the skepticism. Even after photos and forensic tests, many here, young and old, don\u2019t believe that the man with the mustache trotted out for the cameras on Saturday \u2014 and now confined to a high-security Mexican prison, officials said \u2014 is really the one they call Chapo.\u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy,\u201d said Ofelia Aguilar, 52, walking through a shantytown called Santa Monica, still filling up with families who have been forced to flee the lawlessness of the Sinaloan countryside where Mr. Guzm\u00e1n grew up. \u201cIt has to be someone else. I just don\u2019t believe it.\u201dRandal C. Archibold contributed reporting from Mexico City and Ginger Thompson from New York.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Governor of Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank Is Fired After Warning of Missing Oil Revenue", "Date": "2014-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria removed the governor of the country\u2019s central bank from his post on Thursday, after the bank governor repeatedly charged that billions of dollars in oil revenue owed to the treasury was missing.The dismissal of the bank governor, Lamido Sanusi, was seen as further evidence of the Nigerian government\u2019s weakening resolve in tackling widespread corruption, a problem that has plagued the country since independence, analysts said.Mr. Sanusi\u2019s removal was greeted with dismay in financial markets. The country\u2019s stock market fell sharply, bond trading was halted and the value of the Nigerian currency, the naira, plunged to a record low against the dollar before the bank intervened to prop it up. Outside investors had generally seen Mr. Sanusi as an effective regulator of the country\u2019s troubled banking sector; his tenure was scheduled to last until June.His dismissal, along with a series of accusations of misspending by high officials and a presidential pardon last year for a state governor convicted of stealing millions, has prompted Nigerian news outlets to depict Mr. Jonathan\u2019s government as too casual about corruption.At the heart of the problem are the billions of dollars in oil revenue that accrue each year to Nigeria, the largest oil producer in Africa. Oil yields 95 percent of the country\u2019s total export earnings, and Mr. Sanusi has been saying for months that a substantial portion of the money was missing from public coffers.Oil wealth has created a small but immensely wealthy elite in a country where poverty is on the rise; by some estimates, nine-tenths of the economic benefits from oil production go to 1 percent of the population. So when oil money goes missing \u2014 and Mr. Sanusi has said that as much as $50 billion could be unaccounted for, a figure since revised downward \u2014 it touches a nerve in Nigeria.A parliamentary committee is now investigating the claims of missing oil money, first raised by good-government groups and given added weight by Mr. Sanusi. Even the country\u2019s finance minister, a staunch defender of Mr. Jonathan\u2019s government, has called for an audit.Mr. Sanusi, an aristocrat from the ancient Muslim city of Kano, raised the issue in a letter to Mr. Jonathan in September, saying that the state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, or N.N.P.C., had failed to turn over nearly $50 billion in revenue over an 18-month period, from January 2012 to July 2013, \u201cin gross violation of the law.\u201d Though oil prices were strong, official figures inexplicably showed declining revenue and falling reserves.Exactly how much money may be missing is unclear, as Mr. Sanusi acknowledged in a letter to the Nigerian Senate this month. It could be \u201c$10.8 billion or $12 billion or $19 billion or $21 billion \u2014 we do not know at this point,\u201d he wrote, adding that the apparent diversion \u201chas been going on for a long time\u201d and could \u201cbring the entire economy to its knees\u201d if it is not stopped.But he may have taken on too big an opponent in the national oil company. The sprawling company acts as the country\u2019s oil buyer, seller, explorer, producer, processor and regulator, and is \u201cat the nexus between the many interests in Nigeria that seek a stake in the country\u2019s oil riches,\u201d according to a 2010 Stanford University study.The study said that while the company \u201cfunctions well as an instrument of patronage,\u201d it is neither competent nor efficient in its many operations. Mr. Sanusi went further, accusing it this month of \u201cillegal and unconstitutional acts,\u201d including transferring income from government-owned oil properties to \u201cprivate hands.\u201dThe oil company reacted to Mr. Sanusi\u2019s accusations with outrage, though it initially acknowledged that about $10.8 billion in oil revenue had not been accounted for. Then on Thursday, Mr. Jonathan\u2019s government ousted Mr. Sanusi, saying his \u201ctenure has been characterized by various acts of financial recklessness and misconduct.\u201dAnticorruption activists said that explanation for his dismissal would not be widely believed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Leaked Recordings Lay Bare E.U. and U.S. Divisions in Goals for Ukraine", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 \u201cReally Pretty Stupid\u201d was the headline chosen by the august Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Friday to describe an editorial on the latest eruption between the United States and Europe, this time over who should take the lead in trying to calm the crisis in Ukraine, and how to do it.The headline spoke to the tensions that flared this week over the release of a recording in which a top American diplomat disparaged the European Union\u2019s efforts in Ukraine. On Friday, a second recording surfaced in which European diplomats complained about the Americans.But it was also a reflection of the disarray that has marked much of the West\u2019s dealings with Ukraine since late November, when President Viktor F. Yanukovych spurned a pact with the European Union. He then turned to Russia for a $15 billion aid package that the Kremlin has since suspended because of continuing antigovernment protests in Kiev, the capital.Ever since Ukraine became independent as the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991, the United States and Europe have had different aims for the country, a large, troubled nation of 45 million whose very name means \u201con the edge.\u201dWith strategic considerations uppermost in American diplomacy, the United States helped, for instance, to rid Ukraine of old Soviet nuclear weapons. Europe, meanwhile, saw opportunities for trade.As the European Union expanded eastward with the inclusion of Poland and Romania, the perception grew that neighboring Ukraine needed formal ties to regulate commerce and legal systems to facilitate the growing cross-border transactions. In 2012, Poland and Ukraine were even joint hosts of the continent\u2019s premier sports event, the European soccer championship.Russia, which has centuries of shared history with Ukraine and under Vladimir V. Putin has grown ever more painfully conscious of its loss of Soviet empire, looked on with mounting suspicion, and now seems to be intent on exploiting Western disarray.On Friday, a second recording was posted that featured a senior German diplomat, Helga Schmid, complaining in her native tongue to the European Union envoy in Kiev about \u201cunfair\u201d American criticism of Europe\u2019s diplomacy.\u201cWe are not in a race to be the strongest,\u201d retorted the envoy, Jan Tombinski, a Pole. \u201cWe have good instruments\u201d for dealing with the crisis.Yes, replied Ms. Schmid, but journalists were telling European officials that the Americans were running around saying the Europeans were weak. So she advised Mr. Tombinski to have a word with the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, the man whom Ms. Nuland was talking to in her recorded conversation.While the Obama administration accused the Russians of making mischief by recording and then posting the Nuland conversation, neither the European Union nor Germany blamed the Kremlin for the second recording.Illustrating how testy relations with Washington have become, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, earlier the target of American monitoring of her cellphone, issued an unusually sharp statement saying that Ms. Nuland\u2019s remarks were \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201dGermany, as befits its status as Europe\u2019s largest economy and a country with centuries of dealings with lands to its East, has been heavily involved in the crisis over Ukraine. In a speech to the German Parliament on Nov. 18, Ms. Merkel, herself raised in Communist East Germany, emphasized that the Cold War should be over for everyone, including countries once allied with Russia but now independent. She made a forceful case for Ukraine to sign the European pact.Julianne Smith, a former national security aide to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is now at the Center for a New American Security, said there was a structural tension between the European Union and the United States because the Americans can speak with one voice and grow impatient waiting for decisions from a union with many voices.\u201cThey all have different sovereign issues, different threat perceptions, different priorities,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, there has always been this longstanding deep frustration on the part of the United States with the inability to get quick answers, quick responses and broker some sort of U.S.-E.U. agreement on whatever the issue of the day might be.\u201dThe back-and-forth this week illustrates how many interests are a part of the mix in Ukraine \u2014 a mix that Western diplomats seem unable to keep free of their own differences.In the editorial with the headline \u201cReally Pretty Stupid,\u201d Klaus-Dieter Frankenberger, the newspaper\u2019s foreign editor, noted how the latest issue had been stoked by months of \u201cbad blood\u201d with Washington. \u201cYou can certainly criticize some parts of European policy toward Ukraine, but it is not as if American diplomacy has found the font of all wisdom. In fact, they can\u2019t think of anything more than a few mini-sanctions against the regime in Kiev.\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Frankenberger said, Mr. Putin \u201cshould certainly be laughing himself stupid.\u201d \u201cIf a top American diplomat could not care less about the Europeans,\u201d he added, \u201cthen he will certainly bear more easily their absence from the opening of the Olympic Games in Sochi. And he will see in Ms. Nuland\u2019s remark, which Moscow presumably disseminated, a confirmation of the bad opinion he already has of Europeans.\u201dThe moral of the tale? \u201cNo disparaging remarks about partners on the phone.\u201dPeter Baker contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Hand-Me-Down With a History", "Date": "2014-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAuto EgoVelocity, in any case, was never the main attraction of a classic MG. Unhurried top-down touring at 45 to 50 miles an hour on a cool fall day is was the ideal way to appreciate a vintage British roadster, Randy Mehrberg, the car\u2019s owner, suggested. At that speed, there was minimal wind buffeting in the MG\u2019s cramped cockpit, a surprise considering its cut-down doors and the absence of roll-up side windows. Conversation proved easy and relaxed.\u201cI love coming through here this time of year,\u201d Mr. Mehrberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling, driving in such an open car, seeing and hearing everything around you. You get a real sense of your surroundings.\u201dMr. Mehrberg, 58, explained that such drives also gave him a strong sense of connection to his uncle, Morton Mehrberg, who bought the MG in 1960 and presented it to him as a gift four years ago. Morty, as he is known to everyone, taught Randy to drive in this car in 1972 when they both lived on Long Island, Randy in Great Neck, Morty in nearby Manhasset.\u201cWhat stood out for me then was, first, not to hurt the car and, second, Morty\u2019s incredible generosity,\u201d Randy said. \u201cI remember a lot of embarrassing moments. I\u2019d grind the gears.\u201dRandy had driven the MG from his home in Princeton, N.J., about 15 miles south of Duke Farms. Formerly the home of the tobacco heiress Doris Duke, who died in 1993, the complex today serves as a park and a center for environmental education.Morty made a longer trip, driving his 14-year-old Toyota 4Runner 80 miles south from his home in Sugar Loaf, N.Y. He stayed behind in the farm\u2019s parking lot, keeping warm in his S.U.V., while Randy gave a local tour in the sports car that his uncle, now 81, had lovingly cared for through the years.Morty\u2019s attachment to the MG could be seen in an interior devoid of noticeable wear, even though it had never been restored. The wooden dashboard \u2014 whose contours recalled a handlebar mustache \u2014 still looked polished. The seatbelts, installed many years ago, were aftermarket accessories.The gauges and controls looked straight out of the 1930s, because essentially, they were. A successor to the MG TC that had endeared itself to American G.I.\u2019s after World War II, the TD, introduced in 1949, was designed specifically for America\u2019s burgeoning sports-car market.Although its body design still followed the style of MG\u2019s prewar T-series models, the TD was given an upgraded chassis, including an independent front suspension to improve the ride quality and rack-and-pinion steering for more confident cornering. Most important for the United States was the TD\u2019s left-hand drive, which the TC did not offer.\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to drive,\u201d Randy said, explaining that the MG\u2019s steering, clutch, and gearshift operated with a lightness that, to him, feel like the controls of modern cars.The ride seemed compliant and taut, even over railroad crossings. Radial tires on the original vented steel wheels were a big help in that regard, Randy suggested.\u201cIt holds the road surprisingly well,\u201d he continued. \u201cI tried the original-type tires, but the ride and handling were terrible.\u201dRandy dispelled one myth about old British sports cars, describing the MG\u2019s convertible top as easy to use, and side curtains with plastic windows can be installed for a bit of weather protection when needed. But there\u2019s no heater.\u201cIn winter, you wear a blanket on your lap,\u201d Randy said. Some engine heat seeps into the cabin, helping to warm legs, but on a cool day multiple layers are a wise choice.Returning to Duke Farms, Morty joined his nephew for coffee in the park\u2019s cafe, each man carrying items for an impromptu show-and-tell at one of the tables.\u201cMorty, you go first,\u201d Randy said.From a worn Pan Am flight bag that he was using as a satchel, Morty pulled the car\u2019s original workshop manual. Randy looked on fondly as his uncle then sorted through photos, cards and other papers in an overstuffed wallet. In the memorabilia Morty retrieved were laminated pictures of the MG with his favorite passenger, a street mutt that wandered into his electrical supply business in the Bronx in 1988.19 Photos\u201cThat\u2019s Lucky Dog,\u201d Morty said. \u201cWhen I would open up the warehouse in the morning, this stray dog would run from across the street to stare at me. He was in rough shape. One day my wife drove out to see. She opened her car door, and the dog jumped in.\u201dTelling the story of his adopted dog, who died about 10 years ago, Morty began to choke back his words.\u201cHe loved to ride in the MG,\u201d Morty said.Randy paused to give his uncle a moment and then took his turn.\u201cI\u2019ve got something for you,\u201d he said, handing his uncle a package to unwrap. Inside was a framed glass mosaic of the MG \u2014 with Lucky Dog in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201cIt\u2019s by your daughter,\u201d Randy said, explaining that he had commissioned Lauren Mehrberg, an artist in Massachusetts, to create the mosaic. Morty marveled at the detail, especially the grille and hood louvers, and of course his beloved pet. The car, though not especially valuable, holds the status of a family heirloom.\u201cThe MG was in his will for me, but he didn\u2019t want me to wait to enjoy it,\u201d Randy said, and then asked Morty to recount the story of how he got the car.\u201cWhen I got out of the Army, I bought a \u201957 MGA,\u201d Morty began, referring to the sleek successor of the T-series cars. \u201cThat was my first car, but I sold it. I wasn\u2019t really looking for another sports car, but I saw an ad for the TD for $650.\u201dThe seller was an auto shop teacher at a high school in the Bronx. The car, which Morty said was in very good condition, already had its distinctive, though nonoriginal, black-and-gold paint scheme.\u201cFor a long time, it was my only car,\u201d Morty said. \u201cI used it to go on sales calls.\u201dHe commuted from Manhasset to the Bronx and would park the car inside his warehouse. Later, he bought an apartment in Manhattan, where he parked the car on the street.\u201cThere was a lot of car vandalism in the city, but I never had a problem,\u201d he said.Morty drove the MG in all seasons but avoided long trips, which he said could be tiring. To improve traction when it snowed, he secured two 50-pound sand bags on the luggage rack behind the gas tank. The MG does not have a trunk.\u201cI always took care of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe odometer shows 48,000 miles, but it\u2019s probably 68,000.\u201dMorty had the MG repainted once, keeping the black and gold design. Randy had it painted again when the car became his.\u201cI thought about painting it red,\u201d Randy said. \u201cIt turns out that was the original color. I decided to keep the black and gold \u2014 to keep it authentic to Morty.\u201dMorty said he never considered replacing the MG with a more modern sports car. He still has the apartment in Manhattan, where he keeps and drives a 1967 Citro\u00ebn 2CV, a minuscule 2-cylinder French economy car known as the Deux Chevaux.\u201cI\u2019m not a big spender, but when I see something interesting, with character that I really like, I get it,\u201d he said.Thirteen years ago, Morty bought a 1993 Land Rover Defender 110, one of 500 the company imported that year. He recently gave that British-built 4-wheel-drive S.U.V. to a friend\u2019s daughter when she graduated from the United States Merchant Marine Academy.Soon, the MG will be moving west. Randy, who spent five years in charge of building large-scale solar electricity installations in several states for a New Jersey-based renewable energy company, recently started a new position as general counsel for Vail Resorts in Colorado. Appropriately, Randy drives a Tesla Model S, and his wife, Michele, has a Lexus hybrid. Their son Sam, 21, doesn\u2019t gravitate toward the MG because it lacks modern technology, preferring his parents\u2019 cars.\u201cEric, my 12-year old, really likes the MG,\u201d Randy said. \u201cHe enjoys when I drive him to his baseball and soccer games in it. I think it\u2019s partly because of the attention from the other kids.\u201dRandy\u2019s daughter, Dillon, 25, also has a soft spot for the MG. As Morty picked up the mosaic to admire it again, Randy described a drawing Dillon had done of the car with the family\u2019s Portuguese water dog, Odie, sitting inside.\u201cMorty,\u201d Randy said, \u201cin her drawing, Odie looks like Lucky Dog.\u201dRandy MehrbergAge: 58Occupation: General counsel,Vail ResortsLocation: Princeton, N.J.Year acquired: 2009Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuelan Opposition Chief Surrenders, but Not Without a Rally", "Date": "2014-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 A prominent Venezuelan opposition leader surrendered to the authorities on Tuesday in the midst of a large crowd of supporters who tried to block his arrest on accusations that he was responsible for violence that erupted during recent antigovernment protests.\u201cWe are living in a dark time when criminals are rewarded and they want to imprison the Venezuelans who want peaceful, democratic change,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez said, standing on the base of a statue of the 19th-century Cuban independence hero Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed. Clutching a Venezuelan flag, he spoke through a megaphone, and although the large crowd fell into a hush, only those nearby were able to hear him.Mr. L\u00f3pez, 42, a former mayor of a well-off section of Caracas, has helped promote the recent protests against Mr. Maduro\u2019s 10-month-old government.But after a march here last Wednesday, a group of a few hundred youths threw rocks at the police, broke windows in government buildings and set some police vehicles on fire. Two protesters and a government supporter were shot to death.The government quickly accused Mr. L\u00f3pez of being responsible for the unrest and the deaths, claiming he had trained activists to unleash a campaign of violence that was part of a coup attempt against Mr. Maduro. They have provided no evidence for the charges but have demonized Mr. L\u00f3pez in speeches and in programs on government-controlled television and radio.Mr. L\u00f3pez, who left the rally last week before the violence started, has denied he had anything to do with the unrest. He has routinely called for peaceful protests.Local news media reported the day after the rally that a judge had issued an arrest warrant for Mr. L\u00f3pez, saying that he was wanted on charges that included murder and terrorism.At first Mr. L\u00f3pez challenged the authorities to arrest him, but later he went into hiding. A cat-and-mouse game began as heavily armed officials looked for him at his home and his parents\u2019 home. Meanwhile, he taunted Mr. Maduro through Twitter posts, calling him a coward, and Mr. Maduro railed against him in speeches and television appearances, calling him a \u201cfascist coward\u201d and a \u201cfugitive from justice.\u201dThe tension built on Monday when security forces raided the offices of Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s political party, Popular Will, kicking down an office door and drawing guns on startled workers.City officials said that he did not have a permit and vowed to prevent the event. Masses of police officers and national guardsmen, many in riot gear, were in position on Tuesday morning around the plaza designated by Mr. L\u00f3pez for his rally, keeping crowds out.Instead, thousands of his supporters filled a long city avenue nearby.Suddenly a shout went up from the crowd and Mr. L\u00f3pez appeared in the midst of the throng, wearing bluejeans and a long-sleeve T-shirt with a connect-the-dots map of Venezuela on the front. Supporters jammed around him, and he made his way to the Mart\u00ed statue. After a short speech, he climbed down, and in a press of supporters and news photographers, reporters and camera operators, he made his way to a waiting line of riot police officers, holding four white daisies above his head.But the crowd surged through and carried Mr. L\u00f3pez for several more blocks, until he finally arrived at a white armored police vehicle. After turning to the crowd and holding the flowers and a small Venezuelan flag over his head in a gesture of defiance, he climbed into the vehicle.On a building behind him were posters from last year\u2019s presidential election, with Mr. Maduro\u2019s mustached face looking placidly down on the scene.Hundreds of people surged around the vehicle, shouting \u201cFreedom!\u201d and \u201cLet him go!\u201d There was pushing and shoving, and the heavy back door to the vehicle was pulled from its hinges. Other protesters sat or stood in front of the vehicle, blocking it.Finally, Mr. L\u00f3pez, who had declared his intention to surrender peacefully, spoke over a loudspeaker, urging the members of crowd to let the vehicle pass. Eventually they did, but his supporters still crowded around and accompanied it. At one point, when the crowd again refused to let the vehicle pass, he got out and boarded a black Jeep to continue the trip. The crowd around the car eventually swelled into the thousands, and Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s trip to prison took on a paradelike air.In a televised speech at an oil workers\u2019 rally, Mr. Maduro said Mr. L\u00f3pez was being taken to a jail outside Caracas \u201cto answer to justice.\u201dAt the rally for Mr. L\u00f3pez, Garcelis Montilla, 53, a merchant, said she hoped that public reaction to his arrest would bring about change. \u201cLeopoldo\u2019s arrest for crimes that he didn\u2019t commit is the drop that caused the glass to overfill,\u201d she said, using a local saying.Mar\u00eda Eugenia D\u00edaz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Persistent Fall in Producer Prices a Challenge for China", "Date": "2014-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 In a sign that the Chinese economy faces continued challenges, producer prices fell again in January, the National Bureau of Statistics said Friday, in an uninterrupted decline that has lasted for nearly two years. Prices of raw materials and means of production dropped across the board.Chinese consumer inflation hugged a seven-month low in January and showed no signs of accelerating anytime soon, a consolation for the government, which would need to loosen policy measures if economic growth began to founder.Producer prices slid for the 23rd consecutive month, by 1.6 percent in January from the same month last year, according to the statistics bureau.Consumer prices, on the other hand, were up 2.5 percent from the previous year, slightly above market expectations. The rise matched the level in December. Economists polled by Reuters had expected consumer inflation of 2.3 percent in January and producer prices to fall 1.7 percent.China surprised markets in the last week with a strong trade performance in January as import growth reached a six-month high, drawing some skepticism about the data but still allaying fears of a deepening slowing of economic growth.\u201cInflation is not a concern,\u201d said Zhu Haibin, a J.P. Morgan economist in Hong Kong. \u201cThe producer price index is probably a bigger concern for policy makers.\u201dSome analysts say excess factory capacity in sectors like steel, cement, aluminum and glass has dragged on Chinese production prices in the last two years.The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group said Friday that weak producer prices suggested that China was fighting soft demand for its factory goods \u2014 a trend that it said was indicated by China\u2019s falling commodity price index, which is at a seven-month low.\u201cIf the Chinese authorities keep the growth target in 2014 unchanged at 7.5 percent, the government will have to roll out stimulus policy before June,\u201d the bank said, referring to economic growth, which was 7.7 percent last year.Beijing has not announced its growth target for this year, and some economists say they suspect that it has no plans to do so. At the same time, analysts increasingly say that government stimulus will be needed if China wants to maintain economic growth at 7.5 percent this year.No one says Beijing will provide as much fiscal support as it did after the 2008 financial crisis, when the government spent 1.4 trillion renminbi, or about $230 billion at current exchange rates, to bolster the economy. Rather, analysts say smaller-scale pump priming like fast-forwarding of state investment \u2014 which the government did last year \u2014 may be coming.Analysts in a Reuters poll in January forecast that the Chinese economy would grow 7.4 percent this year, which would probably be better than any other major economy in the world but still China\u2019s slowest pace in 14 years.In the meantime, interest rates are expected to stay unchanged until the end of 2015 as annual inflation is expected to remain at about 3 percent this year and next.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Feeling Economic Pressure, Kazakhstan Takes Sudden Action ", "Date": "2014-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKazakhstan joined a growing list of emerging economies under pressure as its central bank moved to devalue the country\u2019s currency on Tuesday.Taking stock of sharp currency declines in other markets like Turkey and Ukraine, the National Bank of Kazakhstan decided to act proactively, devaluing the tenge by about 20 percent against the dollar. But the announcement surprised financial markets, which were taken aback by the severity of the devaluation.\u201cThey decided to move along with other emerging-market currencies so as not to resist pressures globally,\u201d said Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at Otkritie Financial, a financial services firm in Moscow.Kazakhstan\u2019s economy faces headwinds, a common story in the developing markets today. Like other major oil and gas producers, the country looks increasingly vulnerable as commodity prices have stabilized or even fallen in recent years; at the same time, imports fueled by growing domestic consumption have continued to rise.The economy, which expanded 6 percent last year, \u201chas been firing on all cylinders,\u201d Ivan Tchakarov, a Citigroup analyst based in Moscow, wrote in a research note on Tuesday.But he added that a deterioration in its trade balance had eaten into foreign exchange reserves. Defending the tenge has also drained central bank reserves, which have declined by about $11 billion to about $25 billion over the last two years, according to Mr. Tchakarov\u2019s note.With a commodities boom coming to an end, \u201cit should not be surprising that the economy has to adjust,\u201d said Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at Roubini Global Economics who specializes in oil exporting countries.Authorities have also kept a tight grip on the local currency, allowing speculative pressures to build. Mr. Tikhomirov said the bank was alarmed that speculators, including people in Russia, were stepping up their selling of the Kazakh currency against the dollar. And Russia is allowing the ruble to slide, further leaving the tenge exposed.Kazakhstan has been one of the oil industry\u2019s major growth stories, with production rising from about one million barrels a day in 2002 to about 1.7 million barrels a year ago. But the growth in oil production has slowed sharply since 2009, largely because a $50 billion project led by companies like Eni of Italy has been delayed for years. As a result, a current-account surplus that was more than 5 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 dwindled to an estimated 0.2 percent last year, according to Mr. Tchakarov.While the devaluation will push up inflation, which is now running about 6 percent a year, most economists say the country is in better shape than many others to resist the pressure on emerging markets. In addition to healthy economic growth, Kazakhstan has an extra $70 billion stored away in a sovereign wealth fund that it does not count as part of reserves.Kazakhstan does have one conspicuous weakness: a high level of debt and of bank loans that are in or near default, a legacy of a financial crisis in 2008-9. The rating agency Fitch says that 41 percent of bank borrowings were in foreign currency as of September, and the devaluation could add to pressure on the financial system.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Energy Role Is Lifting Democrat in Louisiana", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCongressional MemoSenator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, is set to become chairwoman next week of the Senate Energy Committee, a powerful position that gives her jurisdiction over the oil and gas industry that fuels her state\u2019s economy \u2014 and which will be a major source of contributions to Ms. Landrieu\u2019s tough re-election campaign this fall.Senate Democratic leaders are behind the ascent of Ms. Landrieu, who is one of a handful of vulnerable incumbents whose elections could determine whether Democrats retain control of the Senate. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader, made sure that Ms. Landrieu \u2014 after an unexpected set of dominoes fell in the ranks of the Senate leadership \u2014 got the spot. The Senate\u2019s liberals, many of whom have clashed with Ms. Landrieu on environmental issues, chafe at her new role. But for now, they are staying quiet about a move that could give Democrats an edge in an important race.Unlike many Democrats, Ms. Landrieu typically votes with Republicans on energy policy. She supports more offshore drilling and the Keystone XL oil pipeline. She has voted at least 11 times against proposals to curb climate change by regulating greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be from a state with a 100-year-plus tradition of the energy industry,\u201d Ms. Landrieu said Thursday in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to represent my state and my region in this way.\u201dMs. Landrieu will take control of the committee at a transformative moment for the American energy economy. Breakthroughs in hydraulic fracturing technology have created a boom in domestic oil and gas production, kicking off debates about the safety of the process and over whether the United States should export its newfound fossil fuels. There is a ban on exporting crude oil, while several companies have applied for permits to begin exporting natural gas. Although many Democrats oppose exporting fossil fuels, Ms. Landrieu described herself as \u201cvery favorably inclined to opening up our markets so there will be incentives to find oil and gas.\u201dMs. Landrieu will take charge of the Energy Committee after President Obama\u2019s nomination of Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, as ambassador to China left open his chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, the energy panel\u2019s current chairman, will take Mr. Baucus\u2019s old seat, and Ms. Landrieu will in turn take Mr. Wyden\u2019s place.Ms. Landrieu will become part of a long tradition of Louisiana lawmakers who rose to power in Washington and used their clout to help oil companies. Among them are J. Bennett Johnston Jr., a former Louisiana Democratic senator who was the chairman or ranking member of the Senate Energy Committee from 1983 to 1997. \u201cIt means a great deal,\u201d Mr. Johnston said of the energy chairmanship. \u201cOil and gas is No. 1 in Louisiana. Being chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction is just fabulously important for the state.\u201dMs. Landrieu has already been campaigning on the promise of what she will bring home to the oil industry. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, her campaign and her political action committee, Jazz PAC, have together raised $8.8 million, more than double the $4 million raised by her expected rival, Representative Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Baton Rouge. The oil and gas industry is the second-largest contributor to both campaigns, but it has given far more to Ms. Landrieu \u2014 $456,300 \u2014 than its $172,850 to Mr. Cassidy.\u201cShe believes wholeheartedly in our industry, and that\u2019s good for Louisiana,\u201d said Mark Miller, the president of Merlin Oil and Gas in Lafayette, La. Although he is a Republican, he said he planned to vote for Ms. Landrieu. \u201cI don\u2019t support her on all the issues, but on this I do,\u201d he said.Environmentalists are worried. \u201cShe faces a real choice: Do we move to a clean-energy economy or does she continue to rely on the dirty fossil fuels of the past?\u201d said Tiernan Sittenfeld, a vice president of the League of Conservation Voters. \u201cIf past is prologue, we don\u2019t have a lot of optimism.\u201d Still, Ms. Sittenfeld said, her group is heartened by Ms. Landrieu\u2019s support of legislation to restore Louisiana\u2019s coastal wetlands.Ms. Landrieu\u2019s new position does not give her carte blanche to move drilling legislation through the Senate. Although she can move bills through her committee, they can be blocked on the Senate floor by liberal Democrats. But Ms. Landrieu can count on support from across the aisle, particularly from her friend Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the energy committee\u2019s ranking Republican and a fellow oil-state moderate.Ms. Landrieu is consolidating her energy influence. On the Senate Appropriations Committee, she is in line as chairwoman of an obscure but influential subcommittee that would give her oversight of the Energy Department\u2019s budget.\u201cIn time, she\u2019ll be chair of both,\u201d Mr. Johnston said. \u201cThat\u2019s the catbird seat.\u201dAn article on Friday about the expected ascension of Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, to chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee, rendered incompletely the name of a former Louisiana Democratic senator who was the chairman or ranking member of the Senate Energy Committee from 1983 to 1997.

{"Headline": "Hyundai Sends Luxury Model to Challenge Europe\u2019s Auto Stalwarts", "Date": "2014-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 How\u2019s this for a marketing challenge? Selling a South Korean luxury sedan in Europe \u2014 the home turf of Audi, BMW, Mercedes and other gilded marques.European consumers already have plenty of locally produced choices, and those are in a funk. Sales of new cars in the region fell last year to the lowest level since 1995. What is more, politicians in France have begun taking cues from their Japan-bashing American counterparts of the 1980s, blaming South Korean imports for the troubles of European carmakers like PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn and Renault.That has not discouraged the leading South Korean automaker, Hyundai Motor. In the latest sign of the breadth of its ambitions, the company recently announced plans to sell a new version of its Genesis premium sedan in Europe for the first time, beginning this spring or summer.Hyundai has been selling a version of the Genesis since 2008 in the United States, where it also offers a larger, more expensive sedan called the Equus. The new version of the Genesis, with swept back headlights and a sleeker shape, is expected to go on sale in the United States in April. Hyundai has yet to announce pricing for the new model, but the current Genesis starts at $35,200 in the United States.Selling Asian-made luxury sedans in the United States is one thing. Americans long ago embraced upmarket Japanese brands like Acura, Infiniti and Lexus, and all of those also compete with Cadillac, Lincoln and other Detroit brands, alongside German imports.European luxury car buyers remain far more attached to German sedans like the Audi A6, the BMW 5 Series and the Mercedes E-Class. The three carmakers are the pride of the German export machine, and they dominate the high-end car business across Europe. \u201cFor European consumers to move out of the small circle is extremely rare,\u201d said Antonio Ferreira, founder and director of Carnorama, a research firm in London. \u201cMost people would rather trade down to a less expensive BMW, Audi or Mercedes.\u201dIn a sign of how tough the European market is, even Toyota\u2019s Lexus, perhaps the most widely available luxury import, had a mere 0.2 percent of car sales in the European Union last year. By contrast, Lexus has rivaled or surpassed the German luxury brands in American market share for more than a decade.Though Hyundai struggled last year in Europe, as it and most other carmakers wrestled with a sluggish economy, it has steadily built market share for itself and its South Korean affiliate, Kia, a onetime rival in which Hyundai now owns a controlling stake. With a combined market share of 6.3 percent in the first three quarters of last year for the two brands, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association, Hyundai is now a significant player in Europe.But Hyundai and Kia are known as budget brands in Europe. That reputation, analysts say, may have helped them gain market share during the financial crisis.\u201cWhen European consumers had budget constraints, they started looking at value-for-money options,\u201d said Angela Hong, an analyst at Nomura.Even Hyundai executives acknowledge that high-end sedans are another matter.\u201cUntil now, we did not launch any luxury cars in Europe, which shows how tough the premium segment is,\u201d said Lee In-cheol, vice president for Hyundai\u2019s international sales division. \u201cNow we think the market is ready.\u201dThe new Genesis has been popular in South Korea, where it was introduced in November. Mr. Lee said the company had received 15,000 orders in the first month, half of its domestic goal for the first year.Ms. Hong said she expected Hyundai to sell 62,000 Genesis cars worldwide in the first year, about half of them in South Korea. But she estimated that in Europe, the number might be no more than a few hundred.\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to contribute a lot of earnings,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is more about image. Europe represents the global consumer preference, so that can have a very positive impact on the brand.\u201dMr. Lee declined to provide sales estimates for Europe, but he agreed that the numbers would be modest. The company plans to use the Genesis as a way to showcase its innovations in technology and design, he said. The hope is that the benefits will extend to its less expensive models, in the way that tire-kickers ogling a $115,000 Audi R8 sometimes settle for a $30,000 A3.Accordingly, Hyundai plans a more visible marketing push in Europe than the expected modest sales figures might justify. In addition to advertising, Hyundai plans an extensive program of test drives so that prospective customers, or just curious ones, can get a better feel for the car.\u201cThe target customer is someone who values differentiation in their experiences and a new kind of luxury,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will place an emphasis on social responsibility, design and innovation.\u201dNot everyone in Europe sees Hyundai as socially responsible. Shortly after the election of a Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in France almost two years ago, members of his government began accusing the company of unfair competition, saying it was dumping \u2014 that is, selling its cars below cost in an effort to gain market share \u2014 in Europe.The French industry minister, Arnaud Montebourg, complained that Hyundai was taking advantage of low-cost South Korean labor to undercut European carmakers. Around the same time, Peugeot was announcing the closing of a plant near Paris, eliminating thousands of jobs.Hyundai said most of the cars it sold in Europe were made in the Czech Republic or Turkey, not South Korea. And it commissioned a study by London Economics, a research firm, that said the presence of Hyundai and Kia in Europe supported 317,000 jobs in the region.Though the Genesis is made in South Korea, Mr. Lee said he did not think political concerns would pose any problem in Europe.\u201cWe contribute heavily to the economy, and volume will be low,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Ukraine Crisis Rumbles, Georgian Premier Visits U.S.", "Date": "2014-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili of Georgia met with Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday to discuss ways to develop his nation\u2019s economy and reinforce its pro-Western path. But the tumultuous events in Ukraine, and Moscow\u2019s decision to send a message by conducting a surprise military exercise in western Russia, have cast a shadow on the Georgian leader\u2019s visit here.In an interview on Tuesday night, Mr. Garibashvili reflected on Russia\u2019s role and developments in Ukraine, which Georgia hopes will now move toward greater integration with Europe.Georgia has been pursuing membership in the European Union and NATO, a bid it has reinforced by sending troops to participate in the multinational force in Afghanistan. But Georgia has been powerless to stop Russia\u2019s muscle flexing closer to home, activity that Mr. Garibashvili said had accelerated as soon as the Winter Olympics were over.Mr. Garibashvili said Russia had resumed work on barbed-wire fences in the breakaway region of South Ossetia. Georgia, the United States and most of the world consider South Ossetia to be Georgian territory. Russia, which sent troops to occupy the area during its 2008 war with Georgia, considers South Ossetia an independent country.\u201cThey are installing these fences, and they are calling it border,\u201d Mr. Garibashvili said. \u201cThey suspended these actions in December, and they renewed right after the Sochi Olympic Games.\u201dMr. Garibashvili said that Georgia would never use force to recover South Ossetia and Abkhazia, another breakaway area, but expressed hope the regions would voluntarily rejoin Georgia after it was further integrated with Europe.\u201cThey will have a very clear picture, maybe in five years, maybe in 10 years, and they will see the difference,\u201d Mr. Garibashvili added. \u201cAnd they will have to decide whether they will want to live in the darkness or live in a brighter future.\u201dEvents in Ukraine, another former Soviet republic struggling to find its own way, were also on Mr. Garibashvili\u2019s mind.As far back as Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister who served as president of a newly independent Georgia from 1995 to 2003, Georgia leaders have said a Ukraine that sought its future in Europe would help ease the process for Georgia.Georgian leaders plan to sign partnership and free-trade agreements with the European Union in August, a prospect likely to further irritate Russia.In his interview, Mr. Garibashvili said that he hoped Ukraine would return to its \u201cEuropean choice\u201d by joining Georgia and Moldova in signing a partnership agreement with the European Union\u2014and that the West would reciprocate as well.\u201cI think Ukraine has quite serious economic problems. And I think the European Union, together with I.M.F. and with other international institutions, should find a solution now to solve their problems,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all matters how fast they will do this. I heard that the European Union offered 20 billion euros. I think they should be very flexible.\u201dBalancing his interest in joining NATO with his efforts to improve ties to Moscow remains challenging, at best. Georgia has argued that tying its economic policy to the West would not be damaging to Russia, but there is nothing to indicate that Russia President Vladimir V. Putin is prepared to accept that argument.\u201cWe have to persuade them,\u201d Mr. Garibashvili said of the Russians. \u201cWe have to try. We have to show them the reality. Russia should be interested in having a reliable and predictable neighbor country.\u201dAsked if Russia\u2019s loss of influence in Ukraine might make Moscow toughen its policy toward Georgia, Mr. Garibashvili gave a somewhat philosophical reply.\u201cNothing is excluded,\u201d he said. \u201cGeorgia has already experienced that pressure from Russia when we had this war in 2008. Twenty percent of our terroritory is occupied, so what else can be done? Now Russia does not have too many economic leverages on us.\u201dUkraine, he said, is a different story. \u201cUkraine is dependent on Russia, and Russia can play with this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Third Intifada", "Date": "2014-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRAMALLAH, West Bank \u2014 For a while now I\u2019ve wondered why there\u2019s been no Third Intifada. That is, no third Palestinian uprising in the West Bank, the first of which helped to spur the Oslo peace process and the second of which \u2014 with more live ammunition from the Israeli side and suicide bombings from the Palestinian side \u2014 led to the breakdown of Oslo. You get many explanations from Palestinians: they\u2019re too poor, too divided, too tired or that they realize these uprisings, in the end, did them more harm than good, especially the second. But being here, it\u2019s obvious that a Third Intifada is underway. It\u2019s the one that Israel always feared most \u2014 not an intifada with stones or suicide bombers, but one propelled by nonviolent resistance and economic boycott.But this Third Intifada isn\u2019t really led by Palestinians in Ramallah. It\u2019s led by the European Union in Brussels and other opponents of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank across the globe. Regardless of origin, though, it\u2019s becoming a real source of leverage for the Palestinians in their negotiations with Israel.Secretary of State John Kerry was recently denounced by Israeli leaders for warning publicly that the boycott and campaign to delegitimize Israel will only get stronger if current peace talks fail. But Kerry is right.Finance Minister Yair Lapid told Israel Army Radio on Monday that if no two-state solution is reached with the Palestinians, \u201cit will hit the pocket of every Israeli.\u201d Israel\u2019s economy depends on technology and agricultural exports to Europe and on European investments in its high-tech industries. According to Lapid, even a limited boycott that curbed Israeli exports to Europe by 20 percent would cost Israel more than $5 billion a year and thousands of jobs. That\u2019s why he added: \u201cIsrael won\u2019t conduct its policy based on threats. But to pretend that the threats don\u2019t exist, or that they\u2019re not serious, or it\u2019s not a process happening in front of us, is also not serious.\u201dJust recently, the Israeli daily Haaretz reported that the Netherlands\u2019 largest pension fund management company, PGGM, \u201chas decided to withdraw all its investments from Israel\u2019s five largest banks because they have branches in the West Bank and/or are involved in financing construction in the settlements.\u201d And The Jerusalem Post reported that Danske Bank, Denmark\u2019s largest bank, has decided to boycott Israel\u2019s Bank Hapoalim for \u201clegal and ethical\u201d reasons related to its operating in the settlements.This Third Intifada, in my view, has much more potential to have a long-term impact because, unlike the first two, it is coinciding with the offer from the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, as part of a two-state deal, to let Israeli troops stay for five years as they make a phased withdrawal from the West Bank to the 1967 lines and to then let U.S.-led NATO forces fill in any strategic void to reassure Israel.To put it differently, the Third Intifada is based on a strategy of making Israelis feel strategically secure but morally insecure.The first two intifadas failed in the end because they never included a map of a two-state solution and security arrangements. They were more raw outbursts of rage against the occupation. You cannot move the Israeli silent majority when you make them feel strategically insecure and morally secure, which is what Hamas did with its lunatic shelling of Israel after it withdrew from Gaza; few Israelis were bothered by pummeling them back. President Anwar Sadat of Egypt, though, got all he wanted by making Israelis feel strategically secure but morally insecure about holding any of his land.This Third Intifada is also gaining strength because of the passing from the scene of two key leaders: Nelson Mandela and former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran. For Israel, Ahmadinejad was the gift who kept on giving: an Iranian president who denied the Holocaust and rebuffed global efforts to get Iran to stop building a nuclear bomb. He was hard to love. The replacement of Ahmadinejad by the negotiation-friendly, Holocaust-recognizing Hassan Rouhani is much more problematic for Israel. But my gut also tells me that the death of Mandela has left many of his followers looking for ways to honor his legacy and carry on his work. On some college campuses, they\u2019ve found it: boycotting Israel until it ends the West Bank occupation.Israelis are right to suspect some boycotters of using this cause as a cover for anti-Semitism, given how Israel\u2019s misdeeds are singled out. But that doesn\u2019t mean that implanting 350,000 settlers in the West Bank and turning a blind eye to dozens of wildcat settlements \u2014 that even Israel deems \u201cillegal\u201d \u2014 is in Israel\u2019s interest or smart.If Israel really wanted to slow down the boycott campaign, it would declare that as long as Kerry is trying to forge a deal, and there is hope for success, Israel will freeze all settlement activity to give peace its best chance. Unlikely, I know. But one thing I know for sure: this incessant trashing of Kerry by Israeli ministers, and their demand that Palestinians halt all \u201cincitement\u201d \u2014 but that Israel be free to keep building settlements in their face \u2014 is not winning Israel friends in Europe or America. It is only energizing the boycotters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade Pact With Asia Faces Imposing Hurdle: Midterm Politics", "Date": "2014-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama\u2019s ambitious trade agenda appeared to fall further victim to election-year politics on Capitol Hill on Friday when Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in a closed-door retreat with House Democrats, said he understood why they would not grant Mr. Obama the crucial authority he needs to conclude large trade deals with Asia and Europe.Mr. Biden\u2019s comments most immediately called into question the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional pact among 12 nations that would be one of the world\u2019s biggest trade agreements. It is a central element of Mr. Obama\u2019s strategic shift toward Asia, and the White House had hoped to complete it last year. Responding to a question at the policy retreat for House Democratic leaders in Cambridge, Md., Mr. Biden said he understood that legislation for expedited consideration in Congress for free-trade agreements, known as fast-track authority, was not coming up for a vote now, according to several people who were in the meeting.Winning that authority is viewed as necessary for Mr. Obama to extract politically difficult concessions from Japan, Singapore and other Pacific Rim countries. The Trans-Pacific Partnership aims to reduce tariffs on a vast array of goods and services and to harmonize regulations. It would affect 40 percent of America\u2019s exports and imports.For Mr. Obama, the trade deal would also lend economic substance to a policy on Asia that is otherwise largely about shifting some military forces to the region as a counterweight to a rising China.But with Democrats facing a difficult midterm election in nine months, Mr. Biden appeared sensitive to their more parochial concerns, including the pressures they face from organized labor. He took a hard line against the largest American trading partners in the Pacific and told the Democrats, for example, that he had warned the Japanese on a recent trip to Tokyo that the pact could not go forward if the American auto industry continued to have only 1 percent market penetration in Japan. Many Democrats typically oppose trade deals, along with their allies in unions and environmental and consumer groups, because they do not want to encourage free-trade agreements that they say would siphon off manufacturing jobs in the United States and create pollution.White House officials insisted that Mr. Obama was not ceding the battle, either to win fast-track authority or to pass the broader trade deals. The European trade deal, the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, is also affected by fast-track authority, which is viewed as essential to passing any agreements, and it is one area on which the president and Republicans agree.\u201cWhile the vice president said he understands where some members of the House and Senate are coming from,\u201d said a senior administration official, \u201che made a clear case for the administration\u2019s trade priorities, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations.\u201d The pact, Mr. Biden said, would allow the United States to respond to the growing economic muscle of China, which he said was affecting the economic calculations of its neighbors.When the vice president was finished, one House member responded, \u201cThanks for your explanation of geopolitical priorities,\u201d according to another member who was in the room, and who like other lawmakers spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was closed.Mr. Biden replied, \u201cBut I also get local political priorities.\u201dAt another point, the vice president glanced at the House minority leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, and in a specific reference to trade promotion authority, said, \u201cNancy, I know it\u2019s not coming up now,\u201d according to a person in the room.Last month, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said he had no plans to schedule a vote on trade promotion authority. On Wednesday, Ms. Pelosi told reporters that giving Mr. Obama that authority was \u201cout of the question.\u201dEconomists say that with the United States on the mend and the international trading system still open, the volume of global trade would most likely increase, even if these trade deals were never completed.\u201cBut it would make U.S. trade policy dead in the water, probably for the rest of the Obama administration,\u201d said I.M. Destler, an expert on global trade at the University of Maryland.Mr. Obama, who spoke to Democrats after Mr. Biden, did not mention trade in his brief remarks and instead focused on issues on which the Democrats are generally united, like raising the federal minimum wage and overhauling the nation\u2019s immigration laws.Some analysts credited the administration for working hard to promote the trade deals. Last year the White House moved Michael B. Froman, a top-ranking international economic official, to be the United States trade representative. Mr. Obama plans to travel to Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and the Philippines next month for a trip that will focus heavily on trade.\u201cIf the Democrats on the Hill seem to be reluctant to embrace the deal, and they do, the only question is whether the White House is willing to use the tools at their disposal to change some minds,\u201d said David Rothkopf, who worked on trade issues in the Clinton administration.Trade has long divided Democrats, pitting their business-friendly moderate wing against key allies in organized labor. And in the midterm elections, when key Democratic voting blocs tend to stay home, the party badly needs the unions to get out the vote in November.The remarks by the president and the vice president come as both parties paper over divisions before the election season. Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio heeded warnings from his Republican members and postponed efforts for an immigration overhaul to avoid the spectacle of intraparty warfare on the issue.Fast-track trade authority is the issue on which the White House and congressional Democratic leaders are most obviously at loggerheads. In the past two weeks, Republicans have taken to publicly goading Mr. Obama to move forward on it, saying it was an area in which Republicans and the White House could work together to create jobs.\u201cWith our economy in such dire straits these days, opening new opportunities for American goods through trade should just be a no-brainer,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the source of comments from Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They were not from a transcript of his remarks provided by the vice president\u2019s office; they were from lawmakers who were at the meeting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reopening an Employment Door to the Young", "Date": "2014-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPreoccupationsMost of the leaders with whom I work as a management consultant are a level-headed lot. They rarely let their personal feelings interfere with business decisions. But recently, I\u2019ve noticed some executives becoming irritated, even angry, when I tell them how important it is for companies to hire and train high-potential young people just out of school. Their emotions, I soon discover, often relate to disappointments they have experienced with their own children or grandchildren. These executives will tell me things like, \u201cWhen I was my grandson\u2019s age, I started at the bottom and worked my way up; he\u2019s not willing to do that.\u201d Or, \u201cMy daughter majored in philosophy, of all things \u2014 how will that get her anywhere?\u201d If they don\u2019t have a personal anecdote about their own families to relate, they may remark that too many young people are entitled and self-absorbed. The general message from these leaders is this: More young people would be hired if they had the right qualifications, but too few have the skills and discipline needed to succeed in today\u2019s demanding workplace. Over the last few years, I\u2019ve interviewed more than 200 young people from diverse backgrounds of income, education, race and geography. About half told me that they had liberal arts degrees, and I was struck by how many of them regretted majoring in a discipline now seen as impractical. Many liberal-arts graduates say they are eager to find an employer willing to train them in skills that don\u2019t require a degree in engineering or computer science. They cite six-sigma analysis, supply-chain procedures, customer service, inventory control, quality assurance and Internet marketing. They want a chance to master one of those skills. But their pleas appear unlikely to be answered. Most corporate training today is directed at employees who arrive with technical skills already developed \u2014 if not through their college degrees, then though specialized internships.This puts a large swath of young people at a disadvantage. Burdened with tuition debt, many college graduates from low- and middle-income families can\u2019t afford to serve a low-paying or unpaid internship. I\u2019ve been consulting for more than four decades. Twenty or 30 years ago, a hiring manager at a Fortune 500 company was much more willing to give, say, a dance major a chance. That manager would realize that such graduates were good at teamwork, acquiring new skills and practicing for long hours. Give them some corporate training and they become productive employees, was the thinking. It\u2019s not that they aren\u2019t trying to find work. One problem is that young people are competing both with their peers and with experienced applicants willing to accept entry-level salaries. Rather than waiting for educational institutions or the government to bridge this generation gap, employers should consider accepting some responsibility for introducing young people into the work force. This could be the perfect time for companies to start pilot projects that enroll unskilled but promising people in corporate training programs.Hiring managers who look beyond narrowly focused credentials might uncover something even more important: energetic workers who are determined to make a mark and help their companies succeed. And businesses that gain reputations for preparing young people to become productive employees are likely to have a competitive advantage as the economy recovers and older workers can afford to retire.More hiring managers must be willing to take a risk on people whose careers have stalled because they majored in an \u201cimpractical\u201d discipline. Bottom lines will not suffer \u2014 and might even improve \u2014 if companies provide opportunity to a population hungry to prove its value. ROBERT W.

{"Headline": "A Dire Economic Forecast Based on New Assumptions", "Date": "2014-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceThe part of the past that you deem most relevant can be critical in determining your outlook for the future. And nowhere is that clearer than in the changing economic forecasts that come out of the Congressional Budget Office.They think that Americans will earn less than they previously expected, that fewer of them will want jobs and that fewer will get them. They think companies will invest less and earn less. The economy, as measured by growth in real gross domestic product, will settle into a prolonged period in which it grows at an average rate of just 2.1 percent. From 2019 through 2024, job growth will average less than 70,000 a month.Not only do they forecast an economy with less growth than in any comparable period since the Great Depression, they think interest rates will rise substantially, to the great discomfort of the federal government, which will have to pay ever-rising amounts of interest to service the rising national debt.It is a dreary, depressing prospect.It is also almost certainly wrong.Why is it wrong? It is highly unlikely that we will have both an anemic economy and high long-term interest rates. Both are required to achieve the dire budget consequences forecast by the C.B.O. One would not be enough.\u201cIf we are bound to settle into a world of limited growth and low inflation,\u201d said Robert J. Barbera, the co-director of the Center for Financial Economics at Johns Hopkins University, \u201creal rates are quite unlikely to rebound to the levels witnessed in the halcyon days of 3 percent-plus economic expansions.\u201dOf course, forecasts are often wrong, and economists, like the rest of us, can have different views. But the C.B.O. forecast has an official nonpartisan imprimatur. Its views are likely to shape congressional debate and action.This is reminiscent of one of the great errors committed by the C.B.O., back in 2001. The late 1990s were a boom time in which tax receipts came in well above forecasts year after year. The C.B.O., to the annoyance of many in Congress who wanted to cut taxes, kept forecasting that tax receipts would decline to their historic levels.That forecast was among the worst in history \u2014 and not just because the newly inaugurated president, George W. Bush, used the C.B.O. report to push through a large tax cut. In that very year, 2001, we found out why tax receipts had been far higher than expected \u2014 a reason that seems obvious now but did not then.The reason was the unusual nature of the technology stock bull market. It had to do with all the stock options that were being issued and cashed in, making lucky insiders fabulously rich. They paid taxes on those profits at ordinary income tax rates.In normal times, such increased individual tax receipts would be offset by lower corporate tax payments because companies can deduct every dollar of option profit as an expense. But much \u2014 perhaps most \u2014 of the options profits in the late 1990s and 2000 went to executives from companies that were not paying taxes. Many of the companies had never earned a penny; some never would. They had no use for an additional tax deduction.When the bull market collapsed, options profits stopped arriving. Tax receipts would have plunged even if there had been no Bush tax cuts.What that error has in common with this year\u2019s report is that in each case the C.B.O. decided to change its assumptions to bring its forecasts more in line with recent history. \u201cMost of the increase in projected deficits results from lower projections for the growth of real G.D.P. and for inflation, which have reduced projected revenues between 2014 and 2023 by $1.4 trillion,\u201d the new report states. It has looked at the last five business cycles \u2014 most importantly the recent one \u2014 and concluded that its old estimates were just too optimistic, being based on the history before the Great Recession.One change the office has made is to assume that the labor force \u2014 the pool of people available to accept jobs \u2014 is going to continue to decline as it has during the recession and its aftermath. Part of the decline is the result of demographics, with a larger part of the population past normal retirement age, but much of the rest has until now been viewed as most likely temporary. In a speech this week to the National Association for Business Economics, Douglas W. Elmendorf, the C.B.O.\u2019s director, said he now thinks a significant part of that decline represents \u201cdiscouraged workers who have dropped out of the labor force permanently.\u201d The new forecasts assume that the labor force participation rate \u2014 the proportion of people of working age who want to work \u2014 will continue to decline.One reason for that predicted decline is the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The C.B.O. estimates that a significant number of workers have continued to work primarily because they need health insurance at a reasonable cost. With such insurance available, they will choose to retire.That hardly sounds like a problem for the economy. Those who do choose to retire presumably will be happier and can afford to do so. Others will be promoted into their jobs and will in turn be succeeded by others. Eventually, that will help some unemployed people obtain jobs. But the C.B.O. does not see that as good news, at least in the long term. The assumption is that the number of jobs filled is a proportion of the number of people seeking work, and that if fewer people are looking for work, fewer people will be getting work. As a result, there will be less national income and thus less tax revenue.There is one economic theory that would justify a forecast of higher interest rates when the economy is weak. That is a crisis of confidence, as illustrated by some peripheral economies in the euro zone. The more they needed to borrow, the more fearful of possible default the lenders became and the higher the interest rate they demanded.There is no sign that is happening to the United States, in no small measure because it can borrow in the currency it prints. Recent history indicates that the slower the United States economy is, the more investors value the security of Treasuries, and the lower interest rates fall.That is what has happened in Japan, whose economy has been weak for many years and whose debt burden \u2014 relative to the size of the country \u2014 is much larger than the one in the United States. It is able to borrow in its own currency, and rates have been close to zero for a long time.The C.B.O. assumes that productivity growth will be much lower than it had expected and far below what it was in previous cycles. It assumes that as budget deficits pile up, private borrowers will be crowded out of the market and that as a result there will be less business investment and even less growth, causing tax revenue to fall further.There is a risk that those who fear deficits will seize on this forecast to argue that much more austerity is needed now \u2014 a move that would only serve to slow the economy and make dire forecasts more likely to be accurate. I have no reason to doubt that the economists at C.B.O. are sincere in their pessimism. But it would be good if there were an alternative forecast out there \u2014 one that assumes the sky is not going to fall, and that the fact the economy has been weak does not indicate that it will always be so, any more than the strong economy of the 1990s was proof that the strength would endure indefinitely. Perhaps a group of economists, possibly including some C.B.O. alumni, will take on that task.Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pope Moves to Reshape Management of Vatican", "Date": "2014-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Pope Francis on Monday announced a major restructuring of the Vatican\u2019s outdated administrative and economic bureaucracy as he established an agency to oversee budgets and financial planning and also created a powerful post of auditor general to guard against fiscal mismanagement.The changes are the latest example of how Francis is moving to confront management problems in the Vatican as part of his broader mandate to overhaul the Roman Curia, the administration that runs the Holy See. He has begun shuffling personnel while also speaking out against careerism in the Roman Catholic Church, especially in the Vatican.\u201cIt would be useful to have a pope who can pull the show together, lift the morale of the Curia and strengthen a bit of the discipline there,\u201d Cardinal Pell told The Associated Press at the time.One question that remains is the fate of the Vatican Bank, officially known as the Institute for the Works of Religion. Magistrates in Italy are investigating allegations of money-laundering linked to the bank. Meanwhile, a management team, appointed by Benedict in the final days of his papacy to address the problems, has been poring over the bank\u2019s accounts, looking for irregularities, while also working to bring the institution into compliance with international norms.Francis has not yet signaled his plans for the bank \u2014 one possibility would be to shut it down \u2014 and the announcement on Monday did not mention it.\u201cWe have not yet heard any decisions or deliberations,\u201d said Max Hohenberg, a spokesman for the bank.But Alberto Melloni, a historian of the Vatican, said the latest changes signaled a further diminution of the bank, which once operated with independence and limited oversight, factors that contributed to the recent scandals. He said the bank would now serve essentially as a wallet, while economic decision-making would be made in the new Secretariat for the Economy. He also said the appointment of Cardinal Pell underscored the growing influence of the so-called Group of Eight cardinals over functions once dominated by the Curia.Francis has pledged to bring greater transparency and collegiality to the Vatican, and the announcement on Monday said the secretariat was to help \u201csimplify and consolidate existing management structures and improve coordination and oversight.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nuclear Issue in Limbo as Indecision Grips Japan", "Date": "2014-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Several industrialized countries have turned their backs on nuclear power as a result of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, including one that has already begun permanently shutting functioning plants. That country is not Japan.\u201cGermany chose to get rid of nuclear power because of Fukushima, while the United States is still in favor, but what about Japan, where the accident took place?\u201d said Jun Tateno, who has written several books on nuclear power. \u201cWe still have not had a proper public debate about the most fundamental question: Do we want nuclear power\u2019s low-cost electricity for growth, or do we want a safer, nuclear-free society?\u201dMany analysts had hoped that last Sunday\u2019s vote to choose the next governor of Tokyo would provide just such a forum to that question, which lies at the heart of Japan\u2019s struggle to find its economic footing after two decades of malaise. But the results of the contest \u2014 which included an impassioned though unsuccessful run by two antinuclear candidates, including a former prime minister \u2014 were unclear at best.The current prime minister, Shinzo Abe, appeared emboldened by the results, saying a day after the election that he would soon release a \u201crealistic and balanced\u201d energy strategy, which analysts took as meaning one that would call for restarting at least some idled nuclear plants. But some analysts warned that Mr. Abe could still face a public backlash if he is seen as rushing to return Japan to its pre-accident status quo, especially if he fails to convince enough voters that the plants can be made safe.\u201cThe no-nukes candidates lost, but that doesn\u2019t mean there is suddenly a consensus in favor of nuclear power,\u201d said Shiro Asano, a retired professor of politics at Keio University.The election, in fact, appears to encapsulate the indecisiveness that has kept Japan paralyzed for nearly three years, since the triple meltdowns. After decades of marching forward in the belief that the resource-poor country needed cheap nuclear power to compete economically, Japan is no longer able to muster a new national consensus on it.At root, analysts say, is the deeper angst of a nation still grappling with the question raised by the disaster: Are the majority of Japanese who appear afraid to turn the plants back on willing to enter an uncharted, nuclear-free future that might consign their country to decades of lower growth? That question has taken on new urgency as a rising China is challenging Japan\u2019s influence in the region.Voters continue to send mixed signals, electing Mr. Abe, who has called the low-cost electricity from nuclear power a vital part of his popular Abenomics strategy to revive growth even as polls continue to show an ambivalence about atomic energy. Voters have chosen Mr. Abe\u2019s pro-nuclear governing party in national elections, but then oppose an immediate restart of the plants in opinion polls.That fuzzy message has left this consensus-driven country without a way forward, even as its once vaunted trade surplus has turned to a deficit, with soaring bills for fossil fuels to make up for the lost nuclear power.For the moment, many Japanese have compensated for higher electricity costs by embracing conservation efforts. And as was true even in the depths of the economic downturn, life for many Japanese remains relatively comfortable. The subways run like clockwork, the country is safer than many in the world and the economy is still the world\u2019s third largest.While there have been warnings of companies being driven overseas by high energy costs, so far the costs have at least partly been offset by an upturn in profits under Abenomics\u2019s lower-yen, growth-promoting policies, economists say.\u201cPeople cannot feel the economic damage now because of the overall lift from Abenomics,\u201d said Koji Nomura, an economics professor at Keio University in Tokyo. \u201cBut this is a bill that will come due.\u201dThe prime minister and his allies in the business community have argued as much, saying that the idling of the nation\u2019s 48 operable reactors since the accident three years ago threatens Abenomics by forcing Japan to import an extra $36 billion worth of natural gas and other fuel every year.But even Mr. Abe has been unwilling to force the point by turning the plants on, while a new regulatory agency has appeared reluctant to risk a public backlash by declaring reactors safe to operate. The watchdog was expected to make its first ruling last month on whether reactors meet new safety standards set in July, but a decision is now not expected until spring at the earliest.Popular fears of nuclear power have not been helped by the continuing problems that plague the cleanup at the Fukushima plant, and continued instances of the utility in charge hiding bad news, despite promises that it would change.\u201cI don\u2019t know which way to go,\u201d confessed Hajime Morikawa, 35, a temporary office worker who had come out to hear one of the antinuclear advocates before the election. \u201cI hope this becomes a step toward a nuclear-free future, but I don\u2019t see how we can just turn the nuclear plants off.\u201dThat type of sentiment helps explain the mixed messages of last weekend\u2019s election.While the candidate from the governing, pro-nuclear power party prevailed, analysts say he did so in part by distancing himself from its stance with vague expressions of support for a gradual phaseout of nuclear energy.The two candidates who called for immediately scrapping all atomic power plants also fared better than the results seemed to suggest, winning a combined 1.9 million votes, just 200,000 shy of the victor\u2019s tally. And the only avowedly pro-nuclear candidate of any stature, a former general, placed a distant fourth.At the same time, analysts said, Tokyo\u2019s voters proved unconvinced by the lofty vision articulated by the high-profile antinuclear candidate, former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and another retired prime minister, the popular Junichiro Koizumi, who campaigned at his side. In campaign speeches, the two men, both patrons of the nuclear industry turned apostates by the accident, spoke urgently of the need for Japan to discard nuclear power and become a pioneer in safer, renewable energies they say could drive an economic resurgence.But many analysts said the victory of the governing party candidate signaled that many voters found the appeals of Mr. Hosokawa and Mr. Koizumi unrealistic.As a sign of the depth of the internal conflict, fissures have begun to appear even in Japan\u2019s once solidly pro-nuclear business world. While the powerful Keidanren lobbying group representing Japan\u2019s business establishment still remains a vocal supporter of restarting nuclear plants, many younger companies have turned against it. Rifts have also appeared within Mr. Abe\u2019s governing party, where a group of about 50 mostly younger lawmakers have staged a revolt against Mr. Abe\u2019s unabashedly pro-nuclear stance.But the public has also appeared to lose interest in weekly antinuclear street protests in front of the prime minister\u2019s residence in Tokyo, where the number of people has dropped to a few hundred from tens of thousands two years ago.Some analysts say that in the end, they expect Japan to reject both the desire to go back to the pre-accident embrace of nuclear power, and idealistic calls to take more of a chance with the future. Instead, they say, they expect Japan to go back to the compromise position of a previous government that Mr. Abe scrapped when he took power: allowing the restart of the newest plants in exchange for promises that Japan will eventually shed nuclear power as realistic alternatives are developed.\u201cNeither Abe nor Hosokawa is at the center of public opinion,\u201d said Takeo Kikkawa, an expert on the energy industry at Tokyo\u2019s Hitotsubashi University. \u201cA gradual phaseout remains the best answer for solving the nuclear problem while preserving growth.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about Japan\u2019s indecisiveness toward nuclear power nearly three years after the Fukushima meltdowns included an outdated reference in some editions to Shiro Asano, who said losses by antinuclear candidates in the Feb. 9 election for Tokyo governor did not suggest a consensus in favor of nuclear power. He is a retired professor of politics at Keio University, not a current one.Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Rush to Blame the Fed", "Date": "2014-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 Last week, Turkey\u2019s central bank surprised investors by raising a key interest rate to 10 percent from 4.5 percent. It was a bold move to rein in inflation and calm the markets. But Turkey\u2019s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been vocal in blaming the \u201cinterest-rate lobby\u201d \u2014 a supposed conspiracy of foreign bankers, and some economists and journalists \u2014 for volatility in stock prices and a steep decline in the lira. Turkey is far from the only country to blame foreigners for recent market turmoil. Venezuela\u2019s president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, recently complained of a \u201cpsychological war from abroad.\u201d The governor of the Central Bank of Brazil, Alexandre Ant\u00f4nio Tombini, describes rising interest rates in rich countries as a \u201cvacuum cleaner\u201d that indiscriminately sucks capital out of emerging markets.Emerging markets are justified to be concerned about the recent \u201csudden stop\u201d in capital flows. In several economies \u2014 Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Russia, South Africa, Turkey \u2014 investors have been dumping stocks, currencies have depreciated and central bankers have been sounding the alarm. This will no doubt slow growth and create challenges at home. But for all the colorful language, this obsession with monetary policy in the developed world (code for the United States) is misplaced. Factors other than the \u201ctapering\u201d (the slowdown in asset-buying) by the Fed have been more important in determining why countries like Turkey have been hit hard over the past few months: underlying structural problems, inadequate policy responses and trends in the global economy.While a vacuum sucks everything in its path, investors tend to be more discriminating. The last few months have been no different. Turkey has been at the forefront of selling pressure as a result of political challenges \u2014 a corruption scandal that has dogged Mr. Erdogan\u2019s allies, and protests in defense of civil liberties and secularism \u2014 and a huge current account deficit, equal to about 7 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. A current account deficit is one of the most obvious measures of a country\u2019s reliance on foreign borrowing. Countries with larger deficits are more affected (and more likely to see their currencies drop) when United States interest rates rise, as evidenced since last spring\u2019s \u201ctaper turmoil,\u201d when anxieties erupted over the prospect that the Fed would start slowing its giant stimulus program, known as quantitative easing. Over the last few months, investors in emerging markets have become even more sophisticated. Countries are being assessed based on characteristics like their foreign reserve stockpiles, currency mismatches, recent credit growth, inflation and reliance on \u201chot\u201d money (speculative, short-term capital flows) relative to more stable foreign direct investment. Unfortunately Turkey does not perform well on any of these measures.Government policy responses are also increasingly important. If Turkey allows its currency to depreciate, exporters will become more competitive, which should boost growth and reduce the current account deficit over time. If Turkey were to impose capital controls, this would slow growth for an extended period. Last summer, India saw firsthand that even small restrictions on capital outflows could prompt sharp negative market reactions. Turkey\u2019s choice to raise interest rates will also slow growth over the next few quarters \u2014 but the drag should not last as long, especially if investors believe that the government is committed to sound economic policies.One focus of these policies should be to build the confidence of domestic investors and of foreigners, too. The domestic investor base in many emerging markets has grown in size and sophistication and holds more internationally diversified portfolios. Decisions by these investors and savers to shift money abroad in response to political unrest or Fed tapering in Washington can quickly aggravate the effects of foreign capital withdrawals. But if Turkish citizens are confident in investment opportunities at home, they can play an important role in stabilizing their domestic market. A number of emerging markets, like Chile and South Korea, benefited from this stabilizing role of domestic investors during the financial turmoil in 2008.A final important step is to recognize that American monetary policy is only one of many factors driving major shifts in global capital flows. Changes in expected global growth and global uncertainty \u2014 both of which can be affected by events in emerging markets \u2014 have recently played an even more important role. The sell-off in emerging markets that began late last year, for example, was sparked by weak Chinese manufacturing data \u2014 not the news of American monetary policy. The Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement on Dec. 18 that it would slow its asset purchases to $75 billion a month, from $85 billion a month, had minimal effect on markets, partly because that move came amid increased confidence in the global economy and upgraded growth forecasts for large economies such as China. The sell-off this week, which has sent benchmark emerging market indexes to their lowest level since 2008, was sparked by weaker manufacturing data in the United States.Indeed, my research shows that monetary policy in the United States isn\u2019t nearly as omnipotent in shaping private capital flows to and from emerging markets as is commonly believed. From 1990 to 2013, higher interest rates in the United States actually corresponded to greater, rather than lower, private capital flows to emerging markets (as a share of G.D.P.). But global economic growth, and general macroeconomic risks, were far more influential in predicting the flow of capital to these countries. That doesn\u2019t mean that the Fed has no impact on the global economy. But it suggests that the world\u2019s emerging markets need to pursue sound policies to protect their currencies and stock markets from plunging and to be more resilient in the face of global macroeconomic developments. If they do that, they can avoid the vacuum effect, and only get a light dusting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case for Swapping Roles With China", "Date": "2014-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ShelfStephen Roach proposes to remake the two largest economies on the globe, ours and China\u2019s. For decades, he writes, the United States and China relied too much on a \u201cmarriage of convenience\u201d that guaranteed China a huge market for its exports. In exchange, China gave American consumers a cornucopia of inexpensive products, while creating a willing buyer of the United States government\u2019s swollen debt. But that marriage has played out, Mr. Roach says; it has warped the two economies, leaving them ill-equipped for further growth.Mr. Roach suggests that the way for the two nations to prosper is jointly. If China is to build a consumer society and find jobs for millions of peasants flooding into cities looking for work, it must create a robust services sector. The trick for the United States is to build its exports by helping China meet that need, exploiting American expertise in everything from running retail chains to overnight delivery to professional services. China is already the third-largest importer of American products. It has gobbled up American producer goods, so prospects for broader American exports are good. Mr. Roach calculates that a $4 trillion market is opening up for foreign providers.None of that will come easily, Mr. Roach concedes. He says China can probably pull it off \u2014 its consumerist goals are already built into its Five-Year Plan. But he wonders, without offering much of a blueprint, whether the American people and their elected leaders can stomach the sacrifices of saving rather than consuming.The alternative, he worries, might be more fist-shaking toward China and, conceivably, a devastating trade war that nobody wants. Strident anti-Chinese voices in Congress aren\u2019t entirely bad, Mr. Roach says \u2014 a Senate bill proposing trade sanctions spooked China into lifting the value of its currency, thus raising the price of Chinese products. But if the United States economy doesn\u2019t revive and Washington actually enacts trade sanctions, a tit-for-tat exchange of curbs could carom out of hand as Beijing replies in kind.Mr. Roach offers an evenhanded, thorough response to the anti-China potshots from Democrats and Republicans alike. It is surprising, though, how matter-of-factly he seems to accept that America is on a downhill slope. In the fresh relationship that he sketches for the two world powers, China is the mature senior partner and America its problematic, less-reliable junior. Mr. Roach is a global affairs senior fellow at Yale who once led Morgan Stanley Asia. A top Wall Street global economist, he was struck by how adroitly China dodged being drawn into the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s (by pushing cheap exports to finance huge dollar reserves). \u201cIt didn\u2019t take long for me to get hooked on the Chinese development miracle,\u201d he writes. The root problem, Mr. Roach says repeatedly, is America\u2019s inability to save enough at home to finance its growth \u2014 a situation that is hardly China\u2019s fault. And a day of reckoning is coming. If China devotes more of its surplus savings to funding a decent pension plan or health care for its citizens, it will spend that much less at Treasury auctions.Mr. Roach walks a line between explaining China and excusing it. He stresses that its modern economy, barely three decades old, is still learning the game. He notes that though China has a terrible record on intellectual-property rights, the West has dealt with intellectual-property issues since the 1400s; China\u2019s patent law dates only to 1985.And, yes, the Internet is censored, often heavy-handedly, but it does exist and even thrive in China; it has by far the world\u2019s largest Internet community, which plays a vital role in creating the new consumer economy.Mr. Roach understands that China, in many ways still a poor country, differs vastly from the United States. He acknowledges the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s many flaws. He knows that it cracks down proactively on any dissent that threatens its rule. He is aware that dealings between Washington and Beijing can sour for innumerable reasons. And he is terribly pessimistic about political myopia and paralysis in Washington. But \u201cthe endgame provides enormous opportunity for each,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe challenge is for both to see it.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indonesian Arms Industry Seeks to Drum Up Business", "Date": "2014-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySINGAPORE \u2014 While the Indonesian government is snubbing the Singapore Airshow this week, the country\u2019s main military manufacturer is using it as an opportunity for a coming-out party, with staff members in orange flight suits courting potential buyers.\u201cI think they\u2019ve been doing good just to sustain their operations and production in recent years,\u201d said Lis Gindarsah, a military analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta, Indonesia.Indonesia\u2019s military industry nearly collapsed in the late 1990s, when the nation\u2019s economy contracted a staggering 16 percent, leading to sharp budget and work force cuts by Indonesian military and aviation manufacturers. The Indonesian military also suffered when the United States imposed a ban on arms sales to the country after gross human rights violations by its military in East Timor in 1999.The ban was not fully lifted until 2010 and exposed the need for Indonesia\u2019s military to get up to speed.A major reason for the comeback now is Indonesia\u2019s president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who vowed to modernize the country\u2019s military and has nearly quadrupled the state arms budget to more than $8 billion since taking office in 2004. Under a 2012 law pushed by the president, the Indonesian military, known as the T.N.I., must buy all of its weaponry, with some exceptions, from domestic contractors, both state-owned and private.\u201cWe are working closely with our friends from European countries and the United States to win some sales campaigns in this region,\u201d Mr. Budiman said.Indonesian Aerospace is proceeding with plans this year to build fighter aircraft jointly with South Korea. And although it had yet to close any deals this week, the government agreed last month to sell two multipurpose aircraft to the Philippine Air Force for 813 million pesos, or $18.1 million, with a further six in the pipeline, he said.\u201cWe are now doing great as a result of the restructuring of the company\u2019s balance sheet, equity, business operation, product portfolio and many other reasons,\u201d Mr. Budiman said.Although the Indonesian armed forces will account for about 80 percent of all purchases of locally produced weaponry, the country\u2019s National Police will also be a buyer, and hopes are high for more regional buyers, Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, Indonesia\u2019s deputy defense minister, said in an interview.The company and the industry are coming back from the brink with help from Mr. Yudhoyono. A retired three-star army general, he made military spending a priority.Indonesia\u2019s military industry has had a rocky history, including periods during which it was run by Dutch and Japanese colonialists. In the late 1990s, when military and aviation manufacturers cut back, Indonesian Aerospace shut down most of its assembly lines in Bandung, the capital of West Java Province, and laid off about 12,000 workers.The ban on arms sales revealed problems with Indonesia\u2019s military. Among them was that many of its C-130 transport planes, built by the giant American company Lockheed Martin, were grounded because the military was unable to buy spare parts.\u201cThe conclusion was that we had to revitalize our defense industries,\u201d Mr. Sjafrie said. \u201cFor years we had an embargo; we don\u2019t want to repeat history again.\u201dWhile Indonesia itself is not participating in the Singapore show, international events like it are helping to showcase Indonesian military contractors.The companies must meet requirements set by the government \u2014 like meeting budgets and maintaining technical capabilities \u2014 and in exchange, Jakarta promotes them at shows and in the course of bilateral relations with other countries, Mr. Sjafrie said.\u201cI think it\u2019s a good chance for the defense industry,\u201d said Wahyu Utomo, Pindad\u2019s director. \u201cWe can manage our resources and our money, if we know the long-term spending program of the T.N.I. It\u2019s become our guidance.\u201dUnder Mr. Yudhoyono\u2019s military policy, a special committee was formed in 2013 to coordinate domestic production for the military, in particular manufacture of combat and special-use vehicles, warships and submarines, fixed-wing and rotary aircraft, and light and heavy weaponry.Indonesian military contractors are also producing or negotiating agreements with military suppliers from several countries on joint production of weaponry so Indonesia can gain access to advanced technology. Potential projects include production of submarines with Daewoo Shipbuilding of South Korea, a medium tank with FNSS Savunma Sistemleri of Turkey, antiship missiles with the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, and vehicle-fixed rocket launchers with MBDA of France.Late last year, Pindad completed assembly of 11 Panser armored vehicles whose parts were manufactured by Doosan Infracore of South Korea, in a deal worth $169 million.Pindad officials said they were hoping to sign an agreement this year with AM General, the American heavy vehicle manufacturer that produces the HMMWV, or Humvee, to supply components to Indonesia.The Malaysian armed forces are negotiating to buy 32 armored personnel carriers from Pindad for $10 million and $14 million each, and the Brunei military is also interested in buying, Mr. Sjafrie said.It remains to be seen whether Indonesia\u2019s military industry revitalization policy will have any measurable effect on the country\u2019s economy \u2014 which is already the 16th-largest in the world, thanks to commodities exports and domestic consumption \u2014 or on local regions with arms production plants, including Bandung, Surabaya, Batam Island in western Indonesia and Banyuwangi in East Java Province.The country, which has a population of 240 million people, spends less on the military than Singapore, which has five million people.\u201cMade in Indonesia\u201d weaponry and joint production agreements still cannot meet all of the Indonesian military\u2019s needs, however.The military budget also allocated money to upgrade 24 F-16 fighters given to Indonesia by the United States and five C-130 aircraft from Australia.An article on Friday about Indonesia\u2019s efforts to reinvigorate its military industry misstated the combined amount of money the government in 2012 injected into Indonesian Aerospace and the state-owned ship builder PAL Indonesia. It was 3 trillion rupiah (about $250 million), not 3 billion rupiah (about $250,000).Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rajoy Vows to Cut Taxes, Saying Spain Is Recovering", "Date": "2014-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, on Tuesday announced an income-tax cut for low earners and a reduction in social security contributions by employers, citing an economic recovery he said would let Spain shift away from austerity measures.In a state of the nation address that focused on the economy, Mr. Rajoy suggested that his country had turned a corner, after coming out of recession in the third quarter of last year.Until recently, \u201cwe were a burden for Europe, and now Spain is going forward and is part of the engine,\u201d Mr. Rajoy told lawmakers. \u201cThe time has come to soften demands now that the sacrifices that Spanish society has made are yielding fruit.\u201dMr. Rajoy described Spain as \u201ca country that is regaining confidence.\u201dOpposition lawmakers accused him of unjustified triumphalism. While Mr. Rajoy said the government was preparing a new job-creation plan, opposition lawmakers stressed a high unemployment rate and the growing wealth gap.Mr. Rajoy said the economy would grow 1 percent this year, up from a previous forecast of 0.7 percent. That upward revision was in line with a forecast for Spain published on Tuesday by the European Commission. For the 18-country euro zone, the commission predicted growth of 1.2 percent in 2014 and 1.8 percent in 2015. The commission had previously forecast growth of 1.1 percent this year and 1.7 percent in 2015.For the broader, 28-country European Union, the commission also raised its forecasts by 0.1 percentage point, to 1.5 percent in 2014 and 2 percent in 2015.\u201cThe worst of the crisis may now be behind us, but this is not an invitation to be complacent, as the recovery is still modest,\u201d said Olli Rehn, the Union\u2019s commissioner for economic affairs.Despite the overall upgrade, the commission \u2014 the administrative arm of the European Union \u2014 slightly lowered its forecast for Italy to 0.6 percent, from 0.7 percent. The cut comes amid a government reshuffle in Rome, triggered by Matteo Renzi, who is taking over as prime minister, the country\u2019s youngest.Mr. Rajoy, speaking to Parliament, did not detail his plan to cut taxes. But he said it would be aimed at middle and lower incomes and would exempt from income taxes those earning up to 12,000 euros, or about $16,500.Meanwhile, employers will have to pay only a flat fee of \u20ac100 a month for each permanent hire in the first two years. That would replace the current system, in which employers make contributions that vary with workers\u2019 earnings.Fiscal experts said it was hard to predict how much impact the changes would have, until the government announced its broader fiscal reform plan, which was expected soon.Mr. Rajoy\u2019s political opponents on Tuesday sought to paint a darker picture of the Spanish economy.Soraya Rodr\u00edguez, a lawmaker who is the parliamentary spokeswoman for Spain\u2019s opposition Socialist party, said Mr. Rajoy delivered a speech \u201cclearly far removed from the reality of Spaniards.\u201d She reminded Mr. Rajoy that Spain\u2019s jobless rate had risen to 26 percent, from 21 percent when he came into office in late 2011.During Mr. Rajoy\u2019s mandate, \u201cone million jobs have been destroyed,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is the reality.\u201dSeparately in Brussels, the commission forecast on Tuesday that the euro zone\u2019s unemployment rate would decline to 11.7 percent by 2015, from 12 percent now.Mr. Rajoy is due to call another general election next year. Even as Spain\u2019s economy shows signs of improvement, Mr. Rajoy faces considerable challenges, including a corruption investigation into alleged kickbacks paid to him and other senior politicians from his Popular Party. Madrid is also struggling with a secessionist drive in Catalonia, whose politicians plan to hold an independence referendum in November.Mr. Rajoy said Tuesday that he would \u201cfight for the Catalans, for their progress and well-being,\u201d but without allowing Spain\u2019s northeastern region to hold an independence referendum that would violate the Constitution. Catalan lawmakers responded by warning that Mr. Rajoy\u2019s intransigence risked fueling secessionist demands.\u201cI am sure that he has just increased the number of independentists,\u201d said Josep Antoni Duran i Lleida, a lawmaker from Convergence and Union, the largest and governing party in Catalonia, speaking in a televised news conference after Mr. Rajoy\u2019s address. Mr. Rajoy, he added, \u201cis incapable of offering an alternative over which we can have a dialogue. \u201cAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jewish Hospital a Fixture in Tehran", "Date": "2014-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 Sitting in his office at Tehran\u2019s only Jewish hospital, Ciamak Morsadegh lit another cigarette and reminisced about how his wife left Iran for the United States after he insisted on staying.Dr. Morsadegh, the director of the Dr. Sapir Hospital and Charity Center here, said that unlike thousands of other Jews he has never thought about leaving the Islamic Republic, for the simple reason that Iran is his home.\u201cI speak English, I pray in Hebrew, but I think in Persian,\u201d said Dr. Morsadegh, a surgeon who is also a member of Parliament. \u201cI am Iranian. Iranian-Jewish.\u201d\u201cWe Jews are a part of Iran\u2019s history,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is important is that Mr. Rouhani makes big news out of supporting us. He is showing that we, as a religious minority, are part of this country, too.\u201dSituated on Mostafa Khomeini Street \u2014 named for the son of the Islamic Republic\u2019s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini \u2014 the hospital sits across from the Imam Reza Seminary school, one of the oldest Shiite seminaries in Tehran. White-turbaned clerics pass by, talking in hushed tones with their students. Though the hospital might seem out of place, local people do not seem to think so.\u201cWhen I am sick I go across the street,\u201d Mohammad Mirghanin, a seminary student, said as he rushed to class. \u201cThey might have a different religion, but they are fellow Iranians. I do not see why I should not go to the Jewish hospital.\u201dOn Saturday, a woman in a traditional black chador approached Khoddad Asnashahri, the hospital\u2019s managing director and a Muslim, and asked for help.\u201cI went to the Iman Khomeini hospital with my daughter who needs a sonogram, but over there it costs 500,000 toman,\u201d or roughly $200, said the woman, Zahra Hajabdolmaleki.\u201cWe will help you here for half that amount,\u201d Mr. Asnashahri pledged.Named after a Jewish doctor who died in 1921 while trying to cure patients during a typhus epidemic raging through Tehran, the hospital started out as a clinic where all Iranians could come for medical care at vastly reduced rates. For more than 50 years it has been a meeting point for Iranian Jews and Muslims and the most prominent Jewish charity in the capital.Mr. Asnashahri, who has worked at the hospital for nearly 48 years, praised the \u201cgood atmosphere\u201d while also noting that only five Jewish physicians remained. \u201cMany have migrated and others have bought shares in more modern hospitals,\u201d he said.About 96 percent of patients are Muslim, like most of the hospital\u2019s employees. But what mattered most, he said, was the message that \u201chere all people can come, no matter what religion, color or race.\u201dThough the Jewish population of Iran is dwindling \u2014 now at about 9,000, according to an official census by the Statistical Center of Iran, though other estimates range to 20,000 \u2014 the country has the largest number of Jews in the Middle East after Israel.Dr. Morsadegh, the surgeon, has devoted his life to that diminishing community. He was a leader of the Tehran Jewish Committee, a group that supports synagogues, schools and other facets of Jewish life in Iran, and in 2008 was elected as the Jewish representative in Parliament, where five official religious minorities have a permanent seat.He will not say that the situation for Jews and the other official religious minorities \u2014 Christian Armenians, Assyrians, Chaldeans and Zoroastrians \u2014 is perfect in Iran. The five minorities would like to see an Islamic law changed that allows one of their faith who converts to Islam to get the entire inheritance of his or her non-Muslim family, for example. Yet things are worse for evangelical Christians and Bahais, who can face prison sentences and in many cases exclusion from higher education.Dr. Morsadegh said former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s repeated Holocaust denials left psychological scars, as well. \u201cLook, all Jews believe in the Holocaust,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been much better if the former president had not raised that issue.\u201d\u201cIt has gotten a lot better,\u201d Dr. Morsadegh said, recalling how thousands of Jews left the country after the 1979 revolution. Many more have emigrated since then, often because of Iran\u2019s bad economy.Though Dr. Sapir Hospital is Jewish owned, there is not much that would remind one of Jewish heritage. On the wall of Dr. Morsadegh\u2019s office are two portraits of Iran\u2019s past and current supreme leaders, facing a painting of Moses holding up the Ten Commandments.In September, Dr. Morsadegh joined President Rouhani on his trip to the United Nations in New York. Some in Iran have hinted at a connection between the president\u2019s financial donation to the hospital and Dr. Morsadegh\u2019s enthusiastic defense of Iran and the position of Jews in the country.But the doctor is not bothered by those questions. \u201cI helped out in the war with Iraq for this country, as a first aid doctor,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d do it again tomorrow.\u201dAn article last Monday about Tehran\u2019s only Jewish hospital, Dr. Sapir Hospital and Charity Center, and its place in the history of Iran\u2019s Jewish community rendered the name of an Iranian currency incorrectly.

{"Headline": "Hong Kong\u2019s Indentured Servants", "Date": "2014-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEach year hundreds of thousands of young Indonesian women like Ms. Erwiana fan out across Asia and the Middle East to live in the homes of local people and serve as their domestic helpers \u2014 cooking, cleaning and caring for children and the elderly. Most send a portion of their salary home to their families every month, fueling an Indonesian economy that relies on remittances. More than 320,000 foreign domestic helpers live in Hong Kong, a city of seven million people, and close to half of them come from Indonesia.Although Hong Kong has better legal protections for foreign domestic helpers than other Asian countries like Singapore and Malaysia, the laws that govern their living and working conditions are discriminatory and foster an environment that can lead to abuse. Ms. Erwiana was by no means the first victim in Hong Kong of a horrible beating, and unless changes are made to the law, she won\u2019t be the last.The most restrictive requirement on foreign maids in Hong Kong is the so-called live-in law, which requires that the guest workers reside with their employers. Many employers give maids small windowless closets for bedrooms, and sometimes worse. The live-in rule means that maids are often on call 24 hours a day. And maids with abusive employers have few places to go or people they can turn to for help.The minimum wage for foreign maids in Hong Kong \u2014 a flat rate of $517 per month \u2014 works out to be significantly lower than it is for locals, which is about $3.85 per hour. By paying foreign maids much less for longer working hours, Hong Kong has, in effect, created an underclass of foreign female laborers. The women who take care of Hong Kong\u2019s children and elderly are on the lowest rung of the socioeconomic ladder.And while the legal code is flawed, it is also often flouted. Many employers and placement agents hold maids\u2019 travel documents to prevent them from leaving the territory without permission. They are often paid less than the minimum wage and forced to work seven days a week.Thousands of maids each year file complaints with the Hong Kong Labor Department over contract disputes. A survey by the Mission for Migrant Workers, a nongovernmental organization, reported in 2013 that some 18 percent of maids said they were physically abused by their employers.Yet thousands of women still migrate to Hong Kong, appreciative of the opportunity to earn money that wouldn\u2019t be available to them at home. This workforce of women contributes significantly to their home-country economies: All foreign workers from the Philippines, the other main source of maids in Hong Kong, sent $24 billion home in 2012, while Indonesians sent home an estimated $7.1 billion.My work as a photojournalist took me to Indonesia and Hong Kong between November 2012 and February 2013 to investigate the recruitment of Indonesian domestic helpers and the conditions in which they live in Hong Kong. I spoke with many domestic workers and while some seemed content, a shocking number told of misery and abuse.Lista, 26, was excited to start her new job in Hong Kong when I spoke with her there in November 2012. But after talking about how much she was looking forward to the money, she said, almost jokingly, that living conditions in Hong Kong are not always good. Her sister had to resign as a maid in order to leave the tiny nook in which she was sleeping: a windowless pantry. She also talked, not without horror, about her friend who was forced to sleep on her employer\u2019s dining room table once they had all gone to bed.While the Hong Kong legal system and abusive employers are to blame for many of the hardships maids face in the Chinese territory, the situation is more complex. Indonesia\u2019s government and private business people actively support this flawed system.In Indramayu, a town in West Java, Indonesia, I met Bunda Pitrin and her husband Milyanto, who were brokers for domestic-helper recruitment agencies. They sell the dream of a better life abroad to young female villagers and their families.Each maid they send to a recruitment center in Jakarta brings them around $685. They promise 30 percent to the woman\u2019s family, to encourage them to let her leave home.Yayu Rolya Subandiyah, 26, arrived in Hong Kong in August 2012. Before moving, she had spent six months in a training center in Java, a requirement of the Indonesian government, where she was taught the basics of cooking, cleaning and some English and Cantonese.Like all of her compatriots, she had to pay back the fees for the training classes. When maids arrive in Hong Kong, most women are forced to relinquish a large part of their salary each month to repay the cost of the training back home. This ties them to their new jobs in Hong Kong, and makes it more difficult for them to leave when the situation is bad.In Ms. Yayu\u2019s case, things quickly became complicated with her employer. During her second week on the job, her employer, in a fit of rage, threw some cleaning product into her eyes. She fled out of fear. Her first instinct was to seek refuge with her placement agency, but she found that the agents there did not want to know about her troubles, and she was encouraged to return to her employer.By creating conditions that keep Indonesian women tied to their debts, while limiting their movements and underpaying them, the Indonesian and Hong Kong governments and the recruiters force maids into a form of indentured servitude. The people of Hong Kong should demand that their government rectify the legal discrimination and provide more protections for their domestic workers. And Indonesians should do their part to reshape the recruitment system so foreign worker safety and dignity come before profits.As Ms. Yayu told me in Hong Kong, \u201cWe come here to work, not to be humiliated or tortured.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vehicle Dependability Declines Significantly in J.D. Power Study", "Date": "2014-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDavid Sargent, global automotive vice president of J.D. Power, called the results a \u201cstep backward\u201d and characterized the 6 percent increase in the number of problems as \u201cvery significant.\u201d\u201cIn hindsight, we can see why it happened,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what we weren\u2019t anticipating is that at the same time a couple of things got worse, pretty much nothing much got better.\u201dThe study, now in its 25th year, measures problems experienced by the original owners of three-year-old vehicles over the previous 12 months. This year\u2019s study is based on responses of more than 41,000 owners of vehicles from the 2011 model year.Not all automakers suffered a decline, however. Fifteen had fewer problems than in the last study, one automaker stayed the same and 15 had more problems. But the brands that fared worse this year, including Ford, Hyundai and Nissan, sold a lot more vehicles than the brands whose scores improved, like Jaguar and Land Rover, Mr. Sargent said.Topping the list for the third consecutive year is Lexus, which had three fewer problems than in 2013. Although Lexus lost the top ranking in 2009-11, it had been on top of the survey for 14 years before that.The study covers some 200 problem areas in eight major categories including exterior, seats, engine and transmission. J.D. Power then ranks brands by the number of problems reported per 100 vehicles; the lower the number of problems, the higher the ranking.After Lexus (68 problems per 100), the brands that round out the top 10 are Mercedes-Benz (104), Cadillac (107), Acura (109), Buick (112), Honda (114), Lincoln (114), Toyota (114), Porsche (125) and Infiniti (128).Among individual vehicles, two are tied as the industry\u2019s most dependable 2011 model, with only 62 problems per 100 vehicles: the Cadillac DTS and the Lexus LS.Engine and transmission problems increased by nearly 6 problems per 100 vehicles over last year, which accounts for the majority of the overall increase in problems reported, of 7 per 100.For vehicles with 4-cylinder engines, problems increased by nearly 10 per 100 vehicles, partly a result of the shift by many manufacturers to build more cars with these smaller engines.\u201cIf you spend your life driving a V6 or V8 and suddenly jump into a 4, it isn\u2019t going to feel right,\u201d Mr. Sargent said. \u201cIt feels different and it sounds different.\u201d He said automakers\u2019 efforts to improve fuel economy had resulted in negative customers\u2019 perceptions of how their engines were working.\u201cA lot of the root cause is software,\u201d Mr. Sargent added. \u201cThe engine and transmission are programmed to respond in a certain way to customer input. But it manifests itself as a mechanical problem.\u201dOwners, in turn, often complain that the engines hesitate or feel underpowered, and that the transmission shifts roughly or too quickly.\u201cCustomers are saying, \u2018We don\u2019t like this,\u2019 and they perceive it as a problem,\u201d Mr. Sargent said.So are these issues a matter of perception, or are they real problems?\u201cIt\u2019s both,\u201d Mr. Sargent said. \u201cThey are all real problems: In the consumer\u2019s mind, there is something wrong with the vehicle. Some of them are defects; others are characteristics of the vehicle that the customer doesn\u2019t like. An engineer might argue it\u2019s not a defect, it\u2019s how it was designed. But the consumer is saying, \u2018I don\u2019t like the way you designed it, and that\u2019s a problem for me.\u2019 \u201dIn this year\u2019s survey, Ford had 140 problems per 100 vehicles, which is 13 more than last year. The automaker ranked 17th this year, just below the industry average of 133 problems per 100 vehicles \u2013 down from 13th place in last year\u2019s study.Other findings of the study include:\u25a0 The increase in problems affected both domestic and foreign automakers. The domestic brands were at 138 problems per 100 vehicles, and the imports were at 130, meaning the dependability gap continued to narrow between the American and foreign automakers. The difference last year was 10 problems per 100 vehicles. However, \u201cit\u2019s as much because the imports got worse than it is that the domestics got better,\u201d Mr. Sargent said.\u25a0 Land Rover was the most improved brand, with 41 fewer problems than last year. It ranks 29th. Jaguar\u2019s improvement was second-best, with 32 fewer problems than last year, ranking 13th. Following that was Cadillac, with 21 fewer problems and a third-place ranking.\u25a0 Ram had 43 more problems than last year, making it the brand with the largest increase in problems, taking it from ninth to 25th place. Mr. Sargent attributed this partly to a change in the sales mix. Ram went from selling more light-duty trucks in last year\u2019s study, to selling more heavy-duty trucks. Heavy-duty trucks tend to have more problems.\u25a0 Mini ranked last \u2013 in 31st place \u2013 with 185 problems per 100 vehicles. That is 35 more problems than last year.\u25a0 Porsche, with 125 problems per 100 vehicles, had 31 more than last year, but still managed to rank ninth.\u25a0 Out of the 172 vehicles included in the study, six of the 12 highest-scoring models were made by Lexus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Fails to Pass Three-Month Extension of Jobless Aid", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate failed to move forward on a three-month extension of assistance for the long-term unemployed on Thursday, leaving it unlikely that Congress would approve the measure soon while undercutting a key aspect of President Obama\u2019s economic recovery plan.Fifty-nine senators, including four Republicans, voted to advance the legislation, falling one vote short of the 60 needed to break a Republican filibuster effort.Republicans and Democrats, many from the nation\u2019s most economically depressed states, had been trying to reach a solution that would allow people who have exhausted their unemployment insurance to continue receiving benefits as long as the government offset the $6 billion cost.Ultimately, how to pay for the program proved too big a hurdle for senators to overcome.\u201cWe\u2019ve given them everything they wanted. Paid for,\u201d said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, flashing his irritation at Republicans who blocked the bill.He said Democrats would keep pushing to extend the benefits, which expired at the end of last year, cutting off more than 1.3 million Americans. That number has since grown to more than 1.7 million.Democrats hope to turn the issue into an election-year cudgel and have accused Republicans of ignoring people who are out of work. Republicans have balked at that as political smoke.\u201cWe know it\u2019s a political game,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. \u201cWe know they\u2019d like to bring it up every three months and bash Republicans with it.\u201dMr. Obama has repeatedly pressed Congress to extend the program, an emergency measure enacted during the recession to provide up to 47 weeks of supplemental payments to the long-term unemployed.\u201cWe cannot allow one vote to stand in the way of supporting these Americans as they struggle to find work,\u201d a White House statement said Thursday. \u201cBoth sides of the aisle have worked together to prevent this kind of hardship in the past, and neglecting to do so now is unacceptable \u2014 especially given the high long-term unemployment rate.\u201dBut even if the Senate had moved forward, getting any extension through the Republican-controlled House was going to be very difficult. Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio has said he would entertain a bill only if it was paid for and could stimulate job growth.Some of his more conservative members, who said the extension would only create more debt for future generations to deal with, were even more hesitant.\u201cThe perception that I get from the Senate right now is: \u2018Times are tough. We should make times tougher on our kids to make it easier on us, and then feel better,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Representative James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s just not a philosophy I\u2019m willing to support.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Meeting Turns Into a Lightning Round for Obama and Boehner", "Date": "2014-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner sat across from each other for an hour on Tuesday in the leather-bound chairs of Mr. Obama\u2019s office and quickly ticked through a remarkably long list of issues.They chatted about economic matters like manufacturing, trade promotion authority and flood insurance, according to aides to both men. They discussed the Affordable Care Act and the president\u2019s push for an immigration overhaul. They engaged on efforts to wind down the war in Afghanistan, the process of getting a budget, and the stalled highway funding bill. And don\u2019t forget the California drought and Mr. Obama\u2019s new plan for fighting fires.All told, they spent about five and a half minutes on each of the subject areas. (Less, actually, since the above list is not a complete record of the topics covered during the conversation, Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said.)But while the meeting offered a rare moment for private sharing by the leaders of America\u2019s two dominant political parties, few of their colleagues expect it to lead to any legislative breakthroughs. Aides to both men on Tuesday called it \u201cconstructive\u201d but offered no evidence that Washington gridlock is over.\u201cThey agreed that there is a lot of work to do the rest of the year, and it is important to work together wherever we can find common ground,\u201d an aide to Mr. Boehner said in an email to reporters after the meeting. Mr. Carney maintained that the White House \u201cis looking for a partner in Congress.\u201d But he also noted that Mr. Boehner had in the past said he would never again negotiate with Mr. Obama. Mr. Carney declined to say whether there seemed to be any softening on the no-negotiation stance.The president and Mr. Boehner have spent most of the past five years in a series of awkward and often fruitless negotiations. Tuesday\u2019s exchange of views was the first publicly known, in-person, one-on-one since December 2012, and the only such talk since Mr. Obama became president that was not aimed at resolving some sort of looming fiscal crisis. It is unclear whether Mr. Obama might have had another, private message to deliver to Mr. Boehner during Tuesday\u2019s surprise meeting, which was revealed late Monday night in the president\u2019s daily schedule. But nothing in their dealings so far suggested a new d\u00e9tente is in the works. The two political adversaries met Tuesday even as the leaders in both parties in Washington have largely resigned themselves to the fact that almost no major legislation will break through in the current election year. Republicans are trying to seize control of the Senate this fall, as Democrats scramble to try to defeat as many Republicans in the House as they can.Mr. Obama, for his part, has spent the month since his State of the Union address vowing to circumvent Congress whenever possible \u2014 and has acknowledged publicly that he does not have high hopes for progress on economic issues or an immigration overhaul.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a Congress that prefers to say no rather than yes right now,\u201d Mr. Obama told Democratic governors last week. \u201cThey don\u2019t have an affirmative agenda. Their main strategy is to just try to do nothing and see if they can \u2014 falsely \u2014 give people a sense that somehow the policies that we\u2019re trying to pursue aren\u2019t working for them.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Boehner has done little to suggest his House would advance any of the president\u2019s agenda in the months leading up to the midterm elections, telling his members this month that he would not pursue the immigration legislation that Mr. Obama supports, but that angered conservative Republicans.Republicans have vowed to continue their push to roll back or change the Affordable Care Act, and in a message posted on Twitter, even as the speaker was arriving at the White House, Mr. Boehner took a political jab at the president\u2019s top domestic policy.\u201c#ObamaCare may increase premiums for 11 million workers, report says,\u201d the message from the @SpeakerBoehner Twitter account read.After Mr. Boehner finished the meeting in the White House, he slipped out without talking with reporters and returned to the Capitol. Moments later, he took to the floor \u2014 but not to wax poetic about the \u201cconstructive\u201d meeting he had just had.Instead, he used a new \u2014 and disputed \u2014 report on the costs of insurance premiums to attack the president\u2019s health care law. \u201cAnother sucker punch to our economy,\u201d he called it. \u201cAnother broken promise to hardworking Americans.\u201dThe next Oval Office meeting might not come for another year.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Would Jean Monnet Have Done?", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 Money is an instrument of governance as well as commerce. In almost all countries on earth, the change in people\u2019s pockets and the bank notes in their wallets are an assertion of national sovereignty.Today, there is an exception: the euro, the common currency of 18 of the member states of the European Union. The euro zone puts these countries in the vanguard of the greatest experiment in regional cooperation the world has ever known.Yet that venture has had a rough five years. In the wake of the Great Recession, the euro has become economically disruptive and politically divisive, pitting the states of northern and southern Europe against one another. The crisis is not over, but Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and their fellow leaders are determined to keep the euro zone intact. They are reinforcing accords on national budgets, spending and financial regulation, pushing ahead with a banking union, and tackling unemployment.These measures are necessary to salvage economic integration and serve its original purpose: to bind up the wounds of the most bloodstained continent in modern history and turn it into a zone of peace, prosperity and democracy, governed by common policies and administrative structures.That is the European Project. Its master architect, Jean Monnet \u2014 even though he died nearly 35 years ago \u2014 would have understood the mistakes, dilemmas and dangers that threaten that project now. It is likely he would also have supported the remedies that European leaders are attempting, since they fit with his conviction that political institution-building and economic integration had to be carefully synchronized.Monnet has been hailed as a statesman. In fact, he was something far rarer and more consequential \u2014 a key figure in the transformation of the concept of statehood itself. He never held elective office or a ministerial post, but he was an effective advocate. Modernization, this Frenchman believed, was more than the exploitation of new technologies to improve industry, transportation and communication; it also meant adjusting to the ways in which individual nations were conjoined by an ever thickening skein of economic transactions.Monnet quit school when he was 16 to enter the family brandy business. The experience taught him to respect consistency of method and the importance of proper sequence in a complex process: hanging the vines on meticulously laid-out trellises, fermenting the juices of the grapes for weeks, distilling them twice, then storing the final product in neatly arrayed oak casks in dark cellars for anywhere from two years to five decades or more. As a salesman of this patiently produced and precious commodity, he absorbed the basics of finance and commerce.The House of Monnet was competing against Cognac\u2019s superpowers, Hennessy and Martell. But brandy merchants also depended on cooperation to broaden the global market for the benefit of all. An environment conducive to vigorous trade was a common good. That was an ethos that suited Monnet\u2019s temperament.At the end of his long life, Monnet described his birthplace as a brandy town where \u201cone did one thing, slowly and with concentration.\u201d That could have served as a motto for his life: the cultivation and marketing of a grand plan to bring lasting peace to Europe.Like the liberal economist John Maynard Keynes, Monnet came to view the \u201cwar guilt\u201d clause in the Versailles Treaty, which concluded the First World War, as a mistake. It enforced a Carthaginian peace on Germany, demanding reparations in the form of payments and transfers of property, and sowed the seeds of the next conflict.Even in the dark days of the late 1930s and early \u201940s, however, when the Axis dominated most of the Continent, Monnet was thinking ahead about how to break the cycle of total war followed by a false peace. At a meeting of the French government-in-exile in Algiers in 1943, he declared, \u201cThere will be no peace in Europe if the states are reconstituted on the basis of national sovereignty ... The countries of Europe are too small to guarantee their peoples the necessary prosperity and social development. The European states must constitute themselves into a federation.\u201dTwo years later, after Germany and its allies surrendered, Monnet had his chance to begin realizing his vision. As commissioner-general of the French National Planning Board, Monnet advised Gen. Charles de Gaulle, the president of the provisional government at the end of the war, on the reconstruction of the French economy.One obvious means was to tap into Germany\u2019s industrial potential, much of which was still intact. The Monnet Plan, as it became known, proposed the expropriation of coal from German mines in the Ruhr and Saar regions to fire the furnaces of French steel factories. In addition to hastening the recovery of France, this inhibited Germany\u2019s ability to rearm.Therein lies an irony: the Monnet Plan had an unmistakable aspect of Versailles redux. If its punitive measures had remained in place, it would have crippled Germany\u2019s recovery, and very likely \u2014 as Versailles had done \u2014 sown dragons\u2019 teeth in the soil of Europe.Over the next four years, Monnet worked on a successor arrangement that was negotiated with Germany, not imposed on it. The agreement lowered duties and restrictions on coal and steel trade between France and Germany, bringing two vital sectors together under the aegis of a joint state-sponsored authority.This bilateral accord was an exemplar of Monnet\u2019s strategy for diluting national sovereignties by creating new economic facts on the ground, which, in time, would lead political leaders to see the virtue in acting on the Pan-European level. The 1951 Treaty of Paris was a step in that direction: It added Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands to what became the European Coal and Steel Community. The E.C.S.C. was the progenitor of the European Union, based on Monnet\u2019s guiding principle: \u201cNothing is possible without men, but nothing lasts without institutions.\u201dIn 1955, Monnet resigned from the presidency of the E.C.S.C.\u2019s High Authority to found an independent group advocating an all-inclusive European federation. Widely referred to as the Monnet Committee, its formal name was the Action Committee for the United States of Europe. De Gaulle and others sometimes mocked Monnet as \u201cthe great American.\u201d He did not much mind, since he admired what he had seen of the United States\u2019 federal democracy.Jean Monnet died, at 90, in March 1979. It was a seminal year in the evolution of Europe. That month, the European Economic Community created the European Currency Unit, the precursor to the euro.The ECU (an acronym pronounced \u201c\u00e9cu\u201d) was legal tender, but not in the form of paper currency and coins that could be used to buy a croissant. Rather, it was a single-denomination bookkeeping artifice, backed by a portfolio of currencies whose exchange rates were stabilized by an imposed limit on how much they could fluctuate. Together, these devices made it easier to conduct international financial transactions. They constituted the kind of careful, deliberate, steady-as-you-go approach Monnet favored.Three months later, citizens of the nine member states of the E.E.C. went to the polls for history\u2019s first truly international parliamentary election. The European Parliament, based in Strasbourg, France, was initially a consultative body that offered nonbinding opinions on proposals from the European Commission, the executive branch of what was then called the European Community.Europe was laying the foundation for a common monetary system and a representative legislature \u2014 two prerequisites for the federalized Europe that Monnet hoped would eventually evolve. But in each case, progress toward that ultimate goal was counterbalanced \u2014 and, to a degree, inhibited \u2014 by the still powerful instinct to protect the sovereignty of the nation state. And in the realm of fiscal policy, there was no proto-European finance ministry \u2014 an institution of the sort that Monnet believed was crucial to successful integration.The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 gave the European Community, which by then had 12 members, a new name, the European Union. It also added to the common market and parliament two new \u201cpillars\u201d: a coordinated foreign policy (a proto-ministry of foreign affairs) and judicial cooperation (a proto-ministry of justice).On New Year\u2019s Day 1999, the process of introducing the single currency began. The European Union\u2019s leaders felt that moving forward with the euro would act as an incentive to grant the European Central Bank, established in 1998, more authority over monetary policy. It was often said that the monetary union would be a locomotive that would pull Europe toward an ever more perfect political union.Exactly three years later, euro bank notes and coins began to replace Deutsche marks, francs, lire, pesetas, drachmas and other currencies of the 11 member states that accepted the new currency. (Britain and Denmark negotiated formal opt-outs, and Sweden, through a series of parliamentary maneuvers, has so far avoided joining.)The euro zone thrived as long as its southern tier \u2014 despite gargantuan public deficits in countries like Greece and real-estate bubbles in Spain and elsewhere \u2014 was buoyed by a rising tide of global growth and a huge influx of German capital.The leaders recognized that a common currency without fiscal coordination could backfire if the European economy went into a tailspin and bubbles started to burst. They enacted a Stability and Growth Pact in the late 1990s to ensure that all members of the euro zone were committed to limiting budget deficits. But the pact was never fully enforced. Nor was there any sense of urgency about bolstering the E.C.B. Good times continued to roll, reinforcing the illusion that there was no need to prepare for a major downturn.There is no doubt about how Monnet would have reacted to the financial upheaval on Wall Street in 2008. Unapologetic Americophile that he was, he was also a believer in sound, transparent business practices. He would have had a tart thing or two to say about the complex, opaque financial schemes that \u2014 abetted by the shortcomings of government regulation \u2014 toppled major financial institutions, impoverished clients, wreaked havoc on the economy at large and sent a tsunami across the Atlantic.Because Maastricht had failed to give the E.C.B. regulatory powers to address sudden and crippling pressure on the banking system, there were few mechanisms to stanch the spreading damage. In the depths of the crisis, in 2011 and 2012, serious figures on both sides of the Atlantic urged a wholesale, or at least partial, disbanding of the euro zone.The prevailing view, however, was that the euro zone would have to hang together. Expulsions and defections were out of the question. It would do no good to lament the introduction of the euro. Hasty as that decision was, the name of the game now must be stabilizing and strengthening monetary union; to give up on it would be to give up on union itself.Europe still lacks the type of transnational finance ministry Monnet would have advocated, but it is developing some of the functions of one through existing institutions. In particular, the European Commission and the European Central Bank, along with the International Monetary Fund, are empowered to require, monitor and enforce the fiscal responsibility of national governments.In 2011, the E.C.B. reduced its buying of Italian bonds. This led to the fracture of Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s coalition, forcing the transcendently irresponsible prime minister out of office. The ability of the central bank to, in effect, fire a sitting head of government rebuts the gripe that the European Union is hobbled by a lack of clout.The euro zone may, over time, find ways to replicate the American government\u2019s reliance on the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to back the dollar, while the larger European Union maintains and deepens the common market, even as it develops shared defense and security policies.The progression toward a United States of Europe was the real Monnet Plan. Now that Europe has learned the hard way that it needs to follow the Monnet Method of bolstering integration with institutions, the plan may be back on track.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Breakfast Before the MOOC", "Date": "2014-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBeginning March 2, Prof. Hossam Haick, will teach the first ever massive open online course, or MOOC, on nanotechnology in Arabic. What\u2019s more interesting, though, he explained to me the other day over breakfast is some of the curious email he\u2019s received from students registering for his MOOC from all over the Arab world. Their questions include: Are you a real person? Are you really an Arab, or are you an Israeli Jew speaking Arabic, pretending to be an Arab? That\u2019s because Haick is an Israeli Arab from Nazareth and will be teaching this course from his home university, the Technion, Israel\u2019s premier science and technology institute, and the place we were having breakfast was Tel Aviv.If you had any doubts about the hunger for education in the Middle East today, Haick\u2019s MOOC will dispel them. So far, there are about 4,800 registrations for the Arabic version, including students from Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, Algeria, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates and the West Bank. Iranians are signing up for the English version. Because the registration is through the Coursera MOOC website, some registrants initially don\u2019t realize the course is being taught by an Israeli Arab scientist at the Technion, said Haick, and when they do, some professors and students \u201cunregister.\u201d But most others are sticking with it. (MOOC\u2019s have just started to emerge in the Arab world via Coursera, edX, Edraak, Rwaq, SkillAcademy and MenaVersity \u2014 some with original content, much still translated.)Asked why he thought the course was attracting so much interest in the neighborhood, Haick said: \u201cBecause nanotechnology and nanosensors are perceived as futuristic, and people are curious to understand what the future looks like.\u201d And because nanotechnology \u201cis so cross- and multi-disciplinary. ... It offers a large diversity of research opportunities.\u201dHaick, 38, whose Ph.D. is from the Technion, where his father also graduated, is a science prodigy. He and the Technion already have a start-up together, developing what he calls \u201can electronic nose\u201d \u2014 a sensory array that mimics the way a dog\u2019s nose works to detect what Haick and his team have proved to be unique markers in exhaled breath that reveal different cancers in the body. In between that and teaching chemical engineering, the Technion\u2019s president, Peretz\u00a0Lavie, suggested that Haick lead the school into the land of MOOCs.Lavie, Haick explained, \u201cthinks there is a high need to bring science beyond the boundaries between countries. He told me there is something called a \u2018MOOC.\u2019 I did not know what is a MOOC. He said it is a course that can be given to thousands of people over the Web. And he asked if I can give the first MOOC from the Technion \u2014 in Arabic.\u201dThe Technion is funding the project, which took nine months to prepare, and Haick is donating the lectures. Some 19 percent of the Technion\u2019s students today are Israeli Arabs, up from 9 percent 12 years ago. Haick says he always tells people, \u201cIf the Middle East was like the Technion, we would already have peace. In the pure academy, you feel totally equal with every person. And you are appreciated based on your excellence.\u201d He adds without meaning to boast, \u201cI have young people who tell me from the Arab world: \u2018You have become our role model. Please let us know the ingredients of how we become like you.\u2019 \u201dI know what some readers are thinking: nice bit of Israeli propaganda, now could you please go back to writing about Israel\u2019s ugly West Bank occupation. No. This story is a useful reminder that Israel is a country, not just a conflict, and, as a country, it\u2019s still a work in progress. It has its lows, like the occupation and economic discrimination against Israeli Arabs, and its highs, like the collaboration between Haick and the Technion, which is providing a tool for those in the Arabic-speaking world eager to grasp the new technologies reshaping the global economy. Those, like members of the B.D.S. \u2014 boycott, divestiture, sanctions \u2014 movement who treat Israel as if it is only the sum of how it deals with the West Bank and therefore deserves to be delegitimized as a state, would do well to reflect on some of these complexities.For me, though, Haick\u2019s MOOC is also a reminder of what an utter waste of money and human talent has been the Arab-Israeli conflict. Look how eager all these young Arabs and Persians are for the tools and resources to realize their full potential, wherever they can find that learning. Arab dictators so underestimated their people for so long. That\u2019s what fueled the Arab awakening. It makes you weep for the wasted generations and pray this will be the last of them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sudanese TV Show, Without the Cutthroat \u2018You\u2019re Fired,\u2019 Rewards Entrepreneurs", "Date": "2014-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKhartoum JournalKHARTOUM, Sudan \u2014 It was the final episode, broadcast live from Khartoum\u2019s 18-story, egg-shaped Corinthia Hotel tower, built by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya. On stage, under flashing colored lights, the five contestants, three men and two women, waited anxiously for the outcome.\u201cI followed the show from the beginning,\u201d said Khalid Muhammad Khalid, 22, a university student. \u201cIt was an inspiration.\u201dSudan\u2019s economy has been suffering since South Sudan split off and became an independent nation in 2011, taking with it nearly 75 percent of Sudan\u2019s oil revenues. The country\u2019s economy has shrunk, the value of the Sudanese pound has deteriorated, unemployment is on the rise and thousands of professionals have left for opportunities elsewhere in the oil-producing gulf states and Libya.The unemployment rate among Sudan\u2019s youth, which has been as high as 34 percent, is one of the volatile elements that helped ignite deadly antigovernment protests last September.But some see an option that might help improve the economic fortunes of Sudanese youth by changing long-held presumptions about work and promoting the idea of entrepreneurship.\u201cIt is not culturally given a high status,\u201d said Ahmed Amin Abdelatif, 40, the head of a family-owned company and chairman of the Sudanese Young Businessmen Association. \u201cMany would say, \u2018Why not get a proper job in government or a company?\u2019\u00a0\u201dChallenging that mind-set is what Mr. Abdelatif and several local businessmen sought out to do. Hence, the birth last year of \u201cMashrouy.\u201dMashrouy, Arabic for \u201cmy project,\u201d was promoted through a widespread advertising campaign that focused on Sudanese youth. The campaign brought in an initial 2,500 applicants for the show. A panel of experts screened applications, whittling down the number of contestants to 12.The Mashrouy contestants each came with ideas for a business project. One proposed establishing an ostrich farm, and another suggested converting trash into accessories and furniture. Yet another envisioned producing and exporting spicy peanut butter.Episodes aired twice a week beginning in November, when the nine men and three women presented their projects in front of four judges. Not as aggressive or cutthroat in style as Donald Trump would have it, an elimination process that assessed each project\u2019s viability and the contestant\u2019s presentation skills brought the number down to five.Samah al-Gadi, 32, said she was not too enthusiastic about the idea of appearing on the show at first but submitted her Mashrouy application on the last possible day, at her mother\u2019s insistence. She was also unsatisfied with her routine and limiting office work, so with her academic background in social development and agriculture, she proposed a project to help communities living along riverbanks solve a nasty problem and even profit from it.Water hyacinth is a weedlike aquatic plant that grows in the White Nile River south of Khartoum. The plant can multiply quickly and cover large water surfaces. It obstructs river transport and attracts mosquitoes and parasites that cause bilharzia, increasing water evaporation and diminishing fish populations.Attempts to eradicate it by chemicals, Ms. Gadi said, eventually do not work and hurt the environment. So she offered a new approach.\u201cInstead of trying to eradicate it, I want to propose using it for social development,\u201d she said. \u201cLocal communities can remove it manually, let it dry, braid it, and make ropes, bags and furniture.\u201dSimilar projects, Ms. Gadi explained, have been put in effect in China, Vietnam, Indonesia and elsewhere. \u201cIt is a profitable business and does not need much financing,\u201d she said.Mazin Merghani, 24, a recent university graduate, put forward another agricultural idea.\u201cWe heard that only 10 percent of Sudan\u2019s gum arabic is harvested each year,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt is traditionally harvested manually by ax, and now most of those working in the fields are old.\u201dSudan is the leading global producer of gum arabic, a natural gum collected from acacia trees and used as a stabilizer in soft drinks, candies, cosmetics and paints. It is the only product exempted from American sanctions against Sudan for import.Mr. Merghani and his colleagues designed a mechanical pincer, to be connected to a small tractor that would grab and cut through trees that produce gum arabic and extract the hardened gum sap.\u201cThis way, one could extract gum from 200 trees a day instead of 30, and increase production seven times,\u201d he said.Like Ms. Gadi and Mr. Merghani, hundreds of Sudanese youth are dissatisfied with the lack of opportunity in the nation and the strangling bureaucratic system that can make it difficult for people without connections to get hired or move up the ladder. So they are eager to put their ideas to practice. But promoting entrepreneurship is not a magic answer to Sudan\u2019s economic woes, said Abda el-Mahdi, one of Mashrouy\u2019s four judges.\u201cEntrepreneurship is not a solution in itself,\u201d said Ms. Mahdi, an economist. \u201cBut it allows for youth to think of positive ways to seek self-employment.\u201dBack at the hotel, invited guests, including diplomats, businessmen, friends and family, sat eagerly around dinner tables for the finale a few weeks ago, and after long speeches and musical performances, the final five came on to the stage. Dramatic music echoed in the background and Mashrouy\u2019s winner was finally announced, chosen by a television audience that submitted their votes online.\u201cAnd first place goes to Samah al-Gadi!\u201d yelled the program\u2019s host.Amid ululations, screams and clapping, a jubilant Ms. Gadi raised both hands above her scarf-covered head, flashing victory signs. Her mother, sitting at a dinner table, was brought to tears and her friends jumped up and down in excitement.\u201cI knew I had a good project, but I did not expect first place,\u201d Ms. Gadi later said.Mr. Merghani came in second. \u201cThe experience and networking is even better than the prize,\u201d he said.The contest has created so much buzz among Sudanese that one expatriate businessman, Yasser al-Naeem, 42, flew in from Dubai to attend the final episode with suggestions for the second season.\u201cWhy not have one for the Sudanese diaspora abroad?\u201d Mr. Naeem suggested enthusiastically.Potential financiers have already contacted some of the contestants and Mr. Abdelatif, the businessman who helped create the show and who was also a judge, was impressed by the entire experience.\u201cI look up to these guys,\u201d said Mr. Abdelatif, who is from a prominent business family. \u201cI had it easy, but they started from scratch, which is a million more times difficult to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Looks to Become Big Fish in Another Big Pond", "Date": "2014-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Facebook is already the world\u2019s biggest social network. Now it wants to be the biggest player in a new global field by buying WhatsApp, the global leader in mobile messaging.\u201cWhatsApp is the biggest guy in town,\u201d said Bertrand Schmitt, chief executive of App Annie, an analytics company that monitors app rankings worldwide. \u201cFacebook is buying into that. It\u2019s about global scale.\u201dFacebook\u2019s $16 billion deal to buy WhatsApp, announced on Wednesday, extends a deep reach in countries like Mexico, Germany and India, where the inexpensive messaging application has a big share of the markets.And it gives Facebook a chance to compete elsewhere against other messaging start-ups, like Line in Japan and WeChat in China. About 45 percent of mobile Internet messaging users rely on WhatsApp, according to the research firm Analysys Mason.The acquisition, the largest ever by Facebook, is part of its effort to create a series of applications on a user\u2019s mobile device instead of relying on its core social network alone. It also aims to seize on the trend of more people using their mobile phones to communicate one-on-one or with very small groups, rather than sharing information more widely.WhatsApp\u2019s growth has been explosive. The company, founded in 2009, says that about a fifth of its users, or 100 million of its 450 million subscribers, have joined in the last four months. More than 55 percent of its users are from Western Europe, Mexico, India, Brazil and the United States, according to App Annie.But while the deal gives Facebook an opportunity to reach people in different ways, it could also lead to increased competition and tension with some of the world\u2019s largest telecommunications operators, like AT&T and Deutsche Telekom of Germany. For years, the telecommunications companies have drawn the ire of consumers who were charged high fees to send text messages. But apps like WhatsApp offer consumers a cheap or free way to send messages. WhatsApp, for example, charges $1 a year, and the first year is free.Over the last decade, companies like Telef\u00f3nica of Spain and Vodafone of Britain have relied on high margins from text message services as an important source of revenue. Global carriers lost a combined $32 billion in revenue last year as consumers shifted from costly text messages to cheap Internet messaging services, according to the research firm Ovum.Some operators have tried to ban Internet messaging rivals. That includes the Dutch telecom company KPN, which blamed WhatsApp for a major downturn in its revenue in 2011. Local lawmakers later ruled that KPN could not discriminate against data traffic from rival messaging services.Other telecom companies like Orange of France and Vodafone have tried to compete by offering their own Internet messaging offerings. Yet these services, which generate little revenue compared with traditional text messages, have been limited to users on the carriers\u2019 own networks and have therefore failed to reach a global audience.\u201cTelecoms companies have struggled to react to the growth of services like WhatsApp,\u201d said Steven Hartley, who runs the industry, communications and broadband team at Ovum in London. \u201cBy the time they responded, Internet messaging start-ups already had sewn up the market.\u201dAnalysts say Facebook remains in a strong position when competing with these cellphone operators. Even though it has approximately 1.2 billion global users, Facebook is still one of the most downloaded applications for smartphones worldwide. And few carriers would be willing to block Facebook\u2019s services in fear of angering their customers.WhatsApp has been wildly popular with European customers. The company recently said that it had more than 30 million active users in Germany, and the app is now downloaded more often by European users than rivals like Skype and competing offerings from local telecom companies like Orange. And it has outpaced local rivals like Viber Media of Cyprus, which was acquired by the Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten for $900 million last week.But its popularity in Europe is eclipsed by larger growth in emerging markets like Brazil and India, analysts said. As a growing number of users in developing economies, including Indonesia, have upgraded to smartphones, these customers have turned to online applications like messaging services that were previously not available on low-cost handsets.\u201cFacebook and WhatsApp will work together to get into more emerging markets,\u201d said Pamela Clark-Dickson, senior messaging analyst at the research firm Informa Telecoms and Media. \u201cIt\u2019s an area where both companies want to focus on in the future.\u201dNot every market will be easy to crack. Several well-established rivals in crucial Asian countries have so far kept both Facebook and WhatsApp at bay.In China, where Facebook is banned, the local social messaging application WeChat is the market leader for messaging, while regional rival Line dominates in Japan and Kakao is the most download Internet messenger in South Korea. WhatsApp, which is allowed in China, does not rank in the top five most-downloaded mobile social networking applications in any of these Asian countries, according to statistics from App Annie.Analysts say these Asian tech companies have built entrenched operations that Facebook and WhatsApp will find difficult to dislodge. The competitors are now expanding across the region and farther afield, including in Europe and the United States, which could hurt Facebook\u2019s own future plans for WhatsApp.The rival messaging companies have successfully developed mobile games and other services inside their messaging services that users are willing to pay for. That contrasts with WhatsApp, where the co-founders have vehemently opposed adding advertising to generate much-needed revenue.\u201cIn countries like China and Japan, Facebook Messenger is not a leader,\u201d said Siim Teller, a mobile analyst at the consultant firm On Device Research in London. \u201cFacebook has a problem with innovating beyond its core social networking application.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Pro-Business Stance That\u2019s Bad for Business", "Date": "2014-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneBusinesses in energy-related industries in Texas say they have been unable to take full advantage of the natural gas boom that is roaring across the state because of a delay in the issuing of greenhouse gas permits \u2014 an instance in which Texas\u2019 antiregulation stance might have actually hurt business. But electric power retailers, along with energy transport and chemical companies, have told the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality that the delay has put Texas at a competitive disadvantage against other states that had agreed earlier to issue the permits. Some executives said they have considered building in other states because of the delays. ExxonMobil had to delay construction of an ethylene facility in Baytown that it had hoped to begin building in March 2013. It did not receive E.P.A. approval until November. Several industry lawyers and consultants estimated that the Texas commission would issue permits several months faster than the E.P.A., where in some cases the delays have been as long as two years. \u201cIf it takes six months or a year to start a facility, well, then that\u2019s a year you\u2019re not going to be making any money,\u201d said Bill Jamieson, director for air quality at the environmental consulting firm SWCA. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that equity firms and large investors look at that as risk.\u201d Texas commission officials have maintained that they lacked the authority to issue greenhouse gas permits until the Legislature explicitly asked them to do so last year. The agency will take several more months to develop guidelines to take over the process. Targa had planned to begin operating two natural gas processing facilities in mid-2013. But it received the permits to build both plants only in the last six months. In correspondence records obtained through a public information request, E.P.A. officials have described receiving weekly calls from many other energy companies, including FGE Power, which announced plans to begin building a natural gas-fired power plant in West Texas by August, but is still waiting on its permit. Environmental advocates say the delays are an example of how Texas\u2019 stance against climate change regulations can hurt big business. They also question whether the Texas commission needed state legislators to give it the authority to follow the rules. If Texas wins the case, \u201cthey\u2019re going to look really astute for having taken a firm position.\u201dBut there is no guarantee that will happen. Supreme Court justices have declined to hear Texas\u2019 argument that greenhouse gases should not be considered a danger to public health and welfare. Mr. Jamieson said companies thrive on regulatory certainty, and in some cases, fighting rules can be more costly than following them. \u201cIt really comes down to politics as to why this was done the way it was done,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can look back on a number of instances in the state of Texas where utilities have challenged some pretty significant E.P.A. regulation, and they\u2019ve spent a lot of money, and the end result is: they have the regulation.\u201d nsatija@texastribune.org Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amid Hugs and Tears, Korean Families Divided by War Reunite", "Date": "2014-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Lee Beom-ju, 86, had little to say at first.\u201cI am sorry, I am sorry,\u201d he told his long-lost younger brother and sister in North Korea when he finally met with them on Thursday, during the first family reunions on the divided Korean Peninsula in more than three years.Mr. Lee, now a South Korean citizen, fled the North in 1951 during the Korean War. Until Thursday, Mr. Lee had not seen his family since, living with a sense of guilt for failing to look after it as the eldest son, according to pool reports from the South Korean news media. Hwa-ja, the little sister he last saw 63 years ago, is now a 72-year-old grandmother.\u201cGrandfather told me to run, run and go to the South, away from the war, because I was his eldest grandson,\u201d Mr. Lee said in tears, explaining to his sister and his brother, Yoon-ju, 67, why he had to leave them behind. Mr. Lee was among 83 older South Koreans, including a 96-year-old grandmother, who crossed the border in buses and ambulances on Thursday to meet with 178 North Korean relatives at the Diamond Mountain resort in southeastern North Korea.The rival governments agreed to the family reunions as their first serious gesture toward easing frayed ties and rebuilding trust after several years of high tensions caused by the North\u2019s nuclear tests and armed provocations against the South. Foreign reporters were not allowed to cover the event.The reunions bore witness to the pain the long political divide on the peninsula has inflicted upon separated families. Graying sons and sisters hugged and collapsed in tears on the laps of their parents and brothers, many of whom were so old and weak that they had to make the trip across the border in wheelchairs.\u201cFather\u2019s last wish in his deathbed was that I should look and find you,\u201d Kim Myeong-bok, 66, told his North Korean sister, Myeong-ja, 68, who was the only member of his family left in the North.Lee Young-sil, 88, who has Alzheimer\u2019s disease, did not recognize her North Korean sister and daughter. A 93-year-old man named Kang Neung-hwan met a North Korean son born after he had fled to the South.The separation has been so long that some carried their prewar photos to help their siblings recognize them. They also packed photos of their hometowns, as well as underwear and other gifts for their relatives in the impoverished North.But the family meetings also provide testimony as to how far the two political systems have drifted apart. In the past six decades, a totalitarian government has taken root in the North, while the South has evolved into a democracy with a globalized economy. During past reunions, relatives from the North showed far less emotion, at least while North Korean officials and the news media were watching them. They often puzzled their South Korean relatives by abruptly launching into long speeches praising their \u201cgreat leader\u201d and blaming \u201cAmerican imperialists\u201d for the Korean divide.On Thursday, the North Korean relatives praised their \u201cmarshal,\u201d thanking Mr. Kim for making the reunions possible.This week\u2019s reunions last until Saturday, when the relatives will return to their homes. From Saturday to Monday, a separate group of 88 North Koreans will arrive in Diamond Mountain to meet with 361 relatives who will travel from the South.The meetings are likely to be the older Koreans\u2019 last chance to see their relatives before they die. Their initial tearful joy is replaced by heartbreak as they bid farewell. In the past, sisters and daughters clung at the windows of departing buses. Fathers told sons the dates of their grandparents\u2019 deaths so they could continue the all-important Confucian rites of ancestral worship.Millions of Koreans were separated from relatives when the peninsula was divided into the Communist North and the pro-American South at the end of World War II in 1945. Since the Korean War of 1950-53, no exchanges of letters, telephone calls or emails have been allowed between North and South Koreans, and the occasional reunions are just about their only chance to meet relatives.The humanitarian wishes of the separated families have always been subject to the political mood of the two governments.They did not agree to hold family reunions until 1985. For the next 15 years, there was no reunion. A breakthrough came when Kim Dae-jung, then the president of South Korea, traveled to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, for the first inter-Korean summit meeting in 2000.After that, the two Koreas held up to three rounds of reunions a year until 2008, when a conservative government deeply critical of the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program took power in Seoul.A total of 22,000 people from both Koreas have participated in past reunions. About 71,000 South Koreans \u2014 more than half of them 80 or older \u2014 remain on a waiting list for a chance to meet with relatives in the North. South Korean participants are selected by lottery. It is unclear how the North chooses its candidates. Of those on the waiting list, 3,800 die each year without fulfilling their dreams. Earlier Thursday, Kim Seom-gyeong, 91, arrived in an ambulance at Sokcho, a town in northeastern South Korea where the government gathered South Korean participants before taking them across the border. \u201cEven if I die, I will die in the Diamond Mountain,\u201d Mr. Kim was quoted as saying by the South Korean news agency Yonhap.

Until this football season, that is. This year the Seattle Seahawks opened a civic-size pressure release valve, drawing impossibly loud sellout crowds and delivering the city\u2019s first Super Bowl victory. On Wednesday, that release roared through downtown as hundreds of thousands of people crowded six-deep or more along closed streets for a celebratory parade. \u201cPeople have been waiting their whole lives for this,\u201d said John Cake, 41, a health-insurance industry worker, who was on the parade route with his wife, Julie, and their sons, John, 12, and Miles, 11 \u2014 both pulled from school after Seattle officials said this week that children out for parade route duty could be given \u201cexcused absences.\u201d\u201cIt does build our confidence,\u201d said Ms. Cake, 40, a mental health therapist. \u201cWe get overlooked.\u201dMany observers have long said Seattle suffers from a mile-wide streak of insecurity about itself and its place in the world. Derided by some as the little-brother metropolis to the San Francisco Bay Area, to which the culture and economy have been linked since Seattle\u2019s founding in the 1800s, it has also been saddled with sports teams that mostly stank. The SuperSonics of the N.B.A. last won a national championship when Jimmy Carter was in the White House, in 1979, while the Seattle Storm of the W.N.B.A. won championships in 2004 and 2010.But even in its victory dance, the city never quite strutted. As a tide of blue and green Seahawk hats, shirts and fluttering flags filled the parade route, chest-thumping declarations about being No. 1 seemed less common than expressions of simple happiness, and even relief that something had not gone wrong at the last second to short-circuit the victory.Cliff Meyer, 54, a nonprofit management consultant, who was at the parade with his wife, Alle Hall, 48, a writer, said that what he perceived as the city\u2019s \u201cshyness\u201d would be, at least for the moment, vanquished.\u201cThis is the long-awaited proof that we\u2019re not just stuck, as someone once said, sort of south of Alaska,\u201d he said.Ms. Hall said she was not much of a football fan herself, but had hopes that the Seahawks\u2019 victory would somehow shine a light on Seattle\u2019s other strengths, such as its opera.\u201cWe have the best \u2018Ring\u2019 cycle in the world,\u201d she said, referring to Richard Wagner\u2019s opus, which is regularly staged here. The city has amazing ballet, too, she said, not to mention Dale Chihuly, the blown-glass artist.\u201cIf this brings the needed attention to Seattle, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d she said.That a city priding itself on a nerdy-but-nice blend of socially liberal consciousness \u2014 Oakland of the north, some have called it \u2014 would have an N.F.L. team noted for its hyperaggressive tactics on the field, as measured by assessed or sometimes overlooked penalties, does make some Seattleites scratch their heads. And even the huge noise that Seahawk fans can make at home games \u2014 the vaunted 12th Man, as it is called, loud and vehement enough to create a kind of virtual added player to the team \u2014 has its local critics.\u201cSome of my friends think that the 12th Man is bad sportsmanship,\u201d said Dan Tolliver, 47, a civil engineer. \u201cYou\u2019re preventing the other team from playing their game,\u201d he added, noting \u2014 perhaps wisely given the parade route\u2019s crush of 12th men and women around him \u2014 that he himself had not endorsed that view. But paradegoers like Keith Jefferson, 52, a rowing coach who was there with his daughter, Emma, 9, said he thought the city\u2019s goody-two-shoes image was not quite true to begin with anyway. A strain of radical militancy \u2014 seared into local memory here especially by World Trade Organization riots in 1999, when anarchist groups arose in violent protest, but dating back through decades of labor strife before that \u2014 runs somewhere in the city\u2019s soul, too, he said.\u201cWe invented the labor riot,\u201d he said.Other local stereotypes, though, are happily quite true, said Ms. Cake, the mental health therapist, who said she and her husband took care to have their espresso ready for the trip downtown before dawn to secure a curbside seat. \u201cIt\u2019s Seattle \u2014 we have to have our espresso,\u201d she said.Other images of the city are also borne out by census data. It is geeky. It has the fourth-highest percentage in the nation of computer engineering and science workers among big cities, coming in one notch above the San Francisco area, according to William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. And it is young, Mr. Frey said, ranking seventh in the nation among the 51 largest metropolitan areas in attracting the coveted millennial generation cohort, ages 25 to 34 \u2014 this time trailing San Francisco by just one notch.But at least one other stereotype, the climatological, went resolutely the other way as parade day dawned. The sky was brilliantly blue and clear, with strong winter sunshine. Gloom was hard to find.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China to Reward Cities and Regions Making Progress on Air Pollution", "Date": "2014-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Chinese officials announced Thursday that they were offering a total of 10 billion renminbi, or $1.65 billion, this year to cities and regions that make \u201csignificant progress\u201d in air pollution control, according to a report by Xinhua, the state-run news agency.The meeting was presided over by Li Keqiang, a member of the Communist Party\u2019s ruling Politburo Standing Committee and China\u2019s prime minister.The announcement of the financial incentives revealed how difficult it has been for some leaders in Beijing to get many Chinese companies and government officials to comply with environmental regulations. Though central officials have been saying with growing vigor that pollution of all kinds must be curbed, their efforts to force other parts of the bureaucracy and the state-run economy to obey rules have been stymied by the self-interest of some groups.On Thursday, Chinese news organizations reported that the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences had deemed Beijing to be \u201calmost unfavorable for human living.\u201dThe judgment was part of an annual report on the livability of 40 world cities released by the organization, which is tied to the Chinese government.Beijing ranked second worst in environmental conditions, and Shanghai was the fifth worst. Other indexes used to evaluate the cities included economics, governance and cultural innovation, according to China Daily, an official English-language newspaper.Over all, Shanghai ranked 21st and Beijing ranked 31st after the six indexes were tallied. Tokyo, London, Paris, New York and Singapore made up the top five.The three cities with the best environmental rankings were Stockholm, Vienna and Zurich. Moscow had the lowest ranking.The news reports did not give details on what specific criteria and methods were used for ranking cities in each index.Last year, more than 100 cities in China had an average of 29.9 smoggy days, which was a 52-year high, China Daily reported, though it did not explain what constituted a smoggy day.The Xinhua report on the State Council meeting said that the concentration of PM2.5, a fine particulate matter that lodges deep in the lungs and enters the bloodstream, increased by 56 percent in December compared with the month before, based on monitoring results for 74 Chinese cities. The measured concentration of PM10, a coarser particulate matter, rose by 30 percent that month.The State Council announcement said that nationwide coal consumption must be controlled, more vehicles should run on high-quality gasoline, energy use in the construction industry should be lowered, and cleaner boilers should be used.In July 2013, the Ministry of Environmental Protection ordered more than 15,000 companies regarded as major sources of pollution to report pollutant discharge levels starting this January. The companies account for more than 80 percent of pollution of various kinds in China, according to one official news report. The ministry\u2019s order also required government agencies to supervise the release of pollutants by the companies and their attempts at self-monitoring.The order was praised by Ma Jun, a well-known environmental advocate who promotes transparency efforts, but it is unclear to what extent the companies and government officials across China are now following the mandate.Throughout Thursday, a familiar gray haze cloaked Beijing. At the day\u2019s start, the United States Embassy\u2019s air monitor in Beijing rated the air as \u201chazardous,\u201d a level at which all outdoor activity should be avoided. The concentration of PM2.5 at the time was 268 micrograms per cubic meter, or 11 times the recommended exposure limit set by the World Health Organization. The air stayed at unhealthy levels into the evening.Bree Feng contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kentucky Challenger Sets Sights on Senate G.O.P. Heavyweight", "Date": "2014-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLEXINGTON, Ky. \u2014 Alison Lundergan Grimes leaned across a table at an upscale bar near her home in this city\u2019s historic district, sipped Maker\u2019s Mark bourbon \u2014 a Kentucky staple \u2014 mixed with Diet Coke, and let out a belly laugh. \u201cWe\u2019re in this campaign to kick butt!\u201d she said.It was a rare unguarded moment for the usually on-message Ms. Grimes, Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state and the Democrats\u2019 best hope for unseating one of the most powerful Republicans in Washington: Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader.At 35, Ms. Grimes is a former sorority president, ballet dancer and daughter of an old-style Democratic pol. She has a booming voice, a litigator\u2019s gaze and a lust for a fight that she says was born of a lesson she learned as a kickboxing instructor: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to strike back.\u201dNow she is striking first in her bid to become her state\u2019s first female senator. With the 72-year-old Mr. McConnell deeply unpopular at home \u2014 a symbol of voters\u2019 collective disdain for Washington \u2014 and fighting a primary challenge from the right, the race is already among the most closely watched congressional contests of 2014.On Tuesday, Ms. Grimes will get a boost from former President Bill Clinton, who will headline a fund-raiser for her in Louisville, his first appearance for any 2014 candidate. If Mr. McConnell survives his primary challenge \u2014 polls show Matt Bevin, a Louisville businessman, trailing badly \u2014 and Ms. Grimes beats him, she will be lauded as a giant slayer.It will not be easy. Mr. McConnell practically built the Republican Party in Kentucky and has spent decades reminding voters of federal dollars he has brought home.Critics call Ms. Grimes unprepared \u2014 \u201cNot ready for a race of this magnitude,\u201d said Damon Thayer, the Republican State Senate floor leader. They predict she will crumble against a veteran who joined the Senate when she was in first grade. But polls indicate a tight race, and Kentucky Democrats are united for the first time in decades.For now, Ms. Grimes benefits from not being Mr. McConnell. She is pitching herself to the conservative Kentucky electorate as a pro-coal, pro-labor Democrat and portrays the leader as a symbol of an out-of-touch Washington. \u201cIf the doctors told Senator McConnell he had a kidney stone,\u201d she likes to say, \u201che would refuse to pass it.\u201dOn a frigid February afternoon, hundreds of cheering union members and party activists turned out to hear Ms. Grimes. She cast herself as an advocate for women and the middle class, called for raising the minimum wage and issued a spirited defense of collective bargaining rights.But it was her repeated assault on the senator as a man who \u201cdoesn\u2019t get it\u201d that really fired up the crowd.\u201cMitch is tough, everybody knows that \u2014 he goes right at you,\u201d said Terry McBrayer, a one-time candidate for governor. \u201cShe\u2019s 35 years old; she\u2019s got to show she\u2019s a competitor. I give her high marks for staying on message, for radiating confidence: \u2018Don\u2019t mess with me, big boy. You bite me, I\u2019m going to tear your arm off.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIn Washington, Mr. McConnell had no comment.Kentucky is rocky terrain for Democrats, who have not won a Senate seat since 1992. All but one of the state\u2019s constitutional officers, including Gov. Steven L. Beshear, are Democrats. But in Washington, the reverse is true.President Obama is unpopular here, and Ms. Grimes is distancing herself. In conversation, she calls Mr. Clinton \u201cthe president.\u201d As to whether Mr. Obama would campaign for her, \u201cI don\u2019t need any other surrogates,\u201d she said.For Ms. Grimes, politics is a family business. She grew up in Lexington, the middle of five daughters in a Roman Catholic family with Democratic working-class roots. Weekends were spent \u201cliterally squeezing lemonade at state fairs,\u201d she said, with her father, Jerry Lundergan, who built a family lemonade stand into a catering behemoth while holding a seat in the Kentucky House.The Lundergan girls helped get out the vote, stuffed envelopes, knocked on doors. \u201cAs soon as I could read,\u201d Ms. Grimes said, \u201cI was reading precinct lists.\u201dMr. Lundergan \u2014 a \u201clunch-bucket brawler\u201d in the words of Al Cross, a longtime Kentucky political columnist \u2014 was twice party chairman and helped Mr. Clinton carry Kentucky, recovering politically from a conviction in 1989 for a felony ethics law violation involving work his catering firm did for the state.The conviction was overturned, but the public humiliation \u2014 Mr. Lundergan resigned his House seat \u2014 proved searing. Ms. Grimes said the experience toughened her. \u201cIt made me the person that I am today,\u201d she said.Today, Mr. Lundergan functions as \u201cchief doorkeeper\u201d for the Grimes campaign, said his friend Greg Stumbo, the Kentucky House speaker. But he makes some Democrats nervous.\u201cHe wants her to win so bad that sometimes he might do some things that he shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d said Wendell Ford, the former governor and senator, still sharp at nearly 90.While her sisters shied away from politics, Ms. Grimes gravitated to it. One good friend, Megan Skaff Adkins, surmises that she was driven to restore the family honor, having been pained by the \u201cnegativity that was surrounding her dad\u2019s name.\u201dAfter getting her law degree at American University, Ms. Grimes settled in Lexington with her husband, Andrew. She tried business cases, represented domestic violence victims and revived a moribund women\u2019s law group. Anita Britton, a member, recalls her urging colleagues to worry less \u201cabout day care and appropriate dress in the courtroom\u201d and more about success.In 2011, Ms. Grimes ran for secretary of state and won handily. She has since been viewed as a potential attorney general or governor; her Senate candidacy came as a surprise.\u201cI think Alison may have thought she could make the biggest difference in the swiftest fashion by beating Mitch McConnell and returning his seat to the Democratic column,\u201d said Jack Conway, a Democrat and the Kentucky attorney general, who lost a 2010 Senate bid to Rand Paul, a Republican.Ms. Grimes said simply that she concluded she could win.\u201cI get in a race for two reasons: One, it\u2019s in your heart, and two, the facts are there to win it,\u201d she said. \u201cMitch McConnell has never run against a popularly elected statewide female who got more votes than the governor in 2011.\u201dHer learning curve was steep. Representative John Yarmuth, Kentucky\u2019s lone Democrat in Congress, gave her policy tutorials on issues like energy, health care and the debt. \u201cShe was like a sponge,\u201d he said.Her campaign rollout was rocky. Her meandering answers to complex policy questions drew criticism, and her tendency to avoid unplanned encounters with reporters drew their ire.Ms. Grimes\u2019s biggest challenge may be convincing Kentucky voters that she shares their values. She parses her words carefully. She supports the right to abortion (her father did not) and favors same-sex marriage, but would have states decide.She \u201chas my concerns\u201d about Mr. Obama\u2019s health law, she said, but did not give a yes or no on whether she would delay the mandate that most Americans buy insurance.On coal \u2014 a mainstay of the Kentucky economy \u2014 she dodged a question about whether she believes, as scientists do, that its pollution causes climate change, saying, \u201cI believe that coal keeps the lights on here in Kentucky.\u201d Mr. McConnell wants to repeal federal regulations that would effectively limit coal production. Ms. Grimes promises only to \u201crein in overburdensome regulations.\u201dRepublicans say Mr. McConnell will pull ahead once his primary is over and insist Kentucky will not trade the leader for a novice.Already, more than 3,700 Senate-related television ads have aired in Louisville alone, according to an analysis by Kantar Media.Mr. McConnell has nearly $11 million in the bank, twice as much as Ms. Grimes; he has run no television ads attacking her, though groups supporting him have. Ms. Grimes is not advertising yet.Supporters see Ms. Grimes getting better on the trail; Mr. McBrayer said she \u201cimproves as she goes.\u201d Mr. Conway, the attorney general, sees her learning to be more conversational.She is working at it. Three hours before her jobs speech in Louisville, Ms. Grimes was looking out over rows of empty seats, practicing her hand gestures and lines. She modulated her tone, trying to avoid echoes in the cavernous hall.\u201cI have a loud voice,\u201d she said, \u201cand so I must practice.\u201dAn earlier version of this article erroneously attributed a quote to Al Cross, a longtime Kentucky political columnist.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Industry Flexes Muscle in California Race", "Date": "2014-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySUNNYVALE, Calif. \u2014 Here in the land of technology start-ups, Ro Khanna is its political version. Backed by many of Silicon Valley\u2019s top investors and executives at Google, Facebook, Yahoo and other tech companies, Mr. Khanna, a 37-year-old patent lawyer who has never held elected office, has mounted an aggressive campaign for the seat from the 17th Congressional District in the heart of the Valley.Thanks to tech\u2019s support, Mr. Khanna has significantly outraised Mr. Honda. Four months before the primary, the challenger has $1,975,000 in cash on hand, or more than triple the incumbent\u2019s $623,000, according to campaign finance records filed last Friday.Whether or not this political start-up is ultimately successful, Mr. Khanna\u2019s campaign underscores the tech industry\u2019s push to elect candidates who will further its interests in Washington, even if that means, as in this race, trying to replace a party stalwart with a relative unknown. A liberal, pro-labor Democrat with a passion for civil rights, Mr. Honda, 72, is generally regarded as being on the side of the tech industry, but not as aggressive a champion as other congressmen in the region.\u201cThe tech community is looking for advocates who will be really, really outspoken for tech, and Ro fits that mold,\u201d said Ron Conway, who is one of the industry\u2019s most influential investors and is backing Mr. Khanna. While it is unusual for tech leaders to rally in such a way around a candidate, Mr. Conway added, \u201cI\u2019m hoping it\u2019s a wave of the future that continues, because it\u2019s crucial for the tech community to have a really active voice in Washington.\u201dMr. Khanna, who was a deputy assistant commerce secretary from 2009 to 2011 and now represents tech companies in intellectual property cases at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most prestigious law firms, talks of the need for \u201cGovernment 2.0\u201d and a \u201creset\u201d of Congress. The author of \u201cEntrepreneurial Nation,\u201d a book on manufacturing and American competitiveness, he has been endorsed by Google\u2019s executive chairman, Eric E. Schmidt; Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg; Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer; and many other tech luminaries. After knocking on the doors of potential voters here in Sunnyvale on a recent afternoon, Mr. Khanna said of his list of tech endorsers, \u201cEveryone who is seen as a person of the future has endorsed our campaign.\u201dFacing a serious challenge for the first time since being elected to Congress in 2000, Mr. Honda said he represented the interests not only of tech companies but also of the wider district. \u201cIt\u2019s about experience, the time you spent in the community, your record and people\u2019s expectations,\u201d he said recently, after leading a seminar on science education at Cisco\u2019s headquarters in San Jose. At a time when the tech industry has drawn a backlash in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the tech elite are increasingly portrayed as concerned with their narrow privileges at the expense of society at large, Mr. Honda\u2019s supporters have labeled Mr. Khanna a \u201cSilicon Valley groupie\u201d whose wealthy donors are trying to buy a congressional seat.Silicon Valley has traditionally stayed aloof from politics. But richer and more powerful than ever, the tech industry has become increasingly involved, both in lobbying and in fund-raising. And some of its boldface names have shown strong support for particular candidates, including Cory Booker of New Jersey in his successful run for the United States Senate and Mayor Ed Lee of San Francisco\u2019s campaign for a full term.Tech support has also given Mr. Khanna the means to hire political advisers who worked on Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election campaign, including Jeremy Bird, the former national field director.Rusty Rueff, a tech industry veteran, said he was an example of Silicon Valley\u2019s political transformation. Apolitical until 2011, when he began backing Mr. Obama, Mr. Rueff, 51, now sits on a committee advising Mr. Khanna, only the second political candidate he has supported. \u201cHis formative years, he\u2019s had a screen in front of him, and then not only has he grown up around it, he\u2019s written about it, he\u2019s been involved on the legal side,\u201d Mr. Rueff said. \u201cHe identifies with us, and we identify with someone who thinks that way.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Honda, a former public-school teacher, held several local and state public offices before going to Congress. He is a Japanese-American whose views on politics and civil rights were molded by his family\u2019s internment during World War II. Over the years, Mr. Honda has nurtured many Asian-American political candidates, some of whom are in the 17th District, the first majority Asian-American district in the mainland United States.Larry Gerston, a political scientist at San Jose State University, said that while Mr. Honda had supported the tech industry over the years, he had defined himself through his passionate campaigns for the poor, public education and civil rights. \u201cHe bleeds little guy,\u201d Dr. Gerston said.Mr. Honda\u2019s aides said the congressman had supported immigration changes, science education, nanotechnology and other issues that Silicon Valley cares about. They point to Intel, Google, Oracle, Yahoo and other tech companies whose political action committees are helping in his re-election.Asad Jamal, chairman of ePlanet Capital, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, said he was backing Mr. Honda because of his support of technology as well as his socially progressive issues.\u201cSilicon Valley has a culture of backing new people in start-ups, and Ro is very persuasive and a good candidate,\u201d Mr. Jamal said. \u201cBut Mike is exceptional and has a proven track record.\u201dDilawar Syed, another tech entrepreneur backing Mr. Honda, said Silicon Valley cares about broader issues beyond tech, including social justice, and is not monolithic. \u201cYou have to look at the whole thing and not get confused by the endorsements of some individuals,\u201d he said.Still, the list of Silicon Valley individuals endorsing Mr. Khanna \u2014 which also includes Marc Andreessen, the Netscape co-founder; John Doerr, the venture capitalist; and Randi Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Zuckerberg Media and the sister of Mark Zuckerberg, a Facebook founder \u2014 has given the challenger instant credibility.The average size of individual contributions to Mr. Khanna\u2019s campaign is double to triple those of Mr. Honda\u2019s. In the latest filing, of the 220 individual donors to Mr. Khanna\u2019s campaign, 27 listed their occupation as \u201cC.E.O.,\u201d four as \u201cchief financial officers\u201d and about 40 as being involved in investments.The money gives Mr. Khanna an advantage in what could become one of the costliest congressional races in the nation. Though both candidates are Democrats, they are expected to face each other in a general election in November under California\u2019s top-two primary system, after a primary in June. A Republican candidate, Vanila Singh, an anesthesiologist who, like Mr. Khanna, is Indian-American, is also running in the solidly Democratic district.Pointing to the example of Meg Whitman, the tech executive who spent part of her fortune in an unsuccessful bid for governor in California, Mr. Honda said: \u201cWe know that money is not everything. People in this area understand that you need funds, but you don\u2019t buy the election.\u201dMr. Khanna, whose campaign has not accepted donations from political action committees, waved away that accusation. He said he simply had a better understanding of the global economy and of Silicon Valley\u2019s place in it. For example, he said, he favors changes to tax policy suitable for a global economy, including ones that would make it easier for American companies to repatriate overseas profits without being taxed under certain conditions.\u201cI wear tech groupie as a badge of honor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental difference in our campaign.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turnabout in Bolivia as Economy Rises From Instability", "Date": "2014-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLA PAZ, Bolivia \u2014 Argentina\u2019s currency has plunged, setting off global worries about developing economies. Brazil is struggling to shake concerns over years of sluggish growth. Venezuela, which sits atop the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, has one of the world\u2019s highest inflation rates. Farther afield, countries like Turkey and South Africa have watched their currencies suffer as investors search for safer returns elsewhere.And then there is Bolivia.Tucked away in the shadow of its more populous and more prosperous neighbors, tiny, impoverished Bolivia, once a perennial economic basket case, has suddenly become a different kind of exception \u2014 this time in a good way.Its economy grew an estimated 6.5 percent last year, among the strongest rates in the region. Inflation has been kept in check. The budget is balanced, and once-crippling government debt has been slashed. And the country has a rainy-day fund of foreign reserves so large \u2014 for the size of its economy \u2014 that it could be the envy of nearly every other country in the world.\u201cBolivia has been in a way an outlier,\u201d said Ana Corbacho, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s chief of mission here, adding that falling commodity prices and other factors have downgraded economic expectations throughout the region. \u201cThe general trend is we have been revising down our growth forecast, except for Bolivia we have been revising upward.\u201dBolivia has taken an unlikely path to becoming the darling of international financial institutions like the monetary fund, not least because the high praise today is coming from some of the same institutions that the country\u2019s socialist president, Evo Morales, loves to berate.Mr. Morales often speaks harshly of capitalism and some of its most ardent defenders, like big corporations, the United States, the monetary fund and the World Bank. He nationalized the oil and gas sector after taking office in 2006, and he has expropriated more than 20 private companies in a variety of industries.Yet while Mr. Morales calls himself a revolutionary, others have begun using a very different word to describe him: \u201cprudent.\u201dBoth the monetary fund and the World Bank, in recent reports, praised what they called Mr. Morales\u2019s \u201cprudent\u201d macroeconomic policies. Fitch Ratings, a major credit rating agency, cited his \u201cprudent fiscal management.\u201dWhile Mr. Morales remains firmly in Latin America\u2019s leftist camp, on many economic matters he fits within a broader trend away from ideological rigidity in the region.In Peru, President Ollanta Humala went from ardent leftist to centrist. In Colombia, President Juan Manuel Santos, a former defense minister, now plays the role of peacemaker, negotiating with the country\u2019s largest guerrilla group. In El Salvador, presidential candidates from left and right moved toward the center to woo voters. In Uruguay, President Jos\u00e9 Mujica, a leftist and a former Marxist guerrilla, has carried out business-friendly economic policies.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely an underappreciated element of pragmatism\u201d in the region, said Maxwell A. Cameron, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia.Not long ago, Bolivia was a focal point of political and economic instability, and while it remains South America\u2019s poorest country, much has changed.Economic growth last year was the strongest in at least three decades, according to the monetary fund, and it continued a string of several years of healthy growth. The portion of the population living in extreme poverty fell to 24 percent in 2011, down from 38 percent in 2005, the year before Mr. Morales took office.Though there is still much misery, the economic transformation is widely visible, in thriving urban markets or in the new tractors tilling land where farm animals pulled plows not long ago. In El Alto, a working-class city perched above the capital, the newly wealthy flaunt their success in the form of brightly colored mansions. Another recent addition: the proliferation of bakeries selling elaborate cakes, a sign that even those of more modest means have extra cash to spend.One of the most surprising developments is the way that Bolivia has amassed foreign currency, salting away a rainy-day fund of about $14 billion, equal to more than half of its gross domestic product, or 17 months of imports, that can help it get through economic hard times.According to the monetary fund, Bolivia has the highest ratio in the world of international reserves to the size of its economy, having recently surpassed China in that regard.\u201cWe are showing the entire world that you can have socialist policies with macroeconomic equilibrium,\u201d said Economy and Finance Minister Luis Arce. \u201cEverything we are going to do is directed at benefiting the poor. But you have to do it applying economic science.\u201dThe country is doing well thanks to relatively high prices for natural gas \u2014 its most important export \u2014 during Mr. Morales\u2019s presidency. That enabled Mr. Morales to order in November that all government and many private sector workers get double the customary year-end bonus of a full month\u2019s salary.It was a populist move that critics linked to the coming election season \u2014 Mr. Morales will run for a new term in October. But it is consistent with a broader effort to redistribute wealth and direct some of the country\u2019s natural gas income directly into people\u2019s pockets.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily say these are mainstream economic policies,\u201d Ms. Corbacho said. \u201cWhat we have assessed as very positive are the outcomes they have achieved when it comes to growth, social indicators\u201d and other criteria.Bolivia\u2019s turnaround is noteworthy because for many years the country was a proving ground for the kind of orthodox, free market policies long promoted by the monetary fund and other international institutions. Grappling with a host of economic problems, including hyperinflation that reached 24,000 percent in 1985, the government cut spending, eliminated fuel subsidies, partially privatized government-owned companies and fired many workers.Critics say that while those policies tamed inflation, they also did long-term damage, exacerbating the unequal distribution of wealth, pushing newly out-of-work miners and farmers into coca farming that increased cocaine production, and ultimately contributing to the social unrest that helped usher in Mr. Morales as president.\u201cThe Morales administration has basically cast off the recommendations of the I.M.F. and other huge international lending organizations, and for the first time, during his tenure, you see those macroeconomic indicators improve significantly, which finally gains the approval of organizations like the I.M.F.,\u201d said Kathryn Ledebur, director of the Andean Information Network, a research group based in Bolivia.Mr. Morales has benefited by being president during a time of high commodity prices, which have driven economic growth here and in many countries throughout the region. In a highly contentious move, he nationalized the energy sector by taking a greater stake in the companies that extract the nation\u2019s gas and demanding a bigger share of the revenues. That has greatly increased government income, giving him the money to pay for social programs like cash payments to young mothers, improved pensions and infrastructure projects.But while the nationalization rattled foreign investors, Mr. Morales now gets generally good marks for the way he has handled the windfall.\u201cYou could mismanage this opportunity, and the reality is they have not,\u201d said Faris Hadad-Zervos, the resident representative of the World Bank in La Paz, who cited the large foreign reserves stock and substantial increases in government spending on infrastructure.Not that there are no areas of concern. Both the monetary fund and the World Bank say much more should be done to encourage private investment. Bolivia has less than half the rate of private investment of most other countries in South America.There are also worries about what will happen if natural gas prices fall significantly, and whether Bolivia is simply in the midst of the typical boom-and-bust cycle that often bedevils poor countries.Bolivia\u2019s gas exports go entirely to Brazil and Argentina on long-term contracts, meaning that sustained economic problems in those countries could eventually spell problems for Bolivia. But a greater concern is over a low level of investment in gas exploration, which could endanger Bolivia\u2019s ability to maintain production levels in the future.\u201cThis is not sustainable in the long term,\u201d said Jose L. Valera, a lawyer based in Houston who has represented energy companies doing business in Bolivia. \u201cThe model is not designed to generate substantial profits for an oil industry that is going to then be incentivized to reinvest in Bolivia.\u201dBolivia\u2019s relations with the monetary fund and the World Bank, both based in Washington, are a sharp contrast to those of some of its leftist allies. Venezuela, Ecuador and Argentina refuse to take part in annual economic reviews by the monetary fund.Mr. Morales\u2019s public statements have also often been highly critical. He once said the World Bank tried to blackmail him into changing his economic policies. And in a speech in December 2012, he called for the dismantling of \u201cthe international financial system and its satellites, the I.M.F. and the World Bank.\u201dBut his attitude toward the bank seemed to have changed in July at an event to announce a World Bank project to support quinoa farmers.\u201cThe World Bank does not blackmail, or impose conditions, not anymore,\u201d Mr. Morales said, according to a publication on the bank\u2019s website. To celebrate, he played a friendly soccer game with the bank\u2019s president, Jim Yong Kim.Monica Machicao contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Limbo of Asian Markets ", "Date": "2014-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySURABAYA, Indonesia \u2014 The docks at big Indonesian ports like this one are quieter these days, as China\u2019s demand for raw materials has begun to cool.But drive an hour inland and the agricultural giant Cargill is racing to finish a cocoa-bean processing plant, while a large instant-noodle factory is running full tilt to meet the demand for convenience food from Indonesia\u2019s large and growing middle class. \u201cWe\u2019re having quite a tough time keeping up,\u201d said Tjun Sulestio, a general manager of the noodle factory, run by PT. Suprama.The contrast in many emerging markets between signs of a looming currency crisis and strong domestic demand is visible around the world. Stock markets and currencies have fallen in recent months in places like Buenos Aires; Jakarta, Indonesia; Manila, and Istanbul, as investors have worried that weaker Chinese growth and a United States Federal Reserve that is pumping out fewer dollars will cause a global stumble in many developing nations.Like limbo dancers struggling to shuffle under a low bar before standing upright again, emerging markets must shuffle along under weak commodity exports and capital outflows before they can recover their balance and let strong domestic demand for products like cars, electronics and instant noodles carry their economies forward again. The question is whether their consumers and businesses will continue to spend, or whether international troubles will spill into domestic economies in ways they cannot control.\u201cWe don\u2019t want that bar to go too low,\u201d said Jakob F. Sorensen, the chairman of the European Business Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia. \u201cThe lower it goes, the harder it will be.\u201dThere are reasons for optimism. Many stock markets in emerging economies have rebounded in the past week. International problems have not yet caused the bank runs and large-scale flight of international investors that made previous crises so severe, like the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998.Central banks in emerging markets have gone out of their way to accumulate rainy-day funds of dollars and other foreign currencies. With the conspicuous exception of China, bank regulators in emerging markets have also imposed tougher lending regulations and kept shadow banking operations on tight leashes.While emerging markets may face trouble from beyond their borders, in many of them spending at home has seldom been so strong. Many businesses are even struggling to find enough workers.In the Philippines, a popular chain of chicken restaurants now promises a free meal to new employees and their families within five minutes of their signing up for work. Some McDonald\u2019s franchises have put up signs offering free meals merely for filling out a job application.India and Indonesia suffered large declines in their currencies and stock markets last summer, lasting through early autumn, after Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve at the time, indicated in May that the Fed would start easing back on measures that helped keep longer-term rates at historically low levels. Mr. Bernanke\u2019s warnings had the effect of attracting money from overseas investors to the United States.Both India and Indonesia have since sharply narrowed the deficits in their current accounts, a broad measure of trade and financing. They allowed significant depreciation in their currencies last summer, which made imports more expensive and their exports more competitive.As a result, both countries have less need of further foreign investment in their financial markets, although they could still be hurt if overseas investors withdrew money that they had already put in.\u201cThere definitely will be an effect of both the Fed tapering and a cooling China,\u201d said Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist at Axis Bank in Mumbai. But \u201cIndia is definitely better prepared today to deal with these foreign shocks than it was nine months ago.\u201dPolitical troubles have played a role in market declines in countries like Turkey and Argentina. They have also played a role in Asia, most notably in Thailand, where Bangkok has been clogged with demonstrators for weeks.Yet even the Thai tourism industry seems to be weathering the difficulties surprisingly well so far. \u201cEven though everyone says the economies in China and India are having problems, we still see increases in their numbers\u201d of tourists, said Pornthip Hiranyakij, the managing director of Destination Asia, a travel company.The big question now is how much further growth in China will slow. A serious cutback in China\u2019s demand would not just harm emerging markets\u2019 shipments directly to China, it would also cause further erosion in the already falling world prices for emerging markets\u2019 coal, copper, palm oil and other commodities.Jianguang Shen, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Mizuho Securities, last week labeled troubles in China\u2019s so-called shadow banking sector the biggest potential threat to that country\u2019s economic growth this year.HSBC, the global bank, calculates that growth in China\u2019s economy now adds twice as many dollars to annual global demand as growth in the United States economy and far more than the anemic economies of the European Union. \u201cChina needs to keep humming, or U.S. and E.U. growth would need to step up meaningfully to make up the difference,\u201d said Frederic Neumann, the bank\u2019s co-head of Asian economic research.Another tactic is for emerging markets to start replacing China as the preferred locale for making export goods like clothing, shoes and electronics. Blue-collar wages have increased at least fivefold in China over the last decade, prompting a few industries, including garment and shoe production, to start shifting to Southeast Asia.China is still gaining global market share in consumer electronics, however. That may change, though not rapidly enough to help emerging markets this year.Bayu Krisnamurthi, Indonesia\u2019s vice minister of trade, said in an interview in Jakarta that the Foxconn Technology Group of Taiwan, the main manufacturer of Apple devices, as well as other consumer electronics, was preparing to build a large factory in Indonesia. \u201cThe other brands will come in their footsteps,\u201d he said.Foxconn said in an email reply to questions on Friday that \u201cwe are currently in discussions with potential local partners and government officials, a process we expect to finalize in 2014.\u201dIndonesia was once a symbol of everything that could go wrong in a commodity-dependent country during tough times. During the Asian financial crisis, banks collapsed and civil unrest forced a change of government.But at least for now, Rolls-Royces can still be seen purring through the streets of Surabaya, Indonesia\u2019s second-largest city, and new apartment buildings are still under construction.Whenever global economic troubles threaten, \u201cpeople are calling for the end of the world in Indonesia,\u201d said Jean-Louis Guillou, the president of Cargill\u2019s Indonesia operations. \u201cAnd so far, I haven\u2019t seen the evidence for that.\u201dJoe Cochrane contributed reporting from Jakarta, Neha Thirani Bagri from Mumbai and Thomas Fuller from Bangkok.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Gain in Factory Activity Eases Fears of a Slowdown ", "Date": "2014-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 New orders for factory goods outside of the volatile transportation sector rose for a third straight month in December, easing concerns of an abrupt slowdown in manufacturing activity.The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that nontransportation factory orders edged up 0.2 percent last month, even though overall orders declined 1.5 percent. The gain in nontransportation orders suggested that the factory sector was positioned to withstand what appears to be partly a weather-related slowdown. A report on Monday showed factory activity dived to an eight-month low in January.The 1.5 percent drop in overall factory orders was the largest decline since July, and they were weighed down by a plunge in bookings for transportation equipment. Economists had expected a 1.7 percent drop in overall orders.Transportation orders are often volatile, and economists frequently strip them out to get a better view of underlying trends.New orders for transportation equipment tumbled 9.7 percent last month, the largest drop since July, after increasing 8.1 percent in November. Nonmilitary aircraft and parts orders fell 17.5 percent, while orders for motor vehicles fell by 1.5 percent, the most in five months.Helping to take the sting out of the overall decline, orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft \u2014 seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans \u2014 fell only 0.6 percent.Order backlogs also continued their steady rise, reaching their highest level since the government started tracking them in 1992. \u201cToday\u2019s report shows slightly less weakness in the underlying trend,\u201d said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities.The report on Monday from the Institute for Supply Management had shown the largest drop in orders in more than 30 years. That helped ignite fears of a cooling in manufacturing. The sector makes up about 12 percent of the economy and has been one of the main pillars of growth.The latest data on factory orders showed that manufacturing was still poised for expansion, Mr. Quinlan said. \u201cGrowth continues at a moderate pace, underscored by the recent trend of core orders,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

He would have greater leverage to get what he wants in Europe if there were a treaty change giving all leaders veto power.Friday\u2019s meeting, after which the two leaders lunched in a country pub, was the first Anglo-French summit meeting attended by Mr. Hollande. It came at a time of some turmoil for the French president, who languishes in the opinion polls and split from his partner, Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, following reports that he had an affair with another woman.Asked by a British reporter if the president\u2019s private life had made his country an \u201cinternational joke,\u201d Mr. Hollande declined to comment.Both leaders did their best to highlight areas of common interest. The Brize Norton air base where they held talks is a \u201csymbol of solidarity\u201d between the two nations, Mr. Hollande said. From there 70 years ago, British planes flew missions in preparation for the D-Day landings in Normandy. More recently, planes took off from Brize Norton to refuel French aircraft involved in operations in Mali.Britain and France are the two biggest military powers in the European Union, and agreements announced included an investment of nearly $200 million in developing armed drones and unmanned underwater vehicles able to find and neutralize seabed mines.\u201cWe have agreed on an exciting new collaboration on space,\u201d added Mr. Cameron, \u201cthat will create new economic opportunities for both our industries with a 15 million-pound investment paving the way for joint work on earth observation, telecommunications and space research.\u201d\u201cBoth of us are facing situations where we have to take difficult economic decisions,\u201d Mr. Cameron said diplomatically, welcoming more recent proposals by Mr. Hollande to reduce French labor costs.\u201cOf course we are not going to agree about everything,\u201d he said. \u201cFran\u00e7ois is a French Socialist and I am a British Conservative.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Sell Cheap U.S. Coal to Asia", "Date": "2014-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEASTSOUND, Wash. \u2014 FROM where I live on Orcas Island in Puget Sound, north of Seattle, I can see Cherry Point across the wind-whipped waters of the Salish Sea. This sandy promontory jutting into Georgia Strait has become the focus of heated debate here in the Pacific Northwest.Peabody Energy, Carrix and other corporations hope to build a shipping terminal at Cherry Point to export nearly 50 million metric tons of coal to Asia annually. They ballyhoo the jobs the terminal may bring to our region but say nothing about the profits they will reap from selling subsidized coal. Opponents decry the prospect of the dirty, smelly, noisy trains blocking railroad crossings all across Washington State as they transport coal here from the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. They also warn that coal dust from the terminal will pollute nearby waters and harm our dwindling populations of herring, threatened Chinook salmon and endangered killer whales.But much larger issues of national and global concern are at stake. The low-sulfur Western coal, strip-mined from federal lands, is valuable public property. The federal government\u2019s leasing of these lands at low cost to strip miners made some sense a few decades ago when the United States needed low-sulfur coal to reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide that was being emitted by coal-burning power plants and causing acid rain. But today, as utilities convert to cheap natural gas and American coal use declines, mining companies are seeking customers in China, Japan and Korea.Shipping this subsidized coal to Asian countries to help them power their factories, which undercut American manufacturers, makes little sense. Yes, this coal will help those countries produce cheap consumer goods for sale in stores across the United States. But it will also promote the continued transfer of industrial work to Asia, especially if the Trans-Pacific Partnership goes through. Is that good for American workers?The coal is extracted from federal lands so cheaply that taxpayers should be outraged. A 2012 study by the nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis concluded that the government\u2019s failure to obtain fair market value for coal mined in the Powder River Basin had deprived taxpayers of almost $1 billion annually over the past 30 years. Last year, the Interior Department\u2019s inspector general similarly reported that the agency was failing to collect sufficient lease payments. And last week, the Government Accountability Office concluded that the coal leasing program run by the Bureau of Land Management operates without sufficient oversight to ensure that fair lease prices are being paid and does not fully account for export sales in evaluating these fees.\u201cTaxpayers are likely losing out so that coal companies can reap a windfall and export that coal overseas, where it is burned, worsening climate change,\u201d said Senator Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, who requested the study. When coal companies can strip mine Western coal for less than $10 a ton and sell it in Asia for nearly 10 times as much, lucrative profits can be banked all along the global supply chain. No wonder the Australian coal company Ambre Energy is planning to build two coal terminals on the Columbia River. In all, those terminals and the one proposed for Cherry Point could ship 100 million metric tons of coal to Asia annually.Asian nations hungry for energy have much looser pollution regulations and will pay dearly for coal, despite its noxious impacts on health and the environment. The health impact of coal emissions has recently become obvious in China, where this pollution contributed to 1.2 million premature deaths in 2010, according to the Global Burden of Disease study, published in The Lancet, a British medical journal.And this pollution is unfortunately not confined to Asia. Wafted aloft on winds blowing across the Pacific, it reaches North America, depositing fine particles, mercury and other toxins on land and in water. Carbon dioxide emitted by burning coal adds inexorably to the global overburden of greenhouse gases warming the planet. Projected exports from Cherry Point alone could result in over 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. The gas has already begun to boost the acidity of near-shore waters, threatening Washington\u2019s shellfish industry.The billions of tons of coal burned in Asia every year contribute markedly to global warming. Should the United States be selling them subsidized coal and encouraging this impending disaster? Our nation needs a new, transparent, clean-energy policy that no longer turns a blind eye to the many negative impacts of coal burning \u2014 or to companies trying to sell coal to other nations playing catch-up in the global economy. A cornerstone of this policy must be the rational use of our vast reserves of Western coal as we ramp down the overuse of what is, by far, the dirtiest fossil fuel.Is our economy to become a resource economy like Australia\u2019s, exporting mineral wealth to Asia in return for mining and shipping jobs, plus cheap consumer goods? Should we support this Faustian bargain by selling our coal so inexpensively? What kinds of jobs and living conditions do we really want to foster, and where? These are questions a rational and much-needed, 21st-century energy policy would address.A great and growing plume of carbon dioxide continues to rise over Asia as transnational corporations are shifting manufacturing operations overseas. We can take a resolute stand at Cherry Point and begin to halt this boondoggle. A good first step would be one Senator Markey advocates: a moratorium on new coal leases.

{"Headline": "Global Reach for Smaller Fairs", "Date": "2014-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 There are, according to the latest reliable estimate from The Art Newspaper, 278 art fairs in the world. For cash-rich, time-strapped contemporary art buyers, fairs have an obvious appeal: New artists can be discovered in an afternoon; hundreds of dealers can be met in just a few days.But most buyers can\u2019t get to all of them. \u201cMust attend\u201d fixtures \u2014 like Art Basel, Frieze London and Art Basel Miami Beach \u2014 remain locked in the busy collectors\u2019 electronic diaries, leaving a mass of \u201cmight attend\u201d fairs competing for the attention of the art world\u2019s globe-trotting clientele. Arco Madrid, whose 33rd edition opened to V.I.P. visitors on Tuesday, is one of the more highly regarded. The fair has the challenge of taking place not only in a soulless exhibition multiplex on the outskirts of the Spanish capital, but in an economy that\u2019s still battered by recession, stifling domestic demand. Arco\u2019s solution, under the directorship of Carlos Urroz, has been to internationalize its exhibitor list and program \u2014 this year the focus was on Finland \u2014 and to spend 4.5 million euros, or about $6.2 million, on inviting 500 selected collectors and curators from all over the world to the event.Even though the fair pays for the trips, plenty of international megagallerists and their billionaire clients still give Madrid a miss. Yet Spain\u2019s links to the emerging economies of Latin America have encouraged a growing number of dealers and collectors from that region to attend, and the fair is growing in stature.\u201cWe sell mostly to museums and foundations at Arco,\u201d said Marina Buendia, a director of Vermelho, one of 10 S\u00e3o Paulo dealers among the 219 exhibitors at the fair. Her cutting-edge contemporary gallery also exhibits at Frieze. \u201cWe\u2019ve been at Arco for six years and things are getting better,\u201d she said. \u201cOtra Frontera,\u201d a 2013 conceptual wall sculpture made out of a sieve by the Argentinian artist Nicol\u00e1s Robbio, was among Vermelho\u2019s early sales, to a Colombian collector for $4,000. (Dealers at art fairs can choose in which currency to price their works. Vermelho opted for U.S. dollars, the international currency of the art market.)Arco is \u201can important event for Latin American dealers,\u201d said the S\u00e3o Paulo-based gallerist Luciana Brito, who was showing 2009-2010 landscape photocollages by the German-trained Brazilian artist Caio Reisewitz, priced from \u20ac4,000 to \u20ac20,000. \u201cWe get to meet a lot of museum curators and directors.\u201d Early purchases at the five-day fair, which ended on Sunday and which last year attracted 100,000 visitors, tended to be at modest price-points. Galer\u00eda Elvira Gonz\u00e1lez, from Madrid, sold the 1984 Robert Mapplethorpe photograph \u201cPheasant\u201d to a Spanish foundation for \u20ac13,000. On the second day of the fair Gonz\u00e1lez sold the 2008 Miquel Barcelo canvas, \u201cDogon - 2,\u201d reminiscent of a cave painting, for about \u20ac430,000, one of the few confirmed bigger ticket sales during the early stages of Arco.This week brings another smaller fair, Art14 in London, and the Armory Show in New York follows the next. The art fair merry-go-round keeps turning, and for the moment at least, there\u2019s no sign of it slowing down.Drawings are becoming an unlikely hot stock these days. Long regarded as a slightly arcane category of art collecting, they\u2019ve nonetheless sparked some exceptional auction prices during the last 18 months.The New York-based private equity magnate Leon Black paid 29.7 million pounds, or about $49.5 million, for Raphael\u2019s \u201cHead of a Young Apostle\u201d at Sotheby\u2019s London in December 2012. Earlier this month, the Jan Krugier collection of 19th- and 20th-century drawings raised \u00a374.8 million, almost three times the modest low estimate (also at Sotheby\u2019s London).With big-beast collectors like Mr. Black spending millions at the top end of the market, now is as good a time as any to announce the sale of the collection of I.Q. van Regteren Altena (1899-1980). Mr. Altena was head of the department of prints and drawings at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam from 1948 to 1962. Before and after that appointment he was an active private buyer himself, putting together his own \u201cKabinet van tekeningen,\u201d or cabinet of drawings.About 1,000 of Mr. Altena\u2019s purchases will be sold by his family at Christie\u2019s in a series of four auctions in London, Amsterdam and Paris this year and next, estimated at \u00a310 million. \u201cAltena was one of those collectors who had an amazing reputation as a connoisseur,\u201d said the London-based specialist dealer Stephen Ongpin, who underbid Mr. Black on the Raphael drawing. \u201cHe was buying when there were hundreds of auctions and he could easily make discoveries.\u201dOne of Mr. Altena\u2019s discoveries, back in the 1920s, was Peter Paul Rubens\u2019s only known drawing for his 1609-10 painting, \u201cSamson and Delilah,\u201d now in the National Gallery in London. That early masterpiece, produced in Antwerp soon after he returned from Italy in 1608, shows what an innovative artist Rubens could be before he made a fortune out of decorating the royal palaces of Europe.The pen-and-ink drawing is estimated to sell for at least \u00a31.5 million. It will be the most highly valued lot in a 70-lot sale at Christie\u2019s in London on July 10 of Dutch and Flemish drawings from the collection. A pen-and-ink study of a mutilated hand by the 16th-century Dutch Mannerist artist Hendrick Goltzius is another desirable trophy, priced at \u00a3300,000 to \u00a3500,000. Goltzius, at the age of 1, burned his hands on burning coals, and the after-effects were also recorded in a similar, much-admired drawing in the Teylers Museum, Haarlem, in Holland.Though they\u2019re no longer collected in quite the same quantity as they once were by short-trousered schoolboys, stamps can still be worth serious amounts of money.The British Guiana One-Cent Magenta is among the most valuable. This British colonial penny issue from 1856, resembling a hexagonal red blob, became the most expensive stamp in the world in 1922 when it sold at auction for $35,000.It has remained the Mona Lisa of philately since then, selling to the American chemical heir John E. du Pont for a record $935,000 in 1980. Du Pont died in prison in 2010, after being convicted in 1997 of the murder of an Olympic wrestling champion. The One-Cent Magenta will be sold by Du Pont\u2019s estate at Sotheby\u2019s New York on June 17 with an estimate of $10 million to $20 million, far in excess of the current auction record of about $2.2 million for a single stamp. No work of art has consistently broken auction records in this way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Minimum Wages Rise, Businesses Grapple With Consequences", "Date": "2014-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySmall BusinessSince 2008, the number of children her company cares for has dropped to 40 from 75, reducing her annual revenue to $350,000 from $600,000 and forcing her to cut her own salary 75 percent. In business since 2000, Ms. Riley said she paid all of her 16 employees more than minimum wage \u2014 her lowest-paid workers make $7.75, the highest $15 \u2014 but she fears that increasing the minimum will force her to raise everybody\u2019s pay to maintain her structure.The latest increase, she said, is likely to add $10,000 to $15,000 a year to payroll costs that already make up nearly 80 percent of her operating expenses. \u201cThis really scares me,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t have to close.\u201dOn Jan. 1, 13 states raised their minimum wage, and an additional 22 and the federal government are expected to consider increases this year as well. President Obama is backing a bill to raise the $7.25 federal minimum to $10.10 an hour, to be put into effect in three stages, with annual adjustments indexed to inflation. And in his State of the Union address, the president said he would raise the minimum paid to federal contractors by executive order.There is widespread disagreement about the impact of the increases. Paul Ballew, chief economist at Dun & Bradstreet, says small businesses are a diverse universe, with some more sensitive to policy changes than others. That said, he added: \u201cThere remains a lot of economic pressure on small businesses. The downturn was so severe, and any time you have a policy change, you are going to get pushback. They\u2019ve had a really rough go of it the past six years, and they\u2019ve already squeezed out a lot of the fat.\u201dOthers point out that the proposed increases barely keep up with inflation. The current federal minimum of $7.25, when adjusted for inflation, is about 23 percent lower than it was in 1968. In addition, the increases do not reflect an evolving labor landscape in which the number of minimum-wage earners who work full time has increased substantially, prompting some to ask, Is there never a time when the minimum could be raised without objection? And if a business cannot afford to pay minimum wage, might it be doing something wrong?Ms. Riley said her options were limited. She has already laid off nine employees in recent years. Having raised her rates two years ago, by $5 a week, she is reluctant to do so again \u2014 especially since it would take an increase of $30 a week per child, to $255 from $225, to cover the increased wages. That, she said, would cause many of her clients to withdraw their children and rely instead on less expensive (and unregulated) babysitters.This year, Massachusetts is considering raising its minimum to $9 an hour, from $8. Should that happen, Ms. Conway said, she will probably need to reduce her staff of 20. Her employees currently make an average of $9 an hour, with managers earning from $10 to $15. Like Ms. Riley, Ms. Conway said that an increase in the minimum would force her to raise pay across the board.And she, too, is reluctant to raise prices again. In 2011 and 2012, she increased her admission fees by a dollar \u2014 they generally run from $5 to $10 now, based on age and time of day. Another increase, she said, would just make things worse: \u201cWe will price ourselves out of business.\u201dIn the past, when Massachusetts increased the state\u2019s minimum, Ms. Conway responded by increasing the minimum age of her workers to 16 from 14. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pay a 14-year-old $9 an hour with no experience, maturity or work ethic,\u201d she said. More recently, she has been hiring 18-year-olds with college experience. \u201cWhat this does,\u201d she said, \u201cis eliminate the opportunity for young people to get started in the work force.\u201dShould minimum wage reach $10 an hour, Ms. Conway said she would reduce her staff to 10 employees and double up on work tasks. \u201cThis is a slippery slope that could absolutely cause me to shut down and force me into bankruptcy,\u201d she said.\u201cI think those against increases underestimate how business success is tied to employee satisfaction,\u201d said Ms. Rothschild, who employs 11 people full time and three part time. She said her employees were part of the reason her cafe\u2019s revenue increased to $600,876 last year, up 31 percent from $457,940 in 2012. She expects another increase this year.Paying higher hourly wages was part of Charmington\u2019s business plan from the start. \u201cWe felt that we would end up with more dedicated employees, who would be happier, and we found that to be true,\u201d Ms. Rothschild said, adding that she had a 22 percent employee turnover rate, compared with a restaurant industry average of 50 to 75 percent. A stable staff, she said, helps productivity, saves her money on training and food waste, and leads to better customer service.With Maryland looking to raise the state\u2019s minimum to $8.25, Ms. Rothschild said she was considering several plans, including raising all base pay to $8.25 in preparation. She says she believes that it is possible to increase wages and still keep her payroll within 35 percent of operating costs without cutting hours, jobs or benefits. \u201cI believe part of our costs in running a business includes investing in employees,\u201d she said.There are examples of small businesses that have made paying higher wages a cornerstone of their operations \u2014 and then grew much larger. Costco, for example, pays its hourly employees an average of $20.89 an hour (Walmart\u2019s hourly workers make an average of $12.81). When In-N-Out Burger, the California-based chain, opened in 1948 (the same year as McDonald\u2019s), the minimum wage was 65 cents an hour but its founder, Harry Snyder, paid $1 an hour (plus one burger per shift).An earlier version of this article misstated the size of Ms. Riley\u2019s rate increase two years ago. It was $5 a week, not $5 an hour.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Effects of Raising the Minimum Wage", "Date": "2014-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetters To the Editor:For instance, your certainty that increasing the minimum wage does not reduce employment runs counter to dozens of credible studies by economists that show a negative (though modest) effect. There are also a few recent studies showing no effect, generating some doubt about exactly what will happen.But the risk of employment loss for several hundred thousand low-wage workers, in an already soft job market, should not be so easily dismissed. And the very large minimum wage increases now occurring in many states and localities will almost certainly drive some employers across their borders toward lower-wage jurisdictions.Also, I take issue with your argument that a $10 minimum wage is still too low. Virtually all less skilled American workers have experienced declining relative earnings in recent decades \u2014 partly because of powerful market forces like technology and globalization. Those forces give employers and consumers many options to avoid higher-priced labor, as will further mechanization of low-wage jobs in the near future.In all, a moderate minimum wage increase, coupled with some expansion of the earned-income tax credit, seems sensible, though we should all be humble about predicting its exact effects. The writer is a professor of public policy at Georgetown University and a former chief economist of the Labor Department in the Clinton administration.To the Editor:We have reached a point in the evolution of capitalism where the needs of the money class and the needs of the working class have converged. What our capitalist system needs most is increased domestic consumption. Our economy is producing more goods and services than we can afford to buy.Raising the minimum wage would stimulate demand by putting money into the pockets of the people who are most likely to spend it. The jobs created by the increase in demand for goods and services would overwhelm any direct job losses. This is the same logic used to support lower tax rates \u2014 lower rates bring more economic activity, which leads to more government revenue.Low-income workers survive on a combination of wages and various government programs. These government programs sometimes act as a deterrent to workers who want to work harder and earn more. Raising the minimum wage would reduce the need for these programs and remove government dependency from many people\u2019s lives.Stimulating the economy by increasing the spending power of the working class, and lessening dependency on government, should be ideas on which both conservatives and liberals can agree. The writer is emeritus professor of accounting at Kingsborough Community College.To the Editor:Bankers and corporate leaders can make tens of millions of dollars a year, but we dare not envision an $18-an-hour minimum wage for the average American, which you call \u201cuntenable\u201d?I own a small film production business. My workers start at $25 an hour, and I am able to make a living from our joint efforts just fine. My workers are loyal to our mission and are happier than most. I cannot imagine lowering their wages or suggesting that they get federal aid after working an eight-hour day for me.I refuse to make a living based on the suffering of those who work for me.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Preschool Push Moving Ahead in Many States", "Date": "2014-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPreschool is having its moment, as a favored cause for politicians and interest groups who ordinarily have trouble agreeing on the time of day. President Obama devoted part of his State of the Union address to it, while the deeply red states of Oklahoma and Georgia are being hailed as national models of preschool access and quality, with other states and cities also forging ahead on their own.For generations, it was largely Democrats who called for government-funded preschool \u2014 and then only in fits and starts \u2014 and that remains the case in Congress, where proposals have yet to gain traction among Republicans. But outside Washington, it has become a bipartisan cause, uniting business groups and labor unions, with Republican governors like Rick Snyder of Michigan and Robert Bentley of Alabama pushing some of the biggest increases in preschool spending. \u201cIt\u2019s a human need and an economic need,\u201d said Mr. Snyder, who raised preschool spending by $65 million last year and will propose a similar increase this year, doubling the size of the state program in two years. He called the spending an investment whose dividends \u201cwill show up for decades to come.\u201dAnalysts also see politics behind the shift at the state level, with preschool appealing particularly to women and minorities, groups whose votes are needed by Republicans.Though Republicans and Democrats are clashing with teachers\u2019 unions over teacher evaluations and standardized testing, those unions strongly support preschool expansion if it means more jobs in public schools.Not that any of these factors will necessarily change things in Congress, where Republicans have steadfastly opposed the proposal by Mr. Obama, who has called for a $75 billion federal investment in preschool over 10 years, paid for with an increased tobacco tax.Preschool advocates say that Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee is one of the Republicans most receptive to their arguments, but he rejected the president\u2019s plan as a top-down mandate from Washington. \u201cEarly childhood education is important and we should try to make it available to the largest number of children possible,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cBut most of that should be done by local communities and state governments.\u201dSenator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, has introduced a prekindergarten bill that would cost $34 billion over five years. In a nod to conservative resistance to a tobacco tax, Mr. Harkin has said he is open to any funding mechanism, but he has found no Republican co-sponsors.\u201cThere\u2019s still that ideological barrier that Republicans have that the federal government has no business being in elementary and secondary education,\u201d he said.Mr. Haskins, of Brookings, said congressional Republicans oppose a federal program \u201cfirst because it\u2019s an Obama initiative and you may have noticed that they aren\u2019t in love with the guy,\u201d and because of a general resistance to new social programs and taxes. He and other analysts said that Republican governors tend to take a more pragmatic, less ideological approach than their congressional counterparts, and have less fear of Tea Party-inspired primary challenges.Critics say that public funding of early education has been ineffective, pointing to studies that show the academic effects of Head Start \u2014 the best known federal preschool program \u2014 have faded by third grade. Andrew J. Coulson, director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute, a right-leaning think tank, said studies that have demonstrated long-term benefits of preschool, such as higher graduation rates, fewer behavioral problems throughout elementary and high school, and reduced crime rates, were conducted on small populations of children enrolled in costly programs.Advances in the sciences also point to the importance of the earliest years. \u201cThere\u2019s overwhelming and indisputable evidence across the entire biological sciences that early experiences shape the developing brain,\u201d said Jack P. Shonkoff, director of the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University.Even those who agree that early education can reap long-term benefits say policy makers should not bank on miracles. Mark Lipsey, a psychologist at Vanderbilt University who is leading a study of a voluntary preschool program in Tennessee that has shown early indications of some lasting social benefits for children who participate, said advocates sometimes made preschool sound \u201clike you put them in the pre-K washing machine and scrub them clean and they come out after that.\u201d\u201cBut effects of poverty and disadvantaged environments don\u2019t work that way,\u201d Dr. Lipsey said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cumulative process and it\u2019s going to take cumulative efforts to make a big difference. There\u2019s potential here but we also have to be realistic.\u201dThere are almost as many ideas about how to pay for preschool as there are programs. Several governors have advocated finding the money within existing budgets. San Antonio adopted a sales tax increase, while Virginia uses lottery money for its program. Mr. de Blasio wants to increase income taxes on New York City\u2019s wealthiest residents, and Maine lawmakers are seeking to use casino revenue. One legislator in Maryland has proposed legalizing and taxing marijuana to finance preschool.Florida had the highest enrollment in 2012 \u2014 almost four-fifths of all 4-year-olds \u2014 but with about 84 percent of those children attending classes run by private, religion-based or family centers, the state\u2019s preschool programs did not fare well on quality measures. Other states with more than 50 percent enrollment included Wisconsin, Iowa, Texas, and just one strongly liberal state, Vermont.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Mayor in the Middle of Two San Franciscos", "Date": "2014-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Edwin M. Lee, the mayor of San Francisco, began his career as a lawyer fighting for public housing tenants in the city\u2019s Chinatown and likes to think of himself as a champion for those who are struggling.But with his city flourishing and dotted with construction cranes and tech start-ups, he finds himself in an unexpected position: backed by the city\u2019s new and powerful technology elite, and condemned by housing advocates who accuse him of aggravating a shortage of affordable units and making life difficult for middle-class residents increasingly anxious about rising prices.Perhaps nowhere in America is the debate over income inequality being carried out as fiercely as in San Francisco, where the technology industry\u2019s success has led to a roaring economy, social disruption and widespread protests.\u201cProbably 25 years ago I would have been in this cultural war on the advocacy side,\u201d Mr. Lee, a Democrat, said in a recent interview, describing himself as \u201ca little bit\u201d surprised by the intensity of the anger.\u201cWhen I represented tenants in Chinatown, it was a cultural war about low-income seniors and immigrant families trying to make the city respect them,\u201d he said. \u201cFix the elevators in public housing, fix the lights. Some of the advocates remind me that we\u2019ve got to keep paying attention to this, because there is poverty in the city. There are people struggling.\u201dMr. Lee, 61, who grew up the son of working-class Chinese immigrants in public housing in Seattle, continued: \u201cNow that I\u2019m mayor, I can do something about it in a big way. So if there is a cultural war, I\u2019m in it, but I\u2019m in it to solve as much as I can.\u201dSo recently, in what many in the city see as a course correction, the mayor has emphasized what he calls the \u201caffordability agenda.\u201d He has spoken with urgency about a growing housing shortage, presenting a plan in his State of the City address to build 30,000 housing units for low- and moderate-income people by 2020 and to protect existing ones. Critics remain skeptical, saying that Mr. Lee was late in recognizing the problem and that his plan was cobbled together in response to political problems.Navigating all this will test the political skills of an accidental politician. Mr. Lee, who spent his career in the city administration until three years ago, when he became San Francisco\u2019s first Asian-American mayor, often seems disposed to work out of the spotlight. Saying he is not \u201cinto the pomp and circumstances of this office,\u201d he has chosen a Chevrolet Volt as his official car.\u201cWhen I pull up, unless you know I\u2019m coming, nobody knows I\u2019m there,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say, \u2018Where\u2019s the mayor?\u2019 They\u2019re looking for the S.U.V., and I\u2019m already there. So I love that, it\u2019s fun to do.\u201dIn his time in office, the city\u2019s unemployment rate has been cut in half, to a record low of 4.8 percent. His policies have helped turn San Francisco into Silicon Valley\u2019s newest, and perhaps most dynamic, extension. Construction cranes rise above even Mid-Market, a long-blighted downtown district that bedeviled his predecessors. President Obama even presented the mayor as an American success story, giving him a prime spot in the audience as Michelle Obama\u2019s guest during the State of the Union address last month.\u201cEveryone should be high-fiving him,\u201d said Jeremy Stoppelman, 36, the chief executive of Yelp, the review website for businesses. \u201cIn the wake of that, it\u2019s essentially a high-class problem, which is, \u2018Oh, no, we have so many jobs in this city, and the economy is doing so well here. Now costs are going up, rents are rising.\u2019 That\u2019s sort of the natural product of success.\u201dMr. Lee joined the city government in 1989 as San Francisco\u2019s first investigator charged with rooting out corruption. He rose steadily, eventually being appointed city administrator in 2005 by Gavin Newsom, then the mayor.After Mr. Newsom was elected lieutenant governor, Mr. Lee was selected in 2011 to complete Mr. Newsom\u2019s term as mayor by two local power brokers, former Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. and Rose Pak, an outspoken advocate for the city\u2019s Chinese population.Going back on an initial pledge that he would not seek a full term, Mr. Lee ran successfully in the 2011 election, strongly urged on by Mr. Brown, Ms. Pak and a new powerful ally, Ron Conway, a well-known technology investor.Mr. Stoppelman of Yelp, which went public two years ago and recently expanded into larger headquarters here, said he viewed the mayor as being pragmatic and problem-solving, qualities that tended to appeal to people in the tech industry.\u201cI think he really tries to be a neutral party and bring people together,\u201d he said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been a lifelong politician. He\u2019s been somebody working in the city, and I think that shows. He doesn\u2019t feel as political.\u201dBut Art Agnos, a former mayor who gave Mr. Lee his first job in city government, has become one of Mr. Lee\u2019s most vehement critics, saying he has become captive of the tech elite. Mr. Lee, he said, lacked the political instincts to steer San Francisco through the current turmoil.\u201cHis whole career was leading to the top of the bureaucracy \u2014 that\u2019s his mind-set,\u201d said Mr. Agnos, who led a successful fight against the development of waterfront luxury condominiums last fall. \u201cBeing at the top of public office is something totally different. You set the policy, you are the leader, you step up.\u201dSan Francisco had a housing shortage long before Mr. Lee took office. In the 1970s, the city began passing regulations that made it extremely difficult and costly to build new housing in the city, said Gabriel Metcalf, executive director of SPUR, a public policy center devoted to planning and urban research.The situation has worsened considerably in the past year, according to tenants\u2019 advocates. Not only has the influx of highly paid tech workers led to higher rents, but it has also increased evictions of longtime tenants by landlords seeking higher rents, said Ted Gullicksen, director of the San Francisco Tenants Union. San Francisco has the highest rents in the nation, with the median rent for a two-bedroom apartment at $3,250.In December, in a meeting organized by Mr. Conway, the mayor met with 30 technology chief executives to discuss the city\u2019s housing and affordability problems. Sf.citi, the organization that Mr. Conway founded two years ago and now effectively serves as the tech industry\u2019s business and political voice, will focus on helping the city government with housing, philanthropy and education, Mr. Conway said.\u201cThis a long-term issue that\u2019s not going away fast,\u201d he said of affordable housing. \u201cSo let\u2019s buckle down and work together.\u201dMr. Lee said he believed that much of the current tension would be defused once the 30,000 housing units were built.\"I think people will feel less fear that they can\u2019t live in the city, and hopefully, it shouldn\u2019t be \u2018us versus them, let\u2019s blame tech,' \u201d he said.Was there a danger in his being too closely identified with the tech industry? \u201cWell, if I was a politician, I suppose there might be,\u201d Mr. Lee said with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t think that way. But I do think that tech needs to help me with the affordability agenda.\u201dAn article last Tuesday about the issues facing San Francisco and its mayor, Edwin M. Lee, misstated the year in which Mr. Lee was first elected. It was 2011, not 2012.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Rapid Turnaround, Toyota Is on Track to Post Record Earnings", "Date": "2014-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 While the American automakers have made drastic comebacks since the recession, no car company has had a bigger revival than Toyota.The Japanese company projected that it would earn net income of 1.9 trillion yen for the year, or about $18.8 billion. That figure would surpass the profit of \u00a51.7 trillion it reported six years ago, before the global financial crisis.The annual profit will also easily exceed the combined earnings in 2013 for General Motors, Ford and the Chrysler division of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and will help bankroll Toyota\u2019s continued expansion.It is a rapid turnaround for a company that nearly lost its reputation for quality when millions of its cars were recalled for problems with unintended acceleration. Under its chief executive, Akio Toyoda, the company has hastened cost cuts, streamlined its global organization chart and increased its emphasis on newer models, flashy designs and fuel economy. The company has also continued to resolve lawsuits stemming from the recalls.\u201cThey went through a lot over the past four years and they have learned from it,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst at the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.Still, the mood on Tuesday at Toyota\u2019s offices here was less than joyous, with executives expressing caution about the global markets\u2019 recent jitters.\u201cThe outlook, especially for emerging markets, is very unclear,\u201d the company\u2019s managing officer, Takuo Sasaki, said at a news conference. \u201cWe need to stay vigilant of any adverse effect the recent financial instability may have on the real economy and auto markets.\u201dThe company has faced difficulties, starting with the financial crisis in 2008 that crippled sales volumes in North America and Europe.In 2009 and 2010, it recalled over 10 million vehicles for a variety of problems tied to unintended acceleration of several of its models. And in 2011, it lost significant production after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.\u201cEverything went so wrong so quickly for Toyota,\u201d Mr. Brauer said. \u201cIt was almost surreal because Toyota was never known to slip up.\u201dLast year, Toyota was the best-selling automaker in the world for a second consecutive year, beating out G.M. and Volkswagen of Germany.Toyota sold 9.98 million new vehicles in 2013. This year, it could become the first automaker to sell more than 10 million new cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles, if it meets its targets.The company\u2019s turnaround has benefited from several factors, including a weaker yen, which is inflating the value of its earnings overseas. Toyota has also moved more manufacturing production out of high-cost Japan, and invested heavily in new products.In the United States, sales of its bread-and-butter Toyota brand vehicles rose 6.7 percent in 2013, which lagged the overall market increase of 7.6 percent.But its higher-priced Lexus luxury division reported an increase of 12.2 percent, which fueled growth in its overall profit margins.Newer models like the Toyota Avalon sedan and RAV-4 sport utility vehicle were particularly big sellers. And its revamped Lexus ES sedan strengthened what was already a competitive luxury lineup.Net profit soared in the company\u2019s most recent quarter that ended in December. For the period, Toyota earned \u00a5525.4 billion, about $5.2 billion, up from \u00a599.9 billion in the similar period the previous year. Revenue for the quarter climbed 24 percent to \u00a56.59 trillion.Company officials on Tuesday played down pressure from investors to use the company\u2019s cash holdings to increase its stock dividend or build new factories in major markets like the United States and China.Instead, Toyota executives vowed not to repeat its overheated expansion strategy of the mid-2000s, which left the company vulnerable to sinking sales during the recession.A year after its previous record profit in 2008, Toyota plunged to its biggest loss in history.\u201cWe will not build factories first and then wait for markets to materialize,\u201d Mr. Sasaki said. \u201cWe will consider expansion only when it becomes clear that production cannot possibly keep up with sales, and we are not there yet.\u201dDespite the surge in profits, Toyota faces challenges to increase its share in the most competitive markets.In the United States, for example, its market share was basically unchanged at 14.3 percent last year. And while it has several refreshed models on the way in coming years, so do its big rivals like G.M. and Ford.\u201cToyota is back to strength, but at the same time the domestic carmakers are up to strength,\u201d Mr. Brauer said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult for them to move the market-share needle anytime soon.\u201dHiroko Tabuchi reported from Tokyo and Bill Vlasic from Detroit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Let Up on Iran", "Date": "2014-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsWASHINGTON \u2014 LIKE all Americans, we strongly hope that the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic efforts lead to the peaceful dismantling of Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program. To achieve this key national security goal, we support a policy that complements the current negotiations with a range of congressional actions that threaten greater economic and diplomatic pressure on the Iranian government.Some opponents of such a policy crudely characterize its proponents as warmongers, and fret that Tehran will walk away from the table. But the critics have it backward.The approach we outline offers the best chance to avoid military conflict with Iran. In fact, diplomacy that is not backed by the threat of clear consequences poses the greatest threat to negotiations \u2014 and increases prospects for war \u2014 because it tells the Iranians they have nothing to lose by embracing an uncompromising position.Successful negotiations between adversaries rest on the confluence of interests and goals. Iran came to the negotiating table because it sought the abrogation of sanctions; we came to the table to reach an agreement that, in the words of President Obama, would \u201cmake it impossible\u201d for Iran to develop nuclear weapons.Our message to Tehran should be clear: It will not achieve its objectives unless it satisfies ours.Offering inducements is not enough. Diplomacy must be backed by a clear choice for the Iranian government: Either it dismantles its nuclear program so that it lacks a pathway to weapons capability or it faces greater economic sanctions and international isolation. Without this clarity, no one can be surprised if Iran rejects diplomatic overtures.We strongly believe that the assertion by Congress of its historic role in foreign policy can, in fact, complement and enhance the administration\u2019s efforts by forcing Iran to recognize the stark implications of intransigence. The president should welcome such congressional initiatives, which would actually strengthen, not weaken, the hand of his administration in forthcoming negotiations. Thus we urge Congress to outline for Iran the acceptable terms of a final accord. This must include, at a minimum, the dismantling of its nuclear program, so that Iran has neither a uranium nor a plutonium pathway to a nuclear weapon.Second, Congress should exercise oversight to ensure that Tehran understands that our existing core sanctions architecture will remain in place for the full duration of the negotiations. Third, Congress must oversee continual implementation of the interim agreement: We cannot permit Iran to violate trust again by advancing its nuclear program even as it joins negotiations.Finally, we support the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act, sponsored by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s chairman, Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, and by Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois. This bill would present Iran with a menu of consequences, including new sanctions \u2014 if, and only if, the talks fail. Earlier this month, we agreed with Mr. Menendez on delaying a vote in the Senate, but we remain committed to the bill\u2019s passage.Historically, presidents have resisted congressional involvement that would affect or constrain their diplomatic efforts. Over the past two decades, however, both Republican and Democratic administrations have opposed Iran sanctions legislation only to embrace it later as their own. At this moment, we must not allow Iran to dictate the appropriate role of Congress.As long as Mr. Rouhani can brazenly declare that he will not dismantle a single centrifuge as part of a final agreement, the United States Congress should proclaim that Iran will pay a steep price for its recklessness. America\u2019s elected representatives are not the problem; the unelected theocrats of Iran are.Next week, more than 14,000 Americans from all walks of life will carry this bipartisan message to Capitol Hill as part of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\u2019s annual policy conference. We support the president\u2019s diplomatic effort to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. We also believe the best chance for success in this purpose lies with continued congressional pressure on Iran throughout the negotiations. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brown Seeks Fourth Term as Governor of California", "Date": "2014-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Gov. Jerry Brown, already the longest-serving governor in California history, announced Thursday that he would run for an unprecedented fourth term.Mr. Brown\u2019s re-election bid had been widely anticipated and his announcement was understated \u2014 in a Twitter posting with a simple picture of him taking out papers in the Alameda County registrar\u2019s office.In an email to supporters, Mr. Brown, who is 75, acknowledged that his latest bid for office would have seemed implausible when he first ran for governor four decades ago.\u201cAt this stage of my life, I can say \u2014 without any hesitation \u2014 that I am prepared and excited to tackle these challenges and the many others that lay before us. In fact, there is nothing I would rather do,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cBy the grace of God and habits of perseverance instilled in me by my family, the Dominican nuns and the Jesuits, I am here and ready to go.\u201dMr. Brown also acknowledged the record drought, which has renewed old conflicts among parts of the state, and he promised to \u201cachieve sensible, scientific and sustainable water policies.\u201d\u201cThe current drought is a portent of weather to come,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt should awaken us to the actions we need to take this year and in the years to follow.\u201dTwo Republicans are planning to challenge Mr. Brown \u2014 Neel Kashkari, a former Treasury official who was the architect of the nation\u2019s bank bailout, and Tim Donnelly, an assemblyman from Southern California.When he first took office in 1975, Mr. Brown was a 36-year-old bachelor with a reputation for wild ideas. But in recent years he has cultivated the reputation of an elder politician happy to eschew trendy policy experiments. His wife and steadfast adviser, Anne Gust Brown, has also helped to soften his image. Recent public opinion polls show that Mr. Brown\u2019s approval rating is at an all-time high. And he is fund-raising vigorously. He has amassed roughly $17 million in campaign contributions, dwarfing the money raised by his Republican challengers. Mr. Kashkari has raised about $1 million since announcing his bid last month, and Mr. Donnelly has raised about half that.Despite an improving economy, the state still faces considerable challenges \u2014 including one of the highest unemployment rates in the country and what Mr. Brown has called a \u201cwall of debt\u201d from unfunded pension liabilities. But Mr. Brown has not stopped advocating ambitious new ideas. He has come under repeated criticism for pushing a $68 billion high-speed rail project that would go from San Diego to San Francisco.Mr. Brown will first face his opponents in June in the state\u2019s open-primary system. The top two vote-getters will then face each other in November\u2019s general election. Democrats currently hold all statewide offices and have an overwhelming majority in the State Legislature. Both Mr. Donnelly and Mr. Kashkari have questioned the long-term impact of Mr. Brown\u2019s work on the state budget and emphasized the unevenness of the economic recovery here. Mr. Kashkari has emphasized the fact that when taking cost of living into account, California has the country\u2019s highest rate of poverty. In a statement Thursday, he said helping struggling families \u201cclearly ranks low on Governor Brown\u2019s list of priorities.\u201d \u201cGovernor Brown again touted a status quo that is devastating for millions of families and communities all across the state,\u201d he said. \u201cCalifornians can\u2019t afford another four years of Governor Brown\u2019s failed leadership.\u201dMr. Donnelly, who represents a conservative stronghold east of Los Angeles, said that the campaign would amount to a \u201cshowdown between socialism and freedom.\u201dIn his message to supporters, Mr. Brown seemed to embrace his role as a moderate who can defy categories, a theme he is likely to return to in his re-election campaign. \u201cMy policy is to encourage both new jobs and to protect workers\u2019 rights and environmental values,\u201d he said. \u201cBalance here is key but what constitutes balance is contested on all sides.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Philippine Leader Sounds Alarm on China", "Date": "2014-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANILA \u2014 President Benigno S. Aquino III called on Tuesday for nations around the world to do more to support the Philippines in resisting China\u2019s assertive claims to the seas near his country, drawing a comparison to the West\u2019s failure to support Czechoslovakia against Hitler\u2019s demands for Czech land in 1938.Like Czechoslovakia, the Philippines faces demands to surrender territory piecemeal to a much stronger foreign power and needs more robust foreign support for the rule of international law if it is to resist, President Aquino said in a 90-minute interview in the wood-paneled music room of the presidential palace.\u201cIf we say yes to something we believe is wrong now, what guarantee is there that the wrong will not be further exacerbated down the line?\u201d he said. \u201cAt what point do you say, \u2018Enough is enough\u2019? Well, the world has to say it \u2014 remember that the Sudetenland was given in an attempt to appease Hitler to prevent World War II.\u201dThe Chinese government reacted strongly on Wednesday to Mr. Aquino\u2019s remarks. The official news agency, Xinhua, published a signed commentary calling Mr. Aquino\u2019s approach inflammatory and unfortunate. China\u2019s claims in the region have a sound historical foundation, the commentary said, and \u201ca professional and mature Philippine leader could do more good to his country by seeking to resolve the territorial disputes with China through dialogue and consultation.\u201dMr. Aquino\u2019s remarks are among the strongest indications yet of alarm among Asian heads of state about China\u2019s military buildup and territorial ambitions, and the second time in recent weeks that an Asian leader has volunteered a comparison to the prelude to world wars.The Philippines already appears to have lost effective control of one of the best-known places of contention, a reef called Scarborough Shoal, after Philippine forces withdrew during a standoff with China in 2012. They left as part of an American-mediated deal in which both sides were to pull back while the dispute was negotiated. Chinese forces remained, however, and gained control.In his nearly four years as president, Mr. Aquino, 53, has exceeded expectations, in his country and the region, for what he could accomplish in a nation once known as the \u201csick man of Asia.\u201d He was a fairly low-key senator when he was propelled into the presidency in 2010 by a wave of national sympathy after the death the year before of his mother, former President Corazon C. Aquino.Political analysts say his administration has fought and reduced the corruption that played a role in holding the Philippines back. In one practical measure of that change, the country has been able to pave more roads per 100 million pesos in spending (about $2.2 million) than before \u2014 when funds were lost to corrupt officials and incompetence \u2014 finally addressing an impediment to commerce.All of the major credit-rating agencies now give the Philippines an investment-grade rating, though the recent downturn in share prices and currencies here and in other emerging markets, on fears of further slowing of the Chinese economy, poses an immediate challenge.In another accomplishment, Mr. Aquino\u2019s negotiators concluded a major peace agreement last month with the main resistance group on Mindanao, the heavily Muslim southern island. Still, the deal remains something of a gamble; it is based in good part on the Muslim group\u2019s ability to hold in check smaller resistance groups, which criticized the pact almost immediately.He has also been less aggressive on land reform \u2014 the Aquinos are among the country\u2019s biggest landowning families \u2014 and he has preferred to shift more of the government\u2019s social spending to poor villages instead. Walden Bello, although a congressman in the president\u2019s governing coalition, said he was one of many who believed that \u201cthe lack of real progress on land reform is a real reason why poverty rates have remained\u201d at high levels.Analysts say the almost feudal power of some entrenched families, including some with militias, is a further obstacle to growth. But Mr. Aquino said he was trying to convince the families that becoming less insular would foster greater prosperity.Mr. Aquino is prevented by law from seeking re-election when his six-year term expires in 2016, raising uncertainty about whether his changes will continue.In the wide-ranging interview on Tuesday, Mr. Aquino said he thought the Philippines and the United States were close to a long-delayed deal that would allow more American troops to rotate through the Philippines, enhancing his country\u2019s security. But the subject remains controversial among the political elite in the Philippines, with memories of the country\u2019s past as an American possession making them wary of closer military ties.The United States is pushing for the deal to aid in its rebalance to Asia, where it hopes to retain a strong influence despite China\u2019s rise.Speaking of the Philippines\u2019 own tensions with the Chinese, Mr. Aquino said his country would not renounce any of its possessions in the sea between it and China.China contends that centuries-old maps show that it had an early claim to the South China Sea almost to Borneo. It is trying to use its large and growing fleet to exercise effective control over reefs and islands in the sea, a strategy that could strengthen its legal position.At the same time, China has strongly resisted applying the procedures and numerical formulas of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to the many reefs and islands that lie much closer to countries like the Philippines than to China. Officials in Beijing also oppose multilateral discussions, preferring bilateral talks with individual countries in Southeast Asia, an approach that allows Chinese leaders to apply greater pressure.While China has been improving its military, Mr. Aquino noted that the last flight by a Philippine fighter jet was in 2005 and that the plane dated from before the Vietnam War. Most of the country\u2019s tiny naval and coast guard fleet dates to World War II.In his first public response to the sanctions, Mr. Aquino said he had no plans to apologize, saying that doing so could create a legal liability and noting that China had not paid compensation to the families of Filipinos who have died in violence there.Mr. Aquino, who is not married, lives in a small cottage behind the presidential palace instead of in the luxurious palace itself. He said he tries to relax before going to sleep each night either by listening to music \u2014 often jazz \u2014 or pursuing his passion as an amateur historian, reading military journals, some about World War II.While recently reading about the predicament of Czechoslovakia\u2019s leaders in the late 1930s, he said, he saw a parallel \u201cin a sense\u201d to his own problems now in facing challenges from China. Appeasement did not work in 1938, he noted; within six months of the surrender of the Sudetenland, Germany occupied most of the rest of Czechoslovakia.The Philippines, he said, is determined not to make similar concessions. \u201cYou may have the might,\u201d he said of China, \u201cbut that does not necessarily make you right.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Untouchable Profits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac", "Date": "2014-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameWould you buy stock in a company that barred you from sharing in its future earnings? Of course not. Participating in the upside is what stock ownership is all about.And yet, as of December 2010, holders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac common stock were subject to such a restriction by the United States government. They didn\u2019t know it at the time, though, because the policy was not disclosed.The memo was addressed to Timothy F. Geithner, then the Treasury secretary, from Jeffrey A. Goldstein, then the under secretary for domestic finance. In discussing Fannie and Freddie, the beleaguered government-sponsored enterprises rescued by taxpayers in September 2008, the memo referred to \u201cthe administration\u2019s commitment to ensure existing common equity holders will not have access to any positive earnings from the G.S.E.\u2019s in the future.\u201dLewis D. Lowenfels, a securities law expert in New York, found this statement insufficient. \u201cIf there is disclosure regarding future Fannie and Freddie earnings and the administration has a commitment that existing Fannie and Freddie common equity holders will never receive any future positive earnings,\u201d he said, \u201cthis commitment would be material to investors and should be disclosed.\u201dWhen the memo was written, plenty of people held these stocks. Regulatory filings show that 18,000 investors held 1.1 billion shares of Fannie Mae common stock, while just over 2,100 investors held 650 million Freddie Mac shares.Back in 2010 and 2011, of course, common stockholders of Fannie and Freddie had little hope of making much money. During those days of rampant mortgage defaults and losses, investors were warned about the uncertainty of their companies\u2019 prospects. Fannie and Freddie shareholders were repeatedly told that the preferred and common stock would have value only if anything remained after taxpayers were fully repaid for the rescue. With the amount of that rescue peaking at $189.5 billion, that was a very big \u201cif.\u201d On the day the Treasury memo was written, the price of Fannie Mae shares closed at 34 cents.But the companies staged a turnaround; in mid-2012, they began earning billions. With interest rates low and banks not lending, Fannie and Freddie became the only mortgage game in town. By Sept. 30 of last year, the companies had returned $185 billion to the Treasury.Failing to disclose the administration\u2019s hard line on the companies\u2019 shareholders is disturbing for another reason. In bailing out Fannie and Freddie, the Treasury received warrants \u2014 optionlike securities that rise in value when the shares underlying them do. When investors, hoping for a housing recovery, flocked to the shares and pushed them higher, the value of the warrants increased. Fannie\u2019s common stock now trades at $3.06 a share.Given Treasury\u2019s interest in a rising stock price, depriving common equity holders of future earnings was especially important for investors to know, Mr. Lowenfels said.All of this has come to a boil because Fannie and Freddie have become so profitable. Yet because of a change in the repayment process dictated by the Treasury in 2012, the $189.5 billion debt technically remains outstanding. The profits generated by Fannie and Freddie have instead gone to the general treasury.Siphoning off the entities\u2019 profits is the opposite of conserving their assets and property, the plaintiffs contend. And they point to a 2009 Treasury memo stating that the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie \u201cpreserves the status and claims\u201d of preferred and common shareholders. One of those claims is surely having access to future earnings.A spokeswoman for the Federal Housing Finance Agency declined to comment, citing the litigation. A spokesmen for Fannie declined to comment as well. A Freddie Mac official did not elaborate beyond pointing to the language in its filings.Perry Capital, a hedge fund, is one of the plaintiffs suing the government. Its lawsuit seeks no damages, but asks that the government follow the 2008 law. The 2010 memo was produced by the Treasury in response to this lawsuit.Do the Treasury\u2019s actions amount to a backdoor nationalization of the companies? A full-fledged takeover would have required Treasury to put all the companies\u2019 obligations \u2014 $4.9 trillion at the time \u2014 on the government\u2019s balance sheet. A nonstarter.Furthermore, nationalization would have required the government to provide compensation to shareholders for what it took. Now the government gets the benefits of the companies\u2019 profits while avoiding any compensation payments.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Get Some Sleep, and Wake Up the G.D.P.", "Date": "2014-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewJanuary is always a good month for behavioral economics: Few things illustrate self-control as vividly as New Year\u2019s resolutions. February is even better, though, because it lets us study why so many of those resolutions are broken. But a more important question may involve a resolution that so many of us fail to make. It involves a commodity that nearly everybody needs more of, and our failure to address it arguably has as much impact on our well-being as inadequate exercise and unhealthy eating.The problem is very simple: Many of us need more sleep.What does sleep have to do with economics? Doesn\u2019t it sit squarely in the realm of physiology? Yet even that number, which emphasizes the physical and medical consequences of inadequate sleep, omits the biggest potential impact on the G.D.P. Most of today\u2019s workers rely on their mental and social skills. And if those workers don\u2019t get enough sleep, their lethargy, crankiness and poor decision-making will hurt the economy in assorted and significant ways. There is an odd divide here. Ask why one person had an unproductive day at work, and lack of sleep often seems an obvious answer. But ask why national productivity has fallen, and reduced sleep can appear to be a frivolous answer. Yet what is total output but the sum of all individuals\u2019 work? Sleep deserves serious study by behavioral economists for another important reason. Some struggle with medical issues \u2014 like insomnia \u2014 that make sleep hard. But for many of us, the quantity and quality of sleep come down to a matter of choice. Still, only a few enterprising economists have looked closely at this, and generally those have assumed that we choose our hours of sleep optimally. The idea is that we thoughtfully trade the use of an hour of sleep for an hour spent doing something else. But it is worth questioning the assumption that these are rational and optimal choices. Judge for yourself. Was watching that extra episode of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d last night worth the sluggishness you\u2019re feeling right now?We also need to ask another question: Why do we neglect our sleep? It\u2019s not as if the ill effects of fatigue are a surprise. If for no reason other than self-interest, we are vigilant about our children\u2019s sleep, so it\u2019s hard to understand why we are so cavalier about our own. This puzzle is even more pointed because the benefits of sleep are immediate. Eat better or work out more, and you\u2019ll see the benefits weeks, months or years down the road. Sleep more and you\u2019ll see the benefits tomorrow. The research on this question is sparse, so we must speculate. The problem is aggravated by a common belief that lost sleep can be made up for, that we can manage our \u201csleep debt.\u201d But why should we be any better with this debt than we are with money? When the time comes for a payback, there always seems to be something more appealing for our money or time. Technology is an obvious culprit here. Web searching and cellphone use both flourish in the wee hours. Before the dawn of the web, I would stay up watching television. But there is something soporific about television: I would often nod off. Not so when I\u2019m online. As technologies expand, these problems may only worsen. We can do something about this in our own lives. It\u2019s not too late to add a resolution for this still-young year: to partake more in what Shakespeare called the \u201cchief nourisher in life\u2019s feast.\u201d A good night\u2019s sleep has immediate effects on our productivity, and, best of all, it can even help us keep our other resolutions.

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Central Bank, Defying Doomsayers, Holds Rate Steady", "Date": "2014-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The European Central Bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, is taking a wait-and-see approach as the threat of deflation hangs over the euro zone and the region\u2019s unemployment remains stubbornly high.Despite mounting pressure to take action, the central bank on Thursday kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged for a third straight month, at a record low of 0.25 percent. Mr. Draghi said that the central bank needed more data before any additional moves to spur the economy could be justified, and that it would make a reassessment next month.\u201cTo say that the E.C.B. has fallen behind the curve would be a gross understatement,\u201d Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, wrote in a research note. \u201cThe credibility of the E.C.B.\u2019s monetary policy, at a time when the euro zone\u2019s economic recovery is still dangerously fragile, is being severely undermined.\u201dMr. Draghi seemed to go to great lengths to challenge the doomsayers. The euro zone is currently \u201cexperiencing a prolonged period of low inflation,\u201d Mr. Draghi acknowledged at a news conference Thursday in Frankfurt. At a later point he said: \u201cWe have to dispense with the question, Is there deflation? The answer is no.\u201dFinancial markets took the central bank\u2019s decision in stride, with stocks broadly higher in Europe and on Wall Street, and the euro gaining ground against the dollar.Economists say it is likely that the European Central Bank will have to act next month, given the weak economic environment.With more than 19 million people officially listed as unemployed in the euro zone, falling prices would be another weight on the labor market, corporate profits and growth. And because falling prices put stress on borrowers \u2014 leading some to default on their loans because their houses or other assets are worth less than what they paid for them \u2014 it could further weaken Europe\u2019s still-fragile banking system.Economists have warned that urgent near-term action is needed since deflation is so hard to fight once it is entrenched. Some are calling for a Federal Reserve-style \u201cquantitative easing\u201d campaign, in which the central bank would begin a major bond-buying program to flood the market with liquidity meant to buoy prices.Mr. Draghi did repeat that the central bank was \u201cready and willing\u201d to use all the means at its disposal to fight deflation if it became a problem, and he did not rule out some form of quantitative easing. He also said the bank had studied the possibility of increasing the money supply by not offsetting the purchase of bonds it bought from 2010 to 2012. But all in all, he seemed to be saying that while the bank had a big stick at its disposal, it was not ready to use it.The euro\u2019s gain against the dollar after the European Central Bank\u2019s announcement underscored another nagging problem for the region. While some see a strong euro as a sign of confidence after the upheaval of the sovereign debt crisis, it is a hindrance in a period of ultralow inflation.European officials and companies would welcome a decline in the euro\u2019s value. It would help alleviate many of the central bank\u2019s deflation concerns \u2014 because the prices of imported goods would rise \u2014 and it could contribute to the economic recovery by making the prices of European exports more competitive in overseas markets.On Thursday, the European Central Bank also left unchanged the deposit rate it pays commercial banks on money that they keep at the central bank. That rate remains at zero.There had been speculation by some economists and analysts that the central bank might actually reduce the deposit rate to a negative number, essentially forcing banks to pay the central bank to keep their money. This could encourage banks to lend more to businesses and consumers, rather than parking their funds with the central bank.Mr. Draghi \u201cis trying to get a grip on market expectations,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Group in Brussels. The Governing Council, which sets the bank\u2019s monetary policy, \u201cis really not feeling comfortable with further nonstandard measures,\u201d Mr. Brzeski said. \u201cThese things are controversial, especially in Germany, and they\u2019re hard to implement in practice.\u201d\u201cOn top of that,\u201d Mr. Brzeski added, \u201cit isn\u2019t clear that these things would work. The E.C.B. is already giving banks unlimited access to funds at 0.25 percent interest, so what else can they really do to encourage lending? They don\u2019t have a silver bullet.\u201dHe said the central bank would have a number of new economic reports to work with by its next meeting, on March 6, including data on February inflation; the euro zone\u2019s fourth-quarter gross domestic product; and the European Central Bank\u2019s own new projections.There are reasons for optimism about the euro zone\u2019s economy, which the central bank estimates will expand 1.1 percent this year. Readings of consumer and business sentiment have been strong, and purchasing manager surveys have indicated that output is at the highest levels in more than two years.\u201cIf the trends continue as presently,\u201d Mr. Brzeski said, \u201cthe E.C.B. won\u2019t do anything in March, either. But if something changes dramatically, then they\u2019re going to act.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Orders New Efficiency for Big Trucks", "Date": "2014-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUPPER MARLBORO, Md. \u2014 President Obama on Tuesday ordered the development of tough new fuel standards for the nation\u2019s fleet of heavy-duty trucks as part of what aides say will be an increasingly muscular and unilateral campaign to tackle climate change through the use of the president\u2019s executive power.The new regulations, to be drafted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department by March 2015 and completed a year later so they are in place before Mr. Obama leaves office, are the latest in a series of actions intended to cut back on greenhouse gases without the sort of comprehensive legislation the president failed to push through Congress in his first term.The limits on greenhouse gas pollution from trucks would combine with previous rules requiring passenger cars and light trucks to burn fuel more efficiently and pending rules to limit the carbon emissions of power plants. Cumulatively, experts said the \u00e0 la carte approach should enable Mr. Obama to meet his target of cutting carbon pollution in the United States by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020. But they said he would still be far short of his goal of an 80 percent reduction by 2050.\u201cImproving gas mileage for these trucks is going to drive down our oil imports even further,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a Safeway grocery distribution center here, flanked by a Peterbilt truck and Safeway and Coca-Cola cabs. \u201cThat reduces carbon pollution even more, cuts down on businesses\u2019 fuel costs, which should pay off in lower prices for consumers. So it\u2019s not just a win-win, it\u2019s a win-win-win. We got three wins.\u201dNot everyone sees it that way. United States car and truck manufacturers have lobbied heavily against aggressive increases in federal fuel economy standards, saying that they could increase vehicle prices and diminish safety. More broadly, Republicans have said that the president should not single-handedly impose what they consider onerous requirements on vast swaths of the energy economy when Congress has opted against its own intervention.The announcement was part of the president\u2019s vow in his State of the Union address last month to advance his agenda \u201cwith or without Congress.\u201d But while most of the actions taken since then have been relatively modest, like ordering a study of job training programs, one area where Mr. Obama both has the power to take more sweeping action and seems intent on using it is the environment.While Mr. Obama effectively gave up on comprehensive climate legislation after it stalled in the Senate in his first term, aides said he saw climate change as an area where he could still shape his legacy. He recruited John D. Podesta, a former White House chief of staff for President Bill Clinton, to join his team as counselor in part to direct a more aggressive approach to the issue.These accompany more assertive actions the administration is taking to reshape the American energy sector. In August the E.P.A. issued rules requiring automakers to double average fleet economy standards for passenger cars to 50.4 miles per gallon by 2025, which the administration said would cut carbon pollution from vehicles in half.In September the E.P.A. proposed new rules cutting carbon pollution from future coal-fired power plants, a move that has effectively frozen construction of new coal plants. Mr. Obama has directed the E.P.A. to produce by June a draft regulation targeting existing coal plants, a deeply controversial move that could shutter hundreds of facilities.Specialists like Mr. Levi also note that no matter what the United States does on its own, it may not matter if Washington fails to persuade other nations, like China and India, to commit to similar actions, which is Mr. Kerry\u2019s assignment.In his speech here Tuesday, Mr. Obama said that heavy-duty trucks represent just 4 percent of all vehicles on American highways but generate 20 percent of the carbon pollution produced by the transportation sector.A coalition of shippers that stand to benefit from lower fuel costs, including FedEx, Wabash National Corporation and Waste Management Inc., welcomed the president\u2019s action and released its own suggestions to shape the administration\u2019s new regulations.\u201cThis collaborative approach will result in realistic, achievable goals and an effective regulatory framework to improve fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said Douglas W. Stotlar, president of Con-way Inc., the nation\u2019s third-largest freight company and a member of the coalition.The American Trucking Association took a more cautious view, saying that it had worked with the administration on previous rules. \u201cAs we begin this new round of standards, A.T.A. hopes the administration will set forth a path that is both based on the best science and research available and economically achievable,\u201d said Bill Graves, the association\u2019s chief executive.Mr. Obama pointed to what he called an emerging consensus. \u201cIf rivals like PepsiCo and Coca-Cola or U.P.S. and FedEx or AT&T and Verizon, if they can join together on this, then maybe Democrats and Republicans can do the same,\u201d he said.Peter Baker reported from Upper Marlboro, Md., and Coral Davenport from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Among the Richest of the Rich, Fortunes Diverge", "Date": "2014-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 YES, we know the economic fortunes of the 99 percent and 1 percent have diverged over the last three or four decades. But the fortunes of the 1 percent and the 0.1 percent, or the 0.01 percent, or the 0.001 percent, have diverged even more. Economists have taken to calling it \u201cfractal inequality.\u201d It is not just that the rich have pulled away from the average American. It is that the richer you are, the more you have pulled away. Put another way, our 0.1 percent household made about 206 times, and our 1 percent household about 41 times, what our average household did. That gap has yawned over time. In 1990, for instance, the same multiples were 87 and 21. In 1980, they were 47 and 14.Management has always been overrepresented among top earners, of course. What has changed is what they are paid. About 70 percent of the increase in income going to the top 0.1 percent from 1979 to 2005 comes from increasing pay for executives and financial services professionals, researchers estimate.Not all of that increased compensation for managers is because of improving performance, either. The growth of earnings for executives has outpaced growth in the stock market or in corporate earnings, by a wide margin.\u201cBoards have not been operating at arm\u2019s length from the executives whose pay they set,\u201d Lucian A. Bebchuk and Jesse M. Fried of Harvard Law School contend in an exhaustive study of the phenomenon. \u201cThe constraints imposed by market forces and shareholders\u2019 power to intervene are not tight enough to prevent such deviations.\u201d Earnings have also taken off toward the stratosphere in the world of finance, helping account for much of the rest of the rise of the 1 percent. Wall Street has gotten bigger and richer over time, even after accounting for the dot-com bust and the financial crisis. There\u2019s one further trend that has helped the 0.1 percent take off from the 1 percent, too. The higher a household is on the income scale, the more likely it is that a big chunk of its earnings come from investments rather than wages. Managers at Wall Street firms tend to take home options and shares, for instance, and chief executives often get stock as part of their compensation packages.That makes earnings at the very top of the income scale more variable than earnings lower down at the 1 percent level or 50 percent level. The busts are bigger, but the booms are bigger, too. With the market near its inflation-adjusted high and the housing market recovering, that means swelling incomes for households in those tiptop percentages. The average earnings in the top 0.01 percent, for instance, boomeranged from $38.9 million in 2007 to $20.7 million in 2009, before soaring back up to $31 million in 2012.All in all, 3,672 people made it on the list over the 17 years studied. Only four made it on the list in all 17 years. More than 2,600 only made it once. But income gets stickier lower down the income scale. An earner in the 1 percent has a one-in-four or one-in-three chance of staying there for all of the next five years.For now, it is a very good time to be very, very rich. The 1 percent are doing well. The 0.01 percent \u2014 they\u2019re doing even better. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Founding Editor Is Dismissed as Head of El Mundo", "Date": "2014-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe financial downturn in Spain\u2019s newspaper industry has claimed its most prominent journalist to date, Pedro J. Ram\u00edrez, who was ousted as editor of El Mundo, the conservative newspaper he founded 25 years ago.But rather than blaming his dismissal on the newspaper\u2019s financial losses, Mr. Ram\u00edrez accused Spain\u2019s government of engineering retribution for El Mundo\u2019s recent reporting on a series of corruption cases, one of which involved Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.\u201cThis is a show of force by a government that wants to send a message, not just to El Mundo, but to the whole media sector, that whoever acts in a way that the government sees as inconvenient will pay the consequences,\u201d Mr. Ram\u00edrez said in a phone interview Saturday. \u201cWhat is happening under Rajoy is particularly serious because it\u2019s about using a time of clear economic weakness to force the media to be docile, servile and practice self-censorship.\u201dMr. Ram\u00edrez was ousted Thursday after a board meeting of Unidad Editorial, El Mundo\u2019s parent company, which is owned by RCS MediaGroup, an Italian company.Mr. Rajoy has not commented on Mr. Ram\u00edrez\u2019s removal. But Luis de Guindos, the economy minister, told the radio station Cope that \u201cthe government has a lot of other things to do\u201d besides trying to influence a newspaper\u2019s management.Several governments of late have come under criticism by free press advocates. The top editor at Ming Pao, a newspaper in Hong Kong, was removed last month from his post by its owners, leading to complaints that his departure represented the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s efforts to subdue the territory\u2019s independent media. Last week, prosecutors in Egypt filed criminal charges accusing 20 journalists for Al Jazeera television of conspiring with the Muslim Brotherhood.In Spain, Mr. Rajoy in August had addressed lawmakers and accused El Mundo in Parliament of manipulating information. Mr. Rajoy denounced \u201ca circle of libel\u201d against his governing Popular Party, based on accusations made by Luis B\u00e1rcenas, the Popular Party\u2019s former treasurer, who is in prison awaiting trial on charges of tax evasion and masterminding a slush fund to pay kickbacks to Mr. Rajoy and other senior conservative politicians.El Mundo had backed Mr. Rajoy in three successive general election campaigns, the third of which \u2014 in November 2011 \u2014 allowed Mr. Rajoy and his Popular Party to return to power with an absolute majority in Parliament. Mr. Ram\u00edrez said he \u201chad a good relationship with Rajoy until he came to power.\u201dMr. Ramirez, who is commonly known in Spain as Pedro Jota (Spanish for his middle initial), started in journalism in the 1970s, just as Spain was returning to democracy and rebuilding a free press after Franco\u2019s lengthy dictatorship. In 1980, then only 28 years old, he took charge of the newspaper Diario 16, but was eventually forced out over a journalism dispute. In 1989, he started El Mundo, rapidly establishing its reputation for investigative reporting by unearthing information relating to the GAL, a secret paramilitary force sponsored by the Socialist administration to help fight ETA, the Basque separatist movement.Advertisers in Spanish newspapers spent about 600 million euros last year, or about $808 million, less than a third of the total in 2007, just before the financial crisis. Like other Spanish newspapers, El Mundo has also struggled to switch to an online pay model; the paper\u2019s has yet to yield significant revenue. In November, RCS, the Italian group, was forced to inject \u20ac400 million of capital in Unidad Editorial, El Mundo\u2019s parent company, to keep it afloat.Juan Antonio Giner, president of Innovation, a media consultancy based in London, said Mr. Ram\u00edrez\u2019s removal could be the prelude to RCS\u2019s selling off assets or breaking up its Spanish operations.\u201cTo eliminate a strong founding editor such as Pedro J. Ram\u00edrez was a key prerequisite for potential partners in the Spanish newspaper arena to consider mergers and acquisitions changes,\u201d he said.In fact, Mr. Ram\u00edrez\u2019s personality has generated controversy beyond the newsroom. In 1997, he became the talk of the town as a participant in a sex video. The scandal resulted in a criminal case that established the video was specifically circulated to damage El Mundo. Among those convicted was the personal assistant of Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez, Spain\u2019s former prime minister.On Saturday, commenting on his dismissal, Mr. Ram\u00edrez said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to present myself as a martyr or a victim, but I do think that what is happening in El Mundo is a symptom of how the quality of democracy is falling back under Rajoy.\u201d Mr. Ram\u00edrez was replaced by El Mundo\u2019s deputy director, Casimiro Garc\u00eda-Abadillo, who has been with the newspaper since its 1989 creation. Asked about reports of a multimillion-dollar severance package, Mr. Ram\u00edrez demurred.\u201cI would have been happy to die as director of El Mundo without ever receiving any such indemnity money,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shares Climb Despite Soft Data ", "Date": "2014-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks closed higher on Friday, with major indexes notching a second straight week of gains as investors seemed again willing to overlook some soft economic data stemming from bad weather.Gains were broad, with the Nasdaq closing at its highest level since 2000 and nine of the 10 major Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 sector indexes rising on the day. In the latest data point affected by harsh winter weather, factory production fell 0.8 percent in January, the biggest drop in more than four years. But investors seem to have been willing to forgive soft data of late, attributing weak results to bad weather as opposed to a slowing economy.\u201cWhile weather is often used as an excuse to get a more favorable slant on things, half the country has felt a real impact, which is enough that equity markets can look at the data and not worry about it,\u201d said Jeff Morris, head of United States equities at Standard Life Investments in Boston.Despite difficult weather, the preliminary reading of the Thomson Reuters-University of Michigan overall index of consumer sentiment stood at 81.2 in February, unchanged from the final reading in January.\u201cThe good news is that confidence proved resilient to recent government reports of weak growth in income and employment,\u201d the survey director, Richard Curtin, said. \u201cThe not-so-good news is that the full impact on household budgets from the harsh winter has yet to be registered.\u201dThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 126.80 points, or 0.79 percent, at 16,154.39. The S.&P. 500-stock index was up 8.80 points, or 0.48 percent, at 1,838.63. The Nasdaq composite index gained 3.35 points, or 0.08 percent, at 4,244.03.For the week, both the Dow and S.&P. 500 rose 2.3 percent while the Nasdaq added 2.9 percent. This is the second straight week of gains for all three. The benchmark S.&P. 500 now stands just 0.5 percent away from its nominal closing high.In bond trading, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 3/32 to 100 2/32, and its yield rose to 2.75 percent from 2.73 percent late Thursday. With the market within striking distance of record highs, investors have been looking for evidence that the market\u2019s valuation is justified.\u201cThe market isn\u2019t particularly expensive, but neither does it strike me as being especially cheap,\u201d said Mr. Morris, who helps oversee $292 billion in assets. \u201cIt will be a tough slog for the market to move meaningfully higher from here.\u201dWith unusually low temperatures and disruptive snow storms extending into February, the run of downbeat economic reports is likely to persist and further cloud the growth picture.Given the weather\u2019s role in the slowdown, economists say the Fed will likely discount the reports and continue with measured reductions in its monetary stimulus. It has reduced its monthly bond buying to $65 billion from $85 billion in two steps since its December policy meeting.\u201cWe expect a more buoyant performance in the spring as the economy rebounds from the winter chill,\u201d said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.

{"Headline": "Yellen Sets a Familiar Direction for the Fed", "Date": "2014-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the new chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, told a House committee on Tuesday that she strongly supported and planned to continue the policies adopted under her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke. At the same time, in emphasizing her concern about unemployment \u2014 and in agreeing to spend almost six hours answering the committee\u2019s questions \u2014 Ms. Yellen also began the delicate process of imposing her own influence on the Fed\u2019s direction.Ms. Yellen made clear that the Fed planned to keep cutting back on its bond buying, which had been a crucial part of its economic stimulus campaign, unless there was a \u201cnotable change\u201d in the economy toward a more negative outlook. \u201cI served on the committee as we formulated our current policy strategy, and I strongly support that strategy,\u201d she said.But she described the recovery of the labor market as \u201cfar from complete,\u201d and said she retained her longstanding conviction that the Fed had the power to improve the situation. That suggests the Fed may continue to strengthen the mainstay of its campaign, keeping short-term interest rates at extraordinarily low levels.Ms. Yellen\u2019s marathon testimony was a statement in the same vein. As the Fed\u2019s vice chairwoman, she pushed to increase communication with investors and the public, reflecting her view that clear communication enhances the power of monetary policy. Communication, in the form of assurances that the Fed intends to keep rates low, is now the Fed\u2019s primary means of suppressing rates.The stock markets rose in the morning following the release of Ms. Yellen\u2019s testimony, and again when she began to speak. Some analysts speculated that investors were reassured by the message of continuity. The news that House Republicans planned to allow a debt ceiling increase reinforced the good mood on Wall Street. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 19.91 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 1,819.75.Similarly, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 192.98 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 15,994.77. The Nasdaq composite increased 42.87 points, or 1 percent, to 4,191.05.In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury\u2019s 10-year note rose to 2.73 percent, from 2.67 percent late Monday. Its price fell 16/32, to 100 6/32.Ms. Yellen, in her inaugural public appearance as Fed chairwoman, was fluid in discussing monetary policy, but appeared less assured in answering questions about financial regulation. She sometimes consulted a binder that she kept open on the witness table and at times turned to ask questions of her aides.\u201cThe work of making the financial system more robust has not yet been completed,\u201d she said, but she mostly skirted questions about the details.She faced some confrontational questions, particularly from Republicans concerned the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign was doing more harm than good, by seeding inflation, starving savers of income and destabilizing financial markets. Rep. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, played a video message from a 76-year-old veteran inviting Ms. Yellen to a town-hall meeting to discuss low interest rates.By contrast, some Democrats questioned whether the Fed could do more to cut unemployment. \u201cI hope you will press your colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee to take into account the ongoing impact that this long-term unemployment crisis is having on millions of American families,\u201d said Rep. Maxine Waters of California, the ranking Democrat on the House committee.But Ms. Yellen appeared to disarm the committee members by agreeing to stay as long as they liked. It took almost six hours to field questions from every interested member of the Financial Services Committee \u2014 one of the largest House committees, in part because lawmakers clamor to be on it because they can raise money from the financial services industry.Members thanked her for her time and several mentioned that their daughters said her very presence was an inspiration.The harshest criticism came after Ms. Yellen left, when a panel of experts was called to comment on the Fed\u2019s performance.The central bank\u2019s stimulus campaign has \u201cdriven up asset prices without adding significantly to job creation,\u201d said Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation at the Cato Institute. He said low borrowing costs might be making it easier for companies to invest in technology rather than hiring workers.The economy remains scarred by the collapse of the housing bubble and the consequent 2008 financial crisis. Growth is tepid, unemployment high, inflation sluggish. Ms. Yellen acknowledged those problems, but reiterated the Fed\u2019s upbeat forecast.\u201cThe economic recovery gained greater traction in the second half of last year,\u201d she said, citing the growth of spending by consumers and businesses. She said the Fed expected \u201ceconomic activity and unemployment will expand at a moderate pace this year and next.\u201dMs. Yellen acknowledged that she was \u201csurprised\u201d by disappointing estimates of job growth in December and January, but she cautioned against \u201cjumping to conclusions\u201d in assessing the longer-term trend. She noted the government would release an estimate of February job growth before the Fed\u2019s March meeting.She played down concerns about the consequences of Fed policy. Asked about the impact of low interest rates on savers, particularly the elderly, she said that the Fed could not raise rates without damaging the economy, and noted that low rates had a variety of effects. Retirees with savings accounts, for example, often own stocks too, which have soared in recent years. Like her predecessor, Ms. Yellen said the Fed\u2019s greatest concern was the risk of destabilizing financial markets. And like Mr. Bernanke, she said the Fed was watching closely but didn\u2019t see problems yet. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen threats to financial stability that have built to the point of flashing orange or red,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.The Fed said in 2012 that it planned to keep short-term interest rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent. It has since said that it was likely to maintain that policy well past that threshold, but with the unemployment rate reaching 6.6 percent in January, some Fed officials have said there is a need for greater clarity about its plans.To provide that clarity, however, the Fed must first resolve an internal debate. Much of the decline in the unemployment rate was because people have stopped looking for work. The share of Americans with jobs has not increased since the recession.\u201cContinuing to buy assets is neither helpful nor essential,\u201d Mr Plosser said.Other officials, however, predict that a significant number of Americans will return to the labor market as the economy improves, helping keep a lid on inflation.Ms. Yellen, asked about the issue, appeared to place a greater emphasis on economic factors. She said demographics explained \u201ca significant part of the decline.\u201dBut she continued, with typical caution, \u201cThere may also be, and I am inclined to believe myself based on the evidence, that there are also cyclical factors at work.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A World Unprepared, Again, for Rising Interest Rates", "Date": "2014-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneMEXICO CITY \u2014 I was living in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1997 when, out of the blue, an investment banker I knew in London called to ask about Brazilian cocktails. He didn\u2019t want one. He needed a name for a potential economic crisis, in the vein of Mexico\u2019s Tequila affair in 1994 and Thailand\u2019s Tom Yum Kung debacle, which was unfolding at the time.As unlikely as it seemed to most Brazilians then, the crisis did arrive. A default by the Russian government in 1998 set off a run on Brazilian bonds, as investors rushed to pare their holdings in emerging markets by selling the most liquid among them.Suffering from large trade and budget deficits and a shrinking stock of foreign reserves, Brazil was forced a few months later to sever the real\u2019s link to the dollar and let it sink.That\u2019s when it dawned on me that we weren\u2019t living in my parent\u2019s economy anymore.The stable American economic order lasted more than three decades from the end of World War II, when economic cycles were essentially driven by the Federal Reserve\u2019s raising and lowering of interest rates to combat inflation. It started to crumble with the severing of the link between gold and the dollar and the twin oil crises of the 1970s. That ushered in an era of footloose capital, unshackled by three decades of increasing deregulation, that led to the global tides that, for better and worse, now drive economic ups and downs.That Brazilian morning 17 years ago has come to mind again as the Fed has started gradually reducing the amount of money it pumps into the economy. The move could hardly have been a surprise, because the Fed announced as early as last spring that it would begin doing so by the end of 2013.If anything, the Fed\u2019s action has had an easing effect on domestic interest rates. While higher than in the spring, yields on Treasury bonds were lower last Friday than they were a month before.And yet around the world, financial markets have swooned as if struck by lightning.The reasoning behind investors\u2019 abrupt change of heart makes a certain sense. China\u2019s economic slowdown will blunt the exports of commodity producers, weakening their trade balances. Macroeconomic management in many developing countries has been poor. Budget and trade deficits in some are way too high.Still, there is a deeper dynamic at play. The pullout of capital from developing countries around the world has an eerie resemblance to the seemingly unlikely financial wave that emerged from Asia, crossed through Russia and Eastern Europe and ended up walloping Brazil.That\u2019s hardly the only precedent. As Carmen M. Reinhart, a renowned international economist at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, put it, capital bonanzas, inevitably followed by financial crises, are \u201colder than the hills.\u201dProblem is, the cycles of boom and bust seem to keep getting worse. Whether the Fed continues removing monetary stimulus at the same pace or it pauses, perhaps worried by sluggish job growth, long-term interest rates eventually will rise. The world, evidently, is not prepared. And it\u2019s even less prepared for the bigger crisis that we seem doomed to suffer after this one.Lawrence Summers, President Obama\u2019s former top economic adviser, recently articulated an idea that suggests booms and busts, each one bigger than the last, might be with us for a while.At a speech at the International Monetary Fund last November, he said that the global economy was suffering from \u201csecular stagnation,\u201d persistent low growth caused by the fact that there are more savings around than profitable investments to be made.There could be several reasons, including slowing labor force growth or declining productivity. Cautious consumers and businesses burned by the crisis might be prone to save more and invest less. Income inequality might blunt consumption.Regardless of the cause, a persistent savings glut would make bubbles much more likely. \u201cIn an era of secular stagnation, when equilibrium interest rates are low, there will be more financial stability problems,\u201d Mr. Summers told me.This rings a bell. Asian countries emerged from the 1990s intent on never suffering like that again. It\u2019s debatable whether their primary motivation was to build trade surpluses or to amass financial war chests against future attacks. The fact is they bulked up on savings, held back on consumption and investment, and amassed huge caches of foreign reserves.Is there anything to be done about the new unstable order?\u201cInternational monetary cooperation has broken down,\u201d said Raghuram G. Rajan, India\u2019s central bank chief, a couple of days after he was forced to raise interest rates to keep the rupee from sinking. \u201cIndustrial countries have to play a part in restoring that, and they can\u2019t at this point wash their hands off and say, \u2018We\u2019ll do what we need to and you do the adjustment.\u2019 \u201dAndrew G. Haldane, executive director for financial stability at the Bank of England, also seemed to suggest that international cooperation was the answer. \u201cWhat is going on with the head-to-head combat is people pursuing policies of individual countries,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is at stake is the system as a whole.\u201dYet it is questionable what coordination could achieve. \u201cIt\u2019s not reasonable to think that somehow a cooperative solution will be found where everybody adjusts the policy slightly differently and the world is much better off,\u201d said Donald Kohn, a former vice chairman at the Fed who is now at the Brookings Institution.Mr. Kohn pointed out there were risks involved in committing to a coordinated course of action and then having circumstances change.What\u2019s more, it\u2019s not even clear what governments should do about presumed bubbles. Should they \u201clean against\u201d them by raising interest rates as they emerge, potentially sacrificing investment and jobs along the way? \u201cThe conversation tends to presume that you are going to do the leaning right,\u201d Mr. Summers warned. \u201cIt is likely to be substantially imperfect.\u201dThe world\u2019s top economic authorities hold out hope that finance can be harnessed to prevent such wild lashings in the future. \u201cMacroprudential rules\u201d \u2014 from taxes on short-term foreign loans to countercyclical loan-to-value ceilings on mortgages \u2014 are the talk of the town.Banking regulators have huddled periodically in Basel, Switzerland, since 2009 to hash out rules to limit the leverage of big financial institutions. The logic is that banks will make more prudent investments if they have to set aside more reserves that will raise the cost of credit, and they will be in better shape if their investments go awry.But Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, a three-decade veteran of Mexico\u2019s financial crises who now heads the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, may have the best advice for a developing country standing in the headlights of foreign capital flows: \u201cReforms, reforms, reforms and more reforms and after that reforms of the reforms.\u201dIt\u2019s old advice. It does nothing about curtailing fickle capital spinning on a dime. But it makes sense to go swimming with a bathing suit to avoid undue exposure when the financial tides, inevitably, recede.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; \nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Many Older Americans, an Enterprising Path", "Date": "2014-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringWHEN Marilyn Arnold was 9 years old, her mother, a skilled seamstress, patiently taught her to sew on a vintage Singer treadle sewing machine.As her feet pumped away at the machine in her family\u2019s farmhouse near Paris, Mo., she was smitten. \u201cI was in love with sewing, even when I stuck my finger and it bled,\u201d Ms. Arnold said.Soon she was whirling the thread for crisp white blouses with bright red sailor collars, gathered skirts, and, in time, her entire school wardrobe. She even competed in sewing contests at the Missouri State Fair.But she never dreamed that now, at the age of 66, she would be running her own small business, Marilyn Arnold Designs, in Lee\u2019s Summit, Mo.Her specialty is custom designing and sewing 18-inch-by-18-inch pillows, christening dresses and blankets as mementos made from cherished wedding gowns that had been relegated to the back of a closet.She also stitches quilts big enough for a queen-size bed assembled from beloved T-shirts, and patches together vests from timeworn scarves. \u201cEverything I make is from repurposed materials,\u201d she said.The idea for her venture took root three years ago, shortly before she retired from her position as a managing partner at the New York Life Insurance Company, after 29 years in the insurance business.That was when her accountant asked her what she planned to do in retirement. She acknowledged that she knew she had to do something, but had no idea what. The accountant asked a second question: \u201cWhat did you want to do when you were a little girl?\u201dWhile her childhood dream was to become a dress designer, that endeavor seemed too lofty a goal at her age. The idea to design and sew custom pillows from a wedding dress was inspired by a friend\u2019s request.That was the manageable beginning of a new career. Her start-up costs to buy equipment and supplies and to devise a marketing plan tallied $12,000, financed from personal savings, Ms. Arnold said.Today, she handles all the sewing duties herself, easily clocking in 12-hour days. \u201cMy biggest challenge has been balancing my time in order to work on all aspects of my business,\u201d Ms. Arnold said. \u201cI have to guard against spending too much time working in my business and not enough time working on my business.\u201dOlder American entrepreneurs like Ms. Arnold are on a roll.Kimberly Palmer, author of \u201cThe Economy of You: Discover Your Inner Entrepreneur and Recession-Proof Your Life,\u201d said she had noticed that the most eager audience for the book was often people approaching retirement, or already in it. \u201cThey want to leverage their skills and experience into something entrepreneurial,\u201d she said. According to a recent study published by the Kauffman Foundation and Legal Zoom, in 2013, about 20 percent of all new businesses were started by entrepreneurs aged 50 to 59 years, and 15 percent were 60 and over.And, in fact, over the last decade, the highest rate of entrepreneurial activity belongs to those in the 55-to-64 age group, according to the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity.A desire to work for oneself and create a business that is meaningful and has social impact at this stage of life, combined with a job market that makes it tough for workers over 50 to get hired, has clearly pushed more people to pursue the entrepreneurial path.\u201cFor the longest time we\u2019ve assumed that social entrepreneurship was the exclusive provenance of young people,\u201d said Marc Freedman, founder and chief executive of Encore.org, the nonprofit research center dedicated to second acts for the greater good. \u201cNow we\u2019re realizing an undiscovered continent of innovation in the growing population over 50.\u201dBut it is not an easy road. Money is the biggest stumbling block. Most start-ups like Ms. Arnold\u2019s are underwritten with personal savings.If someone does not have a nice stockpile of savings to tap, or a partner who is still bringing home a paycheck, it is tough to get going. And many entrepreneurs do not pay themselves for a year or so to allow their businesses to gain traction.To finance the more than $100,000 it took to start Well Read New & Used Books in Hawthorne, N.J., about three years ago, for example, Bill Skees, then 56, asked his six siblings for a loan, and he and his wife, Mary Ann, were able to dip into savings for the rest. The banks he contacted were not enthusiastic.\u201cThere\u2019s lots of red tape, and most banks aren\u2019t interested in financing a senior business start-up, which generally runs between $10,000 to $25,000, because it\u2019s too small,\u201d said Elizabeth Isele, 71, co-founder of SeniorEntrepreneurshipWorks.org, a nonprofit venture geared to helping workers over age 50 start their own businesses. \u201cAnd age bias can be a big factor.\u201dThat said, many small and microbusinesses, particularly freelance, home-based and online e-commerce businesses, require only a fraction of that to get going, sometimes under $1,000.Where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way. Determined older entrepreneurs have tapped retirement accounts, tracked down hard-to-get economic development loans in their communities and turned to crowdfunding sites.A Senate hearing titled \u201cIn Search of a Second Act: The Challenges and Advantages of Senior Entrepreneurship,\u201d scheduled for next Wednesday, will offer a chance to air issues like age bias from lending organizations and the need to develop tax incentives for training and start-ups.\u201cIn order to continue our economic recovery, we need to change how we view the terms \u2018start-up\u2019 or \u2018entrepreneur,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, chairwoman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\u201cMost people associate those terms with a tech business and a young computer whiz, not a home business in a rural town and a seasoned executive with 30 years of management experience,\u201d Senator Landrieu said. \u201cSenior entrepreneurs are especially critical to creating jobs and growing the economy, because they have the right experience and resources to be successful.\u201dMs. Isele, who plans to testify at the hearing, said she and others would argue that this growing demographic group would not cause a crisis. \u201cWe need to help people in policy and private industry to understand, this isn\u2019t a silver tsunami,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a silver lining, yielding golden dividends. Senior entrepreneurs contribute to the economy, paying taxes, creating jobs, paying people and underwriting entitlement programs.\u201dSenator Landrieu said she hoped the hearing would showcase successful initiatives and discuss whether they could be replicated elsewhere.One innovative initiative is the eProv Studio, which will officially start this weekend at the Institute for the Ages\u2019 Conference on Positive Aging in Sarasota, Fla.These new workshops, created by Ms. Isele and Cheryl Kiser, executive director of the Lewis Institute at Babson College, combine the methodology of entrepreneurial thought and action and the techniques of improvisational theater.\u201cEach participant comes to the workshop with a desire, an itch, an idea of what they might want to do,\u201d Ms. Kiser added. \u201cThe method we teach in these groups of 20 is to look at who you are, what you know, who you know, what you can do and the resources you have at hand to create something of value.\u201dUsing the improv process can help decode someone\u2019s entrepreneurial history. \u201cWe help them understand decade by decade what they have accomplished and see a pattern of these accomplishments and entrepreneurial skills they have had throughout their entire life,\u201d Ms. Isele said.Other resources include a free, online, open-source entrepreneurship curriculum, hosted at the Lawrence N. Field Center for Entrepreneurship at the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College. It is intended for people over 50 and includes help with developing business plans, obtaining loans, gaining and access to business start-up incubators and meeting mentors to serve as sounding boards.And while many older Americans are new to learning business skills, some cherish the personal rewards discovered along the way. \u201cMy business has given me so many things, but what I love the most is that I\u2019m my own boss,\u201d Ms. Arnold said. \u201cI manage my time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conflict in Oil Industry, Awash in Crude", "Date": "2014-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 T. Boone Pickens has personified the nation\u2019s oil industry for more than a generation. So when he made an offhand comment at a conference here a few weeks ago expressing reservations about lifting the nation\u2019s ban on exports of crude oil, he startled some of his old allies in the business.Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources and one of the top oil executives in the state, picked up the phone to have a chat. \u201cWe had lunch and he made sense,\u201d said Mr. Pickens, who has since revised his position.Chalk one up for the oil producers, who have begun lobbying the Obama administration, Congress and the public to let them export the bounty of crude oil flowing out of new shale fields across the country.Opposing them are their erstwhile cousins, the independent refiners, who insist that they need abundant, economical domestic supplies of oil so they can compete with foreign refiners.It is a rare clash in a deeply guarded industry that involves arguments over national security, pricing at the pump and, after all is said and done, who will get a bigger share of earnings from the current drilling rush.\u201cWhat we have here is a food fight for the profits that will come either from exports of crude oil or exports of refined products,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, executive director of energy and sustainability at the University of California, Davis, who testified before Congress recently in favor of lifting the ban. \u201cIt\u2019s like an argument inside a family business but one that could result in huge market distortions that can either hurt the consumer or our national security.\u201dProducers like Mr. Sheffield warn that a mounting glut of certain grades of oil in some regions of the country will eventually force a halt to unprofitable drilling if exports are not allowed.\u201cNobody wants the collapse of the oil industry,\u201d Mr. Sheffield said in an interview. \u201cYou would be importing crude oil from the Middle East all over again.\u201dOn the other side of the debate are some of the nation\u2019s biggest refiners, who argue against unlimited exports of crude oil even as they export increasing amounts of refined products like diesel and gasoline. To their way of thinking, the oil producers are merely trying to increase their profits at the expense of American consumers.\u201cThey are seeking the highest price available,\u201d Bill Day, a vice president at the Valero Energy Corporation, a large independent refiner, said of the producers. \u201cIf anything, unlimited exports would raise the price of American crude to the international level, which is why the producers want this step to begin with.\u201dThe topic has renewed interest thanks to the oil industry\u2019s reversal of fortunes in recent years. Only seven years ago the country\u2019s domestic oil production appeared to be in a downward spiral. But with the advent of new extraction techniques, entire new fields were opened, replacing oil imports from unfriendly or unruly places like Venezuela and Nigeria.Suddenly parts of the Midwest and Gulf of Mexico regions are overflowing with superior grades of crude, leading to a slump in prices and a gap of as much as $10 between American oil benchmark prices and the dominant world Brent price.Even under current restrictions, crude exports are growing quickly. Shipments to Canada have already roughly tripled since 2012 to around 200,000 barrels a day. Some analysts say they think that figure will double by the end of the year.While the entire oil industry has profited from all the domestic production, which has increased by about 60 percent to eight million barrels a day since 2005, refiners have particularly benefited. American refiners became darlings of Wall Street by buying cheaper domestic crude and now export 3.4 million barrels a day of gasoline, diesel and other refined products, mostly to Latin America and Europe.Not surprisingly, both the producers and the refiners say they are on the side of consumers and national security, and each side has academic and consultancy reports to back up its position.The producers argue that if they could freely export, they would increase world oil supplies, forcing down the international Brent benchmark crude price, which in turn would reduce the price of gasoline at the pump. \u201cThe American consumer is held captive by the restrained market,\u201d said Jack Ekstrom, a vice president at the Whiting Petroleum Corporation, a major producer in the North Dakota Bakken shale field. \u201cWhen you have additional supplies coming on to market, the price naturally comes down.\u201dExecutives at the refineries, which struggled for decades, counter that adding another million barrels of United States oil of daily supply to a global market of 90 million barrels a day will make little difference. Instead, they say, domestic crude prices will climb higher and with them gasoline prices.\u201cThe export ban works,\u201d Graeme Burnett, chairman of Monroe Energy, which operates Delta Air Lines\u2019 refinery in Trainer, Pa., told a Senate Energy Committee hearing last month. \u201cWe still have a long way to go to protect against oil market volatility and achieve true energy independence.\u201dRefinery executives concede that they cannot argue against free trade when they are exporting products themselves. Michael C. Jennings, chief executive of the HollyFrontier Corporation, said in an interview that he could support ending the oil export ban as long as other regulations that he said penalize the refiners, including federal mandates for the refining of expensive biofuels, were also reformed.Such sweeping energy reforms are not likely to be enacted by Congress soon. But in their talks with Commerce Department officials and members of Congress, refiners and producers appear to be closing in on some short-term compromises.Some executives have suggested that Commerce Department officials could approve swaps of lighter American crudes to Mexico for their heavier sour crudes without violating current oil export regulations. That would give the producers another market and give refiners more oil to process.There appears to be growing support for recharacterizing condensates, the hydrocarbon liquids used for petrochemical production, from crude to natural gas liquids, so they might be exported under current regulations. That would ease gluts in Rocky Mountain and South Texas fields where drilling has already slowed.And perhaps more oil could be sent to countries with free trade agreements with the United States.Such compromises, some executives say, could look something like the arrangements for export of liquefied natural gas from the United States. While gas producers supported exports and some chemical companies opposed them, the Obama administration responded by approving export terminals slowly to gauge the impact on domestic energy prices in the future.\u201cThe middle ground could probably be accomplished without any additional legislation,\u201d said Stephen H. Brown, a vice president for federal government affairs at the Tesoro Corporation, a major Texas refiner, \u201cand I think that is what this administration is probably hoping for.\u201dSuch actions by the Commerce Department, Mr. Sheffield said, could be a \u201crelief valve that would push off the problem for another two years.\u201dBut after that, he and other executives said, the country will probably again face a glut of high-quality crudes if current production trends continue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Middle Class Is Steadily Eroding. Just Ask the Business World.", "Date": "2014-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Manhattan, the upscale clothing retailer Barneys will replace the bankrupt discounter Loehmann\u2019s, whose Chelsea store closes in a few weeks. Across the country, Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurants are struggling, while fine-dining chains like Capital Grille are thriving. And at General Electric, the increase in demand for high-end dishwashers and refrigerators dwarfs sales growth of mass-market models.As politicians and pundits in Washington continue to spar over whether economic inequality is in fact deepening, in corporate America there really is no debate at all. The post-recession reality is that the customer base for businesses that appeal to the middle class is shrinking as the top tier pulls even further away.If there is any doubt, the speed at which companies are adapting to the new consumer landscape serves as very convincing evidence. Within top consulting firms and among Wall Street analysts, the shift is being described with a frankness more often associated with left-wing academics than business experts.\u201cThose consumers who have capital like real estate and stocks and are in the top 20 percent are feeling pretty good,\u201d said John G. Maxwell, head of the global retail and consumer practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers.In response to the upward shift in spending, PricewaterhouseCoopers clients like big stores and restaurants are chasing richer customers with a wider offering of high-end goods and services, or focusing on rock-bottom prices to attract the expanding ranks of penny-pinching consumers.\u201cAs a retailer or restaurant chain, if you\u2019re not at the really high level or the low level, that\u2019s a tough place to be,\u201d Mr. Maxwell said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be stuck in the middle.\u201dIn 2012, the top 5 percent of earners were responsible for 38 percent of domestic consumption, up from 28 percent in 1995, the researchers found.Even more striking, the current recovery has been driven almost entirely by the upper crust, according to Mr. Fazzari and Mr. Cynamon. Since 2009, the year the recession ended, inflation-adjusted spending by this top echelon has risen 17 percent, compared with just 1 percent among the bottom 95 percent.More broadly, about 90 percent of the overall increase in inflation-adjusted consumption between 2009 and 2012 was generated by the top 20 percent of households in terms of income, according to the study, which was sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, a research group in New York.The effects of this phenomenon are now rippling through one sector after another in the American economy, from retailers and restaurants to hotels, casinos and even appliance makers.For example, luxury gambling properties like Wynn and the Venetian in Las Vegas are booming, drawing in more high rollers than regional casinos in Atlantic City, upstate New York and Connecticut, which attract a less affluent clientele who are not betting as much, said Steven Kent, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.Among hotels, revenue per room in the high-end category, which includes brands like the Four Seasons and St. Regis, grew 7.5 percent in 2013, compared with a 4.1 percent gain for midscale properties like Best Western, according to Smith Travel Research.While spending among the most affluent consumers has managed to propel the economy forward, the sharpening divide is worrying, Mr. Fazzari said.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to maintain strong economic growth with such a large proportion of the population falling behind,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might be able to muddle along \u2014 but can we really recover?\u201dMr. Fazzari also said that depending on a relatively small but affluent slice of the population to drive demand makes the economy more volatile, because this group does more discretionary spending that can rise and fall with the stock market, or track seesawing housing prices. The run-up on Wall Street in recent years has only heightened these trends, said Guy Berger, an economist at RBS, who estimates that 50 percent of Americans have no effective participation in the surging stock market, even counting retirement accounts.Regardless, affluent shoppers like Mitchell Goldberg, an independent investment manager in Dix Hills, N.Y., say the rising stock market has encouraged people to open their wallets and purses more.\u201cOpulence isn\u2019t back, but we\u2019re spending a little more comfortably,\u201d Mr. Goldberg said. He recently replaced his old Nike golf clubs with Callaway drivers and Adams irons, bought a Samsung tablet for work and traded in his minivan for a sport utility vehicle.And while the superrich garner much of the attention, most companies are building their business strategies around a broader slice of affluent consumers.At G.E. Appliances, for example, the fastest-growing brand is the Caf\u00e9 line, which is aimed at the top quarter of the market, with refrigerators typically retailing for $1,700 to $3,000.\u201cThis is a person who is willing to pay for features, like a double-oven range or a refrigerator with hot water,\u201d said Brian McWaters, a general manager in G.E.'s Appliance division.At street level, the divide is even more stark.Sears and J. C. Penney, retailers whose wares are aimed squarely at middle-class Americans, are both in dire straits. Last month, Sears said it would shutter its flagship store on State Street in downtown Chicago, and J. C. Penney announced the closings of 33 stores and 2,000 layoffs.Loehmann\u2019s, where generations of middle-class shoppers hunted for marked-down designer labels in the famed Back Room, is now being liquidated after three trips to bankruptcy court since 1999.The Loehmann\u2019s store in Chelsea, like all 39 Loehmann\u2019s outlets nationwide, will go dark as soon as the last items sell. Barneys New York, which started in the same location in 1923 before moving to a more luxurious spot on Madison Avenue two decades ago, plans to reopen a store on the site in 2017.Investors have taken notice of the shrinking middle. Shares of Sears and J. C. Penney have fallen more than 50 percent since the end of 2009, even as upper-end stores like Nordstrom and bargain-basement chains like Dollar Tree and Family Dollar Stores have more than doubled in value over the same period.Competition from online giants like Amazon has only added to the problems faced by old-line retailers, of course. But changes in the restaurant business show that the effects of rising inequality are widespread.A shift at Darden, which calls itself the world\u2019s largest full-service restaurant owner, encapsulates the trend. Foot traffic at midtier, casual dining properties like Red Lobster and Olive Garden has dropped in every quarter but one since 2005, according to John Glass, a restaurant industry analyst at Morgan Stanley.With diners paying an average tab of $16.50 a person at Olive Garden, Mr. Glass said, \u201cThe customers are middle class. They\u2019re not rich. They\u2019re not poor.\u201d With income growth stagnant and prices for necessities like health care and education on the rise, he said, \u201cThey are cutting back.\u201d On the other hand, at the Capital Grille, an upscale Darden chain where the average check per person is about $71, spending is up by an average of 5 percent annually over the last three years.LongHorn Steakhouse, another Darden chain, has been reworked to target a slightly more affluent crowd than Olive Garden, with d\u00e9cor intended to evoke a cattleman\u2019s ranch instead of an Old West theme.Now, hedge fund investors are pressuring Darden\u2019s management to break up the company and spin out the more upscale properties into a separate entity.\u201cA separation could make sense from a strategic perspective,\u201d Mr. Glass said. \u201cGenerally, the specialty restaurant group is more attractive demographically.\u201dAdvertisement"}
