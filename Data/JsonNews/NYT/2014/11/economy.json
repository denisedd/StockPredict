{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Plan for Immigration Reform", "Date": "2014-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:I support a generous immigration reform, and I am closer to the position of President Obama than that of most Republicans on what the system should be. But undertaking to bypass Congress on a major change in enforcement of federal law is a terrible idea.Whatever perceived political benefits may follow with the Hispanic community (and I suspect that these may not be as expected), the practical result is likely to be a mess for the immigration system, a political battle that distracts from nearly all other (also important) issues, and a very bad precedent.However frustrating the process of passing needed reforms, imposition by executive fiat will be a disaster of no small proportion.\u00a0To the Editor:I think President Obama\u2019s move is smart for several reasons:It recognizes the reality on the ground and treats people with compassion.It forces House and Senate Republicans to write legislation addressing immigration reform rather than just complaining and using it as a perennial issue. If they don\u2019t like President Obama\u2019s executive orders, they should write and pass some laws. Otherwise, they should shut up.It frees up immigration officers for border enforcement.The president\u2019s action has flowed directly from Congress\u2019s inaction on immigration.\u00a0To the Editor:I\u2019ve been a progressive all my life, and I voted for President Obama twice. But as a refugee who was born in a displaced persons camp after World War II, and a legal immigrant, I am deeply disturbed that our immigration policies have been hijacked.There are people around the world who are far worse off than the illegal immigrants from Central and South America. Many of them are at risk of their lives from religious or other persecution. I\u2019m especially distressed that we have left behind Iraqis and Afghans who helped American troops. These people and their families are being hunted down, while we turn our backs.We have always been a refuge for those fleeing persecution, but that is a very narrow door to squeeze through with our current quotas. Yet we are talking about giving refuge to up to five million economic immigrants, primarily because they were best able to break the law.If we want to provide refuge for economic immigrants as well, there are 2.8 billion people in the world who live on less than $2 a day. Why aren\u2019t we bringing in starving and persecuted Africans from Darfur?An informed citizenry is entitled to determine its own immigration policy, but we should make the decisions based on a well-thought-out policy and not be held hostage to emotion.\u00a0To the Editor:Allowing millions to step out of the shadows will be a boost for the economy. Allow them to participate fully in our economy as workers, consumers and small-business owners who will be able to create more employment opportunities for everyone.Even in health care, long seen as a system that pays out more to address immigrant health needs than it takes in, there would be a transformation. Imagine millions of immigrants having to pay their fair share of health insurance premiums. Let\u2019s empower this population to contribute more fully to our society by allowing them to live normal, productive lives.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China and Japan, in Sign of a Thaw, Agree to Disagree on a Disputed Island Group ", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith that step, the leaders of both countries gave the first public declaration that they are trying to roll back a prolonged standoff that has inflamed nationalist sentiments, damaged economic ties and at times appeared to bring them close to military conflict.Even acknowledging differences counts as something of a breakthrough in the standoff. Japan has long declined to discuss China\u2019s claim to sovereignty over the islands, which Tokyo has controlled for most years since the 1880s.China has grown bolder in asserting its claim by making unilateral declarations about control of airspace and sending fishing boats and other vessels to test Japan\u2019s resolve to defend the remote islands, raising fears of a broader conflict.The adversaries said they had agreed to overcome political obstacles in the spirit of \u201cfacing history squarely and looking forward to the future,\u201d while also creating \u201ccrisis management mechanisms\u201d to help prevent any future escalation.Now, there is hope that the Beijing moment could provide for a breakthrough at the APEC forum for world leaders, which begins Monday.In Tokyo, the director of the China division of Japan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Atsushi Ueno, said there had been no decision about a meeting between Mr. Abe and Mr. Xi in Beijing. The Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said in a commentary, \u201cThe Chinese Foreign Ministry has yet to offer a definite answer on whether or not Xi will converse with Abe and, if yes, what kind of talks they will have.\u201dJapan\u2019s foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, will meet with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on Saturday, Mr. Kishida told reporters on Friday in Beijing, where he was attending a gathering of foreign ministers at the APEC summit meeting.The accord, which had been the subject of negotiations for some time, was completed in Beijing on Thursday in a meeting between Japan\u2019s national security adviser, Shotaro Yachi, and China\u2019s chief diplomat, State Councilor Yang Jiechi, according to a Japanese official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with diplomatic protocol.The tone of the accord showed that China was able to maneuver to prevent mention of Japan\u2019s claim of sovereignty over the islands, said Zhang Baohui, director of the Center for Asian Pacific Studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.Two weeks ago, he said, the Japanese reported that the behind-the-scenes negotiations would lead to a statement that would recognize Japan\u2019s sovereignty but would also say that Japan was aware of China\u2019s position.\u201cThat the statement doesn\u2019t say Japan has sovereignty is a diplomatic victory for China and allows the Xi-Abe meeting to happen in the next few days,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.The statements on Friday announcing the agreement said that Tokyo and Beijing would gradually resume security and diplomatic dialogue to build mutual trust. But they made no specific mention of one important issue grounded in the countries\u2019 painful World War II history: Mr. Abe\u2019s past visits to the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, which honors Japanese war criminals along with the country\u2019s other wartime dead.Chinese officials have bluntly called for Mr. Abe, a conservative, to end his visits to the shrine, a pledge that would be extremely unpopular with his core constituency. Mr. Abe has made no such promise, said the Japanese official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.China and Japan have been in a Cold War-style standoff since 2012, when the Japanese government nationalized the disputed islands in the East China Sea, which Japan controls.China has recently increased its pursuit of territorial claims in nearby seas, leading to tense exchanges with neighboring countries. A map of some of the most notable disputes.Since then, China has repeatedly dispatched paramilitary ships to the waters near the uninhabited islands, though those patrols have been reduced in the last few months, apparently in an attempt to defuse the situation.China also declared an air defense zone above the islands, setting off an international uproar because it demanded that all aircraft entering the area submit flight plans to China first. The United States, whose most important ally in Asia is Japan, advised its civilian airlines to refrain from doing so.The Obama administration, concerned about the possibility of an altercation near the islands that could explode into a full-blown conflict, had urged Mr. Abe to try to talk to the Chinese. This year, Mr. Obama said in Tokyo that the United States would stand by its commitment to defend Japan in the event of a conflict.China has long demanded that Japan formally acknowledge the existence of a dispute over the sovereignty of the islands, and Japan has long refused, worried that doing so would strengthen Beijing\u2019s position. The careful wording of Friday\u2019s statements appeared intended to enable each side to say it had not backed down and to claim a diplomatic victory.The tensions between China and Japan have had significant economic consequences for both sides, including a drop-off of Japanese investment in China by nearly half in the first six months of this year.The negotiations that led to the agreement announced on Friday appeared to have started in July with the visit to Beijing of a former Japanese prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, who met with Mr. Xi.Thomas Berger, a professor at Boston University and an expert on Japanese politics, said domestic and international concerns had prompted both countries to agree to disagree and get on with other business.Mr. Abe needed to signal to his domestic audience that his \u201cpeace through strength\u201d policy was working, and China, with its economy slowing, needed better economic relations with Japan, he said.\u201cThe overwhelming majority of Japanese, especially in the pragmatic wing of his government, have little desire for an actual conflict with Beijing,\u201d Professor Berger said. \u201cInstead, what they hope is that through a policy of strength, they can get China to moderate its policies toward Japan.\u201dMr. Xi was probably hoping to get credit internationally for moderating his position, while not making substantive concessions to Japan over the islands or other issues, Professor Berger said.Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about efforts by Japan and China to step back from a longstanding dispute over islands in the East China Sea referred incorrectly to Japan\u2019s control of the islands. Japan has held them for most years since the 1880s, not since World War II. (From 1945 to 1971, they were controlled by the United States.) The error was repeated in an accompanying picture caption.A correction in this space on Wednesday for an article on Nov. 8 about efforts by Japan and China to step back from a longstanding dispute over islands in the East China Sea omitted the source of the error \u2014 that Japan had controlled the islands since World War II. (It has held them for most years since the 1880s.) The error was made during the editing process, not by the reporter, Jane Perlez.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Sand Is Disappearing", "Date": "2014-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 TO those of us who visit beaches only in summer, they seem as permanent a part of our natural heritage as the Rocky Mountains and the Great Lakes. But shore dwellers know differently. Beaches are the most transitory of landscapes, and sand beaches the most vulnerable of all. During big storms, especially in winter, they can simply vanish, only to magically reappear in time for the summer season. It could once be said that \u201ca beach is a place where sand stops to rest for a moment before resuming its journey to somewhere else,\u201d as the naturalist D. W. Bennett wrote in the book \u201cLiving With the New Jersey Shore.\u201d Sand moved along the shore and from beach to sea bottom and back again, forming\u00a0shorelines and barrier islands that until recently were able to repair themselves on a regular basis, producing the illusion of permanence.Today, however, 75 to 90 percent of the world\u2019s natural sand beaches are disappearing, due partly to rising sea levels and increased storm action, but also to massive erosion caused by the human development of shores. Many low-lying barrier islands are already submerged. Yet the extent of this global crisis is obscured because so-called beach nourishment projects attempt to hold sand in place and repair the damage by the time summer people return, creating the illusion of an eternal shore. Before next summer, endless lines of dump trucks will have filled in bare spots and restored dunes. Virginia Beach alone has been restored more than 50 times. In recent decades, East Coast barrier islands have used 23 million loads of sand, much of it mined inland and the rest dredged from coastal waters \u2014 a practice that disturbs the sea bottom, creating turbidity that kills coral beds and damages spawning grounds, which hurts inshore fisheries. The sand and gravel business is now growing faster than the economy as a whole. In the United States, the market for mined sand has become a billion-dollar annual business, growing at 10 percent a year since 2008. Interior mining operations use huge machines working in open pits to dig down under the earth\u2019s surface to get sand left behind by ancient glaciers. But as demand has risen \u2014 and the damming of rivers has held back the flow of sand from mountainous interiors \u2014 natural sources\u00a0of sand have been shrinking. One might think that desert sand would be a ready substitute, but its grains are finer and smoother; they don\u2019t adhere to rougher sand grains, and tend to blow away. As a result, the desert state of Dubai brings sand for its beaches all the way from Australia. And now there is a global beach-quality sand shortage, caused by the industries that have come to rely on it. Sand is vital to the manufacturing of abrasives, glass, plastics, microchips and even toothpaste, and, most recently, to the process of hydraulic fracturing. The quality of silicate sand found in the northern Midwest has produced what is being called a \u201csand rush\u201d there, more than doubling regional sand pit mining since 2009.But the greatest industrial consumer of all is the concrete industry. Sand from Port Washington on Long Island \u2014 140 million cubic yards of it \u2014 built the tunnels and sidewalks of Manhattan from the 1880s onward. Concrete still takes 80 percent of all that mining can deliver. Apart from water and air, sand is the natural element most in demand around the world, a situation that puts the preservation of beaches and their flora and fauna in great danger. Today, a branch of Cemex, one of the world\u2019s largest cement suppliers, is still busy on the shores of Monterey Bay in California, where its operations endanger several protected species.The huge sand mining operations emerging worldwide, many of them illegal, are happening out of sight and out of mind, as far as the developed world is concerned. But in India, where the government has stepped in to limit sand mining along its shores, illegal mining operations by what is now referred to as the \u201csand mafia\u201d defy these regulations. In Sierra Leone, poor villagers are encouraged to sell off their sand to illegal operations, ruining their own shores for fishing. Some Indonesian sand islands have been devastated by sand mining. It is time for us to understand where sand comes from and where it is going. Sand was once locked up in mountains and it took eons of erosion before it was released into rivers and made its way to the sea. As Rachel Carson wrote in 1958, \u201cin every curving beach, in every grain of sand, there is a story of the earth.\u201d Now those grains are sequestered yet again \u2014 often in the very concrete sea walls that contribute to beach erosion. We need to stop taking sand for granted and think of it as an endangered natural resource. Glass and concrete can be recycled back into sand, but there will never be enough to meet the demand of every resort. So we need better conservation plans for shore and coastal areas. Beach replenishment \u2014 the mining and trucking and dredging of sand to meet tourist expectations \u2014 must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with environmental considerations taking top priority. Only this will ensure that the story of the earth will still have subsequent chapters told in grains of sand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eurozone Inflation Rate Dips, Stirring Deflation Fears", "Date": "2014-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The eurozone inflation rate is slipping toward zero, even as the job market remains moribund, official data showed on Friday, highlighting the weak demand at the heart of the bloc\u2019s economy and posing a test of the European Central Bank\u2019s pledge to head off deflation.\u201cThe data show that the Japanification of the eurozone continues apace,\u201d said Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London, referring to the low inflation and economic stagnation that have been the hallmarks of the Japanese economy for much of the last two decades.\u201cThe claim of the European Central Bank that inflation expectations are still anchored is a pipe dream,\u201d Mr. Spiro said. \u201cMarkets are anticipating outright deflation\u201d \u2014 an actual contraction in the Consumer Price Index \u2014 \u201cin the new year.\u201dThe unemployment rate in Italy, the third-largest economy in the eurozone, rose in October to 13.2 percent, the highest since at least 1977, according to a report on Friday from the Italian statistical agency Istat.Unemployment rates vary widely across Europe. Greece, with a jobless rate near 26 percent, and Spain, at 24 percent, are experiencing depression-level conditions, reflecting the damage to their economies from the combination of the credit crisis and budget austerity.At the other end of the scale, Germany\u2019s jobless rate of 4.9 percent reflects a relatively strong environment in Europe\u2019s largest economy, as well as labor market innovations like work-sharing that ensure that many more people are counted as employed. France lies in between, at 10.5 percent.The inflation and jobless figures were in line with market expectations. The euro was little changed against the dollar.The eurozone has already proved itself ill equipped to deal with continuing stagnation, and it must now reckon with the danger that low inflation will tip into outright deflation. That would further sap demand and add stress to borrowers and lenders, because the cost of repaying loans rises in real terms when prices decline.Europe\u2019s malaise has raised alarms in Washington, where officials fear that the United States economy, while relatively strong, cannot carry the weight of global growth alone. The eurozone accounts for about a quarter of global gross domestic product, but it has been unable to muster a policy response sufficient to restore its economic health in the years since the financial crisis began.One contributor to low inflation is the decline in energy prices in recent months. Oil on Friday remained near four-year lows, the day after OPEC decided not to try to reverse the price plunge by curtailing production.Most economists agree that falling energy prices are a boon for businesses and consumers because the less spent on heating or transportation costs, the more is available for spending or investing. The question, over time, is whether that stimulus effect will be enough to keep the overall inflation rate from falling to dangerously low levels.Eurostat on Friday noted that energy costs were down 2.5 percent in November. But even considering that, the so-called core inflation rate \u2014 which strips out the prices of energy and food \u2014 came in at just 0.7 percent in November, the same as October.Many economists say the most important tool left in the central bank\u2019s kit is so-called quantitative easing \u2014 the outright buying in bulk of bonds, including sovereign debt. That policy has been used, with varying levels of success, by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan.The European Central Bank has been loath to commit to it, though, because of questions about its efficacy in a currency union with 18 sovereign nations and because of institutional resistance from Germany, where it would most likely be met with legal challenges. The bank\u2019s governing council will meet on Thursday to discuss policy.Speaking on Thursday at a conference in Helsinki, Finland, he noted that the bank had already taken a number of unorthodox measures intended to restore credit and raise prices, including by providing financial institutions with longer-term loans at rock-bottom rates and by buying asset-backed securities on the open market.But \u201cshould it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation,\u201d he added, \u201cthe governing council is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate.\u201dIn a pointed reference to quantitative easing, he added that central bank staff members had been instructed to be ready \u201cwith the timely preparation of further measures to be implemented, if needed.\u201dFor all the importance of monetary matters, Europe\u2019s fundamental problem is a lack of demand. Gross domestic product is made up of private consumption, business investment, government spending and net exports. In the current climate, none of those look capable, for reasons of confidence or ideology, of lifting the economy.Clemente De Lucia, an economist at BNP Paribas, estimated that the eurozone had an output gap of about 3 percent, meaning the economy is operating that much below its potential. He said he expected it to remain at that level through next year, shrinking to 2 percent in 2016.That would be bad news for the central bank, he wrote in a research note, because until that gap starts to close, price pressures are likely to remain weak.Analysts are divided over whether the central bank will act next week, but there is plenty of evidence that investors are placing their bets now, piling into eurozone government bonds on expectations that the bank will soon follow.As investors scoop up those bonds, prices have risen, and yields, which move in the opposite direction of price, have tumbled across Europe. As a result, France and Germany can currently borrow 10-year funds at below 1 percent; even Italy and Spain, which only a few years ago were looking at terms too onerous to repay, can now borrow at around 2 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fix the New G.I. Bill", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsTHIS Veterans Day there will be over a million students on college campuses in the United States who are using their G.I. Bill benefits. The Department of Veterans Affairs forecasts that the number of student veterans will increase by 20 percent in the next few years. These student veterans are unlike the vast majority of their student counterparts, as more than 60 percent are first-generation students and almost half have children of their own. Much more needs to be done to ensure that they are getting the education they need to succeed in the modern economy.After 9/11, Congress passed a new G.I. Bill modeled after the post-World War II legislation that so powerfully expressed America\u2019s gratitude to its veterans. The original G.I. Bill of 1944 lifted up thousands of veterans and their families, and the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill, enacted in 2008, attempts to do the same. Yet higher education today is far more complicated than it was in the 1940s. Perhaps the most troubling phenomenon returning veterans face right now is this: predatory for-profit schools that exploit their G.I. Bill funding and offer them \u2014 and taxpayers \u2014 very little in return. The schools in question are eager to access our veterans\u2019 grants and loans, but they employ deceptive recruiting practices and achieve low graduation rates. For-profit schools have received over $4 billion \u2014 over a third of all benefits \u2014 under the new G.I. Bill, even though they educate only one-quarter of veterans, and even though their graduation rate is less than half of the graduation rate at nonprofit schools. For-profits are also responsible for about half of all student-loan defaults.Further, for-profit schools often charge more than the G.I. Bill covers, saddling veterans with high debt that is not dischargeable if they find themselves filing for bankruptcy. And since many for-profits are unaccredited, students often find it difficult or impossible to transfer credits to accredited colleges or to apply to graduate school. This trap exacerbates an already difficult transition from military to civilian life.Last month, the Obama administration published new regulations that will impose sanctions \u2014 including the loss of eligibility for federal funding \u2014 on schools whose graduates earn too little income to carry their debt. That is a good step, but much more can be done.Congress should rally behind the Protecting Our Students and Taxpayers Act proposal. Currently, G.I. Bill funding is not classified as a federal source of revenue for for-profit companies. This act would remedy the existing misclassification, thereby reducing the amount of federal dollars that for-profit schools collect. (For-profits are currently prohibited from deriving more than 90 percent of their revenue from federal funds.)And as the Department of Veterans Affairs investigates abuses of the G.I. Bill by for-profit schools, the military could also revisit its internal promotion policies, so as not to encourage service members to use the for-profit schools. Under the current system, for-profit schools can be a good (if misguided) deal for career military service members trying to climb the ladder, but are often a lousy deal for veterans who are transitioning out. Therefore, we suggest that the Department of Defense\u2019s tuition assistance program should be used only at accredited, preapproved universities.To meet the demand of service members who are striving for higher education and accreditation, the Pentagon should also establish a public-private partnership with the leading providers of massive open online courses. Companies like Coursera and edX use these courses to provide free education far outmatching that offered at typical for-profits, in both quality and scale. Through these partnerships, the Pentagon can reduce its costs, attain more tangible insights into veterans\u2019 academic performance and completion rates, and begin to develop certification programs for online education.The military should also be doing a much better job of focusing on the education piece of the transition from the military to the civilian sector. To their credit, the Marines have established a Leadership Scholars Program, which offers a pathway for Marines with a strong interest in higher education to gain entrance into top higher education institutions. Unfortunately, the other service branches do not have a similar model. The military\u2019s transition programs are all built around immediate employment \u2014 and not an acknowledgment that higher education from established, credentialed institutions provides essential skills, knowledge and networks for success in the economy.The government should also require that elite schools devote additional funding to recruiting veterans. Even so, there is still a notable absence of undergraduate veterans at these institutions. Columbia University has already done an excellent job of reaching out to the veteran population, and other schools should follow its lead. Lastly, the G.I. Bill should be amended to limit veterans to only two years at for-profit schools. Some veterans are not comfortable in traditional academic settings, and some of the for-profit schools do a decent job. But a major problem is the inability of students to transfer their credits to traditional schools. Limiting time at for-profit schools to two years and easing transfers would pressure the for-profit schools to raise their standards.The modern G.I. Bill is proof of our nation\u2019s commitment to help veterans help themselves. It is also an important investment in our country\u2019s human capital, because veterans will contribute to our economy just as they did in the decades following World War II. These proposals would not just save taxpayers money, but would also empower veterans to fully participate in the new economy. They would help ensure that today\u2019s G.I. Bill is as effective \u2014 indeed, as transformative \u2014 as the original one.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Longer Business as Usual in China", "Date": "2014-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina is changing the rule book for business, forcing multinational companies to figure out how to play a new game or risk losing out on the world\u2019s second-largest economy.When China joined the World Trade Organization 13 years ago, the government welcomed foreign companies, eager for their factories and technology. Now China is using its growing economic and financial muscle to dictate new terms, as dozens of American, European and Japanese businesses face scrutiny for corruption, monopolistic practices and, most recently, tax evasion.With heads of state and corporate chieftains in Beijing for a major economic summit this week, China\u2019s increasing economic nationalism is expected to be heavily debated. The squeeze on multinationals has coincided with President Xi Jinping\u2019s consolidation of power and his increasingly nationalistic and sometimes confrontational stance toward China\u2019s neighbors and the West.\u201cIf any leader wants to push for economic cooperation,\u201d said Li Cheng, the director of the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution, \u201che\u2019s really taking a serious political risk.\u201dWhile China has long presented unique challenges for businesses, the regulatory and legal environment has been especially perilous in recent months, with authorities pushing companies to cut prices and punishing them with large fines. GlaxoSmithKline, Volkswagen, Chrysler, Mead Johnson, Samsung, Johnson & Johnson and other companies have been hit with multimillion-dollar fines this year, while Microsoft, Daimler and Qualcomm are under investigation.Then suddenly, in the last five weeks, there has been a lull in what had been a rapid pace of punishments. The pause has been all the more abrupt because Chinese officials were putting the finishing touches on what seemed likely to be their heaviest penalties yet in the continuing crackdown on monopolistic practices. The target was even identified by Chinese officials at a news conference in mid-September as Qualcomm, which invents and licenses mobile technology.But Chinese regulators did not end up acting against Qualcomm, as Beijing\u2019s leaders were distracted by the protests in Hong Kong. China was then preoccupied with a top-level Communist Party meeting, followed by preparations for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in the coming days.Another possible factor in the slower pace of investigations may be an important personnel change. Xu Kunlin, the head of the price supervision antimonopoly division at the National Development and Reform Commission and the leading advocate of a tough stance toward multinationals, was transferred a month ago to run the separate price regulation division, said two people who know Mr. Xu but insisted on anonymity because of the sensitivity of personnel moves.Mr. Xu\u2019s transfer came right after foreign businesses and governments had complained bitterly to senior Chinese officials about the antimonopoly investigations. While his transfer has most likely delayed some antitrust investigations, it is not necessarily a demotion, and the timing with the foreign complaints may be a coincidence, said the two people. The price regulation division has just had a corruption scandal, and Mr. Xu has now been given broad authority to rebuild it.While national and provincial investigators appear to have pressed pause, township governments have quietly stepped up their activities, raiding the local offices of multinationals.The townships, which do not have the legal authority to enforce antitrust legislation, are operating under old, vaguely worded laws against price gouging as well as collusion that are still on the books even as China has modernized much of its legal code to embrace more market-oriented principles. The local investigators have been copying large amounts of memos, tax records and financial documents. The more complex documents have then been forwarded to more experienced investigators in provincial capitals.\u201cWe have clients that are investigated by very, very rudimentary teams who have no clue what they are doing,\u201d said an adviser to multinationals who insisted on anonymity because of the legal sensitivity of the cases. Those teams, the adviser said, nonetheless manage to accumulate large quantities of confidential corporate data, sending a shudder through the head offices of the affected multinationals.Whether the Chinese government is focusing disproportionately on foreign companies is the subject of considerable dispute.Foreign business groups calculate that half the recent national and provincial antitrust and collusion penalties have been aimed at multinationals even though they represent a very small share of the Chinese economy. But Chinese officials said in late September that if all collusion penalties assessed by local governments are included, then multinationals are only the targets a tenth of the time.Western companies have been taken aback by many procedural aspects of the investigations, which diverge significantly from practices in the United States and Europe.Chinese regulators have been pushing through antitrust cases in a few weeks, giving companies little chance to respond. In the United States, they take two years or more.China also does not have clear rules on whether investigators need warrants to search offices or whether executives are entitled to lawyers, particularly foreign lawyers. So many companies have been raided that the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China has organized a conference for executives in Beijing on Nov. 21 titled, \u201cDawn Raids in China \u2014 How to avoid and answer a sudden knock at your door?\u201dLegal and regulatory action against some companies doing business in China.Antitrust authorities in China also routinely share evidence with other agencies, including tax collectors. The information, which generally cannot be shared among agencies in the United States, has opened up new avenues for potential cases. People\u2019s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, devoted nearly an entire page on Oct. 13 to accusing foreign corporations of diverting large profits out of the country without paying taxes on them \u2014 a complaint sometimes levied against multinationals in the United States and Europe.Yuan Shuhong, the deputy director of the legislative affairs office of China\u2019s State Council, or cabinet, said at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday that China planned to enact an administrative procedures law to require that due process and other legal norms be followed during government regulatory actions. But the law may take considerable time to draft and approve, he warned.Some lawyers contend that the Chinese government is simply looking to create a robust regulatory framework and stamp out corruption. Chinese government agencies \u201care becoming more and more sophisticated, and confident in launching investigations against foreign companies,\u201d said Michael Gu, an antimonopoly specialist at the AnJie Law Firm.To others, the legal cases are signs that the government\u2019s growing nationalism \u2014 already evident in state-run media and China\u2019s contentious relationships with neighboring countries \u2014 extends to economic policy as well. Critics contend China is going beyond the spirit, and possibly the letter, of the free-trade rules of the World Trade Organization, even though China, as the world\u2019s largest exporter, has been the biggest beneficiary of the W.T.O.\u201cChina should be out there in the front trying to make W.T.O. rules stronger, not undermining them,\u201d said Susan C. Schwab, who was the United States trade representative from 2006 to 2009. \u201cBut I don\u2019t get the sense there is anyone in Beijing making that case, because you\u2019ve got a very self-absorbed focus on industrial policy coming out of parts of the government.\u201dChina\u2019s assertive stance has created a dilemma for the United States and other trading partners. While they are reluctant to defend companies that may have bribed officials or colluded with competitors, they are also unsettled by China\u2019s insistence that companies cut prices for products or otherwise hamper business. The Obama administration has ended up saying little publicly even as American business leaders have fumed.\u201cWe have been in regular contact with U.S. companies on a range of issues that may affect the business climate in China and want to ensure foreign firms are not singled out for Anti-Monopoly Law investigations and are treated fairly by Chinese enforcers,\u201d Matt McAlvanah, the chief spokesman for the Office of the United States Trade Representative, said in a written reply to questions. \u201cThe U.S. has had longstanding discussions with the Chinese government on antimonopoly law and we will continue this engagement.\u201dAdvocates of a more confrontational trade strategy have criticized the administration for not taking a more public stance. They point to various potential tools, like threatening to limit China\u2019s access to the American market.\u201cWashington doesn\u2019t appear to have any idea on how to deal with China\u2019s rising economic nationalism \u2014 their default approach is dialogue,\u201d said Michael R. Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a group created by Congress to provide advice on China policy. \u201cBut there\u2019s little evidence that dialogue results in anything other than delay and ultimately acceptance of China\u2019s plans.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spain's Problems Leave Parties at a Loss", "Date": "2014-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomySpain has been held up to other eurozone countries as an example of the benefits of structural reform. That is fair enough, up to a point. The conservative government\u2019s bank rescues and labor overhauls have stabilized the financial system and improved competitiveness. The economy is expected to grow 1.2 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year, according to the European Commission.But the country is troubled. The unemployment rate may be falling but it is expected to end next year at an eye-popping 23.5 percent. Corruption scandals embroiling politicians from all the traditional governing parties are coming out of the woodwork. And government debt is still climbing and expected to exceed 100 percent of gross domestic product next year.Meanwhile, many Catalans in the north of Spain are campaigning for independence. Over the weekend, Barcelona held an unofficial vote on quitting Spain. Although this became something of a theatrical exercise after Madrid stopped it from having a referendum, the campaign will go on until the people are given the choice of whether to stay in Spain or leave it.The next major move in Catalonia is likely to be regional elections, which have to be held within two years but may be brought forward. Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, a radical nationalist group, would then become the largest party, supplanting the moderate nationalists who now run the government.Esquerra would want to declare independence unilaterally. Such a move would probably lead to a run on banks in Catalonia and to capital controls as people tried to take out their deposits. It could also lead to default by the regional government if Madrid stopped sending it money. This would be economically disastrous, and Esquerra probably would not be able to secure the support of moderate nationalists for a unilateral declaration of independence. But the Catalan issue would still be a sore spot.The discredited political class is at a loss over what to do about all these problems. The government\u2019s initial zeal for change has faded into history as Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, has prepared for a general election that has to be held in little more than a year. The last initiative, a tax reform announced in the summer, ended up a flop.The opposition socialist party has a young new leader in Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who is not tarred by corruption scandals or the policy errors of his predecessors. He is struggling, however, to come up with a coherent economic policy. His most notable idea is to roll back the labor reform that has been the current government\u2019s most successful policy. This has left open a huge gap in the market for Podemos, a left-wing populist party. It is now leading in the opinion polls, even though it did not exist a year ago.Podemos, the Spanish word for \u201cwe can,\u201d wants to clean up politics, which is good. But its leaders sympathize with Venezuelan-style Chavismo: The party wants to cut the retirement age to 60, audit the country\u2019s debt before writing part of it off and guarantee everybody a minimum income. If such a program ever became policy, Spain would be heading for default and exit from the eurozone.What the country really needs is a second wave of reforms. There should be another dose of labor reform, as those in permanent jobs still have excessive privileges with the result that most new jobs are short-term contracts. Taxes on labor should be cut and replaced with taxes on spending to encourage more job creation. And court procedures need to be simplified to speed up justice and encourage investment.Unfortunately, the prognosis is not good. The next general election is unlikely to produce an overall majority for any of the three leading parties \u2014 the conservatives, socialists or Podemos. But they will not be able to cut a deal with the Catalan parties unless they offer a referendum, and the other parliamentary groups are too small to count.As a result, two of the big three parties will probably need to club together to get a majority. A socialist-Podemos alliance is conceivable. Although neither party would want to join forces, their supporters might want them to. The snag is that the economic policies that would then emerge would be deeply unappealing. A \u201cgrand coalition\u201d of conservatives and the socialists would be the best bet. In such a situation, Mr. Rajoy might have to step down to make way for a coalition leader.A grand coalition would also be the best way of resolving the Catalan situation. Before Catalonia could be given a vote, Spain\u2019s Constitution would have to be changed \u2014 and that would require a supermajority in Parliament as well as a countrywide referendum.But the socialists and conservatives will be reluctant to form a pact. This is not just because of their traditional rivalry. A grand coalition could play into Podemos\u2019 hands, validating its script that the two parties are as bad as each other. The upstart party might then be well placed to take power in the following general election, in much the same way that Greece\u2019s radical-left Syriza party looks set to win that country\u2019s next elections after the conservatives and socialists formed a grand coalition.Spain is in for a rough ride.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter \u00adSchneider\u2019s \u2018Berlin Now\u2019 and Rory MacLean\u2019s \u2018Berlin\u2019", "Date": "2014-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the German writer Peter \u00adSchneider published \u201cThe Wall Jumper,\u201d his celebrated elliptical novella about the divided Berlin of the Cold War, in 1982, the city\u2019s central importance to the 20th century was unquestioned. First the kaiser and then the F\u00fchrer had touched off world wars from Germany\u2019s capital. And when the world was split between Soviet and American blocs, Berlin could rightly claim to be the front line. The concrete barrier zigzagging through its streets stood as the tangible symbol of that division.President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1963 Berlin speech is best remembered for the phrase \u201cIch bin ein Berliner,\u201d but before his indelible German declaration he said more broadly, \u201cAll free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin.\u201d Caring about what happened in Berlin meant caring about what happened everywhere, lending added significance to works like \u201cThe Wall Jumper\u201d or the Wim Wenders film \u201cWings of Desire.\u201dNow, 25 years after the fall of the wall, the city is once again the object of intense fascination \u2014 not because of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s influence over European fiscal policies but because bohemian young people are moving to the city from every part of the globe and clubbing all night. It\u2019s Berlin as Ibiza or Cancun, but with bad weather.In \u201cBerlin Now,\u201d Schneider seeks to explain why the city became \u201cthe capital of creative people from around the world today,\u201d attracting artists, D.J.s and software developers from Tokyo, Tel Aviv and all points in between. He also tackles the interconnected question of how, once Berlin \u201cburst out of the shackles of reinforced concrete, barbed wire and iron bars . . . the severed veins and limbs of the divided city fused back together.\u201dThe most famous line from \u201cThe Wall Jumper\u201d was Schneider\u2019s statement that \u201cit will take us longer to tear down the wall in our heads than any wrecking company will need for the wall we can see.\u201d Indeed, Schneider finds himself following roundabout routes through the reunified city defined by the path of the now absent wall, \u201ctaking the old detours. Nothing seemed more difficult to me than driving straight from west to east.\u201dHe recounts the debates over how to rebuild the central but long-abandoned square known as Potsdamer Platz, and describes the fight over destroying the East German Parliament building and replacing it with a facsimile of the old Prussian palace that preceded it. Even a quarter-\u00adcentury after the wall\u2019s demolition, the city has a strikingly unfinished quality, full of gaps and absences.Schneider identifies \u201cthe weirdness, perpetual incompleteness and outlandishness of Berlin,\u201d not as a failing but as an attraction. A jewel of a city like Dubrovnik or Venice feels like a closed circuit, a finished book. \u201cImperfection, incompleteness \u2014 not to say ugliness \u2014 afford a sense of freedom that compact beauty never can,\u201d he writes.For centuries Berlin has had something of a chip on its shoulder. It lacks the ancient ruins of Rome or the sophisticated beauty of Paris. It is landlocked and flat, with a climate that can be frigid, gray and unpleasant up to eight months out of the year. \u201cImagine Geneva, lost in a desert,\u201d Balzac wrote in 1843, \u201cand you have an idea of Berlin.\u201dThat quotation surfaces in another book timed to the 25th anniversary of the fall of the wall by the Canadian travel writer Rory MacLean. With a few exceptions, \u201cBerlin: Portrait of a City Through the Centuries\u201d is a series of loose biographical sketches of both famous and everyday Berliners, past and present. The very first concerns a 15th-century poet and singer, Konrad von C\u00f6lln, who was prone to debauchery. He had his tongue cut out for defying Prince-Elector Irontooth, and was then executed.MacLean sees the dualities of sex and violence, freedom and fascism as central to the city\u2019s character and its appeal. A worker in a factory kitchen inadvertently kills herself trying to induce a miscarriage by eating the tips of 160 phosphorous matches. A courtesan becomes the model for the golden angel at the top of the Siegess\u00e4ule, or victory column, featured prominently in \u201cWings of Desire.\u201d Leni Riefenstahl, Albert Speer and Joseph Goebbels are juxtaposed with Christopher Isherwood, Marlene \u00adDietrich and David Bowie.MacLean acknowledges Alexandra Richie\u2019s comprehensive doorstopper of Berlin history, \u201cFaust\u2019s Metropolis\u201d (worth the time of any dedicated student of the city\u2019s history), and his book reads at times like a breezy companion to that work. But what is real and what is not in MacLean\u2019s stories is often unclear. He tells of a Vietnamese immigrant to East Germany and in the notes writes: \u201cThe truth of the story \u2014 although not its facts \u2014 was checked by author and translator Nguyen Ngoc Bich.\u201d The British edition of the book was called \u201cBerlin: Imagine a City,\u201d which better alerts readers to the blend of fact and fiction.Both MacLean and Schneider restore a sense of the importance of Berlin\u2019s vanished industrial might, crippled by Allied bombing, stripped by the Soviets as reparations after the war and finally starved by the wall surrounding it. The makeshift galleries and pop-up clubs of recent vintage are staged on its ruins. \u201cThe landmarks of Berlin are old gasometers and water towers, deserted hospitals, disused airports, onetime docks, vacant train stations, abandoned C.I.A. surveillance facilities and Stasi prisons,\u201d Schneider writes, \u201cmoldy bunker and tunnel complexes from two dictatorships and warehouses of all kinds.\u201dOn a visit to the converted bunker of the art collector Christian Boros, Schneider recalls his own time in bunkers as a boy during the war, \u201cthe absence of sounds: the anxious silence among hundreds of women and children, loud screams when bombs strike nearby, the wait for a sign that danger has passed.\u201d Seventy years later he finds himself \u201cunsettled\u201d by a sound installation where microphones amplify the hum of \u201ccoldly glowing fluorescent tubes.\u201dToo often, however, Schneider settles for pontificating \u2014 on subjects ranging from the sexual differences between East and West German women to the perils posed by Muslim immigrants. He quotes a study that he says revealed \u201ca clear relationship between Islamic piety and the propensity toward violence,\u201d and repeats a Berlin politician\u2019s assertion that \u201cthere are also Turks and Arabs who aren\u2019t stupid. It\u2019s these kids that we need to help against their parents.\u201d Schneider praises his straight talk, calling him a \u201cnatural-born tribune.\u201dToday, as global economies continue to sputter through the aftereffects of the Great Recession, the German capital has come to feel like a day care facility for \u00adcollege-educated Americans and Europeans. The nightclub lines ring with brash Spanish chatter and lilting Irish accents. Gallery openings are packed with New Yorkers playacting a vision of the city filtered through the novels of Isherwood and the music of Bowie.Most will go home, provisioned with a few outr\u00e9 stories to be told later, in stolid, responsible middle age.

{"Headline": "An Agreement on Climate Change", "Date": "2014-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:It is good to see an American president deal with China as a respected member of the international community, a position it has earned. It is also excellent to see a Chinese president take a responsible position with regard to global climate change.Now if only the Republican Party would join the world in recognizing the threat global warming presents and join President Obama in taking appropriate action, we might all breathe a sigh of relief.\u00a0To the Editor:I believe that the Chinese will actually try to honor the agreement. They are quickly realizing that the health of their citizens is at severe risk given the air quality in China and that it makes sense economically to make strides to clean the environment. They are facing severe health care costs in the future.Next step, get India on board.\u00a0To the Editor:The agreement with China announced this week is a huge step toward avoiding the worst effects of climate change. Republicans in Congress can\u2019t block the agreement, so they should start advocating for emission reduction mechanisms that don\u2019t increase regulations, expand government or slow economic growth.A strategy called carbon fee-and-dividend meets all these criteria. A fee would be placed on each ton of carbon extracted or imported, and revenues would be returned to every household. Multiple studies have demonstrated that these dividend checks would stimulate the economy and offset higher energy prices for the vast majority of Americans. And best of all for conservatives, this market-based solution wouldn\u2019t result in expanded government or increased taxes.Congressional Republicans should stop fighting efforts to address climate change and start advocating for solutions that are consistent with their values.\u00a0To the Editor:Mr. Kerry\u2019s announcement of the pact between China and the United States was rightly described as \u201chistoric.\u201d Both sides agreed to agree, rather than to disagree. The Chinese proverb \u201ca journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step\u201d is most appropriate. Agreeing to agree is the first step in this thousand-mile journey that we all face together and that we cannot make alone.In future elections, voters need to demand that climate change be a front-burner political issue. Since many elections these days are close, we need only a relatively small percentage of voters to demand climate-consciousness in their candidates for them to win elections.\u00a0To the Editor:The announcement of the accord with China is not only good news for the climate, but also signals great promise to American business and job seekers.With the world\u2019s two largest economies voicing a commitment to cutting carbon, demand for all renewable energy technologies will naturally soar. Even as 18,000 clean energy jobs were added during the third quarter of 2014, such rapid job expansion will pale in comparison going forward as manufacturers, developers and energy suppliers add employees to ramp up production, construction and deployment.The agreement ought to spur an unprecedented sense of urgency among American policy makers. With a new Congress focused on restarting American manufacturing and spurring job growth, we must work to ensure that this impending economic explosion happens right here in the United States.The writer is president and chief executive of the American Council on Renewable Energy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Suffer Little Children", "Date": "2014-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI get especially choked up about the Baldizzi apartment from 1934. When I described its layout to my parents, both declared, \u201cI grew up in that apartment!\u201d And today\u2019s immigrants are the same, in aspiration and behavior, as my grandparents were \u2014 people seeking a better life, and by and large finding it.That\u2019s not to say that I, or most progressives, support open borders. You can see one important reason right there in the Baldizzi apartment: the photo of F.D.R. on the wall. The New Deal made America a vastly better place, yet it probably wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the immigration restrictions that went into effect after World War I. For one thing, absent those restrictions, there would have been many claims, justified or not, about people flocking to America to take advantage of welfare programs. So there are some difficult issues in immigration policy. I like to say that if you don\u2019t feel conflicted about these issues, there\u2019s something wrong with you. But one thing you shouldn\u2019t feel conflicted about is the proposition that we should offer decent treatment to children who are already here \u2014 and are already Americans in every sense that matters. And that\u2019s what Mr. Obama\u2019s initiative is about.What should we do about these people and their families? There are some forces in our political life who want us to bring out the iron fist \u2014 to seek out and deport young residents who weren\u2019t born here but have never known another home, to seek out and deport the undocumented parents of American children and force those children either to go into exile or to fend for themselves. But that isn\u2019t going to happen, partly because, as a nation, we aren\u2019t really that cruel; partly because that kind of crackdown would require something approaching police-state rule; and, largely, I\u2019m sorry to say, because Congress doesn\u2019t want to spend the money that such a plan would require. In practice, undocumented children and the undocumented parents of legal children aren\u2019t going anywhere. The real question, then, is how we\u2019re going to treat them. Will we continue our current regime of malign neglect, denying them ordinary rights and leaving them under the constant threat of deportation? Or will we treat them as the fellow Americans they already are?The truth is that sheer self-interest says that we should do the humane thing. Today\u2019s immigrant children are tomorrow\u2019s workers, taxpayers and neighbors. Condemning them to life in the shadows means that they will have less stable home lives than they should, be denied the opportunity to acquire skills and education, contribute less to the economy, and play a less positive role in society. Failure to act is just self-destructive.But speaking for myself, I don\u2019t care that much about the money, or even the social aspects. What really matters, or should matter, is the humanity. My parents were able to have the lives they did because America, despite all the prejudices of the time, was willing to treat them as people. Offering the same kind of treatment to today\u2019s immigrant children is the practical course of action, but it\u2019s also, crucially, the right thing to do. So let\u2019s applaud the president for doing it. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don't Overreact, Canada", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMONTREAL \u2014 Canada, so the reigning clich\u00e9 goes, is a peaceable country, the quaint counterpoint to the aggressive ways of its southern neighbor. And while part of that clich\u00e9 is hardly true \u2014 we\u2019ve seen our fair share of wars \u2014 its central idea generally holds: Canadians tend to be less reactionary in the face of a perceived threat. Witness how Canada didn\u2019t participate in the Vietnam War, or the Iraq invasion in 2003. Cooler heads prevailed, perhaps because (to borrow another clich\u00e9) they were watching a hockey game.Two recent attacks on Canadian soldiers threaten to lay waste to this cheery sensibility. On Oct. 20, a 25-year-old recent convert to Islam hit two soldiers with his car in a Quebec town about 25 miles outside Montreal, killing one before a police officer shot him. Less than 48 hours later, another Islamic convert shot and killed a soldier before dying in a shootout in Ottawa with the police and Kevin Vickers, Parliament\u2019s sergeant-at-arms.The two attacks sparked near-instantaneous calls for an increase in surveillance powers for Canada\u2019s law enforcement and intelligence agencies. \u201cIn recent weeks, I have been saying that our laws and police powers need to be strengthened in the area of surveillance, detention and arrest,\u201d Prime Minister Stephen Harper told Parliament a day after the Ottawa attack. \u201cThey need to be much strengthened. I assure members that work, which is already underway, will be expedited.\u201dMr. Harper is right: The Canadian government\u2019s attempts to erode individual freedoms in the name of security started well before the deaths of the two soldiers. Last fall, the government shoehorned increased Internet surveillance powers into an anti-bullying bill, which would grant legal immunity to telecommunications companies that voluntarily hand over customer data. The bill would also further lower the standards of evidence for police officers seeking to monitor Internet activities.More recently, the government introduced legislation that would give blanket anonymity to informants for Canada\u2019s spy agency. This would potentially allow for a dereliction of a basic principle of justice: An accused person would be unable to face his accusers. Yet the attacks have apparently loosened the tongues of those in government wanting the country to go even further. The government, Justice Minister Peter MacKay recently mused, should consider further powers to monitor and remove offensive websites, lest they lead to a \u201cpoisoning of young minds.\u201d Jason Kenney, the minister for multiculturalism, recently suggested that those suspected of terrorist sympathies be subject to \u201cpreventative detention\u201d \u2014 which the criminal code already permits \u2014 for longer time periods, and a lower legal threshold for the government to detain them.It\u2019s worth considering that such measures would not have prevented the recent attacks. Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the perpetrator of the Ottawa shooting, had little online presence. His arrest record, a grab bag of drunken driving, drug possession, assault and weapons charges, suggests teenage overindulgence and inner demons, not a budding terrorist. Having drifted from his family, he lived on the margins of society for years. He\u2019d recently told an acquaintance that the devil was following him around. In the case of Martin Couture-Rouleau, who hit the two soldiers with his car, law enforcement had already revoked his passport, and he\u2019d been under surveillance for months \u2014 including at the mosque he attended. He simply hadn\u2019t done anything to warrant arrest, preventive or otherwise. His online presence, meanwhile, was largely an Islamic-themed cacophony of anti-Semitism and cut-and-paste screeds against Christianity. While disturbing, only in the most totalitarian of states would this sort of thing constitute a crime.Besides, Canadian intelligence and law enforcement agencies have performed their jobs admirably without any increased powers. Canadian law enforcement has prevented at least two potentially disastrous terror strikes on Canadian soil in the last decade. And the country\u2019s spy agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, isn\u2019t without resources: Its budget has more than doubled in the last 12 years.Canadians need only look to the south to see how attacks on individuals and establishments can\u2019t usually be prevented by increased surveillance of a country\u2019s civilians. The United States arguably is home to the world\u2019s largest and most sophisticated intelligence-gathering network, the excesses of which have been documented by leaks from the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden.Yet none of this prevented the breach of the White House in September, in which an Iraq war veteran scaled the White House fence and made it to within feet of where the president and his family live before being apprehended. Nor has surveillance hindered the ability of various gunmen to inflict mass murder on innocents throughout the years. As the former Vice President Al Gore noted last year, in a speech decrying the folly of such mass intelligence gathering, \u201cWhen you are looking for a needle in a haystack, it\u2019s not always wise to pile more hay on the haystack.\u201dTheoretically, it would be possible for the Canadian government to legislate itself the powers to prevent all such attacks. Yet the trade-off \u2014 constant surveillance, criminalization of dissent, restriction of free movement and the economy \u2014 would make the country unlivable. It would be a travesty if the actions of two troubled individuals moved the country closer to that possibility. Advertisement"}

It coordinated communication to all health care facilities, standardized education for health care personnel and created protocols for improved quality of care in emergency situations.It has demonstrated that scientifically informed rather than politically tinged state efforts are effective. Just as with national defense, only a coordinated, unified response by the federal government is capable of meeting such an emergency.Fortunately such a model is translatable not just for medical emergency situations, but to all levels of medical care. The Affordable Care Act remarkably has had the foresight to focus on prevention and public health as well as individual treatment.Ebola has focused our government\u2019s role in the delivery of health care.

One suspects they also conducted amateur analysis of the rich people\u2019s surnames. The result was an infographic with the 22 ethnic groups the authors identified among the 200 entrepreneurs, with some helpful statistics, including: the cumulative worth of members of a particular ethnic group on the list, the percentage of the list the group represented and the percentage of the ethnic group in the general population.It follows from the infographic that \u201cJews\u201d (meaning Ashkenazi Jews) hold a disproportionate amount of wealth: They represent only 0.11 percent of the population, but 42 people on the list with a total of more than $122 billion to their names. Then come the ethnic Ukrainians: a mere 1.41 percent of the population but 12 percent of the list, for a total of over $70 billion. The Armenians, the Azeris, the Ingush, the Chechens and even the Arabs have all grabbed more than their fair share. Only the ethnic Russians \u2014 with over 80 percent of the population but a mere 44.5 percent of the list and a cumulative wealth of $165 billion \u2014 clearly have less than they ought to, statistically speaking.The authors of the article specifically point to Mountain Jews \u2014 an ethnic group distinct from the Ashkenazi Jews who have historically lived in Russia and Ukraine, these are Jews from the North Caucasus \u2014 as being overrepresented among the rich: with six men (and over $10 billion) on the list when the total population of Mountain Jews in Russia, according to the piece, is 762 people. Predictably, the authors also point to ethnic Ukrainians as having too much money.\u201cEthnicity has been and continues to be one of the key identifying characteristics of human beings,\u201d the authors write, explaining the importance of their undertaking. \u201cNo less interesting is the question of the ethnic makeup of the ruling elite.\u201d In other words, they are presenting the article as a social service and perhaps even an educational tool.Those claims are not entirely absurd: Russia is casting about for new enemies, and the media appear to feel the need to contribute to the search. For two months now the state propaganda machine has been pulling back from the intense anti-Ukrainian rhetoric that dominated the spring and summer. In Moscow, city authorities have even painted over at least one Crimea-themed mural, replacing aggressive military images with video game characters. The rhetorical withdrawal from Ukraine probably has two goals: forestalling further Western sanctions and perhaps reversing some that have been imposed, and diverting Russians\u2019 attention from a war that risks becoming too costly.It is impossible to say which enemy Mr. Putin will choose for the next stage of his war. Domestic enemies, however, offer some clear benefits: Going to war against your own people costs less, both in direct expenditures and in potential penalties. In addition, with the Russian economy shrinking rapidly, the wealth pie is getting smaller \u2014 and the desire to reapportion it is growing stronger. It is not a good time to be a moneyed member of an ethnic minority in Russia. Then again, it is never a good time to be a poor member of an ethnic minority there.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Drills and Spills", "Date": "2014-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersReaders discuss the environmental damage in North Dakota from oil extraction.To the Editor:Your excellent article on oils spills and pollution in North Dakota shows the drilling-mud-encrusted depths to which elected and non-elected officials will descend in their abject failure to strengthen and enforce regulations, assess meaningful fines, and protect the citizens and land of North Dakota.When land and water become polluted, they are useless. When will Gov. Jack Dalrymple and others wake up?None of this is rocket science. It just takes responsible companies and government officials, both apparently in short supply in North Dakota.\u00a0To the Editor:Not all of us North Dakotans have our heads in the sand. However, the Legislature and state government have allowed oil companies to run like a freight train over the state. There are responsible people peppered within our state agencies and the Legislature, but they are overwhelmed, outfinanced and outnumbered.People here are not used to being advocates. They are \u201cNorth Dakota nice.\u201d They trust authority. It will be up to the next generation of young North Dakotans to fix this mess, but they better start voting.\u00a0To the Editor:North Dakota\u2019s success as an energy leader has been transformative for the economic security of its residents and has not come at the expense of sound regulation, contrary to your recent article. According to the Western Organization of Resource Councils, North Dakota is the only state with enough inspectors to inspect every producing well at least once a year.We can all agree that even one incident is too many, yet your reporting does not provide a fair picture of the stringent standards governing the state\u2019s energy development. The North Dakota Industrial Commission \u2014 elected by and accountable to the state\u2019s citizens \u2014 continually adopts regulations to meet new challenges, passing more than 70 new or modified rules in the last two years. State leadership has demonstrated that we can have a balanced approach to energy, combining safety and environmental stewardship with domestic investment and job creation. Because of this, the rest of the world now views North Dakota \u2014 and the United States \u2014 as energy superpowers.The writer is director of upstream and industry operations at the American Petroleum Institute.\u00a0To the Editor:A great expos\u00e9! On behalf of the millions of us who live near tracks that carry Bakken oil to refineries for foreign export, I\u2019d like to draw attention to the trains that carry Bakken oil across the United States through our communities.In Bergen County, New Jersey, where trains carrying Bakken crude come through 11 heavy populated towns, our Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains has demanded city, state and federal legislation and action by the Department of Transportation to protect us from these toxic time bombs. Tragically, 47 people were killed last year when a train carrying crude oil exploded in Quebec. As in North Dakota, our governor, Chris Christie, refuses to allow transparency about the toxicity and the regulation of these trains. We don\u2019t even have information about real evacuation and decontamination plans.We say: Ban unsafe oil trains!\u00a0To the Editor:I grew up in North Dakota, and my family holds some mineral rights in the area, but small holders like us don\u2019t reap the supposed benefits of this boom. As the article points out, the oil companies, the railroads and a select few like the governor take most of the spoils. It is not unreasonable to require those who have benefited so greatly to pay for the cleanup. That can happen only with strong and honest regulation. It\u2019s time for North Dakotans to demand better of their politicians.\u00a0To the Editor:Your reporting is spot on. Oil extraction is a messy and high-stakes industry, and, yes, those who have influence get special treatment. The oil industry directly contributes to climate change and pollution.However, let\u2019s not ignore the fact that oil promotes the growth of American companies, the gross domestic product and jobs. The Great Recession is not that far behind us, and for me jobs and energy independence are far more important than putting an end to drilling because of environmental concerns.North Dakota and America are very fortunate to have this oil; the Bakken shale oil fields add billions of dollars to the state\u2019s economy and lead to the $450 million surplus that North Dakotans will enjoy in 2014. We all use oil every day, so why wouldn\u2019t we use American oil?\u00a0To the Editor:The late CBS News correspondent Eric Sevareid, a native son, once referred to North Dakota as \u201ca large, rectangular blank spot in the nation\u2019s mind.\u201d After the coal, oil and railroad cartels are done, I imagine it will return to being a blank spot \u2014 poisoned and desecrated \u2014 again.Although I am from Vermont, I have lived in North Dakota twice and got to know its beauty. Now, the state is under assault. Kathleen Norris wrote a wonderful book called \u201cDakota: A Spiritual Geography.\u201d It celebrated the ineffable quality of the alternately harsh and magnificent life on the Northern Plains. Unfortunately, when humankind gets done with North Dakota, we will have eradicated a good part of the spirit that she found there.\u00a0To the Editor:The indifference of North Dakota\u2019s oil industry to the environmental damage it is creating is horrifying enough, but words fail me when I learn that the state agency charged with regulating that very industry shares that indifference.In the future America will surely require increased energy production, especially in the form of electric power. At the same time it is a well-established scientific fact that global warming is directly related to fossil fuel consumption. Clearly the resolution of the collision is to develop alternatives to fossil fuels.Photovoltaic solar receptors and wind turbines currently make up only about 5 percent of total United States energy production. This proportion is unlikely to increase appreciably until solutions are found to the problems of storing energy when the sun doesn\u2019t shine or when the wind is inert.One solution stands alone as the choice for a viable American energy future. It is the revival of our moribund nuclear power industry. The 1986 Chernobyl disaster and the 2011 reactor explosions at Fukushima are attributable to design errors that have been corrected by modern reactor technology and siting errors that are unlikely to be repeated.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Election Day: The Mood of America", "Date": "2014-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetters To the Editor:I find the mood of the electorate bewildering: There is widespread dissatisfaction with President Obama\u2019s job performance, even though he delivered a health care law that is working and will improve over time; he pulled the economy back from the precipice, even as he reduced the deficit by half from when George W. Bush was in office; and he is battling the twin plagues of Ebola and the rise of ISIS, crises not of his making, with thoughtful, measured approaches.Still, a majority of Americans may be turning to a Republican Party that has promised diminished government, repeal of Obamacare, environmental and corporate deregulation, and further tax reductions that will balloon the deficit and vastly reduce funding of essential services.The message from voters is wildly ambivalent: Many Americans want a severely hobbled federal government, but at the same time one that guarantees their health and safety. They want stronger government and leadership, even as they ask for less. The truth may be even more troubling: Too many Americans don\u2019t know what they want, or care. If history is any indicator, a sizable majority of eligible voters won\u2019t even bother to vote.This is the real tragedy. The fault is not in our stars, it is in ourselves. We get the government we deserve. I pray I am wrong.To the Editor:To the Editor:You write of President Obama and his aides: \u201cAnticipating a less friendly Congress, they are mapping possible compromises with Republicans to expand trade, overhaul taxes and build roads and bridges.\u201d Less friendly Congress? I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s room for that, given the unfriendliness of the past one. And I find this article, and Mr. Obama\u2019s intent, a bit polyannaish.The bottom line is this: The most conservative Republican members of Congress, particularly in the South, vowed to destroy this presidency on Day 1. And I don\u2019t think that will change. They have zero interest in governing, but 100 percent interest in grandstanding, and making the president take the blame for their intransigence.Am I cynical? You bet I am. How can anyone not be after the last six years?To the Editor:As the writers point out, elections are expensive. This fact makes our representatives more dependent on raising funds and less focused on the independent thinking needed to resolve the issues of our day.To the Editor:Although we can debate the reasons, we cannot dispute the fact that President Obama is unpopular with the majority of Americans.A politics built on resentment of the successful, including derision of their effort (\u201cYou didn\u2019t build that\u201d), a politics pitting class against class, a politics of personal identity instead of time-honored American principle and tradition, a politics that veers into autocratic executive action in the flawed belief that ends justify means, may yield electoral victory when championed by a political pied piper, but ultimately debases the commonweal.This is the sour politics of bitterness, the corrosive politics of envy, the superficial politics of expedience. This is not optimism. There is no shining city on a hill at the end of this twisted trail but only a covetousness that demeans the founders\u2019 experiment.To the Editor:Ross Douthat misses a major point: President Obama\u2019s biggest problem is that he does not seem presidential. His leadership of the country, his party and his agenda is at best tepid at a time when strong, media-savvy leadership is called for. He also does not appear willing to engage in the necessary political fray that is Washington.The country wants a confident, larger-than-life figure in the presidency \u2014 a Teddy Roosevelt, an F.D.R., a Ronald Reagan \u2014 and Mr. Obama fails this critical test.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Really Tore Down This Wall? ", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetters To the Editor:It was a propitious time for revolt because the self-liberation of the Eastern bloc was in full swing, pioneered by the Solidarity movement in Poland and ultimately favored by the reformist instincts of the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.The victory was theirs, not ours, except for the renewed validation of our faith in freedom and our horror of surveillance by the Stasi, the East German secret police. It is indeed a moment to be remembered in all its greatness and present-day relevance. The writer is university professor emeritus at Columbia University. To the Editor:Mary Elise Sarotte diminishes the direct role that President Ronald Reagan played in bringing about this pivotal event. Reagan\u2019s demand that the Berlin Wall be torn down capped nearly a decade of efforts by him to force the Soviets into an arms race that would predictably implode the Soviet economy.Additionally, Reagan\u2019s unshakable conviction that the Soviet empire was an evil that must be eradicated, coupled with his genuine, collegial warmth for Michael S. Gorbachev, created an improbable historical moment that still confers a profound, if tarnished, benefit.To the Editor:Mary Elise Sarotte notes that many still leap to the simplistic conclusion that President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1987 speech at the Brandenburg Gate caused the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. She details how the East German government botched its announcement of reforms in travel restrictions, after which a Stasi officer allowed East German crowds through a checkpoint on Nov. 9, 1989.Ms. Sarotte\u2019s explanation of the fall of both the wall and the Soviet Union would be complete if she had added Pope John Paul II\u2019s 1979 visit to his Polish homeland supporting the nascent Solidarity movement and his homilies to thousands of Poles. The British historian Timothy Garton Ash summed it up: \u201cWithout the pope, no Solidarity. Without Solidarity, no Gorbachev. Without Gorbachev, no fall of Communism.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Falling Wages at Factories Squeeze the Middle Class", "Date": "2014-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor nearly 20 years, Darrell Eberhardt worked in an Ohio factory putting together wheelchairs, earning $18.50 an hour, enough to gain a toehold in the middle class and feel respected at work. He is still working with his hands, assembling seats for Chevrolet Cruze cars at the Camaco auto parts factory in Lorain, Ohio, but now he makes $10.50 an hour and is barely hanging on. \u201cI\u2019d like to earn more,\u201d said Mr. Eberhardt, who is 49 and went back to school a few years ago to earn an associate\u2019s degree. \u201cBut the chances of finding something like I used to have are slim to none.\u201dEven as the White House and leaders on Capitol Hill and in Fortune 500 boardrooms all agree that expanding the country\u2019s manufacturing base is a key to prosperity, evidence is growing that the pay of many blue-collar jobs is shrinking to the point where they can no longer support a middle-class life. Perhaps even more significant, while the typical production job in the manufacturing sector paid more than the private sector average in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, that relationship flipped in 2007, and line work in factories now pays less than the typical private sector job. That gap has been widening \u2014 in 2013, production jobs paid an average of $19.29 an hour, compared with $20.13 for all private sector positions.Pressured by temporary hiring practices and a sharp decrease in salaries in the auto parts sector, real wages for manufacturing workers fell by 4.4 percent from 2003 to 2013, NELP researchers found, nearly three times the decline for workers as a whole.Despite that widening gap, Washington still paints the manufacturing sector as a gateway to the middle class, even if the gate is closing.The White House earmarked $100 million in grants last month to encourage manufacturing innovation, part of President Obama\u2019s goal of adding one million American manufacturing jobs by the end of his second term.After losing more than six million factory jobs from 2000 to 2010, the sector has rebounded a bit in recent years, with more than 700,000 positions created since early 2010. A total of 12.2 million Americans work in manufacturing, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\u201cWhile they are rebounding in numbers, which is good news, they are not delivering on the wages front,\u201d said Catherine Ruckelshaus, general counsel and program director at NELP. She argued that if federal, state and local governments continued to promote manufacturing jobs with tax breaks and credits, employers should be encouraged to pay higher starting salaries and provide good benefits. \u201cIf you are getting a tax break or a subsidy, we should make sure those jobs are good jobs,\u201d Ms. Ruckelshaus said.Based in New York, NELP is a research and advocacy group for low-wage and unemployed workers. It receives some financial support from organized labor, including unions like the United Steelworkers and the United Food and Commercial Workers, as well as the A.F.L.-C.I.O. The data in the study were drawn mostly from government sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau, and independent experts confirm many of the trends NELP cites in the report.\u201cWe are not going to back to Detroit in the 1950s or Akron in the 1900s,\u201d said Lawrence Katz, a professor of economics at Harvard. \u201cThere still are many manufacturing jobs that are high-paying, but they tend to be more senior or require a lot more education than entry-level jobs do. And their numbers are shrinking, too.\u201d Even if it does not continue to be a mass employer or a ticket to the middle class, Mr. Katz said, manufacturing remains vital to the economy because it spurs innovation and leads to higher-paying, value-added jobs like design, marketing and other support services. It is also a major source of productivity gains, as well as a generator of profits and exports for American companies. But most of those gains are not going to the workers on the factory floor. One major factor in the downward pressure on overall manufacturing wages has been a particularly sharp fall in hourly pay earned by workers like Mr. Eberhardt who make parts that supply the big automakers. Parts workers make about one-third less than assembly-line workers who put together cars and trucks, but parts jobs account for 72 percent of all auto sector employment. From 2003 to 2013, median wages for parts workers fell to $15.83 an hour from $18.35.The auto industry in the United States, both parts makers and large auto companies like General Motors, have staged an impressive recovery since G.M. filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and required a federal bailout. Lower salaries and efficiency gains, along with less debt, have helped make Detroit more globally competitive.At the same time, one of the most important reasons for lower pay is the increased use of temporary workers. Some manufacturers have turned to staffing agencies for hiring rather than employing workers directly on their own payroll. For the first half of 2014, these agencies supplied one out of seven workers employed by auto parts manufacturers.The increased use of these lower-paid workers, particularly on the assembly line, not only eats into the number of industry jobs available, but also has a ripple effect on full-time, regular workers. Even veteran full-time auto parts workers who have managed to work their way up the assembly-line chain of command have eked out only modest gains. When Timothy Shelly first started working at the Faurecia Automotive Seating plant in Cleveland, Miss., he was earning $8 an hour. Nearly 10 years later, with a promotion that moved him up to managing three other workers, he earns $12.72, not much more than the rise in the cost of living over the same period. \u201cThe work is very strenuous. It\u2019ll wear you down,\u201d said Mr. Shelly, who loads 35-pound tubs of parts on pushcarts and then walks miles every day delivering them. Mr. Shelly can supplement his paychecks with overtime, which pays 50 percent more, but, he said, \u201cit\u2019s not easy at all to get those extra shifts.\u201d Instead, according to Mr. Shelly, his plant regularly uses a service to hire temp workers who are paid $7.50 an hour and do not receive health insurance or other benefits. In Ohio, Mr. Eberhardt, who works a 10 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. shift, is due for a raise of 50 cents an hour, having just completed his first year in the job. \u201cOnce in a while we get a Saturday or a Sunday shift, and that helps,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time and a half.\u201dvideovideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Spicy, Pricey Sport Sedan Alternative", "Date": "2014-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel12 PhotosLOS ANGELES \u2014 In the early 2000s, I took my first drive in the Cayenne, the new S.U.V. that Porsche said it needed to build but that Porsche purists hated with the heat of a thousand ghost peppers. The Cayenne Turbo was a very cool machine, combining legitimate off-road chops with serious hustle on the street. The lesser models, though, were a bit of a letdown.The first time I flattened the accelerator of the V8 Cayenne S, a pair of lookie-loos in the next lane easily kept pace in a front-wheel-drive Pontiac Grand Prix. The V6 Cayenne was genuinely slow, accelerating from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 9.1 seconds. In Germany, a nine-second 0-to-60 will get you laughed out of die kneipe and right onto ihr ges\u00e4ss. The 2015 Porsche Macan, the Cayenne\u2019s new, smaller sibling, will not have a problem outrunning 6-cylinder Pontiacs. Like the original Cayenne, the Macan is available in S and Turbo models. The difference is that all Macans have the power to uphold Porsche\u2019s good name. The slowest Macan will do 0 to 60 in 5.2 seconds, and the Turbo is as quick as a 911 Carrera. It\u2019s a feisty little crossover.The Macan model distinctions are a bit misleading. With previous Porsches, the Turbo models were turbocharged and the non-Turbos were not. This was logical. In the case of the Macan, the Turbo is turbocharged, and so is the S. While Porsche\u2019s \u201cTurbo\u201d mystique is special, turbochargers are no longer a big deal, and the Macan nomenclature reflects that reality. So the Macan S just shuts up about the twin turbos that help its 3-liter V6 generate 340 horsepower and 339 pound-feet of torque. The V6\u2019s output is routed through a drivetrain worthy of a sports car, with rear-biased all-wheel drive and Porsche\u2019s PDK 7-speed dual-clutch automated manual transmission. Some conventional automatics have narrowed the performance gap with dual-clutch systems, but the PDK is in a different league, delivering seamless power on upshifts and whip-crack, rev-matched downshifts. On Macans with the Sport Chrono Package, PDK also enables launch control starts at high engine speeds, which will really get some attention when you\u2019re leaving the drop-off lane at the charter school. The Macan\u2019s power delivery favors the rear wheels, but the all-wheel-drive system can send 100 percent of torque to the front if conditions warrant. This thing has no shortage of traction.It may look like a crossover, but the Macan definitely drives like a Porsche \u2014 solid, serious and fantastically quick. I didn\u2019t drive the Turbo, but with a 3.6-liter V6 and 400 horsepower, it seems like overkill in the finest Porsche Turbo tradition. Whether equipped with a V6 big or small, the Macan returns an E.P.A. economy rating of 17 miles per gallon in the city and 23 on the highway. Three suspension systems are available. The base model uses conventional steel springs and nonadjustable shock absorbers. The midlevel version pairs the steel springs with Porsche Active Suspension Management, or P.A.S.M., which provides adjustable damping. Finally, you can opt for an air suspension with P.A.S.M., which is the setup that I tested here on the cratered ribbon of canyon road known as Mulholland Drive. Up there, the Macan S was really the perfect weapon \u2014 small and nimble, but with plenty of ground clearance and, of course, power. Carving along the hillside, the exhaust barking out at each shift, the optional torque-vectoring rear end helping point the nose into corners, the Macan can fool you into thinking it\u2019s a really good sport sedan. Which is the point. This is really Porsche\u2019s BMW 3 Series competitor, garbed as an S.U.V. because that\u2019s what people want. Not that the Macan pushes the S.U.V. theme too hard. The only silly bit of pretense is the standard off-road mode, whose functions include raising the ground clearance by 1.58 inches \u2014 but only if you buy the optional air suspension. I predict that the Macan\u2019s off-road button will get pushed about as often as J. D. Salinger\u2019s doorbell. But it might be a little more useful than the button in the cargo area that lowers the rear end for loading, as if the Macan\u2019s rear bumper is but a cloud-shrouded outcrop somewhere in the misty heavens.The base Macan S starts at $50,895 and gets vastly more expensive depending on how deeply you wade into the sea of options. The car I drove cost nearly $70,000, and most of the padding came from packages that you\u2019d probably want, like the $2,590 Premium Package (including parking assist, backup camera, front and rear heated seats and other things) and the $1,290 Sport Chrono Package. Sport Chrono gives you a button you\u2019ll actually use \u2014 Sport Plus, which is the mode you want if you ever take your Macan to the Los Angeles canyons. Of course, the options list also included garnet red seatbelts for $500 and \u201cthermally and noise-insulating privacy glass\u201d for $990. (You\u2019ll want that so you can\u2019t hear what people are saying about your red seatbelts.) Porsche doesn\u2019t charge a cent for the badge-delete option, so you\u2019re not freighted with the horrible shame of an S on the back of your car instead of Turbo script. Procuring that Turbo badge will cost at least $73,295, which means that the base Macan Turbo starts around the price of a really well-equipped S and finishes in six figures. Porsche knows what it\u2019s doing. That\u2019s affirmed by the Macan\u2019s robust sales, which Porsche describes as \u201csupply limited.\u201d The Cayenne is the brand\u2019s best seller, so it makes sense that a smaller offshoot would find plenty of takers. With the Macan, Porsche proves that the Cayenne taught it a few lessons about how to approach a new market in the right way. On the continuum of compact luxury crossovers, the Macan is the fastest and the most expensive, which is as it should be for a Porsche. There will be no Macan that needs 9.1 seconds to hit 60 m.p.h. And Porsche fans will say \u201cGott sei Dank\u201d for that.Advertisement"}

The uneven character of the economic recovery added to a sense of anxiety, leaving voters in a punishing mood, particularly for Democrats in Southern states and the Mountain West, where political polarization deepened.Those contests were measures of how difficult the terrain was for Democrats in an election where Republicans put together their strategy as a referendum on the competence of government, embodied by Mr. Obama.With at least a nine-seat gain and most likely more, House Republicans will have close to 245 seats, the largest Republican majority since the Truman administration.\u201cBarack Obama has our country in a ditch, and many of his lieutenants running for the Senate were right there with him,\u201d said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee. \u201cThe punishment is going to be broad, and it\u2019s going to be pretty serious.\u201dThe breadth of the Republican victories also reset the political landscape ahead of the 2016 presidential campaign. And it left Mr. Obama with a decision to make: Will he move toward Republicans in his final years in areas of common interest, such as tax reform and trade, or will he dig in and hope Republican overreach will give his party a lane for a comeback?\u201cJust because we have a two-party system doesn\u2019t mean we have to be in perpetual conflict,\u201d vowed Mr. McConnell, in a victory speech.White House officials accepted the overture and said Mr. Obama had invited the bipartisan leadership of Congress to the White House on Friday.\u201cI think it\u2019s a message from the American people about their concern about the direction of the country, and the competency of the current administration,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, vice chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cMost people have voted to end the dysfunction and to get back to legislating on issues that will help them and their families, and I think that\u2019s something that both parties need to listen to.\u201dSupporters cheered for Joni Ernst, a Republican who was elected to the Senate, during an election night party in West Des Moines, Iowa.And in the panhandle of Florida, Gwen Graham, daughter of a former Democratic senator and governor, defeated Representative Steve Southerland, a Tea Party favorite.But those high notes were swamped by the lows for the president\u2019s party. In Arkansas, Representative Tom Cotton, a freshman Republican and an Iraq War veteran, defeated Senator Mark Pryor, despite the efforts of former President Bill Clinton.In Colorado, Mr. Udall tried to replicate the storied ground game that helped propel his Democratic colleague, Senator Michael Bennet, to an unexpected victory in 2010. He was not even close, and drew further criticism for running a campaign that some felt was too focused on abortion rights and contraception.And in West Virginia, Representative Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, won the Senate seat long held by Jay Rockefeller, a Democrat, to become that state\u2019s first female senator and the first Republican elected to the Senate from West Virginia since 1956. In Iowa, Joni Ernst also made history by becoming the first woman to be elected in that state\u2019s congressional delegation.Supporters cheered for Joni Ernst, a Republican who was elected to the Senate, during an election night party in West Des Moines, Iowa.Two years after handing Democrats broad victories, voters again seemed to be reaching for a way to end Washington inertia. Yet the results on Tuesday may serve only to reinforce it. Voters appeared unsure of just what they wanted, according to surveys. Among those who voted for a Democrat, only one out of eight expressed an unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party. Republican voters were more conflicted; among those who voted Republican, one of four viewed the party unfavorably.Mr. Obama is left with the prospect of finding a new path to work with Republicans, something for which he has shown little inclination, and Republicans must find a way to demonstrate they are more than the party of \u201cno.\u201dFor their part, Democrats were hindered by their inability to persuade members of the coalition that delivered the White House to Mr. Obama \u2014 young voters, women and minorities \u2014 to turn out at levels seen in presidential elections. Decisions like Mr. Obama\u2019s delay of executive action on behalf of illegal immigrants also angered crucial constituencies.Even the president conceded the steep climb his allies faced.\u201cThis is possibly the worst possible group of states for Democrats since Dwight Eisenhower,\u201d Mr. Obama told a Connecticut public radio station on Tuesday. \u201cThere are a lot of states that are being contested where they just tend to tilt Republican.\u201dDemocratic midterm losses during the Obama presidency now rival those of both Richard M. Nixon in 1974 and Bill Clinton in 1994 as the most destructive to his party\u2019s political standing in Congress in the post-World War II era. It was a stunning reversal for the president, who was the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to twice win a majority of the national vote.\u201cThe top issue is not jobs and the economy; it\u2019s ending gridlock in Washington,\u201d said Mr. Portman. \u201cSecond, there is a desire to hold the administration accountable for incompetence on issues like ISIS and Ebola. I don\u2019t think those goals are inconsistent.\u201dWith the political climate and the electoral map playing to their decided advantage, Republicans were determined not to relive the elections of 2010 and 2012, when infighting between establishment Republicans and Tea Party insurgents damaged the party\u2019s brand and elevated candidates who could not win.From the beginning, party officials decided to take sides when fierce primary challenges emerged. The party establishment crushed challengers to Mr. McConnell in Kentucky, and to Senators Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and Lamar Alexander in Tennessee.The establishment also sent reinforcements to help Senator Thad Cochran eke out a runoff victory against a Tea Party firebrand in Mississippi; cleared the Republican field for Mr. Gardner in Colorado; and backed winning primary candidates in Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire and Alaska.Democrats tried to distance themselves from the president\u2019s health care law and economic policies, despite signs that both may be working. In Colorado, Mr. Udall relied on the playbook that propelled his Colorado colleague and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chairman, Senator Michael Bennet, to victory in 2010, speaking almost exclusively about abortion rights and contraception. That cost him the endorsement of The Denver Post, which castigated him for an \u201cobnoxious, one-issue campaign.\u201dLost was Mr. Udall\u2019s work in the Senate opposing Mr. Obama\u2019s policies on security surveillance and privacy.In Kentucky, Alison Lundergan Grimes, considered a strong challenger to Mr. McConnell, lost some support when she refused to say whether she voted for Mr. Obama, and ran a risk-averse campaign.But mainly, Democrats were working off a map heavily tilted toward Republicans in states like West Virginia, South Dakota, Montana, Arkansas and Alaska, in a year when disengaged, frustrated voters and Mr. Obama\u2019s low approval ratings were inevitably going to be a millstone.An earlier version of a slide show that appeared with this article on the home page and politics section of NYTimes.com misstated the office of Jeanne Shaheen. She is in the Senate, not the House. An earlier version of this article also misstated the location of a town where one woman voted. It was Salem, N.H., not Salem, Mass.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Delusions of the Democrats", "Date": "2014-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionDEMOGRAPHICS is not enough.For years now, it\u2019s been an article of faith among Democrats that the future belongs to them, thanks to the country\u2019s changing demographic mix. The rising percentage of voters who are women, Americans of color and especially Latinos were always about to turn the country deep \u201cblue.\u201d I never believed this \u2014 largely because I have been hearing it since 1971. That was the year the 26th Amendment passed, lowering the voting age to 18. Democrats had already been the dominant political party since the 1930s, and now with young people getting the vote, a permanent Democratic majority was guaranteed, right?The future failed to arrive on time again this fall. Democrats lost all over America, and they lost big, by much wider margins than predicted. They lost statewide races in the Midwest where Democrats have won repeatedly in presidential elections for more than 20 years. They lost in races against radical right-wing Republicans they might have been expected to defeat, like Sam Brownback in Kansas and Paul R. LePage in Maine.Nor was this month\u2019s election an anomaly. It was the third disastrous midterm for Democrats in the past 20 years. The party suffered similar or even worse losses at all levels of government in 1994 and 2010, along with a lesser catastrophe in 2002. It now holds fewer elected offices at both the federal and state level than it has at any time since the 1920s. Democratic tacticians maintain that things will be different in 2016, when their base will go to the polls in greater numbers, and when demographics \u2014 again \u2014 will render the country less white, more Latin and more female. They blame this latest meltdown on terrible candidates, administration flubs and foreign crises. They argue that voters favored Democratic positions in state referendums, from a higher minimum wage to abortion rights and legal marijuana. In other words: \u201cProblem, what problem? We Democrats are in great shape, if only we could turn out our base, find good candidates, deal with crises efficiently or get people to vote our way even when they agree with us.\u201dThe accepted wisdom is that the Democrats hamstrung themselves many years ago, when they passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and thereby lost the Solid South forever. It\u2019s a nice story, one that allows everyone to feel good: liberal Democrats, who would like to believe their party was martyred in as noble a cause as there could be, and Clinton-Obama Democrats, who have long cited it as proof that the party needs to move to the right and start appealing to conservative Southern whites again. The only trouble is, it\u2019s not true.Yes, the South was never \u201csolid\u201d for Democrats again after 1964, and the party lost five of six presidential elections from 1968 to 1988. But at every other level of government, Democrats remained highly competitive, even dominant, in the South for years to come.Going into the 1994 elections, Democrats still held 16 of the 30 United States Senate seats from the 15 Southern states (which I define as the 11 states of the Confederacy, plus Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri and West Virginia), and nearly two-thirds of the Southern seats in the House. On a state level, the figures were even more one-sided. Democrats held 12 of the 15 Southern governorships, and 29 of the 30 state legislative chambers.It\u2019s only in the last two decades that these numbers flipped. In the next Congress, fewer than a third of the South\u2019s representatives will be Democrats; if Mary Landrieu loses her seat in Louisiana, there will be seven Democratic senators in the region. Democrats there will hold four governorships and both chambers in just one legislature.Democrats did lose the South, but they didn\u2019t lose it because of the Civil Rights Act. Instead of waiting for all those mean old Southern white men to die, Democrats might be better off asking themselves why so many of them were still voting Democratic just 22 years ago.Nor have Democratic losses in the South been much worse than they were all over the country. To give just one egregious example, Democrats lost the Massachusetts statehouse this year \u2014 for the fifth time in their last seven tries.This is a historic shift. From 1931 to 1995, Democrats held majorities in the House of Representatives for all but four years and in the Senate for all but 12. On the state level, they held their own with (or outnumbered) Republicans in governorships and state legislatures for the vast majority of those 64 years.It\u2019s been a completely different story since 1994, however, and by next January, Democrats will not only be in the minority in both houses of Congress. They will likely hold 18 statehouses and both chambers in only 11 state legislatures.Suffering a series of historic defeats is not a sign that you\u2019re winning. The Democrats no longer please anyone much, neither their depressed base nor the less committed. Meanwhile, Republicans still manage to portray them as wild-eyed socialists. The party does take the White House more often now, but at the state level, and in the midterms, when a third of the senators and all representatives are up for election, the party has been hollowed out. THE trouble was that the Clinton-Obama strategy got things upside down from the start. Why try to cast yourselves as economic moderates and cultural progressives when the disparate elements of your coalition have little in common culturally, but are all struggling with the same wretched economy?The Democratic Party that shot to some 50 years of overwhelming electoral success beginning in the 1930s was helped in part by changing demographics. But many of those who built what George Packer calls \u201cthe Roosevelt Republic\u201d started out as Republicans. Or \u201cBull Moose\u201d Progressives, or Populists, or Socialists, or Communists, or simply the politically alienated and disengaged. The people who built that party rallied around big things \u2014 and usually big things they had come up with themselves. The reforms that Democrats embraced were almost all culled from grass-roots movements, and they were big enough to erase the lines between cultural and economic issues. Electrifying large swaths of the South and West changed how people lived and worked every day, how their cities grew and their farms survived. The G.I. Bill, to take another of a thousand examples, was intended to reward veterans and stave off a postwar depression, but it also opened up new possibilities of learning and travel (and therefore work) for millions of young men. This blurring of the cultural and the economic includes the civil rights legislation of the 1960s, which threw the weight of the federal government behind the struggle of African-Americans to go about their daily lives with hope and dignity and which did not alienate every white person in the South. Today\u2019s Democratic Party, with its finely calibrated, top-down fixes, does not offer anything so transformative. It seems scared of its own shadow, which is probably why it keeps reassuring itself that its triumph is inevitable. It needs instead to fully acknowledge just how devastating the recession was for working people everywhere in America, and what a generation of largely flat wages did to their aspirations even before that. It needs to take on hard fights, even against powerful forces, like pharmaceutical and insurance companies that presume to tell us the limits of what our health care can be or energy companies that would tell us what the world\u2019s climate can endure. It means carving out a place of respect for working men and women in our globalized, finance-driven world.Invite us to dream a little. You don\u2019t build an enduring coalition out of who Americans are. You do it out of what we can be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Oklahoma Oilman\u2019s Billion-Dollar Divorce ", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring his nearly 50 years as an Oklahoma oil man, Harold Hamm has done everything on a huge scale. The chief executive and majority shareholder of Continental Resources, he owns the largest piece of the greatest oil discovery of our age, in the shale-rich plains of North Dakota. His net worth has been pegged at more than $18 billion by Forbes, making him the 24th richest man in the country.Now another superlative can be added to Mr. Hamm\u2019s outsize career: He is paying one of the biggest divorce settlements in history.After a secretive, nine-week trial, a judge in Oklahoma City has ruled that the 68-year-old Mr. Hamm must pay nearly $1 billion to his ex-wife, Sue Ann Hamm. With the bang of a gavel, Ms. Hamm has joined the ranks of the wealthiest women in the United States.Or rather, she will join those ranks over time. The judgment requires Mr. Hamm to pay his ex-wife about $320 million, or one-third of the total settlement, by the end of 2014. The rest is to be paid in chunks of at least $7 million a month. For a little perspective, that figure is slightly larger than last year\u2019s salary of the chief executive of U.S. Steel.The settlement looks economy-class compared with the $4.8 billion that was awarded to the ex-wife fo the Russian oligarch and \u201cfertilizer king\u201d Dmitry Rybolovlev was awarded this year. But the payment is large enough that the presiding judge in the case, Howard Haralson, placed a lien on 20 million shares \u2014 or more than $ 1 billion \u2014 of Mr. Hamm\u2019s Continental stock.Mr. Hamm, who has described himself as \u201cmore hardheaded than other people,\u201d did not have a particular document that is all but standard now whenever tycoons wed: a prenuptial agreement. Barring future fiascos, this will surely stand as the costliest decision of Mr. Hamm\u2019s life. He has already paid his ex-wife roughly $25 million since the case was filed in 2012, the ruling stated.Messages left with Continental Resources and with a lawyer for Ms. Hamm were not returned.Harold Hamm was just another middle-age multimillionaire when he married Sue Ann Hamm, his second wife and a woman a decade his junior, in 1988. At the time, Ms. Hamm was a lawyer at Continental and Mr. Hamm was just beginning to snap up roughly one million acres of land leases in North Dakota, Montana and parts of Canada in what is the Bakken formation.The Bakken turned out to be a rich underground trove. The question at the center of the divorce trial was what exactly led Mr. Hamm to it and his epochal fortune \u2014 expertise or dumb luck?Under Oklahoma law, the answer matters. The money a spouse earns while married can be part of a divorce settlement if it is made through skill. If, on the other hand, the increase is attributable to \u201cchanging economic conditions, or circumstances beyond the parties\u2019 control,\u201d as the state\u2019s Supreme Court put it in a 1995 case, then that money is off the table.The law put Mr. Hamm and his lawyers in an odd spot. They had to argue that one of the country\u2019s singular entrepreneurs, an up-from-nothing wildcatter, had essentially stumbled into his billions. This seemed like a tough sell. Mr. Hamm was once quoted as saying that \u201cMy biggest advantage is that I was born with no advantage.\u201dAs Mr. Hamm sought to poor-mouth his prowess, his company followed suit. Continental\u2019s proxy filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for years have praised Mr. Hamm for \u201chis leadership and business judgment.\u201d Not anymore. As Reuters wrote in September, that phrase was excised in the company\u2019s most recent proxy, along with a reference to Mr. Hamm as \u201cone of the driving forces\u201d behind Continental.Judge Haralson did not seem to buy this just-lucky account of Mr. Hamm\u2019s accomplishments. In arriving at the settlement terms, the judge cited Mr. Hamm\u2019s \u201cskills and efforts\u201d and said his leadership spurred an \u201cincrease in value for Continental.\u201d He also called Mr. Hamm \u201can expert in the oil field service business\u201d and even after this ruling, Mr. Hamm remains one of the richest. As a fraction of his net worth, the settlement leaves him with many billions to spare.Aside from the final judgment, little of the proceedings have been public. All but three days of the trial were held in a room at the Oklahoma City county courthouse with a handmade \u201cDo Not Enter\u201d sign attached to the door. Most of the voluminous filings in the case were placed under seal by the judge, who ruled in early August that \u201cconfidential financial information\u201d about Continental could be revealed in the proceedings that might harm the company.But enough about the case has come to light to make clear that it did not stint on drama. In a 2013 filing, Ms. Hamm accused her husband of infidelity, and seven years ago \u2014 after she had moved out of their home and to a different city \u2014 she began documenting his extramarital behavior on audio and video tapes. Lawyers for Mr. Hamm would later demand those tapes as a way to prove that the two hadn\u2019t lived as husband and wife for a long time.Filings by Mr. Hamm\u2019s lawyers stated that the union had been loveless for more than a decade, a \u201cmarriage in name only.\u201d Ms. Hamm\u2019s lawyers retorted in a filing of their own that \u201cnothing under Oklahoma law suggests that a loveless marriage does not qualify as a marriage for the purposes of property division issues.\u201dHarold Hamm is paying one of the biggest divorce settlements in history.The settlement is a rare setback for a man accustomed to success on his own terms. Mr. Hamm is the 13th and youngest child of sharecroppers and he moved with his parents from job to job as a child. \u201cWe went wherever the cotton was good,\u201d he told National Review last year.His interest in the oil business started when he was a teenager, living in Enid, Okla., with a job at truck stop called the Potter Oil Company. In 1967, he parlayed the proceeds from his truck hauling business into a tiny oil drilling company, and struck a 75-barrel-an-hour gusher on his second try.When he turned his attention to the Bakken formation, in the mid-'80s, other companies had already tapped into it and moved on. Mr. Hamm thought that was a mistake, and fracking and horizontal drilling would prove him right.His hunches and persistence led not just to a vast windfall, but notoriety. He was named one of Time magazine\u2019s 100 most influential people in the world in 2012. He and Sue Ann Hamm were photographed at a gala celebrating the occasion at Jazz at Lincoln Center. Mitt Romney, during his run for president, named Mr. Hamm his chief energy adviser.Mr. Hamm has two adult daughters with Sue Ann Hamm, Jane and Hillary. His first marriage, to Judith Ann Hamm, ended when she accused him of having an affair with Sue Ann.Much of the judge\u2019s ruling is given over to a lengthy inventory of the Hamm\u2019s considerable holdings, which include a $17.4 million ranch in Carmel Valley, Calif., a $4.6 million home in Nichols Hills, Okla., as well as homes in Enid and Branson, Mo. There is also a hangar at an airport and shares of an assortment of companies, many of them worth multiple millions. Then there is Orbit Gas Storage, which was given a \u201cvalue of zero\u201d in the ruling.Mr. Hamm was granted that apparently worthless entity by the judge, who painstakingly divvied up everything else. He awarded livestock, farm equipment and home furnishings from the California ranch to Ms. Hamm, but gave Mr. Hamm two horses, Star and Uno. The judge even addressed a last-minute request from Mr. Hamm for \u201ccertain family pictures, a few books, guns, shotguns, some pictures, geode in quartz display, and his hand tools\u201d in the Nichols Hill residence. Mr. Hamm was awarded all of it, with one exception.\u201cRespondent\u2019s request for the geode in quartz display,\u201d the judge wrote, without explanation, \u201cis denied.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about a judge\u2019s ruling that will require Harold Hamm, the chief executive of Continental Resources, to pay nearly $1 billion to a former wife, Sue Ann, in a divorce settlement misstated the status of another large divorce judgment involving the Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev. While Mr. Rybolovlev\u2019s ex-wife, Elena, was awarded $4.8 billion in the divorce, that amount has not yet been paid to her.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economic Activity Slows in Eurozone, Survey Shows", "Date": "2014-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 More gloomy economic data for the eurozone arrived on Thursday, with activity dropping to a 16-month low as France weakened further and manufacturing slowed in Germany, a private sector survey showed.The poor showing keeps the pressure on the European Central Bank, the eurozone\u2019s last resort for growth when the bloc\u2019s political leaders have sworn off expansionary fiscal policies. With companies reluctant to invest, governments trying to hold the line on spending, and the jobless rate at 11.5 percent, few expect demand to bounce back soon.Perhaps most worryingly, a separate Markit survey focused on German factories suggested that Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, continues to struggle.The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of blue chips for the eurozone, closed down 0.7 percent on Thursday.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said in a news release that the French economy \u201cremains a key concern,\u201d while Germany has \u201cslowed to the weakest since the summer of last year, with demand stagnating.\u201dMr. Williamson said the latest statistics were consistent with quarterly gross domestic product growth of 0.2 percent, at best, in the last three months of the year, the same as in the third quarter.\u201cThe deteriorating trend in the surveys will add to pressure for the E.C.B. to do more to boost the economy without waiting to gauge the effectiveness of previously announced initiatives,\u201d he said.A German slowdown \u201cwould be bad news for the rest of the eurozone, given that Germany has been in a stagnation for already two quarters in a row,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING in Frankfurt, said in a research note.But Mr. Brzeski cautioned against reading too much into the report, saying that the country\u2019s \u201cstrong labor market, lower energy prices, solid private consumption and a recovery of foreign demand on the back of a weaker euro should support the economy in the final quarter of the year.\u201dThe eurozone expansion in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, which was equivalent to just a 0.6 percent annualized G.D.P. growth rate, contrasts with the United States economy, which grew at a 3.5 percent pace in the third quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Have Already Won a Governor\u2019s Race Today, in Guam", "Date": "2014-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMidterm CalculusEven before noon on the East Coast, Republicans notched a governor\u2019s race victory on Tuesday: in Guam, where Gov. Eddie Calvo was re-elected in a landslide. In the nearby Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Gov. Eloy Inos, also a Republican incumbent, leads with most of the votes counted but is likely to face a runoff.These Pacific island territories are so far east that they are 15 hours ahead of New York, which is why their results come in so early.Mr. Calvo won 64 percent of the vote, defeating Carl Gutierrez, a Democrat he only narrowly beat four years ago. But his landslide win does not appear to have translated into a Republican takeover of Guam\u2019s legislature; current results show a narrow lead for Democrats.Guam, which has 165,000 residents \u2014 about three times the population of the Northern Marianas \u2014 is the territorial equivalent of a swing state. Every four years since 1984, it has included a straw vote for president on its general election ballots; every time, Guam residents have chosen the same candidate who won the election nationally. Local politics in Guam are closely divided between Republicans and Democrats. Mr. Calvo was first elected governor in 2010 with 50.6 percent of the vote; the unicameral legislature had a 9-6 Democratic majority going into today\u2019s election.But while Guam\u2019s party divide mimics the country\u2019s, its ideological divide does not. Over half of Guam\u2019s G.D.P. is public expenditure, and both Republicans and Democrats in the territory embrace an active role for government. In a debate last week, Mr. Calvo spoke enthusiastically about his administration\u2019s work building homeless shelters and affordable housing. He has made no move to privatize the territory\u2019s public hospital or utility companies.\u201cTraditionally, candidates for office on Guam run on personal characteristics such as charisma, family background, trust, perceived helpfulness to ordinary citizens, and how much money they can cajole from Washington,\u201d according to Michael Stoil, a professor of political science at the University of Guam.Political affiliations in Guam are heavily driven by family affiliations. Mr. Calvo comes from a prominent Republican family that owns many business interests on the island; he ran the family\u2019s Pepsi bottling plant before getting into politics. Mr. Gutierrez, the Democratic candidate, ran television ads featuring an endorsement from a former Republican first lady, whose cousin happened to be his running mate.But Mr. Stoil argued that Mr. Calvo, who \u201cadmittedly has little charisma,\u201d represents a shift in Guam\u2019s politics. His campaigns have had a heavy emphasis on policy, and particularly on fixing the territory\u2019s messy public finances. His campaign themes were similar to ones you often hear from Republican candidates in blue states or large, left-leaning cities: not so much about shrinking government as about making it more efficient and rooting out patronage.For example, Mr. Calvo noted in last week\u2019s debate that under his administration, Guam\u2019s main public hospital has fewer total employees, but more doctors. \u201cI don\u2019t know who he was hiring at the hospital back then,\u201d he said of Mr. Gutierrez, who served as governor in the 1990s and early 2000s. Mr. Calvo has set a policy of hiring only government employees with at least a high school diploma, which Mr. Gutierrez has attacked as discriminatory.These victories don\u2019t say much about what will happen on the mainland. But Mr. Calvo\u2019s ability to meet an electorate halfway on ideology and work productively with an opposite-party legislature might provide lessons for candidates in both parties, especially given the economic and fiscal difficulties that exist in Guam.The territory has suffered nearly two decades of economic stagnation, dating from the Asian economic crisis that started in 1997. Guam\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on tourism, mostly from Japan, and Japan\u2019s economic troubles have been contagious. Real per-capita gross domestic product in Guam was lower in 2012 (the most recent year for which data are available) than it was in 2005.There are bright spots in Guam\u2019s economy, including a soon-to-open resort that will be the island\u2019s first new hotel in 15 years. The military is shifting resources to Guam from Okinawa, which will create local jobs. Mr. Calvo\u2019s campaign slogan was \u201cThe Right Direction,\u201d and voters apparently agreed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Formula One\u2019s Elusive American Dream", "Date": "2014-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: U.S. Grand PrixFormula One and the United States have had a long, uncertain relationship. No other country on the series\u2019s calendar has been so often, so warmly, so desperately and, occasionally, so foolishly courted by the sport. And while the race this weekend in Texas will be the third straight U.S. Grand Prix in Austin and the 43rd Formula One race in the country since 1959, the United States has yet to be won over by the world\u2019s premier global auto racing series.If several recent events are any indication, that long tale of unrequited love looks set to continue this weekend. In what could be perceived as a slight, two teams have opted out of the U.S. race \u2014 for financial reasons \u2014 which means there will be only 18 cars lining up on the grid for the first time in a Grand Prix since 2005 in Monaco. And one of those teams \u2014 Marussia \u2014 had been set to run an American driver, Alexander Rossi, who would have been the first American racer in Formula One since Scott Speed in 2007.And yet, on paper, Formula One\u2019s recipe for success in a given country could not be simpler: Provide a first-class race at a world-class track and make sure that a local driver at least participates, preferably in a top team, and, even better, that he is a race and title winner. A local team is another ingredient that can help, but that doesn\u2019t beat a winning driver.This equation was never better achieved in recent years than by Michael Schumacher of Germany and Fernando Alonso of Spain, who both helped turn their previously uninterested countries into leading Formula One nations. But back-of-the-grid drivers from India, Malaysia, Portugal and other countries never did much to flame the local passions.For the moment, U.S. organizers have fulfilled their part of the recipe, creating the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, the first purpose-built track, and possibly the best-ever Formula One venue, in the country. U.S. Grands Prix have been held in more different locations than in any other country \u2014 there have been U.S. races in 10 different places in the 60-year history of the series \u2014 and the Austin circuit is an indication of the efforts made to win over the American public.The track was built on an 890-acre, or 360-hectare, site southeast of the city. It has been universally praised by fans and drivers alike.Toto Wolff, the head of the Mercedes team, called the U.S. race \u201ca weekend the whole paddock looks forward to and an important event in terms of bringing Formula One to the United States.\u201d\u201cThe U.S. is the biggest consumer market in the world and the largest global market for Mercedes-Benz,\u201d he added. \u201cThanks to the race in Austin, we can see that the U.S. is playing a bigger role in our sport, too, with greater interest and investment at many levels. F1 has a passionate fan base in the U.S.A., which we can see growing all the time. The crowds at the first two races in Austin were absolutely mega, which is very encouraging for the future.\u201dOr is it? The most popular American sports tend to be insular affairs, and it is not only Formula One that has failed to break the hold on the American public that baseball, basketball, football and hockey enjoy. Those sports feature what are for the most part U.S.-based teams filled with mostly American players whose regular competition generally takes place only in the United States and, in some cases, Canada.Formula One, meanwhile, has also found it difficult to break into the U.S. market because there is already a widely popular homegrown racing series, Nascar.But Nascar may end up being a key link to Formula One\u2019s breakthrough in the United States. An American team is in the works, owned by Gene Haas, whose Nascar team, Stewart-Haas Racing, is familiar to U.S. fans.\u201cThis is very important because of the image and recognition of the Haas team throughout U.S. auto sport and what it has achieved,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so in this way, the new American team brings a history with it that a large part of the racing public is familiar with. So they get to see that team go into Formula One and they have a team that they can already identify with entering the series.\u201dNonetheless, Formula One\u2019s popularity has been growing in the United States, and the genius of the Austin event is part of the reason.\u201cIt has planted its flag in America, and it\u2019s not a repurposed flag, it\u2019s a purposed flag in the form of a Formula One track that has been designed with that sport in mind, and as a home for F1 in American,\u201d said Peter Habicht, the founder of the San Francisco Formula One Group, with nearly 700 members the largest group of American and U.S.-based Formula One fans.\u201cIt definitely made it a lot more relevant,\u201d he added. \u201cThe U.S. Grand Prix has always had a time element to it, but now it has a time and a place. Now it\u2019s \u2018Are you going to Austin?\u2019 It has solidified things in people\u2019s minds, anchored the event in people\u2019s mind.\u201dHe added that there are now Formula One fan organizations popping up around the country, in New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, Miami and elsewhere.Matt Cadieux, an American who is the head of information technology at the Red Bull team, also said that he thinks the new circuit has helped increase attention for the series in the United States.\u201cF1 is not that popular, but the interest is growing and I think people are genuinely interested,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last two years I\u2019ve gone, I\u2019ve been asked a lot of questions and seen a lot of people who have become fans.\u201dHe said the Austin circuit facilities are among the best in the world in areas that really count, such as the layout and the quality of the infrastructure.\u201cI think the undulating nature of the track is really interesting and from an IT point of view, which is my job, it\u2019s very technically advanced,\u201d he said. \u201cThe networking infrastructure and cabling is the best in the world from a technical perspective. It\u2019s a new track and people invested to do the job properly.\u201dThe local promoter and the city of Austin have done more than just about any other Grand Prix venue to offer a vibrant Formula One weekend, and after two years of success, they are continuing to learn and develop the offering. Their new marketing theme this year is the Wild West, with the slogan, \u201cHow the West was Formula One.\u201d\u201cWhat I hear from Formula One is that this is one of the best-loved events already, right up there with events like Australia, Monaco,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cAnd the reason is because we put on a good show, we have a good infrastructure, a great track, and people love Austin.\u201dThe circuit is not yet making money, though, and there have been complaints from local residents about it being partly funded by local government money.But on Tuesday the organizers released the results of a survey done over the last year focusing on the amount of money that the circuit has helped inject into the local economy. The report, performed by Greyhill Advisors, said that from October 2013 to the end of September this year, the circuit and its activities injected $897 million into the local economy. Of this, last year\u2019s Formula One race brought in $507 million, compared to $161 million from ESPN\u2019s X-Games, which the circuit also hosted.\u201cThere are those who would like to see us fail,\u201d Epstein said. And although he did not specify whom that might be, his tone suggested that they were likely to be let down.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kakha Bendukidze Dies at 58; Pushed Post-Soviet Market Change", "Date": "2014-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKakha Bendukidze, a biologist who became a wealthy businessman in the final years of the Soviet Union and, later, an architect of sweeping economic and governmental changes as a senior official in his native Georgia, died Thursday in London. He was 58. The apparent cause was heart failure, his sister, Nunu Bendukidze, said through a spokeswoman. He had recently undergone minor heart surgery. Mr. Bendukidze (pronounced ben-du-KEED-zeh) considered Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, to be his home, though in recent months he had spent time in Kiev, Ukraine, as an adviser to President Petro O. Poroshenko. At the time of his death, he had been expected to accept an official government position there. A big man in both physical stature and force of personality, Mr. Bendukidze crusaded for market changes and economic modernization in Russia before he left the country in 2004; in Georgia, where he was economics minister; , and throughout the former Soviet Union. As economics minister, Mr. Bendukidze led efforts to cut tax rates and eliminate many regulations in an aggressive restructuring. The measures were at the center of a broader push to overhaul the Georgian government, which had been mired in post-Soviet dysfunction and corruption for more than a decade. Though President Mikheil Saakashvili\u2019s administration was later criticized as heavy-handed, particularly in law enforcement, its efforts to modernize Georgia\u2019s economy and revamp its government were praised, especially in the West, and became a model for other countries, even Russia. Mr. Bendukidze signaled his unconventional approach when he promised to eliminate even his own ministry of economic development; a normal country with a functioning market economy, he said, should not need one. Although the ministry was retained, it was renamed the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development in 2010. Mr. Bendukidze was born on April 20, 1956, in Tbilisi, which was then part of the Soviet Union. His father, Avtandil, was a professor of mathematics at Tbilisi State University. His mother, Julietta Rukhadze, was a historian and ethnographer. He earned degrees in biology from Tbilisi State in 1977 and from Moscow State University in 1980. In Moscow, he began his career as a laboratory biologist. In 1987, in the wake of Mikhail S. Gorbachev\u2019s economic liberalization efforts, Mr. Bendukidze started his own business, Bioprocess, which manufactured biochemicals for scientific research. When the Soviet Union began privatizing state enterprises, Mr. Bendukidze vastly expanded his holdings, which ultimately included Uralmash, the country\u2019s signature heavy machinery factory, and numerous other businesses in machine building, energy and chemical industries, under the umbrella of a holding company, OMZ.His involvement in public policy began in Russia. In 1992, he formed the Entrepreneurial Political Initiative-92 with Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, who would later be jailed and whose oil company, Yukos, would be seized by the Russian government. Mr. Bendukidze soon became known as one of Russia\u2019s leading libertarians. He led a working group on tax and currency within the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and pressed for changes in tax policy, which ultimately included adoption of a flat 13 percent tax rate. Later, as economics minister in Georgia, he helped impose a similar 12 percent flat rate. In Russia, he was a strong opponent of government intervention in the economy, a view that put him at odds with President Vladimir V. Putin. Afraid his businesses, like Mr. Khodorkovsky\u2019s, would become a Kremlin target, Mr. Bendukidze sold his stake and moved back to Georgia. He was economics minister from June 2004 to January 2008 and then the chief administrator of the government for more than a year. In both positions, he was a fierce advocate of deregulation and privatization. Critics accused him of seeking to sell off national assets, including ports and railroads. He created a charity called the Knowledge Foundation, and he was the force behind the establishment of the Free University of Tbilisi and the Agricultural University of Georgia.In addition to his sister, he is survived by his wife, Nataliya Zolotova. This year, he took an active role in helping the new government of Ukraine, amid its violent confrontation with Russia. In an interview in September, Mr. Bendukidze was excited about his work in Kiev, but also cutting in his criticism of Ukraine and cautious about its chances. \u201cUkraine is one of the most unreformed economies in the post-Soviet space,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need a lot of bold reforms.\u201d Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Prices Are Plunging. Here\u2019s Who Wins and Who Loses.", "Date": "2014-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrize CommodityWhile Americans were stuffing their faces with poultry Thursday, global oil markets were in chaos. And the implications are far-reaching.In other words, even amid a sluggish global economy and a boom in oil production in the United States, oil-producing countries from Saudi Arabia to Nigeria to Venezuela are going to keep pumping rather than pull back on output in hopes of pumping prices back up.The latest decline pushes oil prices in the United States under $70 a barrel; the prices were more than $100 for almost all of July. And the latest OPEC move (or non-move, as it were) suggests that it isn\u2019t going to reverse course anytime soon.Indeed, the falling price of oil looks likely to be one of the dominant forces shaping the global economy in 2015. Here is an early guide to the winners and losers. The list is hardly exhaustive \u2014 though perhaps no list would be, given the unpredictable ripples caused by swings in the price of the world\u2019s most economically important commodity.This is, in effect, a global supply shock, the reverse of what happened with energy in the 1970s (or, to a smaller degree, the mid-2000s) when petroleum shortages and embargoes led to a sharp rise in prices. It may not last forever, but for now consumers in the United States and beyond will be winners.The falling commodity prices are actually making these authorities\u2019 jobs harder. The overwhelming urgency across the advanced world \u2014 in the eurozone, the United States and Japan \u2014 has been to try to get inflation higher, to reach the 2 percent annual target central banks in all three places have set.In the short run, central banks tend to look through big swings in commodity prices, viewing them as one-time events rather than permanent shifts in the rate of price increases. But to the degree those one-time shifts change peoples\u2019 expectations about future inflation, and lead people to doubt the credibility of the central banks\u2019 promises to keep inflation at 2 percent, it is a problem. That\u2019s particularly true when inflation expectations are already below where the likes of Mario Draghi, Janet Yellen and Haruhiko Kuroda would prefer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeing the Whole of Antigua", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAntigua lets you in slowly. It reveals itself cautiously, at its own unhurried pace. You\u2019ll miss it if you turn away too quickly.I saw what many people see when I awoke the first morning of my trip there this summer. The pale light of dawn was seeping into my room, and the tiny yellow and black birds flapped their wings as they made their way through the thick grove of palm fronds, bougainvillea and banana trees outside my balcony. Then came the swish of the gardener\u2019s broom on the paths below and the steady roll of the sea a few yards away. Not much later, I was trudging on sole-burning sand and standing at the cool water\u2019s edge, squinting at the blazing sun.This is what draws thousands of visitors to Antigua year after year \u2014 the sybaritic resorts and the 365 brilliant, largely pristine beaches, sheltered bays, harbors and coves. The island, a 9-by-12-mile speck of hills with a jagged coastline, claims famous residents and visitors (Eric Clapton has a home here, Oprah visits), multimillionaire manors like the Mellon estate at the exclusive Mill Reef Club, and a world-class sailing regatta at English Harbour, home of the 18th-century British Navy station named after Horatio Nelson.Caribbean connoisseurs can tell the difference between Antigua (pronounced An-TEE-gah) and Anguilla, St. Lucia and St. Barts, but many tourists who only want an island getaway fly in, drive from airport to hotel, visit a few historic sites and socialize mainly with fellow like-minded guests.Dig a little deeper, though, and you\u2019ll find more.\u201cAntigua is two worlds. On one side there\u2019s all this \u2014 sandy beaches and blue seas \u2014 and on the other, the buried history,\u201d Reginald Murphy, the island\u2019s pre-eminent archaeologist, said one day over a soft drink at an outdoor table at the Siboney Beach Club, the small resort where I was staying. \u201cThere\u2019s a dark side.\u201dMr. Murphy has spent his days deep in the dark history, overseeing excavations in English Harbour and Betty\u2019s Hope, a major sugar plantation, and the discovery of human skeletons \u2014 believed to be the remains of young British sailors dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries \u2014 at Galleon Beach several years ago.They are a reminder of the lesser-known narrative of the island, a onetime colonial hub of sugar and slavery. Like many of its Caribbean neighbors, it has changed hands repeatedly: the Siboney, Arawaks and the Caribs saw their island seized by the Spanish, then the British, who brought along African slaves. They were emancipated in 1834, and eventually, in 1981, Antigua became independent. What remains is a population estimated at 91,295 \u2014 91 percent black, 4.4 percent mixed race and 1.7 percent white, who work in light industries, including tourism, which draws about 250,000 people a year.While Mr. Murphy and I spoke about this, I took in the placid mood and surroundings of the Siboney. Flowers and palms were flourishing despite Antigua\u2019s perennial drought; the front desk was staffed with sharp, jovial women; an old woman in a floppy hat sold T-shirts and beachwear under a coconut tree; a middle-aged couple ventured into the water under the bristling midday sun; a guest slept on a lounge chair in the shade, cooled by the sea breeze.It was a contrast to the history Mr. Murphy had been telling me. Once you know that the other Antigua exists, seeing the part laid out for vacationers starts to feel lacking. I\u2019d gotten to know that part of the island on my first visit 20 years ago. This time, I\u2019d revisit it but also veer slightly beyond the Edenic coast to get a sense of the whole of Antigua.\u00adThere is no better place to start a tour of the glamorous side of Antigua than Galley Bay Resort & Spa, a 40-acre manicured refuge of white-painted cottages, sea grape trees, coconut palms and a bounty of yellow and orange blooms. From the Siboney, it was a 20-minute ride, and on the way, I asked my driver, Martin Edwards, a spry 70-year-old, to take me through St. John\u2019s, the capital. Streets teemed with \u00adpeople and the sounds of Caribbean music emanated from boomboxes. Food stalls, cars, S.U.V.s, vans and trucks clogged the lanes.As we passed wood-and-cinder-block homes and low-rise buildings, bars, dancehalls and banks (offshore banking is big here), Mr. Edwards complained about the slow economy (unemployment is 11 percent) and the influx of immigrants from Jamaica, Dominica, Guyana and the Dominican Republic, all poorer than Antigua, who were taking jobs away from the locals. Later, I asked a young Jamaican woman about this and she shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking jobs away from them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a job for $8 an hour, but they won\u2019t do it for $12.\u201dOver at Galley Bay Resort, there was no room available, although its all-inclusive rate for a single in the low April-December 2014 season ran $840 a night. At the al fresco restaurant, birds flew in and out, and guests in beach hats and sunglasses chatted over lunches of salads, cold cuts, fish and grilled vegetables. While I was looking over the menu, the restaurant manager came over to my table and to my amazement recognized me from 20 years back, when I had stayed at Galley Bay for eight days (she was then a housemaid).Resorts like Galley Bay are still powered largely by black bartenders, waitresses and clerks and white, foreign patrons. It mirrors the symbiotic relationship throughout much of the Caribbean, where money filters from Americans and Europeans to locals. The nation is more fortunate than those on many islands, though. Its tourism has made it enjoy a higher per-capita income than many fellow islands \u2014 an estimated $18,400 a year in 2013, according to C.I.A. World Factbook estimates. That placed it 59th in the world, ahead of hundreds of bigger nations like Russia, Brazil and China.Tourism is Antigua\u2019s bread and butter, its main source of income and employment \u2014 and sometimes its curse. It brings wealth and it can take it away when tourists don\u2019t come. Its fortune is subject to fashion and whim, weather and the caprice of travelers. Because 60 percent of the island\u2019s GDP comes from tourism, it has been slow to recover from the global recession.But you wouldn\u2019t know that from sitting at Galley Bay. Around the open-air bar, I flopped back into a low, cushioned wicker armchair under a humming ceiling fan. Soon it was busy with guests ordering up margaritas and mojitos. I met a wedding party; a Texas family celebrating the return of a daughter from Afghanistan; a middle-aged couple from Nebraska. The festive mood was infectious. From my comfy chair, I looked on the flat, translucent sea and the two rocky promontories that bracket Galley Bay, giving it a cocooning effect. A day there felt like a week away from the world.\u00adTourism served with a side of history was a specialty at my next stop, English Harbour, so named because it became a regular base for the British Navy in the 18th century. After a 45-minute spiraling, bumpy ride there down a two-lane road, I arrived at a place I scarcely recognized. The same centuries-old structures were standing, but two decades ago the restaurants were crowded, bars and clubs hopping, with young people of all races dancing together.This time the place was quiet. The popular Admiral\u2019s Inn on Nelson\u2019s Dockyard was closed for repairs, and the charming Copper and Lumber Store Hotel was eerily empty \u2014 in fact, I would be the only guest that night. Even restaurants, usually busy, were closed for the day. Still, wandering the grounds that served as a naval base while Admiral Nelson helped defend the British West Indies from French incursion perhaps demanded some quiet reflection.But I needed a dose of local culture. I took a taxi to Shirley Heights Lookout, the top of a hill above English Harbour.Sundays on Shirley Heights are an island tradition and a favorite tourist entertainment. Visitors come by the busloads, in taxis and vans, for an afternoon in the cooling mountain air, for the bopping sounds of steel-drum bands and some of the best spicy barbecue in Antigua. Elbowing my way through the crowd, I lined up behind dozens of fellow tourists for a bite and a cold Wadadli beer. For less than $10, I got some chicken and a drink.Carrying the paper plate and a plastic cup, I navigated through the throng to find a vacant spot at a picnic table set under a makeshift cover. A young couple was making out nearby, and a couple of parents were having no success quieting their screeching young children. Looking around, I saw few locals, mainly the ones serving customers at the food stalls, where the lines were getting longer. After wolfing down my lunch, I joined a boisterous crowd circling several young couples twisting and bopping to the fast tempo of steel drums. Barbecue and steel drums, nothing could be more Antiguan. And toward the end of that lazy afternoon, there was the memorable sight of the sun setting over English Harbour.I would head inland the next day to get a better grasp of the island\u2019s colonial remnants. I met Mr. Murphy, and we drove in his cranky Jeep through roadside villages of simple homes with tin roofs and meager yards. He\u2019d periodically point out sites of interest \u2014 here is Bethesda, where slaves were first educated, a quiet village with a handful of flat-roofed cinder block buildings, and here\u2019s All Saints, a crossroads with a church on each corner. We buzzed by body shops, stands with fruit and vegetables, a few schools and municipal buildings.\u201cThat\u2019s one big change,\u201d he said, drawing my attention to the cars and vans parked by homes we passed. \u201cEveryone, no matter how poor, has a car. Used to be people rode on mules up in the hills.\u201d Just then we passed a boy straddling a skinny mule.Minutes later, down a dusty track off the road, we reached Betty\u2019s Hope, a fenced-in mound surrounded by overgrown vegetation. A few trees gave shade. We stepped gingerly around broken branches, ancient artifacts, broken pottery, glass shards and other detritus of an archaeological excavation. A dozen schoolchildren in black and orange uniforms played at the site\u2019s museum, a onetime cotton storage room. In the center of the room was a model of the original plantation, featuring figurines of slaves and livestock and windmills, slave barracks, the boiling house where cane juice was turned into sugar and the distillery where rum was made. Drawings, pictures and maps, artifacts recovered nearby and estate plans adorned the museum walls.A half dozen or so college-age student volunteers from around the world were huddling and squatting at a cordoned area where Mr. Murphy believed the slave barracks once stood. \u201cBe careful, don\u2019t scrape too hard,\u201d the team\u2019s leader, Georgia L. Fox, an anthropologist and archaeologist from California State University at Chico, cautioned her volunteers.Mr. Murphy, who was born in Antigua and got his doctorate at Calgary University in Canada, has worked with Ms. Fox for several years. They\u2019ve got much in common. He has developed a field research program in archaeology, has raised millions of dollars for research and restoration on Antigua and heads the International Association for Caribbean Archaeology. Professor Fox is the head archaeologist at Betty\u2019s Hope Plantation, a field school designated by the American Anthropological Association. They talked shop awhile, and then he walked around the mound, picked up a piece of pottery, examined it, threw it over his shoulder and climbed over to the site of the plantation\u2019s house, giving me a tour, pointing out where the kitchen had stood, the large pool-size cistern that had held rain water, and the sugar windmill he restored in 1995.Many Antiguans opposed the restoration of Betty\u2019s Hope, he told me. They saw it as a monument to the dark past. But over time they\u2019ve come around. \u201cThe site is now shared by all, as we intended,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is used for education, cultural events, research and recreation. That was my original intention.\u201d Every year on Emancipation Day, Aug. 1, there\u2019s a celebration there.\u00adEveryone knows Mr. T, Antony Johnson, who\u2019s been in Antigua for more than 50 years. An English-Australian who served in the Australian army in World War II, he had a seafarer\u2019s spirit and arrived in Antigua in 1959 on a converted trawler he had been hired to sail. He stayed and built hotels and homes in Antigua and nearby islands and ran his own water-sports business. In 1981, he designed and built a small seafront resort on a sand patch on Dickenson Bay. He called it Siboney Beach Club, after the indigenous tribe and a Cuban love song he will sing unprompted, eyes closed, shoulders swaying.The precursor, if not the model, for these elite hotels was the exclusive Mill Reef Club, founded by an American architect, Robertson (Happy) Ward, in 1947. He envisioned a secluded resort for blue bloods like the DuPonts and the philanthropist and banking heir Paul Mellon and his wife, Rachel Lambert Mellon, known as Bunny. Mill Reef lived up to his original plan, retaining its low-key exclusivity for over half a century. Mrs. Mellon died in March at the age of 103, and the sale of the Mellon estate is being conducted by Sotheby\u2019s this month.\u201cBunny Mellon was very good to the island\u2019s causes,\u201d Agnes Meeker, a sixth-generation Antiguan of Scottish ancestry, told me. \u201cShe helped me with the St. John\u2019s Hospice. Also she was a good friend of Jackie Kennedy and often had her at Mill Reef with the children for Christmas.\u201d Indeed. When photographers tried to take pictures of Mrs. Kennedy on a Mill Reef beach, they were arrested and deported.As Mr. T rose from our table to return to his office, I asked him about his future. He was ready to retire and sell his hotel, he said, but he would not budge from the oceanfront apartment at the Siboney where he has lived since 1984.While he strolled away, a loud crowd was packing the Coconut Grove, the restaurant and bar next to the hotel, to catch that day\u2019s World Cup matches. It was early in the afternoon, but the place was already busy with people huddling around the bar and drinking up: expats, tourists, locals, whites, blacks, men, women, Italians, Canadians, Americans, Britons, Aussies. Johnny, the manager, a sunburned Dane in his 40s with a shaved head, stubble and rugged looks, kept an eye out for customers. His girlfriend, Emma, a Brit who called herself a \u201cbeach girl,\u201d was holding court nearby, and the bartender, Jermaine, a 30-something Antiguan, was greeting everyone with his standard \u201cHow are you, my friend?\u201d He slid a glass of sauvignon blanc across the bar counter toward me. I squeezed my way in and climbed onto a stool to join the fray. It was a small world, a small place, but it was for everyone. It was Antigua whole.A map on Nov. 9 with an article about the island of Antigua located the Galley Bay Resort incorrectly. The resort is west of the town of St. John\u2019s, not north.

And with two Democrats \u2014 Tom Torlakson, the incumbent, and Marshall Tuck, the challenger \u2014 vying for the office, the race also reflects a national schism within the party.\u201cDemocrats have been counting on Republicans beating each other up on immigration or social issues,\u201d said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at the University of Southern California. \u201cAnd what we see is the Democratic Party beating up itself on a critical issue in terms of the average voter, which is education.\u201dThe shifting relationships can be disconcerting. \u201cPeople who I do not agree with are Democrats,\u201d said Sara Roos, a mother of two students in a public high school in Los Angeles who supports Mr. Torlakson. \u201cThis is very unsettling for somebody who is a lifelong partisan Democrat.\u201dMr. Torlakson, the union-backed candidate, has expressed views that at times echo conservative mantras. Speaking of California\u2019s refusal to mandate the use of test scores in teacher evaluations, Mr. Torlakson said: \u201cWe took a stand against a new federal bureaucracy. I\u2019m saying Washington, D.C., shouldn\u2019t dictate to California.\u201dMr. Tuck, a former charter school executive who managed 17 underperforming schools in Los Angeles for six years, supported the judge\u2019s ruling in the case, Vergara v. California, and has called for an overhaul of tenure rules.That appeal has resonated with some voters. At a fund-raiser last weekend in Hermosa Beach, a wealthy community south of Los Angeles, Ian Dalsemer, 45, the owner of a music company and a residential real estate investor with two daughters in public school, said he had resolved to vote for Mr. Tuck in part because of his views on tenure.\u201cTenure is terrible,\u201d Mr. Dalsemer said. \u201cIt protects bad teachers.\u201dMr. Torlakson, who taught biology for eight years at a public high school and spent more than a decade in the State Legislature before being elected to the superintendent\u2019s job in 2010, has staunchly supported tenure protections while stumping for office.Some observers are surprised polling is still so close. \u201cThat\u2019s unusual that an incumbent superintendent would not simply be walking sedately toward re-election,\u201d said David Plank, a professor at the Center for Education Policy Analysis at Stanford University. Mr. Torlakson\u2019s supporters say Mr. Tuck is commanding attention because of the money he has raised. One of Mr. Tuck\u2019s largest donors is Eli Broad, the housing and insurance magnate whose philanthropic foundation is also backing the Partnership for Educational Justice, a group started by the former CNN anchor Campbell Brown to file lawsuits challenging tenure in other states.Mr. Tuck and his supporters have raised a total of about $10 million, including contributions to independent political committees. Donors include heirs of Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart; Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York; and Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs, who co-founded Apple.With the support of the teachers\u2019 unions, Mr. Torlakson has also raised a substantial war chest. Donors have contributed about $7.6 million to his campaign and political committees that support him, according to state campaign filings. The California Teachers Association, the state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, separately spent close to $5 million in October on issue ads supporting Mr. Torlakson\u2019s candidacy.Opponents are suspicious of Mr. Tuck\u2019s lack of teaching experience, as well as his high profile with wealthy donors and his two years as an investment banker.\u201cTuck is the neo-liberal, what\u2019s-wrong-with-the-market approach to education,\u201d said Cynthia Liu, a parent with a son in public elementary school in a Los Angeles suburb.A challenge for both candidates is that few voters realize there is a race for state superintendent at all. And with close to a quarter of students in public schools learning English as a second language, many parents may face language barriers in analyzing the issues.When Mr. Torlakson visited an after-school program at Roosevelt Middle School in Oakland last week, very few of the 60 parents and children there were aware he was running for an office.\u201cI appreciate you lifting us up,\u201d Mr. Torlakson told the 10 teachers and administrators there before observing lessons in kickboxing, salsa dancing and cooking.Mr. Tuck cites California\u2019s dismal record in national education rankings and said the teachers\u2019 unions \u201care comfortable with the current system as it is.\u201d But in an interview, he said he supported much of what the unions advocate, including higher pay for teachers and more time for training.Given how fiercely the unions have fought to preserve tenure rules, some Democrats say politicians like Mr. Tuck are picking the wrong fight. \u201cIn some states, politicians try to drive a wedge between labor and the people they serve,\u201d said Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, a state that has been working to change evaluation systems in collaboration with teachers. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s particularly healthy.\u201dBut other Democrats say public education needs a reboot.\u201cPeople are very comfortable doing tomorrow what they did yesterday,\u201d said United States Representative George Miller of California, who is the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. \u201cAnd our education system is so much more dynamic than that and needs to be, because our economy is so much more dynamic than that.\u201dIan Lovett and Ronnie Cohen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Afghan Opium Cultivation Rises to Record Levels", "Date": "2014-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWith the presidential election ongoing, there was a huge demand of funding,\u201d said Jean-Luc Lemahieu, a senior official with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. \u201cAnd that funding is not available in the licit economy, and that money has to come from somewhere, so they turned to the illicit economy.\u201dStill, officials noted at least one encouraging sign, saying that the new government of President Ashraf Ghani had moved to arrest three judges accused of aiding the escape of a drug kingpin wanted by the United States.The three judges accused of corruption are in custody in Kabul, according to Afghan and international officials. The men are accused of engineering the release of Haji Lal Jan Ishaqzai in June, as he was serving a 20-year sentence for drug trafficking.The arrests of the judges were welcomed by United Nations officials as a signal that Mr. Ghani\u2019s government was willing to treat the country\u2019s drug-trafficking problem more seriously than past officials have done.Still, the problem has never been worse.The numbers are particularly troubling, the agencies said, because in 2013, opium cultivation increased 36 percent over the year before, reaching its highest levels since the fall of the Taliban.The Taliban regime in the late 1990s was the only Afghan government to completely eradicate opium cultivation, but the Taliban now both tax and actively participate in opium production.The eight-month presidential and provincial elections, which included two rounds of voting and a protracted dispute over the results, affected opium production not only in the increased demand by politicians for campaign cash, but also in diverting police and military resources to the elections and away from opium eradication.Opium crop eradication decreased by 63 percent from 2013 to 2014, the report said. Such changes were seen in nearly all provinces where there were eradication efforts underway. Such programs are led by provincial governors, who are political appointees of the president.\u201cHe understood well that drug trafficking suffocates the normal economic development,\u201d Mr. Avetisyan said. \u201cWe are quite optimistic.\u201dMr. Lemahieu said: \u201cAshraf Ghani is not a magician, but at least Ashraf Ghani said all the right words, with a lot of passion. The criminalization of economics and politics threatens everything he wants to achieve.\u201dMr. Ishaqzai\u2019s arrest and conviction in 2012 was a major victory for the country\u2019s drug enforcement efforts. But he was then transferred to Kandahar to serve his 20-year sentence. In the prison there, the former warden, Mohammad Akbar Zabuli, \u201ctreated him like a bride and allowed Jan to carry a cellphone and provided him with a separate cell to live in,\u201d said one Kandahar prison official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.Mr. Zabuli could not be reached for comment.The prison official said that Mr. Ishaqzai had sometimes been allowed to spend nights in his own home and return to the Kandahar prison in the daytime.International officials said that many efforts had been made last year to persuade Mr. Karzai to pardon Mr. Ishaqzai, but that they had been thwarted by opposition from international law enforcement officials. His escape in June may have been prompted by concern that his connections would weaken under a new government.Officials in Kandahar said that after the judges quietly got him released, Mr. Ishaqzai was believed to have fled to Helmand Province, to his home district of Sangin, where the insurgents are strong. Others say he fled to Quetta, in Pakistan, where he has close relations with Taliban leaders and other relatives.Mr. Ishaqzai is such a powerful and feared figure that most officials in Kandahar and Kabul were reluctant to comment Wednesday on the arrests of the judges who are accused of releasing him. Shamsul Rahman Raiskhail, head of the appeals court in Kandahar, claimed that he did not know the names of the judges who had been arrested, for instance, and referred questions to the Supreme Court in Kabul.Five Supreme Court officials were contacted, but all refused to comment on the case or claimed to have no knowledge of it.\u201cWhat was missing in the last decade was political will,\u201d said Mr. Lemahieu \u2014 both on the part of world leaders, who could not agree on how to attack the opium problem, and on the part of \u201cnational entities who saw this as one big opportunity.\u201dAn article on Thursday about a United Nations report that found a sharp rise in opium cultivation in Afghanistan misstated the increase in cultivation in 2013 over the year before. It was 36 percent, not 49 percent.Taimoor Shah contributed reporting from Kandahar, Afghanistan, and Jawad Sukhanyar from Kabul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Side Effects of Consumerism", "Date": "2014-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 British supermarkets are selling beer in glass bottles that are a third lighter than they were a few years ago. Unilever, which makes products like Dove cleansers and Sure deodorant, has pledged to reduce its packaging by a third by 2020. Dell is cushioning computers and server parts with wheat straw and a compostable, mushroom-based material, instead of Styrofoam.Across the business world, more companies, mindful of the environment and their bottom lines, are scrutinizing their packaging and cutting the excess. Less packaging means fewer raw materials to buy and lower shipping costs. The changes can also add up to fewer climate-warming carbon emissions and less garbage in landfills.\u201cIt\u2019s good for Cisco, it\u2019s good for our customers and it\u2019s good for the environment,\u201d said Kathleen Shaver, director of sustainability, risk and compliance at Cisco Systems, which says it has eliminated 1.9 million pounds of packaging this year. \u201cCosts are reduced, not just with material you\u2019re not buying, but with the material you\u2019re not shipping and the material you\u2019re not disposing of.\u201dIn the United States, packaging makes up about 30 percent of all municipal solid waste, down from 36 percent in 1970, said Susan Selke, interim director of Michigan State University\u2019s School of Packaging. The overall amount of municipal waste, though, has more than doubled in that time, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says. \u201cIndustry is paying attention, but not enough attention yet,\u201d Ms. Selke said.The environmental impact of a product\u2019s packaging is usually less than the footprint of the goods within, Ms. Selke said. But the visibility of packaging gives it a special status in the world of waste.\u201cIt\u2019s almost a kind of archetypal image of consumer goods products, the pack on the shelf,\u201d said Sandy Rodger, of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which seeks to promote an approach to material reuse known as the circular economy. \u201cIt has visibility everywhere: visibility for companies, visibility as a waste issue, visibility of plastic in oceans.\u201dGenerally, the environmental impact of producing packaging is greater than the impact of getting rid of it, because of the resources used, whether paper or petrochemicals, and the energy involved in manufacturing, Ms. Selke said.Packaging serves a positive role, companies and experts said, protecting products and preventing food from going bad. \u201cIf we\u2019re not protecting the product, we\u2019re actually wasting all the resources that went into the manufacture of the product,\u201d said Richard Swannell, waste prevention director at WRAP, a waste reduction group backed by the British government.Efforts to reduce excess packaging range from the immediate and incremental to long-term visions of a waste-free world where goods and their wrappers are designed to be reclaimed, reused or composted, becoming a resource instead of a problem.In addition to its wheat straw and mushroom-based packaging, Dell is working with Newlight Technologies on a plastic that the companies say sequesters carbon dioxide.Manufacturers have redesigned glass and plastic bottles so they use less material to hold the same amount of liquid, Mr. Swannell said. \u201cWe targeted high-volume lines, like milk, like wine, like beer, and try to get them to shift to more resource-efficient designs,\u201d he said.Sellers realized, for example, that tall, thin beer bottles use less glass than short, wide ones, he said. \u201cIn a supermarket now, you pretty much see only tall, thin bottles,\u201d Mr. Swannell said.The home improvement sector is also on board. DIY stores pledged to cut packaging 15 percent by 2012, then delivered a 25 percent cut, partly through innovations like shipping sofas in bags that delivery workers remove and reuse, instead of disposable cardboard and plastic, Mr. Swannell said.Unilever has pledged to halve the greenhouse gas emissions created by its products and the waste associated with their disposal by 2020. Paul Howells, vice president for packaging research and development, says this requires not just reducing the amount of material, but rethinking the way things are made. \u201cFor us as packaging designers and packaging developers, at the outset of an innovation,\u201d he said, it is critical \u201cto ask ourselves the question \u2018How can we design this so that the materials that we use will have more than one life?\u2019 \u201dIn Britain, Unilever has started selling a compressed version of its Sure, Dove and Vaseline spray deodorants, shrinking the size of cans by half, a change that cuts the aluminum content by a quarter and requires 35 percent fewer trucks for shipping, the company said.Unilever is also using a new type of plastic, starting in bottles of some Dove skin care, in which embedded air bubbles reduce the amount and weight of the material by 15 percent.The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is trying to coordinate such efforts, working with McKinsey and the World Economic Forum on an effort known as Project MainStream.The project is trying to bring companies and cities together to coordinate the design of packaging and arrangements for its disposal. The group hopes to come up with a way to standardize the ingredients in plastic packaging, so any company or municipality can easily become part of one process of reusing and recycling packaging.\u201cIt\u2019s integrating what it takes to design the packaging and what it takes to design the system that captures the packaging after use,\u201d said Mr. Rodger, co-director of Project MainStream.Others are promoting smaller-scale changes billed as \u201cdisruptive innovations\u201d \u2014 new ideas with the potential to shake up an established industry. David Edwards, a Harvard University engineering professor, said fruit skin was the inspiration for the edible packaging on the frozen yogurt balls that his company, WikiFoods, designed for Stonyfield Organic. The snack, called WikiPearl, is not entirely free of packaging. The balls are wrapped in a layer of paper.Changes to something as central to modern life as packaging may not come unless companies are pushed to do things differently, Mr. Edwards said. \u201cThe industry is going to have to have amazing leadership, given the investment and the way things are done now, the complexity of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be an easy path.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House G.O.P. Files Lawsuit in Battling Health Law", "Date": "2014-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe lawsuit \u2014 filed against the secretaries of Health and Human Services and the Treasury \u2014 focuses on two crucial aspects of the way the administration has put the Affordable Care Act into effect.The suit accuses the Obama administration of unlawfully postponing a requirement that larger employers offer health coverage to their full-time employees or pay penalties. (Larger companies are defined as those with 50 or more employees.)Answers to common questions about open enrollment and the Affordable Care Act.That issue involves subsidies known as cost-sharing reductions, which the federal government pays to insurers on behalf of people whose incomes range from the poverty threshold to two and a half times the poverty threshold ($11,670 to $29,175 a year for an individual).If the lawsuit is successful, poor people would not lose their health care, because the insurance companies would still be required to provide coverage \u2014 but without the help of the government subsidy, the companies might be forced to raise costs elsewhere.The subsidies reduce the co-payments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs that consumers incur when they go to doctors and hospitals.Democrats have cast a legal challenge as strange. Republicans, they say, are attacking Mr. Obama for delaying enforcement of a law that they vehemently oppose.A year after it was fully in place, the Affordable Care Act has largely succeeded in delivering on President Obama\u2019s main promises, even as it fell short in some ways and gave birth to a new and powerful conservative movement.The health care law was passed in 2010 without any Republican votes, and House Republicans have voted dozens of times to repeal all or part of it.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Eric Schultz, the White House deputy press secretary, called the lawsuit announced by Speaker John A. Boehner \u201cunfortunate.\u201d\u201cAt a time where we \u2014 I think the American people want Washington focused on jobs and the economy, the House Republicans choose to sue us, sue the president for doing his job \u2014 and using taxpayer resources at the same time \u2014 for a lawsuit that their own congressional research service could not identify any merit for,\u201d Mr. Schultz said.Mr. Boehner has been talking about suing the president since the summer, and in July, House Republicans passed a resolution authorizing the House to legally challenge Mr. Obama over the use of his executive authority to change parts of the health care law.Robert Pear contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hopes Are Low for G-20 Summit in Brisbane", "Date": "2014-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 It will shut down a city for two days, cost hundreds of millions of dollars and oblige 20 of the world\u2019s top leaders to make long journeys to the east coast of Australia. So it would be a bit of a letdown if the Group of 20 summit meeting in Brisbane on Saturday and Sunday failed to accomplish very much.Expectations are that the gathering will be a disappointment. Past summit meetings have fallen short of their goals, and the latest meeting will take place when collegiality among leaders is at a low ebb, strained by conflict in Ukraine, territorial disputes in Asia and war in the Middle East.Failure of the G-20 meeting would be more than just a diplomatic setback for the countries involved, which include the United States, China, Russia, Japan, Germany and France. If they fail to coordinate their economic policies \u2014 the forum\u2019s primary goal \u2014 the leaders will squander an opportunity to make the global economy grow faster and improve the living standards of millions of people, economists say.John P. Lipsky, former first deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has said that the Brisbane summit meeting is a make-or-break moment for the G-20. If the leaders fail to achieve anything concrete, or fail to follow up later, it will raise questions about whether they are capable of working together in service of global prosperity, Mr. Lipsky told an audience in Melbourne this year. During a recent telephone interview, he did not sound optimistic. \u201cIn the way of these summits, agreements will be announced on all the principal agenda items,\u201d Mr. Lipsky said by phone from Washington. \u201cWhat remains to be seen is whether the specifics will be sufficiently credible and whether they will receive strong enough political backing by the G-20 leaders to make them politically convincing as well.\u201dThe G-20 nations held their first summit meeting in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, when the world was in danger of falling into economic depression.Initially, the leaders, including those from developing countries like Brazil and India that had been excluded from the Group of 7 summit meetings \u2014 focused on creating a financial system less vulnerable to the kind of crisis that was then raging. Later, a more ambitious goal evolved \u2014 coordinating economic policies with the aim of lifting world growth.World leaders would work together to remove the roadblocks to economic progress, including corruption, trade restrictions and regulations that discourage hiring and firing. Countries would spend more on research and development, create more equitable tax systems, and invest in public infrastructure like transit systems.The stakes were big. In 2010, the I.M.F. estimated that if the 20 leaders could follow through on their commitments, global growth would have been 2.5 percentage points higher. The extra economic output would be worth $1.5 trillion, the I.M.F. said, while 30 million new jobs would be created and 33 million people would escape poverty.The I.M.F. also sketched out a worst-case scenario in which members of the G-20 did not follow through on their promises and growth missed forecasts. The difference between the best-case and worst-case scenarios was $4 trillion in output and 52 million jobs.In fact, it was the worst-case scenario that proved to be the more accurate prediction. If anything, Mr. Lipsky said, it was too optimistic.Strictly speaking, the G-20 is not a forum to achieve rapprochement with Russia over Ukraine or adjudicate conflicting claims to waters in the South China Sea. The G-20 is supposed to be about economics and finance. The United Nations is supposed to be responsible for geopolitical issues.But heightened tensions will inevitably affect the mood in the Brisbane convention center, where the leaders, 4,000 delegates and an estimated 3,000 media representatives will gather. Security precautions will be even more intense than usual because of conflict in Syria and Iraq and heightened fear of terrorism. A public holiday has been declared in Brisbane for Friday. The government of Australia will spend 400 million Australian dollars, or about $350 million, hosting the event, according to local press reports. That figure does not include what the G-20 leaders and their entourages will spend during the meeting.The summit meeting is the culmination of intense preparation by officials below the rank of head of state. In September, central bank governors and finance ministers from the G-20 countries met in Cairns, farther up Australia\u2019s eastern coast, and agreed to a range of measures designed to add 1.8 percent to global growth by 2018. This included more investment in public works and measures to combat tax evasion.But such high-minded policy declarations often prove to be inconsistent with the domestic politics of individual members. Germany, for example, has been reluctant to spend more fixing roads and bridges, even though the government has a budget surplus and can borrow money on international financial markets at interest rates close to zero. Cautious German voters would rather save than invest in, say, their country\u2019s overcrowded public universities.Mike Callaghan, director of the G-20 Studies Center at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney, said there should be more rigorous monitoring of whether leaders delivered on their promises, and peer pressure when they fall short. In fact, one outcome of the G-20 in Brisbane could be a stronger mechanism to name and shame laggards.In addition, Mr. Callaghan said, leaders need to spend more time explaining to their own citizens why the G-20 and its aims are important.\u201cThe biggest step is to maintain the momentum, to actually implement these reforms,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t know that until the fullness of time. It\u2019s going to depend on winning domestic political battles.\u201dEven under the best of circumstances, the G-20 is an unwieldy group. Unlike the G-7, whose members are all wealthy democracies, the G-20 includes authoritarian countries like China and poor countries like India. But is it all just a waste of time and money?The G-20 has arguably had a significant impact in addressing one pressing global issue: the fragility of the financial system. G-20 support has been crucial in addressing the problem of banks that are too big to fail, an underlying cause of the financial crisis that brought the world leaders to Washington in 2008 for the first summit meeting. Another likely outcome of the Brisbane gathering will be to endorse rules that further strengthen banks\u2019 ability to absorb losses.\u201cHas the G-20 done enough to support a vision of well-functioning, integrated financial markets? I would say no,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. But he said the progress on bank regulation \u201chas been useful.\u201dMoreover, he and others pointed out, there is something to be said for getting leaders together in one room where they have a chance to take each other\u2019s measure, where they must deal with each other as mortal human beings.\u201cMaybe there are too many people attending and too much taxpayers\u2019 money spent,\u201d Mr. V\u00e9ron said. \u201cBut the fact that we have these meetings to discuss the world economy at the highest level with the most important leaders is useful.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The measures have been broadly unpopular among virtually all sectors of the electorate.Referring to his promise to reduce unemployment, which has crept inexorably above 10 percent as growth has faltered, Mr. Hollande said, \u201cI talked about reversing the trend in unemployment; it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\u201cI was criticized for this,\u201d he continued, \u201cbecause it was a high hope for many, especially those seeking work.\u201dHe added: \u201cIf I don\u2019t succeed by the end of my term, do you think I will present myself to the French people in 2017? The French would be unforgiving and rightly so.\u201dThere is probably little Mr. Hollande can do to reverse high unemployment anytime soon. He has presented a program intended to encourage more hiring at companies by relaxing parts of France\u2019s stringent labor code, but with the economy continuing to stumble, new employment has not picked up significantly.If anything, French employers continue to complain that a thicket of regulations and high taxes makes it difficult for them to maintain profitability or hire new workers. Hours after Mr. Hollande\u2019s television appearance, the employers\u2019 union Medef called on the chief executives of all small and medium-size businesses to take to the streets on Dec. 1 in Paris and in the large southern city of Toulouse to protest constraints that the union says are killing businesses.Forecasts for a French economic recovery after two years of stagnation continue to be downgraded. In the last week alone, the European Commission, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the French central bank cautioned that the economy would grow at a rate of less than 1 percent a year for the foreseeable future, much more slowly than expected at the beginning of the year.The number of long-term unemployed people \u2014 those still looking for a job after a year of unemployment \u2014 has surged to 43.8 percent of all job seekers, according to Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union. Joblessness is growing fastest among people older than 50 and remains high for young people under 24.In the interview, Mr. Hollande also pledged not to raise individual taxes in an effort to address the nation\u2019s persistent budget deficits.\u201cStarting next year, there will be no additional taxes on anybody whatsoever,\u201d Mr. Hollande said. The business newspaper Les Echos reported this week that the Hollande administration planned to impose a special tax on second homes in densely populated areas next year.Troubled by critics and rebels in his Socialist Party, while facing a determined challenge from the far-right National Front, Mr. Hollande said he had been \u201changing on.\u201dBut, he said, he would go \u201cto the end\u201d to make France \u201cstronger in the two and a half years I have left.\u201dThe latest opinion surveys suggest that nearly all French voters believe he has failed to turn around the economy, and four-fifths of them do not want him to run for a second term.\u201cI have made mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cWho hasn\u2019t?\u201dLiz Alderman contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

Mann, the organization\u2019s chief economist, said that insisting on fiscal consolidation would merely worsen the weakness in demand, the main problem facing Europe, and that as a rule of thumb, every one percentage point reduction in the fiscal deficit in the current low-growth environment would mean a two percentage point decrease in employment.Still, the officials stressed the need for a multipronged approach, noting that some of the so-called peripheral euro members that had done the most to overhaul their economies had begun to show growth, while \u201ccore\u201d members like Germany and France were faltering.\u201cWe really need to see structural reforms in order to allow the fiscal and monetary policy levers to work effectively,\u201d Ms. Mann said, adding that doing so was most important in Germany and France.But with unemployment high, business investment low and little enthusiasm in Brussels for expanded government spending, Ms. Mann conceded that the main hope for new demand was in the hands of the European Central Bank.Still, Ms. Mann noted that alone among major central banks, the E.C.B. had been shrinking its balance sheet in recent years, in effect withdrawing monetary stimulus even as credit shrinks.\u201cThe E.C.B. has taken away the punch bowl and the party hasn\u2019t even started yet,\u201d she said.Policy makers and analysts have consistently underestimated the weakness in Europe, she said, and the outlook now is for growth rates well below previous norms.\u201cEven in our positive scenarios we\u2019re not getting back to historical averages,\u201d she said.The two officials spoke just before the organization announced the latest installment of its twice-yearly surveys of the world economy. The group, based in Paris, comprises most of the world\u2019s developed nations but not rising economies like China and India.Mr. Gurria, the group\u2019s leader, said that the global outlook was growing worse and that \u201csome of our forecasts are weaker than ones we made just a few weeks ago.\u201dThe organization expects the world economy to grow by 3.3 percent this year, accelerating to 3.7 percent in 2015 and 3.9 percent in 2016.Among the major economies, it forecasts that the United States will grow 2.2 percent this year and 3 percent in 2015 and 2016. It predicted that the eurozone would grow just 0.8 percent this year, 1.1 percent next year and 1.7 percent in 2016.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Hillary Clinton, the Right Time to Get Ready", "Date": "2014-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 The Democrats\u2019 drubbing in the midterm elections simplified one of Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s challenges: Now she can strike some distance from President Obama. Everybody else is doing it.The former secretary of state, who is almost certain to run for president in 2016, has the luxury of time to elaborate her strategy. There will be matters beyond her control: relentless attacks, including some from the left.But it\u2019s mainly the political right and Republicans who will work tirelessly to dig up dirt on the expected 2016 Democratic nominee. For all the talk of empowered congressional Republicans investigating every facet of the Obama administration, they won\u2019t miss any opportunity to look into Mrs. Clinton.She\u2019s tough, resilient, and likely to be prepared for this predictable onslaught. More instructive is whether she\u2019s prepared for matters within her control. These include defining her candidacy and possible presidency. It won\u2019t be sufficient to run on competence, breadth of experience and reminders that, by the way, her husband\u2019s White House years were the salad days for the United States economy.Her foreign policy credentials are fodder for champions and critics alike. But there is no domestic centerpiece. She needs an innovative, or even bold approach \u2014 this is a cautious politician \u2014 to dealing with middle-class economic stagnation and income inequality.That requires choices and trade-offs. She has a good and lucrative association with Goldman Sachs. She also praises the liberal Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts: \u201cI love watching Elizabeth give it to those who deserve to get it,\u201d she said last month at a campaign rally in Massachusetts. One of the institutions Ms. Warren likes to \u201cgive it to\u201d is Goldman Sachs.Can Mrs. Clinton put together an efficient, functioning campaign? In the 2007-8 cycle, the Clinton camp was rife with infighting, warring clans as the many elements of Clintonland weighed in, sometimes not helpfully. Especially controversial was top strategist Mark Penn, who had to step down late in the campaign when it was disclosed he was simultaneously working for the government of Colombia.It is expected that former President Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff, John D. Podesta, will assume the role of chief executive in the 2016 campaign. It would be a widely praised selection. As a strategist, he understands the nexus of politics and policy as well as anyone since James A. Baker III, the renowned Republican who served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.Mrs. Clinton is also seeking advice outside her political circle, most notably from David Plouffe, who ran Mr. Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns.And this time she is determined get the crucial technology and data right.The big question is whether she will assemble a coherent team that holds at bay some of the more disruptive elements of the far-reaching Clinton constellation.Will there be a Bill problem? The former president\u2019s indelicate comments caused her some anxiety in 2008. He was rusty then, having been out of the campaigning limelight for a while. But in 2012 and during this year\u2019s midterm elections, he has shown that he\u2019s easily America\u2019s best stump campaigner as well as the most popular politician.Everyone else pales next to him on the campaign trail, including Mrs. Clinton. He also possesses superb political instincts; she is more methodical. Unfavorable comparisons will be made, but she can\u2019t let that get to her.The former secretary of state\u2019s book and promotional tour this summer fell flat. Yet she won raves for her campaign appearances this autumn.In modern American politics, there has never been such a prohibitive front-runner who wasn\u2019t the incumbent president. No one, in either party, can boast of such odds of winning. Yet Mrs. Clinton\u2019s path will be full of unforeseen changes, and more than a few ugly moments. How she prepares in the next few months may well determine how she weathers the storms. Advertisement"}

But what if it had ruled differently?Today, the odds of having health insurance are much lower for people living in Tennessee than in neighboring Kentucky, for example, and lower in Texas than in Arkansas. Sharp differences are seen outside the South, too. Maine, which didn\u2019t expand Medicaid, has many more residents without insurance than neighboring New Hampshire. In a hypothetical world with a different Supreme Court ruling, those differences would be smoothed out.Consider New Mexico and Texas, two states with among the highest rates of the uninsured in 2013. The gray arrow shows how much the uninsured rate has declined in the last year, according to the Enroll/Civis data. In reality, New Mexico expanded its program while Texas did not. But the green arrow shows our estimate for how much more Texas\u2019 rate might have declined if it had expanded, too.Here\u2019s a similar chart showing how an across-the-board expansion might have looked in every state.Nearly all the states at the bottom of the list were those that did not expand. That\u2019s because many started with high percentages of uninsured people and made smaller reductions than states that did expand. But if every state had expanded, many states now near the bottom of the list would have moved up.Because some states that have not expanded Medicaid may do so later, the data also gives us a glimpse of the possible future in some states.A previous version of the interactive map mislabeled the insurance status of residents at the county level.

{"Headline": "Welcoming a Boom\u2019s Cash, but Not Its Rowdier Side", "Date": "2014-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneKARNES CITY, Tex. \u2014 Circling this small South Texas city in his black Cadillac, Ray Kroll surveys empty streets, faded storefronts and a century-old mercantile building with fresh blue paint and a teetering veranda.His eyes light up as he describes what could be: Over there, a new, two-story, $30 million high school. There, a park, with as many as five baseball diamonds. There, a new corner store. \u201cIt affords us the opportunity to do a lot of things we never would have dreamed of years earlier,\u201d said Mr. Kroll, the city\u2019s new development manager, who has lived here for eight years.But the energy world\u2019s sudden interest in Karnes City has brought its own challenges, like cracked roads and a housing crunch. And it is prompting deep questions. How can the community nourish itself from the boom, and build landmarks that will sustain it when the drilling rigs are gone and the flow of oil money dries up? Its answer, so far, has been to keep rough-and-tumble oil workers and the boom\u2019s opportunists \u2014 people here call them \u201ccarpetbaggers\u201d \u2014 at arm\u2019s length, even if that means losing out on short-term bonanzas. That means no liquor stores, strip clubs, bars or \u201cman camps\u201d \u2014 temporary oil field housing. The city is also limiting new hotels, which are popping up elsewhere like weeds after rain.\u201cWe want families to move here,\u201d Mr. Kroll said. \u201cWe want them to join our churches, send their kids to school here, become productive members of the community. \u201cAs far as the guys blowing off steam after they\u2019ve worked 16, 18 hours by going into a bar? We really don\u2019t want that here.\u201dSome neighboring towns have been less stringent, allowing most developers to come in, no matter how long they plan to stay. Officials in Karnes City, population 3,200, say they have learned from past booms and busts, and are embracing a slower pace. They are using the influx of oil money to invest in education, parks, walking spaces and other amenities. They are welcoming businesses like restaurants and stores that improve the quality of life. \u201cIf you want traction in this city and you\u2019re a developer, you should be asking one of two things: \u2018What do you need, and what can I do to help?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Don Tymrak, the city manager and a former longtime mayor.\u201cThey\u2019re trying to take an organized approach to development,\u201d said Thomas Tunstall, the research director for the institute. This is not Karnes City\u2019s first go-round with a volatile industry. At various times during the 20th century, it depended on cotton farming, uranium mining and some oil production. By the 1990s, all those industries had tanked, taking the economy down. \u201cRight before this happened, I would say this place was oppressed,\u201d said Lance Rhodes, who owns a funeral home here. \u201cPeople were about to lose businesses, lose property.\u201d Mr. Tymrak talks of a time when Karnes County was considered a \u201csevere economic dislocation\u201d community, meaning more than half its population had died or moved away. \u201cWe were losing our future,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have a reason for them to come back.\u201dThe oil fields have pumped millions of dollars into the community. Karnes City had nearly $1 million in sales taxes in 2013, more than four times as much as it collected in 2010. The city is also banking big royalty checks. Dozens of people with rights to minerals under the city became millionaires almost overnight. So far, signs of that newfound wealth are subtle: new pickup trucks, remodeled houses, and churches with new roofs and electronic welcome signs. Karnes City\u2019s broader vision will take shape in the coming years. A crucial piece is a proposed civic plaza including a hotel, a convention center and a new city hall. With officials\u2019 input, architects at the University of Texas at San Antonio drafted a concept for the project last spring.\u201cWe have to have a reason to get people to come to town,\u201d Mr. Kroll said, even if it is just what would be the largest convention center between San Antonio and Corpus Christi. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just people are going to come into town to have a wedding.\u201dThe city has rolled out a branding campaign to persuade visitors that it is more than just a boomtown. It bills itself as \u201cThe Real Texas,\u201d a nod to the area\u2019s longhorns, horny toads and oil wells.The look is much different four miles down the road in Kenedy, a city of similar size. A tangle of gas stations, fast-food joints, hotels and oil field services has sprouted along the main drag, where eighteen-wheelers rumble to and fro. Amid a drought, the city\u2019s rapid growth threatens to outpace its water resources, developers say. \u201cIt\u2019s just the Wild West in a lot of ways,\u201d Mr. Tunstall said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more growth in Kenedy, but it\u2019s not yet clear if there\u2019s any plan associated with it.\u201d Kenedy has not created the equivalent of Mr. Kroll\u2019s position in Karnes City, leaving most of the planning to Ford Patton, its city manager of five years. Mr. Patton said Kenedy had its own ambitions, including building a civic center and financing long-neglected infrastructure projects, but was mostly reacting to growth. \u201cEverybody is trying to keep up,\u201d Mr. Patton said. \u201cThe impact is so sudden that everyone is trying to keep up with the day-to-day necessities.\u201d In Karnes City, some residents have grumbled about the city\u2019s slow pace, saying officials are passing up easy money. Kirby Hons, who owns an antique store where shoppers can peer under the floorboards at fat catfish swimming in an ever-flooded basement, said that Kenedy-style development might bring him more business.But Arlene Matthews, who has lived all 76 of her years here, said she did not want what Kenedy has. \u201cThey\u2019re growing. That\u2019s fine,\u201d she said after finishing lunch at the Pastime Cafe, a new downtown restaurant. \u201cKarnes City, we hope, will stay small.\u201d jmalewitz@texastribune.org Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Borscht and Rifle Scopes, Volunteers Power Ukraine Forces", "Date": "2014-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDNEPROPETROVSK, Ukraine \u2014 In a cramped kitchen that smelled strongly of cabbage and beets, a small army of women labored into the night, preparing what would become dried borscht to supply Ukrainian soldiers in the field.One Ziploc bag of the borscht, which looks something like wood chips, can feed 10 men and is distributed as a type of Ukrainian meal ready to eat. Each bag comes with a handwritten note saying, \u201cBon app\u00e9tit, made with love.\u201d\u201cWho in the Ministry of Defense is going to make borscht?\u201d Tatyana V. Sirko, an obstetrician volunteering on a recent evening, said. \u201cI want to help somehow. I want to help our guys. They aren\u2019t having an easy time.\u201dIn late summer, with rebel fighters on the run from a concerted government drive, Russian troops and military equipment poured over the border and launched a devastating counterattack, stopping the Ukrainians in their tracks.While the Ukrainian government maintains that it is prepared for any sort of attack, the preparations are veiled in secrecy that many fear is a cover for weakness. Most of the open fortification for the troops is coming now from volunteers, who offer not just moral and physical support but at least a glimmer of hope that the Ukrainian forces can hold their own against what appears to be a vastly superior force.Powering the Ukrainian war effort, teams of volunteers, most of them women, work around the clock at a logistics center to send an array of products \u2014 bottles of homemade pickles, sets of handmade underwear and commercially available military equipment, like night vision scopes for rifles.In one room, a man stacked hand-sewn ballistic vests, peculiarities of the war in Ukraine, a nation with a rich tradition of handicrafts but a woefully underfunded military. Others at the site sort sleeping bags, miniature wood stoves and wool socks.Volunteers tackle even seemingly core military tasks. One group of civilian mechanics in the town of Zhovti Vody repairs trucks and armored vehicles, ancient heaps that break down regularly.\u201cOur guys, our men, are defending the country, our country, and everything depends on them,\u201d said Natasha L. Naumenko, a travel agent who organizes the operation.\u201cThey need a strong spirit,\u201d Ms. Naumenko said of the troops. \u201cWe want to give them the warmth of home, let them feel they are not standing there for nothing. Their wives, their mothers, their daughters have made them borscht.\u201dThe volunteerism is most pronounced in Dnepropetrovsk, a sprawling industrial city just 150 miles from the front that serves as a main logistic point in the war, but it is spreading throughout Ukraine.In the western city of Lviv, residents drop money in a donation box in the shape of a tank. Inspired by the dried borscht operation here, which produces 2,000 servings a week, similar kitchens have opened recently in Kiev and Odessa.Volunteers are also fighting \u2014 15,000 to 20,000 irregular combatants in about 30 volunteer battalions active in the east.\u201cWithout us, the situation would be far more grievous,\u201d Vitaly G. Feshenko, a former furniture salesman and deputy commander of the Dnipro-1 volunteer battalion, said in an interview. \u201cWe are lawyers, businessmen and housewives,\u201d he said. Serving in one of his units, for example, is a former cellphone store accountant who fights under the nom de guerre \u201cThe Accountant\u201d and is rumored to be widely feared along the front.While this dedication to defending the country may warm the hearts of Ukrainian patriots, it also reflects the dismal state the military has fallen into, haphazardly equipped by a bankrupt government and receiving only minimal, defensive-oriented aid from the West.With talk rife of an imminent rebel offensive, senior Ukrainian officials put on a brave face and never pass up an opportunity to reiterate that their army is ready. On a recent visit to the front lines, however, the soldiers seemed to be lacking just about everything, including such basics as fuel and warm coats.And yet Ukraine\u2019s post-Soviet army has for years been unraveling amid corruption and mismanagement. The Kiev Post newspaper printed a graphic detailing the origin of one soldier\u2019s personal equipment: All but the Kalashnikov rifle and a pair of summer boots was either donated or purchased by the soldier.In Kharkiv, a group of men build prefabricated plywood shacks, more comfortable in the cold than tents. Enthusiasts of drone photography donate their buzzing machines, teaching soldiers to use them to see over hills and around buildings. Stories abound of families scraping to buy protective vests for a son or a nephew.\u201cWhat is wrong with our government?\u201d said Anastasia S. Kuznetsova, 22, a social worker in Dnepropetrovsk, who helps coordinate donations. \u201cWinter is here and the soldiers don\u2019t have warm clothes. They will be living in the snow and sleeping in trenches. And schoolchildren are sending them socks.\u201dAt one sandbagged redoubt on a November morning, soldiers stood around a campfire, slathering toast with a tart, homemade cranberry jam.\u201cIt\u2019s a people\u2019s army,\u201d Mikola I. Fakas, a private, said. \u201cSome people fight, and some people supply them. The state is not an intermediary, and not a spoke in the wheel.\u201d Of those who donated the jam, he said he was very grateful. \u201cThey love us, they trust us, they are counting on us.\u201dVolunteers are allowed powerful weapons like .50-caliber rifles and antitank rocket-propelled grenades, but are not provided factory-made armored vehicles. On the Ukrainian side of the front, monstrous vehicles made from vans welded with steel plates rumble along the roads.In what volunteer groups point to as grim evidence of their rising importance in the Ukrainian war effort, the man who organized the volunteer mechanics, Ivan D. Veliki, an Afghan war veteran, was killed this month in a sophisticated attack. He was shot by a remote-controlled gun planted in a parked car that then burst into flames. Nobody has been arrested in the killing.Russian news media routinely vilify the proliferation of nongovernmental military organizations, dismissing them as the private armies of Ukrainian oligarchs, and to be sure, wealthy industrialists do play a big role. So do the legions of do-it-yourself enthusiasts in Ukraine.Sewing, embroidery, gardening and canning are traditions that run deep in Ukraine. In the Soviet era, gaps in the consumer economy created these experts throughout the former Soviet space.At Ms. Naumenko\u2019s collection point on a recent evening, a woman showed up who had sewn from nylon camouflage fabric two pouches just the right shape for Kalashnikov magazines to fit snugly inside.One group of women sews boxer shorts, each with a distinct floral print pattern.Like everything else at the collection point, they are stamped, \u201cNot for sale. Army aid.\u201d Handwritten tags on the shorts say, \u201cTogether to victory!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Goes Up Must at Least Slow Down", "Date": "2014-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesGood news sometimes causes its own problems. That is, arguably, what\u2019s happened with the American stock market. Despite persistent troubles for the global economy and occasional market scares, the overall news for stock investors over the last five years has been astonishingly good. But it\u2019s time to re-evaluate the state of the markets and make some adjustments.He made a prediction in 2012 that seemed audacious. The Dow Jones industrial average was then languishing below 12,900. And with the horrors of the financial crisis all too vividly apparent, relatively few people were saying that it was worth making big bets on the stock market. But, based on historical data and on projected returns for the years ahead, he argued that many investors were failing to perceive a major opportunity: The Dow, he said, was likely to reach 20,000 within the next decade.The big picture since then \u2014 despite periodic setbacks, notably including a sharp decline from mid-September through mid-October \u2014 has been one of tremendous success for stock investors. The Dow stood at only 6,547 at its financial-crisis low of March 9, 2009. It has now moved above 17,300, and Mr. Masters has reassessed the odds for further market gains. They are still good \u2014 but the probability of outstanding returns is not as high as it was. Investors with at least a moderate tolerance for risk should invest in stocks, he says, but they should lower their expectations and understand that the shoot-out-the-lights returns of the last five years aren\u2019t likely to continue right now. That\u2019s partly based on the assumption that the stock market is subject to \u201cmean reversion\u201d \u2014 the notion that what comes up must come down, and vice versa, with returns and valuations tending toward a mathematical middle ground. Valuations have gone up, into territory that has sometimes signaled trouble. While we don\u2019t have any real idea of where the market will go over the short term, history suggests once valuations are stretched, the market will probably have poorer returns over periods of five years or more. On the positive side, Mr. Masters considers it highly likely that the market will keep rising over the next few years (there will, no doubt, be periodic setbacks) and that we won\u2019t have to wait until 2022 to see Dow 20,000. The years 2017 or 2018 may be when that threshold will be crossed, he says, though he doesn\u2019t claim clairvoyance. \u201cBased on where we are now, it\u2019s just time to move up the schedule for a probable Dow 20,000,\u201d he says. \u201cThe market has already risen so much that we\u2019re in a new world.\u201dOf course, from where we stand now, Dow 20,000 in 2017 or 2018 isn\u2019t much of a reach. It represents a cumulative gain of less than 20 percent over several years. The market rose more than that last year alone, with a gain for the Dow of 26.5 percent, not counting dividends. But that was an extraordinary year. Over the last 20 years, Bernstein calculated, American stocks returned 9.6 percent, annualized, with dividends. Over the next five years, it projects returns of only 6.6 percent, annualized, precisely because the market has become more expensive as it has ascended to its current heights.Already at this level, there are indications that some investors are nervous, and nervous investors are prone to panic. That helps explain the fierce moves that racked the market early this autumn: Traders began to bid prices lower in a cascade that, for short periods, was self-reinforcing.Such sharp drops occur because the market isn\u2019t just a mathematical construct reflecting financial relationships. Fundamental valuations have a strong correlation with stock prices over the long term but not necessarily over the short term. As Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett\u2019s finance professor at Columbia University, put it, \u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine,\u201d but \u201cin the long run, it is a weighing machine.\u201dPart of what it weighs is the relationship between stock and bond returns. Mr. Masters estimates that even if stock returns are relatively modest, bond returns will probably be worse \u2014 only 2.2 percent, annualized, for domestic investment-grade bonds over the next five years, versus the historical return of 6.1 percent, annualized, over the last 20 years. In short, stocks are likely to outperform bonds by so much that it would be unwise to switch from stocks to bonds in order to find higher returns, Mr. Masters said. But stock markets in other developed countries are a better bet than in the United States over the next five years, with expected annualized returns for all such markets of 7.6 percent, versus 5.2 percent, annualized, over the last 20 years, Bernstein estimated. Bonds are worth holding because they reduce the risk of big declines in investment portfolios, but their returns are likely to be so low that they will continue to cause severe problems for retirees and other people who rely on them for income, Mr. Masters said. \u201cIt\u2019s a balancing act,\u201d he said. \u201cIndividuals need to figure out the amount of risk they can afford to take.\u201d While there\u2019s a risk of losing money in the stock market, there\u2019s a risk of running short of money if you depend too much on bonds.In a nutshell, it amounts to this: Expect lower stock returns than you may have received in recent years. Be steady, be diversified \u2014 and be prepared for problems, even if they\u2019re caused by good news.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Men Make Employment Gains", "Date": "2014-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsTHE men are finding work. For the first time since 2006, the unemployment rate for men in the United States has fallen below the rate for women \u2014 5.6 percent for men and 5.9 percent for women in October. In the depths of the financial crisis, the rate for men had climbed to as much as 2.6 percentage points above that for women.October was also the month that the number of private sector jobs held by men, according to the survey of employers, finally reached the level of June 2007, when male employment had peaked. In October, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated, 61,304,000 men were employed by private sector companies, 4,000 more than at the previous high.The accompanying charts show how the two sexes have fared since June 2007. Neither men nor women have as many government jobs as they did then, although women have come closer to a full recovery. The number of private sector jobs held by women, which had peaked in December 2007, rose above that level in June 2013.Men suffered far more in the recession, in part because occupations that are dominated by men were hard hit. Construction jobs \u2014 only about an eighth of which are held by women \u2014 were devastated, falling nearly 30 percent from the peak and, even now, are still well below 2007 levels. The number of jobs in education and health services, on the other hand, dipped by just 4 percent. More than three-quarters of those jobs are held by women. One area where the recovery has been much better for men than for women is financial services. Over all, women hold 57 percent of such jobs, but men have been more likely to find jobs recently. Compared with the June 2007 numbers, 1.5 percent more jobs are held by men, and 8.5 percent fewer jobs are held by women.In fact, of the 12 areas of the private economy shown in the charts, women have added jobs at a slower rate than men in all but three \u2014 retail trade, mining and logging, and construction. Women have a small minority of jobs in each of those areas other than retail, though, so those gains do not reflect a lot of hiring. As can be seen from the charts, the unemployment rate of prime-age men, 25 to 54 years of age, is now lower than that of women, and the rate of younger workers is the same for both sexes. Only in the over-55 age group do men have a higher unemployment rate than women.The overall rate for men is now less than 1 percentage point above where it was in June 2007, and the rate for women is only 1.5 percentage points higher. But appearances can be misleading. Unemployment rates do not include those who have chosen to leave the labor force, and a significant number of people under 55 have chosen to do so. If most of them came back to the labor force over the next couple of years, the unemployment rate might stop falling, or even rise, but the labor market, for both men and women, would be healthier than it is now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Immigration Issue Pushes Cameron Into a Corner", "Date": "2014-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyDavid Cameron is on the verge of making a historic error. The Sunday Times says the British prime minister has already decided to set an annual cap on the number of Continental Europeans who are legally entitled to work in the country. But it seems more likely that he is still agonizing over exactly what to say on immigration in a speech promised before the end of the year.The snag is that imposing quotas would infringe on the European Union treaty commitment to allow free movement of people. If Britain just goes ahead and stops people from going there to work, it will be hauled up in front of the European Court of Justice.More likely, Mr. Cameron will seek to secure the right to set a cap on immigration as part of his plan to renegotiate Britain\u2019s relationship with the European Union before holding a referendum on whether the country should stay in the 28-nation bloc. The problem is that it is inconceivable that he can negotiate such a deal.Therefore, if the prime minister commits himself to getting the right to impose quotas, the logic of his position will force him to campaign to quit the union \u2014 assuming, that is, he wins next year\u2019s general election and is in a position to hold his promised in/out referendum.Few people believe Mr. Cameron wants to pull Britain out of the European Union. He seems to understand that it would be bad for Britain\u2019s prosperity and influence. But he is increasingly boxed in by the rise of the U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP, which wants Britain to quit the Union and has succeeded in persuading many voters that immigration is the most important issue facing the country.Last month, a member of Parliament from Mr. Cameron\u2019s Conservatives switched to UKIP and won a landslide special election. A second defecting legislator is expected to win a special election this month. The Tories are panicking because they fear they will lose next year\u2019s election as a result of its voters\u2019 turning instead to UKIP.Meanwhile, Boris Johnson, the popular Conservative mayor of London, has come out in favor of quotas on European Union immigrants. Mr. Johnson plans to become a member of Parliament next year, putting him in pole position to take over the party if Mr. Cameron slips.Mr. Cameron is, therefore, under huge pressure to match Mr. Johnson\u2019s pledge on quotas \u2014 to hold off the external threat from UKIP and the internal threat from the London mayor.The prime minister\u2019s allies at home and abroad must try their hardest to stop him from making this error.Other European Union leaders should make it clear to Mr. Cameron that they have a red line when it comes to the free movement of people. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has already done this. But others should do so, too, either privately or publicly.It would be great if other European Union leaders could at the same time offer Mr. Cameron an olive branch. They should repeat Ms. Merkel\u2019s message that while the free movement of people is nonnegotiable, they support tightening up the rules so that it is harder for immigrants to abuse benefit systems.Very few Continental Europeans actually come to Britain to live off benefits. But the voters have been so whipped up into believing that they are being swamped by scroungers that Mr. Cameron unfortunately needs to secure some deal on this topic.Other European Union leaders should also make it clear that they are sympathetic to Britain\u2019s ideas for overhauling the bloc \u2014 like cutting red tape, completing the single market in services and decentralizing decisions where possible.But beyond that, there is little they can do to save Mr. Cameron from himself, apart from stressing the risks of quitting the Union. Many of his Conservatives think they can have their cake and eat it: leave the bloc but still retain full access to its single market.So it would be useful if Ms. Merkel and others said this would be impossible. They could stress that Switzerland doesn\u2019t get a passport for its banking industry to operate in the Union, despite allowing free movement of people; and that if Britain quit and imposed quotas, it would get even less access.But it is not just foreign leaders who should be trying to bend Mr. Cameron\u2019s mind. British businesses need to say publicly that they are opposed to quotas on commercial grounds and that they are worried that promising to introduce them could put Britain on a fast track to quitting the Union.It might even be helpful if business leaders, most of whom normally back the Conservatives, made clear they were rethinking their support. Although Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition, is not an appealing prospect as prime minister, at least he wouldn\u2019t take Britain out of the European Union.The other person who might be able to influence Cameron is Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister. His Liberal Democrats want to stay in the Union. He should, therefore, tell the prime minister that there\u2019s no way he will renew the coalition after the election if Mr. Cameron insists on quotas.The prime minister will make his mind up in the next few weeks. European Union leaders, British businesses and Mr. Clegg need to make their moves fast.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.C.B. Threatened to End Funding Unless Ireland Took Bailout, Letters Show", "Date": "2014-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Newly released documents suggest that Ireland was pressured into a controversial 67.5 billion euro bailout that left taxpayers rescuing crippled banks, reigniting a fierce debate about the international aid that Dublin accepted after the financial crash.The documents, dating from 2010, also show the European Central Bank\u2019s role in determining the scope of the aid program. One indicates that the central bank, based in Frankfurt, threatened to cut off emergency support for Ireland\u2019s failing banks unless the country applied for an international rescue.At the time, the eurozone authorities were determined to protect senior bondholders from losses in order to preserve confidence in the European banking system, a policy that was reversed in other cases as the debt crisis wore on. That specific issue was not referred to directly in a letter written by Jean-Claude Trichet, who was then the president of the European Central Bank, to Brian Lenihan, who was the Irish finance minister at the time and died in 2011. The letter was sent two days before Ireland sought its bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.Mr. Trichet wrote that the position of the central bank\u2019s governing council was that it was \u201conly if we receive in writing a commitment from the Irish government\u201d to seek international assistance \u201cthat we can authorize further provisions of E.L.A. to Irish financial institutions.\u201d He was referring to Emergency Liquidity Assistance.Ireland\u2019s request should include a commitment to undertake \u201cdecisive actions in the areas of fiscal consolidation, structural reforms and financial sector restructuring\u201d in agreement with international partners, the letter added.An earlier letter from Mr. Trichet referred to the \u201cextraordinarily large provision of liquidity by the Eurosystem to Irish banks in recent weeks.\u201dMario Draghi, Mr. Trichet\u2019s successor at the central bank, defended its actions at a news conference on Thursday.\u201cThe decision to ask for a program was the government\u2019s,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cIt was not the E.C.B. forcing the government to do this.\u201dBrian M. Lucey, professor of finance at Trinity College, Dublin, said the letter showed that the European Central Bank was more involved in the details of the bailout than he expected and that \u201cthey were trying to make things up as they went along \u2014 there were no clear rules.\u201dThe fact the bank was \u201cthrowing its weight around\u201d did not help the image of the bailout, Professor Lucey said, adding that while most Irish citizens accept that Ireland made big mistakes, they resented the shape of the rescue.The European Central Bank or the bondholders of crashed Irish banks should have borne some of the financial pain, Mr. Lucey added.\u201cHistory will judge this as having been the wrong decision,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, the burden should have been spread and it wasn\u2019t.\u201dIn a statement on Thursday, the E.C.B. defended its actions.\u201cIt was not the letter that \u2018pushed Ireland into a program\u2019 as is sometimes claimed,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt was the scale of the domestic crisis that made it necessary for Ireland to apply for an E.U./I.M.F. adjustment program.\u201dBut the handling of the crisis by eurozone officials remains highly contentious. Simon Tilford, deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London, said it was \u201cshocking\u201d to see so little acknowledgment from the president of the E.C.B. that the eurozone creditors who financed Ireland\u2019s property bubble bore some responsibility for the crash.\u201cMost people that think objectively about the eurozone crisis now fully appreciate that the handling of this was deeply flawed, and that the Irish crisis could have been handled with less damage to the Irish economy,\u201d he said.The Irish government said little on Thursday about the release of the letters, though Finance Minister Michael Noonan said they would be reviewed by a parliamentary committee looking into the banking crisis.Last year, Ireland ended is reliance on international loans and left the bailout program, although repayments to international lenders will take many years to complete, with the final one due in 2042.Douglas Dalby contributed reporting\nfrom Dublin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Takes Stronger Measures, Albeit Symbolic, to Condemn Israeli Policies", "Date": "2014-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter years of mounting frustrations widely expressed but rarely acted on, politicians from Britain, France, Spain and Sweden have embraced symbolic steps to pressure Israel into a more accommodating stance toward the Palestinians.Last week, European Union foreign ministers issued a statement that condemned the growing violence in the Israeli-Palestinian relationship, Israeli expropriation of land near Bethlehem in the West Bank, and plans for new settlement construction, and urged Israel to change its policy on Gaza.It ended with an unusual warning: \u201cThe future development of relations with both the Israeli and Palestinian partners will also depend on their engagement toward a lasting peace based on a two-state solution.\u201dDahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli analyst and pollster, said, \u201cIsrael is losing Europe on three levels: Public opinion has shifted decidedly against Israel in most E.U. countries, the E.U. itself is increasingly thinking about and implementing policies against Israel\u2019s presence in the West Bank, and, most recently, the waves of parliamentary discussions and votes in favor of recognizing Palestinian statehood.\u201dStatements and nonbinding votes in support of a Palestinian state do not seem likely to have an immediate, tangible impact on Israel\u2019s core political or economic interests. Israel continues to enjoy good diplomatic relations with the major European powers.Yet the actions reflect surging antipathy in Europe\u2019s public discourse that threatens to drown out residual support for the Jewish state. Many leaders do not rule out sanctions on Israeli interests, especially in territories beyond the country\u2019s 1967 boundaries, if they see no progress toward a two-state solution.The tone sharpened in response to the war in Gaza this summer and to continuing Israeli settlement expansion, which European leaders call illegal.European diplomats have been discussing what actions the European Union might take \u2014 in addition to recognizing a Palestinian state, symbolically or otherwise \u2014 to promote a two-state solution in the absence of negotiations toward that end.Perhaps most of all, said Vincent Fean, Britain\u2019s consul general in Jerusalem from 2010 until this year, Europe is deeply troubled by \u201cthe one-state outcome, where Israel is heading fast.\u201dThe changing atmosphere presents dangers for Israel. The European Union is Israel\u2019s biggest trading partner, at nearly 30 billion euros (about $37.4 billion) a year, and provides it with tariff-free access to the bloc\u2019s 28 member states. For many European nations, Israel is an important partner in high technology, intelligence and defense, including arms purchases.Beyond that, most Israelis see themselves as more aligned culturally with Europe than with the United States or the Middle East. The prospect of being cut off \u2014 through the introduction of visas, say \u2014 would be a terrible shock.\u201cMost of Israel cares very much,\u201d said Shlomo Avineri, a former diplomat who teaches at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere else in the world where people wake up and are disturbed by what a newspaper in London or Stockholm says.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Avineri said he was alarmed by how some Israeli hard-liners disregard the shift in tone in Europe.\u201cThere are people in the Israeli government for the first time who are messianic fanatics,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t care what the world thinks, either because they believe God is on their side, so who cares what Brussels thinks, or because they want Armageddon, after which all will be fine.\u201dIsraeli leaders reject much of the European criticism of their policies as betraying a deep bias or lack of understanding. It is Palestinian leaders, not Israelis, they say, who have declined to engage substantively in the peace process. They argue that radical Islamists among the Palestinians, including Hamas, conduct armed struggle and terrorist attacks against Israelis, leaving the country no choice but to take tough security measures. Some blame an increasingly organized and vocal subset of Muslims for the shifting opinions in Europe.Moreover, they say, the chaos that followed the Arab Spring, and the quick rise of extremist groups like the Islamic State, underscored how easily a poorly governed Palestinian state could threaten Israel\u2019s existence.Europeans have focused on Israeli settlement activity, which they see as illegal under international law and as fundamentally at odds with public vows by Israeli leaders to pursue a two-state solution. They draw a sharp legal distinction between pre-1967 Israel and occupied territories.Daniel Levy, a Middle East expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the era of a \u201ccost-free occupation\u201d of Palestinian lands, as defined by the 1967 borders, was coming to an end. European officials are threatening sanctions for what Israel does outside those borders, including settlement expansion.So far, symbolic gestures like recognizing Palestine or limiting academic cooperation to pre-1967 Israel have had little impact.\u201cBut the next time the European frustration or egregious Israeli action hits a certain bar, then you\u2019ll start to hit tangible issues and not just symbolic ones,\u201d Mr. Levy said. Some suggest that European actions might include visa restrictions for Israeli leaders who reject a two-state solution, or even economic sanctions against companies doing business on occupied land.Avi Primor, head of European studies at Tel Aviv University and a former Israeli ambassador to Germany and the European Union, acknowledged \u201cthe loss of European public opinion.\u201dStill, many Israelis do not seem to care, Mr. Primor said \u2014 so \u201cit does not change anything for the government,\u201d which dismisses most criticism as anti-Semitic, and will not affect elections.\u201cPublic opinion in Israel has learned that international criticism does not hurt us,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes this damage something? Bring sanctions? No. The dogs bark and the caravan moves on.\u201dForeign Minister Avigdor Lieberman last month compared European criticism of Israel and support for the Palestinians to \u201cEurope\u2019s attitude toward Czechoslovakia in 1938.\u201d He also said that increasingly large Muslim communities in Europe were influencing government views.The frustration in Europe has led diplomats from some leading countries to begin informal discussions about how to encourage movement toward a two-state solution. They say they are weighing possible actions, including sanctions, against settler organizations and Israeli politicians like Naftali Bennett, the economy minister, who oppose a Palestinian state as no longer \u201crealistic.\u201dSenior European Union officials said these discussions, which began in September after a burst of Israeli settlement activity, were at a low level and had produced no agreement. They are more indicative, one official said, \u201cof growing frustration with the absence of serious efforts to find a negotiated solution.\u201dThere is a great gap between these early talks, which have been opened by diplomats from individual countries, and serious action by the European Union, which would require unanimity among the 28 member states.\u201cThis is a theoretical exercise that stems from member states\u2019 trying to think through ideas about what to do if the whole project fails,\u201d the official said.At the United Nations, too, there are European efforts, led by Britain and France, to draft a Security Council resolution urging talks. The French ambassador to the United Nations, Fran\u00e7ois Delattre, told the Council this month that Europe must \u201cassume its responsibilities\u201d and work to give Palestinians a more equal status with Israelis.\u201cIt is no longer acceptable for the Security Council to remain a bystander to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\u201d Mr. Delattre said. \u201cOf course, if nothing can replace the negotiations between the parties, Security Council action to establish a balanced framework for the negotiations must be seriously considered.\u201dNigel Sheinwald, a former British ambassador to the United States and the European Union, recalled growing up Jewish in North London when Israel was revered as a plucky, brave outpost of the West that had arisen from the ashes of the Holocaust. That image is long gone.\u201cThe change from that high point to the levels of public antipathy toward Israel today is quite serious,\u201d Mr. Sheinwald said. \u201cThe single thing that has changed perceptions of Israel and increased the sense of frustration is simply the sense that this Israeli government, even more than its predecessors, has been averse to serious negotiations with the Palestinians.\u201dEuropean officials also worry about some young Muslims\u2019 attraction to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, which they say is partly inspired by sympathy with the Palestinian cause.For now, symbolism rules. Sweden in October granted recognition to a Palestinian state. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said in a recent visit to the United Nations that the move was not intended to take sides in the conflict, but to spur talks.\u201cEveryone says we need a negotiated solution. That\u2019s also what we want,\u201d Mr. Lofven said. \u201cWe need to make these two partners a little less unequal.\u201dSweden, he added, would like to see \u201ctwo partners, being two states, negotiating.\u201dThe British and Spanish Parliaments urged their governments to do the same as Sweden, and similar nonbinding votes are scheduled soon in France and in the European Parliament.But Europe must be careful, warned Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations and president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. \u201cIn general, these European initiatives don\u2019t contribute to diplomacy, and strengthen the Palestinian proclivity for unilateralism,\u201d he said, \u201cso it can have the exact opposite effect from what Europeans want.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Nov. 23 about a growing movement among European governments to recognize Palestinian sovereignty erroneously attributed a distinction to Sweden in some editions. Several European countries, including Malta, Albania and Cyprus, recognized Palestine as a state in 1988, immediately after the Palestine National Council declared independence; Sweden was not the first to do so.Irit Pazner Garshowitz contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Somini Sengupta from the United Nations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Downside of the Boom", "Date": "2014-11-22", "News": "WILLISTON, N.D. \u2014 In early August 2013, Arlene Skurupey of Blacksburg, Va., got an animated call from the normally taciturn farmer who rents her family land in Billings County, N.D. There had been an accident at the Skurupey 1-9H oil well. \u201cOh, my gosh, the gold is blowing,\u201d she said he told her. \u201cBakken gold.\u201dIt was the 11th blowout since 2006 at a North Dakota well operated by Continental Resources, the most prolific producer in the booming Bakken oil patch. Spewing some 173,250 gallons of potential pollutants, the eruption, undisclosed at the time, was serious enough to bring the Oklahoma-based company\u2019s chairman and chief executive, Harold G. Hamm, to the remote scene.It was not the first or most catastrophic blowout visited by Mr. Hamm, a sharecropper\u2019s son who became the wealthiest oilman in America and energy adviser to Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential campaign. Two years earlier, a towering derrick in Golden Valley County had erupted into flames and toppled, leaving three workers badly burned. \u201cI was a human torch,\u201d said the driller, Andrew J. Rohr.Blowouts represent the riskiest failure in the oil business. Yet, despite these serious injuries and some 115,000 gallons spilled in those first 10 blowouts, the North Dakota Industrial Commission, which regulates the drilling and production of oil and gas, did not penalize Continental until the 11th.In 2011, Andrew J. Rohr and two other workers were badly burned when a towering derrick erupted into flames and toppled. \u201cI was a human torch,\u201d Mr. Rohr said.The commission \u2014 the governor, attorney general and agriculture commissioner \u2014 imposed a $75,000 penalty. Earlier this year, though, the commission, as it often does, suspended 90 percent of the fine, settling for $7,500 after Continental blamed \u201can irresponsible supervisor\u201d \u2014 just as it had blamed Mr. Rohr and his crew, contract workers, for the blowout that left them traumatized.Since 2006, when advances in hydraulic fracturing \u2014 fracking \u2014 and horizontal drilling began unlocking a trove of sweet crude oil in the Bakken shale formation, North Dakota has shed its identity as an agricultural state in decline to become an oil powerhouse second only to Texas. A small state that believes in small government, it took on the oversight of a multibillion-dollar industry with a slender regulatory system built on neighborly trust, verbal warnings and second chances.In recent years, as the boom really exploded, the number of reported spills, leaks, fires and blowouts has soared, with an increase in spillage that outpaces the increase in oil production, an investigation by The New York Times found. Yet, even as the state has hired more oil field inspectors and imposed new regulations, forgiveness remains embedded in the Industrial Commission\u2019s approach to an industry that has given North Dakota the fastest-growing economy and lowest jobless rate in the country.For those who champion fossil fuels as the key to America\u2019s energy independence, North Dakota is an unrivaled success, a place where fracking has provoked little of the divisive environmental debate that takes place elsewhere. Its state leaders rarely mention the underside of the boom and do not release even summary statistics about environmental incidents and enforcement measures.Over the past nine months, using previously undisclosed and unanalyzed records, bolstered by scores of interviews in North Dakota, The Times has pieced together a detailed accounting of the industry\u2019s environmental record and the state\u2019s approach to managing the \u201ccarbon rush.\u201dThe Times found that the Industrial Commission wields its power to penalize the industry only as a last resort. It rarely pursues formal complaints and typically settles those for about 10 percent of the assessed penalties. Since 2006, the commission has collected an estimated $1.1 million in fines. This is a pittance compared with the $33 million (including some reimbursements for cleanups) collected by Texas\u2019 equivalent authority over roughly the same period, when Texas produced four times the oil.\u201cWe\u2019re spoiling the child by sparing the rod,\u201d said Daryl Peterson, a farmer who has filed a complaint seeking to compel the state to punish oil companies for spills that contaminated his land. \u201cWe should be using the sword, not the feather.\u201dNorth Dakota\u2019s oil and gas regulatory setup is highly unusual in that it puts three top elected officials directly in charge of an industry that, through its executives and political action committees, can and does contribute to the officials\u2019 campaigns. Mr. Hamm and other Continental officials, for instance, have contributed $39,900 to the commissioners since 2010. John B. Hess, chief executive of Hess Oil, the state\u2019s second-biggest oil producer, contributed $25,000 to Gov. Jack Dalrymple in 2012.State regulators say they deliberately choose a collaborative rather than punitive approach because they view the large independent companies that dominate the Bakken as responsible and as their necessary allies in policing the oil fields. They prefer to work alongside industry to develop new guidelines or regulations when problems like overflowing waste, radioactive waste, leaking pipelines, and flaring gas become too glaring to ignore.Daryl Peterson taste-tests the residue left by a wastewater spill on land he farms. The highly saline spill rendered the land useless.Mr. Dalrymple\u2019s office said in a statement: \u201cThe North Dakota Industrial Commission has adopted some of the most stringent oil and gas production regulations in the country to enhance protections for our water, air and land. At the same time, the state has significantly increased staffing to enforce environmental protections. Our track record is one of increased regulation and oversight.\u201dResearchers who study government enforcement generally conclude that \u201cthe cooperative approach doesn\u2019t seem to generate results\u201d while \u201cthe evidence shows that increased monitoring and increased enforcement will reduce the incidence of oil spills,\u201d said Mark A. Cohen, a Vanderbilt University professor who led a team advising the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling.With spills steadily rising in North Dakota, evidence gathered by The Times suggests that the cooperative approach is not working that well for the state, where the Industrial Commission shares industry oversight with the state\u2019s Health Department and federal agencies.One environmental incident for every 11 wells in 2006, for instance, became one for every six last year, The Times found.Through early October of this year, companies reported 3.8 million gallons spilled, nearly as much as in 2011 and 2012 combined.Over all, more than 18.4 million gallons of oils and chemicals spilled, leaked or misted into the air, soil and waters of North Dakota from 2006 through early October 2014. (In addition, the oil industry reported spilling 5.2 million gallons of nontoxic substances, mostly fresh water, which can alter the environment and carry contaminants.)The spill numbers derive from estimates, and sometimes serious underestimates, reported to the state by the industry. State officials, who rarely discuss them publicly, sometimes use them to present a rosier image. Over the summer, speaking to farmers in the town of Antler, Lynn D. Helms, the director of the Department of Mineral Resources, announced \u201ca little bit of good news\u201d: The spill rate per well was \u201csteady or down.\u201d In fact, the rate has risen sharply since the early days of the boom.Presented with The Times\u2019s data analysis, and asked if the state was doing an effective job at preventing spills, Mr. Helms struck a more sober note. \u201cWe\u2019re doing O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing great.\u201dHe noted it is a federal agency, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, that regulates oil transmission pipelines. \u201cYou can\u2019t use the spills P.H.M.S.A. was responsible for and conclude my approach to regulation is not working,\u201d he said.More than 18 million gallons of oil and toxic wastewater were spilled in North Dakota from January 2006 to October 2014. Most individual spills were contained to the immediate drilling area, but many of the largest spills polluted surrounding farms and waterways.Indeed, as the tangle of buried pipelines has grown, there have been no federal pipeline inspectors based in North Dakota. But there have been no state inspectors, either, to oversee the much larger network of gathering pipelines unregulated by the federal government \u2014 a fount of many spills.Penalizing companies for every violation is imprudent and can be counterproductive, Mr. Helms said, potentially \u201cleaving the citizens of North Dakota with enormous liabilities on their hands when bankrupt operators walk away.\u201dContinental Resources hardly seems likely to walk away from its 1.2 million leased acres in the Bakken. It has reaped substantial profit from the boom, with $2.8 billion in net income from 2006 through 2013.But the company, which has a former North Dakota governor on its board, has been treated with leniency by the Industrial Commission.From 2006 through August, it reported more spills and environmental incidents (937) and a greater volume of spillage (1.6 million gallons) than any other operator. It spilled more per barrel of oil produced than any of the state\u2019s other major producers. Since 2006, however, the company has paid the Industrial Commission $20,000 out of $222,000 in assessed fines.Continental said in a written response to questions that it was misleading to compare its spill record with that of other operators because \u201cwe are not aware other operators report spills as transparently and proactively as we do.\u201d It said that it had recovered the majority of what it spilled, and that penalty reductions came from providing the Industrial Commission \u201cwith precisely the information it needs to enforce its regulations fairly.\u201dWhat Continental paid Mr. Rohr, the injured driller, is guarded by a confidentiality agreement negotiated after a jury was impaneled for a trial this September. His wife, Winnie, said she wished the trial had gone forward \u201cso the truth could come out, but we just didn\u2019t have enough power to fight them.\u201dLooking back now, one thing gnaws at her.\u201cYou know what really bothered me?\u201d Mrs. Rohr said. \u201cHarold Hamm flew up to see the damage to the rig but didn\u2019t go see the guys who were burned.\u201dGiven the state\u2019s history of population loss and economic decline, state officials delighted in the arrival of oil companies eager to exploit the tremendous untapped potential of the primeval Bakken formation deep beneath the sweeping prairies and rugged badlands of western North Dakota.Especially during the first years, officials were anxious that this oil boom, like previous ones, could be fleeting, that oil companies, if not embraced, could shift their rigs and capital investment to fields with less severe winters and better access to markets.\u201cThere was a mentality that we should be helping things along, not getting in the way with regulations,\u201d said Todd Sattler, a lawyer who served as a state oil and gas hearing officer through mid-2011. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t blatant disregard for bad things, just permissive.\u201dMr. Sattler said he tried to establish a protocol for field investigations, preparing a three-page checklist of procedures, including how to conduct witness interviews. The response from the state\u2019s chief inspector, he said, was: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be a cop out there, Todd.\u201dLynn D. Helms, the director of the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources, advocates a collaborative, not punitive,\u00a0 approach to oil industry enforcement.In 2006, the Industrial Commission issued 419 drilling permits, processing applications in five days. By 2011, when it handed out 1,927 permits, it was still managing to issue them in 10 days. At that point, concerned that the Environmental Protection Agency might establish a moratorium on fracking \u2014 the legislature set aside $1 million to sue the E.P.A. \u2014 there was a desire to establish facts on the ground.Some officials in western North Dakota challenged the accelerating pace. \u201cIt was so ragtag and breathless,\u201d said Dan Kalil, the Williams County Commission chairman. \u201cInfrastructure in every facet wasn\u2019t able to keep up.\u201dRon Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say it\u2019s been too fast, too much. But this is what North Dakotans have hoped for, prayed for.\u201d Investors from all over the country are now drawn to tiny, remote places like Watford City, where \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a damn thing\u201d seven years ago, he said.\u201cWe\u2019ve got the largest-producing Cinnabon anywhere in the world,\u201d he said. (The Williston Cinnabon, more precisely, has the highest sales in a travel plaza, the company said.)In the first five years, the \u201cslow, nasty drip, drip, drip\u201d of routine spills \u2014 as Edmund Baker, environmental director for the Fort Berthold Reservation in the heart of the oil patch, calls it \u2014 went largely unnoticed and sometimes unreported to the authorities.In the spring thaw of 2011, however, after a winter of record snowfall, scores of oil waste pits overflowed at once. The large, open pits, adjacent to rigs throughout the Bakken at that point, disgorged oil-based drilling mud that mixed with snowmelt and streamed across farmland and into stock ponds, creeks and river tributaries.Farmers were horrified; the local news media took note. And, in concert with the development of a new regulation outlawing liquid waste pits, the Industrial Commission undertook its first \u2014 and so far only \u2014 crackdown on spills. It filed several dozen formal complaints against companies that, Mr. Helms said, had defied the Mineral Resources Department\u2019s warning to take precautions to prevent the predicted overflows.Hess Oil was one target. It paid its fines in full: $112,500.Continental, like some other companies, disputed its responsibility.Its lawyer, a former counsel to the Industrial Commission, proposed that consent agreements state that the overflows were caused by unforeseeable extreme weather. Instead, the agreements attributed the violations \u201cin part\u201d to bad weather \u201cunforeseen by Continental.\u201dAn oil drilling rig in Williston, N.D., which proudly welcomes visitors to \u201cBoomtown U.S.A.\u201d\u00a0Still, the Industrial Commission accepted $12,500 rather than $125,000.That fall, at a commission meeting in Bismarck, Mr. Helms explained the logic behind the waste pit settlements.Most companies would make \u201ca voluntary 10 percent payment\u201d and 90 percent would be suspended for a year, during which the operator would have to \u201ckeep completely clean\u201d of the offense, Mr. Helms said, according to the meeting minutes. This works, he added, because \u201ckeeping that 90 percent hanging over their head for a year creates a culture change within the company.\u201dMr. Helms said this had been departmental practice since the early 2000s when officials were trying to prod Earl Schwartz of GoFor Oil \u2014 his logo was a gopher in a hard hat \u2014 to plug some wells and start production on others.Sarah Vogel, a former Industrial Commission member, said she considered it a startling admission that current policy was based on \u201cthe treatment of a small wildcatter from an earlier era.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s absurd to compare an Earl Schwartz to a Hess or any of these other enormous companies worth billions,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, announcing publicly that it is your practice to suspend the bulk of all fines makes a mockery of the whole enforcement system. Should we tell the general public that if they\u2019re caught speeding, the fine is $100, but they only have to pay $10? It\u2019s an invitation to violate the law.\u201dBearded and deliberative, Mr. Helms is a petroleum engineer by trade, with a hand that bears the burn scars of an industrial accident. The state\u2019s senior oil official since 2005, he previously worked at Texaco for two years and at Hess for 18.To his critics, Mr. Helms personifies a cozy relationship between the commission and oil companies. His dual mission heightens this, they say, as he is compelled by statute both to promote \u201cthe greatest possible economic recovery of oil and gas\u201d and to enforce regulations.Mr. Helms, however, said that his background gives him access and authority, and that his job is to promote responsible development, not the industry.\u201cIn order to effectively do that I have to be on a first-name basis with C.E.O.s and managers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t trust me, and if they expected every time they made a mistake they were going to get slapped with a great big fine or be singled out or profiled, I wouldn\u2019t get straight answers.\u201dThe commission has imposed its stiffest penalties on smaller companies. Last year, it fined Halek Operating, whose leader had a history of swindling investors in Texas, a record $1.5 million for a defective waste disposal well that threatened a town\u2019s water supply. But Halek has gone out of business, and the state is unlikely to obtain more than the $140,000 in bonds it has seized.Mr. Helms said that problems in the oil patch were often the fault not of the major companies but of the contractors who do their physical labor.\u201cThe large independents \u2014 the bread and butter of the North Dakota oil industry \u2014 really understand their social license to operate and really try to emphasize environment, health and safety,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a disconnect.\u201dL. David Glatt, Mr. Helms\u2019s counterpart in the Health Department\u2019s environmental division, has voiced the same sentiment. Though the state\u2019s chief environmental regulator, he described himself on a radio show last year as \u201cnot a regulations guy\u201d \u2014 after the host said that \u201cthe word \u2018regulation\u2019 is like Lucifer\u201d in North Dakota.Before the boom, Mr. Glatt said in an interview, the Health Department had \u201ca very hands-on, personalized approach, going out and helping people solve their problems.\u201dHarold G. Hamm, the chairman and chief executive of Continental Resources, the top producer in North Dakota\u2019s booming Bakken oil patch.\u201cNow with the oil boom bringing in people who are just here to make a living or make money,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are being forced to change our regulatory approach to in some cases a very heavy-handed one, which is a paradigm shift for us.\u201dJudging by the data, the Health Department, overseen by civil servants and not elected officials, appears to have been tougher on the oil industry than the Industrial Commission has. It has collected over three-quarters of the fines levied, amounting to at least $4.1 million since 2006.Still, most of that revenue derived from a single industrywide enforcement action that, Mr. Glatt said, the industry itself requested.After years of underestimating volatile emissions from its oil storage tanks in the Bakken and allowing them to vent directly into the air, the industry \u201cself-reported\u201d the potential pollution and safety problem to the government.A task force was formed; the companies devised a new model for estimating the emissions and pledged to control them through devices. And then they made a request: \u201cThey wanted fines to be collected by the state to reduce their exposure to lawsuits,\u201d Mr. Glatt said. \u201cWe said, \u2018Sure, we\u2019d be more than happy to take your money.\u2019 \u201dThe Health Department did not publicize that it collected record penalties for these violations last year: $2.64 million, including unprecedented sums like $418,500 from Hess and $305,400 from Continental.\u201cWe are not wired like that,\u201d Mr. Glatt said. \u201cIt goes to the fact that, honestly, when I get to the point where I have to collect a penalty, I look at that as a failure on our part.\u201dA ranch in Epping, N.D., is dotted with oil rigs and sliced by oil service roads. It sits along the road to the Lewis and Clark State Park.At her isolated farmhouse near Tioga, Patricia Jensen disarms guests \u2014 pipeline executives, oil spill cleaners \u2014 with a glistening berry pie fresh from the oven. She and her husband, Steven, are firm but nonconfrontational in their approach to what he calls the \u201cecological nightmare\u201d in the backyard of the family\u2019s century-old homestead.\u201cWe\u2019ve kind of taken a route of not being too sour, but yet we\u2019re really concerned,\u201d Mr. Jensen said.What happened to them last fall \u2014 considered the largest on-land oil spill in recent American history \u2014 confronted North Dakota with the potential costs of the boom.It shined a light on the state government\u2019s lack of transparency when it went unreported to the public for 11 days. It raised awareness that spills of all magnitudes were daily and routine. It highlighted the inadequacy of pipeline monitoring.And it made clear that even in the worst cases the authorities are hesitant to use punitive sanctions. More than a year after the spill, neither the federal nor the state government has penalized the company responsible, Tesoro Logistics of San Antonio.\u201cClearly, they have impacted the groundwater system,\u201d Mr. Glatt said. \u201cThere will be an enforcement action. But we use a carrot and stick approach. The carrot is if you get into it and clean it quickly, the stick won\u2019t be as severe.\u201dLate last September, Mr. Jensen was harvesting waist-high durum wheat when he found his combine\u2019s tires wet with an unmistakable sheen. His wife called the operator of a nearby well, which contacted Tesoro, and both companies immediately sent out representatives.\u201cIt was dark out at this point,\u201d Mrs. Jensen said. \u201cWe went to drive wide around what we thought was the spill and realized that we were not at the edge of it. We were still in it.\u201dMr. Jensen continued: \u201cThere was a question of, well, whose line is it? It was squirting out of the ground. But the minute Tesoro shut its valve, there was a loud sucking sound.\u201dIn its initial report, Tesoro seriously underestimated the contamination. A week and a half later, after a \u201csubsurface assessment\u201d request by the state, it tripled its estimate to 20,600 barrels, or 865,200 gallons. The lost oil had soaked a large stretch \u2014 equal to about six football fields \u2014 of the windswept land where the Jensens run cattle and rotate crops like sunflowers and sunshine-yellow canola.The spill was publicly disclosed only after local reporters learned of it, provoking an outcry from environmentalists that led to the creation of a spills website.In Tioga, a preliminary investigation found a small hole in the pipeline that appeared to have been caused by lightning, said the federal pipeline administration, whose final investigation has yet to be completed.On Patricia and Steven Jensen\u2019s farm near Tioga, N.D., a pipeline break last summer resulted in the largest spill of fracked oil in American history.That cast the incident as an act of nature, but Tesoro officials now acknowledge that the hole had gone undetected for as long as two months.\u201cHow do you lose over 20,000 barrels of oil and not realize it?\u201d Mr. Glatt said. \u201cThat does kind of boggle the mind a little bit.\u201dIn a statement to The Times, Tesoro expressed \u201cdeep regret.\u201d\u201cOur systems did not prevent the spill, and we find that unacceptable,\u201d it said. \u201cWe have put additional systems and controls in place and are committed to operating a safe pipeline system.\u201dBefore the leak sprang in July 2013, Tesoro had not conducted an internal inspection of that segment of pipeline for eight years. Federal officials had last inspected the Tesoro network in North Dakota in 2010.Pipeline leaks are not the most common cause of spills; valve or piping connection problems are, The Times found. But they spew the greatest volume of oil and wastewater and are the most likely to cause pollution.Unlike several other major oil-producing states, North Dakota has until now relied on federal inspectors \u2014 based in Kansas City, Mo., 950 miles from Tioga \u2014 to monitor all its oil transmission lines, interstate and intrastate.At the time of the spill, Brian Kalk, chairman of the state Public Service Commission, felt keenly frustrated, he said: \u201cThe company was not as forthright as they should have been. Everybody in the state was asking what\u2019s going on, and I didn\u2019t have jurisdiction on this pipeline. I didn\u2019t like it.\u201dAs a result, Mr. Kalk\u2019s commission is seeking to take over the monitoring of the crude oil transmission pipelines that travel solely within the state.Transmission pipelines, which carry oil to market, are not the only problem, however. Until this year, no authority, federal or state, monitored what Mr. Helms estimates to be 18,000 miles of gathering pipelines, which transport oil and wastewater from wells to collection sites. In fact, the North Dakota government does not even know their precise locations.But, with legislative permission, Mr. Helms is taking the gathering lines under his aegis and hiring the state\u2019s first three hazardous-liquid pipeline inspectors.In Tioga, the Jensens are inclined to look at the bright side, though 33 acres of their farmland have been cordoned off for an industrial cleanup operation expected to take at least another year. They are glad that their spill was oil, not wastewater \u2014 \u201cThere\u2019s no cleaning up of that,\u201d Mr. Jensen said \u2014 and hope it served as \u201can eye-opener.\u201d\u201cThe industry really wants to fight putting monitoring devices on pipelines, but it\u2019s a no-brainer, seems like,\u201d Mr. Jensen said. \u201cThe cost of monitoring equipment is obviously far cheaper than the cost of cleanup.\u201dTesoro said the cleanup would cost more than an initial estimate of $4 million and \u201cless than $25 million.\u201d It hired a Canadian company, Nelson Environmental Remediation, to treat the contaminated soil by burning it on site in \u201cthermal desorption units.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re kind of like the proctologists of the industry,\u201d said Warren Nelson, the company\u2019s vice president. \u201cWe deal with the problems nobody wants to talk about.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve kind of taken a route of not being too sour, but yet we\u2019re really concerned,\u201d said Steven Jensen, whose farmland was covered by oil from a pipeline break.The lost oil soaked a large stretch \u2014 equal to about six football fields \u2014 of the windswept land where the Jensens run cattle and farm.The site of the spill is still being actively cleaned. Neither the federal nor the state government has penalized the company responsible.\u201cThe industry really wants to fight putting monitoring devices on pipelines, but it\u2019s a no-brainer, seems like,\u201d Mr. Jensen said.One August evening this year, after a barbecue dinner beneath an elaborate skull-and-antler chandelier in the Outlaw Shack at Antler Memorial Park, Mr. Helms and Mr. Glatt faced an audience of farmers disgruntled by the wastewater contamination of northwestern North Dakota.Their corner of the state is like a cautionary tale. It is pocked with the remnants of 1980s oil production: abandoned wastewater ponds, some of which leached brine downward and outward, sterilizing the soil and shriveling crops. State officials have estimated it would cost $2 million each to reclaim what might amount to 1,000 ponds, said State Representative Marvin E. Nelson.\u201cWell, we have more than $2 billion in our Legacy Fund,\u201d he said, referring to a set-aside fund containing oil tax revenues. \u201cSo why not take the legacy from this oil boom to fix the legacy from the last oil boom?\u201dThough the industry now disposes of oil field brine primarily by injecting it deep underground, it still needs to be transported to disposal wells and remains a stubborn pollution problem. For every barrel of oil, about 1.4 barrels of brine is produced, state officials say, and far more of it spills than does oil.And while the industry calls it saltwater \u2014 \u201cwhich makes it sound harmless, like something you would gargle with,\u201d said Derrick Braaten, a lawyer who represents farmers \u2014 it is highly saline and can be laced with toxic metals and radioactive substances.Three years ago, a farmer in the Antler audience experienced one of the largest oil field wastewater spills ever in North Dakota. A leaking wastewater line contaminated some 24 acres of farmland and eight surface ponds, and the site has yet to be restored to health.After the leak was detected, cleanup crews pumped out two million gallons of severely contaminated water, with chloride levels 2,700 times higher than normal, and a generator was still pumping out contaminants this summer.\u201cThree years!\u201d the farmer, Darwin Peterson, exclaimed at the meeting. \u201cThree years, and this spill has been addressed in a Band-Aid fashion. Meanwhile, that 24 acres has expanded, with Mother Nature, to the neighbors. When is enough enough?\u201dState officials say the spill far exceeded the 12,600 gallons originally reported by the company, Petro Harvester, though it remains listed that way on the state\u2019s spills website. Mr. Helms, in an email last year to his spokeswoman, Alison Ritter, estimated it at 332,000 gallons. Mr. Nelson, the legislator and agronomist, thinks it probably was three times that much.A farmer working a field, foreground, near oil wells outside Epping. North Dakota has shed its identity as an agricultural state in decline to become an oil powerhouse second only to Texas.The state has not yet penalized Petro Harvester.Underlying the state\u2019s regulatory posture is the premise that spills are all but inevitable and will increase alongside increases in drilling. But that is not a universally shared perspective.\u201cThere\u2019s this idea that spills are just the cost of doing business,\u201d said Amy Mall, a senior policy analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cBut there\u2019s no technical justification for all these spills. And it\u2019s not acceptable. It\u2019s just not. It just shows how poorly the oil and gas industry is doing its job, and that nobody is making them do it right.\u201dTo a skeptical audience in Antler, Mr. Helms proclaimed that North Dakota was \u201chead and shoulders above our sister states\u201d in the region for its vigilance as measured by the ratio of wells to inspectors, the frequency of inspections and the authority to fine up to $12,500 per offense a day.He said that almost all problems found by his inspectors were corrected within 30 days of verbal warnings. Some 2,500 warnings were issued last year, Ms. Ritter said; only 4 percent resulted in a written violation and only nine complaints were filed (up from four in 2012).In the park, Mr. Helms offered a boardroom-style PowerPoint presentation, including a graphic that he said contained the \u201cgood news\u201d that the spill rate per well was steady or down.His figures, however, provided to The Times later, show that the number of spills continued to grow faster than the number of wells \u2014 just not as fast as before. All told, the number of wells is up 200 percent and spills 650 percent since 2004.The farmers in Antler said they assumed Mr. Helms\u2019s spills data was comprehensive, but he told The Times later that he was including only spills under his jurisdiction. That omitted hundreds of incidents, including the Jensens\u2019 spill and the 464,000 gallons of oil that gushed from a fiery train derailment near Casselton last December.The most encouraging statistic, Mr. Helms told the farmers, was that a higher proportion of individual spills were being contained to production sites. That is true according to the numbers he uses. But, looking at the actual volume of pollutants and all reported spills, The Times found a decline, not an improvement, in spill containment \u2014 with 45 percent contained from 2011 to 2013, down from 62 percent in the previous three years.Without engaging in any data analysis, the farmers in Antler were suspicious of the spill estimates because they were based on self-reporting by the industry. \u201cYou take the word of the operators? That\u2019s your first mistake,\u201d one man said, to laughter. They remarked that their own spills were often drastically underestimated on the state\u2019s spills website.Indeed, The Times found scores of cases on that website where the release of pollutants was not just undercounted but marked as zero. One supposedly zero-volume wastewater spill in Bottineau County last year required the removal of 600 dump-truck loads of contaminated soil.For a North Dakotan trying to make sense of the state\u2019s environmental and enforcement records, numbers are essentially inaccessible. The state spills site posts incidents in chronological order, without summary statistics, and it is not searchable. Oil and gas enforcement data is not made public at all, unlike in Texas, where the legislature mandates quarterly reports.The Times built a database to analyze the state\u2019s raw information from a variety of perspectives, including a company-by-company assessment. It found that companies in the Bakken spill at different rates. This suggests to some experts that companies could do more to prevent and minimize environmental incidents.\u201cWhether it\u2019s maintaining equipment properly, monitoring equipment routinely, training individuals well, having backup equipment on site or having containment machinery \u2014 there are all kinds of things that can be done,\u201d Professor Cohen of Vanderbilt said. \u201cBut they all require money and attention.\u201dThis database contains all reported spills from Jan. 1, 2006, to Oct. 13, 2014.Statoil, a multinational company whose largest shareholder is the Norwegian government, now ranks as the state\u2019s fifth-biggest producer. With a professed goal of \u201czero incidents, zero releases,\u201d according to Russell Rankin, its regional manager, it has reported no blowouts and has the best record in the state among the major producers in terms of how many gallons of oil it produces for each incident.Based on volume, Statoil has produced 9,000 gallons of oil for every gallon of spillage; Continental has produced 3,500. Statoil contained some 70 percent of its spill volume to production sites. Continental contained less than half, The Times found.In its written response, Continental disputed The Times\u2019s \u201cmath,\u201d but did not respond further after it was sent a spreadsheet of reported incidents that formed the basis for the findings.Continental, which on its website calls itself \u201cAmerica\u2019s oil champion,\u201d said it has \u201cimplemented a corporate policy focused on reporting, spill reduction and, ultimately, elimination.\u201d It emphasized that it was the largest producer in the Bakken and \u201cmanaged the largest volume of liquids.\u201d It underscored that \u201cour diligent spill response efforts have enabled us to recover the majority of all volumes spilled.\u201dAnd, Continental said, The Times should not imply that \u201cvolumes spilled remain in the environment in perpetuity and that we and other operators have no concern for doing anything more than reporting spills as \u2018an inevitable byproduct of oil production.\u2019 \u201dAt a park in Antler this summer, Lynn D. Helms, the state\u2019s senior oil official, addressed an audience of farmers disgruntled by wastewater contamination.The farmers were suspicious of spill estimates because they are based on self-reporting by the industry.L. David Glatt, the state\u2019s chief environmental regulator, also at the meeting in Antler. He said on a radio show last spring, \u201cI\u2019m not a regulations guy.\u201dBrenda Jorgenson, 61, has been a persistent thorn in the side of oil field companies and state officials.When the Skurupey well blew out last summer, Continental waited some 10 hours to notify the local authorities.\u201cThey should have called us a lot sooner, but when these things happen, the oil companies pretty much take over, \" said Sheriff Dave Jurgens of Billings County. \u201cThey have their own security, and they don\u2019t let anybody on location, unless you\u2019re with Continental or the state Industrial Commission. And I totally understand why. It\u2019s specialized-type stuff.\u201dThe public never knew the blowout had occurred because the well, like many new wells, had been granted confidential status by the state for competitive reasons; almost everything except its existence was off the record for six months.Oil, water and chemicals shot 40 feet into the air from the wellhead but did not ignite. One worker was injured with a broken finger and bruises to his head and chest, the sheriff said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t call an ambulance, just put him in a pickup and took him to the E.R.,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was not very wise on their part.\u201dThe oil misted over hundreds of acres, contaminating hundreds of bales of hay and alfalfa fields.\u201cThey redid the land, washed all the tanks,\u201d Mrs. Skurupey said. \u201cContinental was super-nice. They left no stones unturned, as far as I was concerned. They paid us all for damages, and we signed agreements that we wouldn\u2019t sue.\u201dDefending itself against the commission\u2019s enforcement action this year, Continental argued that its own investigation revealed that \u201can irresponsible supervisor\u2019s callous disregard of\u201d its \u201cwell-established standard operating procedures\u201d caused the Skurupey blowout.At the Williston courthouse in September, Continental\u2019s lawyer, Steven J. Adams of Tulsa, Okla., placed the responsibility for the previous blowout in Golden Valley County squarely on Mr. Rohr and his crew, who worked for Cyclone Drilling of Wyoming.\u201cIt was the Cyclone crew that failed to do its job,\u201d he told the jury.Mr. Rohr\u2019s lawyer, Justin L. Williams of Corpus Christi, Tex., opened by suggesting that Continental prized speed over safety: \u201cPedal to the metal, no brakes, lives shattered.\u201dMr. Rohr, the injured driller, sued Continental Resources. The case was settled. His wife, Winnie, said she wished the trial had gone forward \u201cso the truth could come out, but we just didn\u2019t have enough power to fight them.\u201dThe wreckage of the rig Mr. Rohr and his co-workers were working on.During the voir dire process, many prospective jurors had revealed just how interwoven their lives were not only with the oil industry, but also with Continental. Some had worked for or done business with Continental; others owned its stock or received royalty checks from Continental wells.Asked if they had strong feelings about the oil boom, almost all, even those who saw the positive, raised their hands to say they thought it had had negative consequences, too. A landowner referred to oil sludge buried and flares burning on her property, a nurse to injured oil workers treated at her clinic, an oil field technician to a \u201churry up and wait world\u201d that put profits first.The next morning, a settlement was reached.Later, in a nearby hotel, sitting with his lawyers, his wife and a former co-worker, Mr. Rohr lifted his T-shirt to reveal what he had been prepared to show the jury: his pink, waffled back, patched together through skin grafts after the rig at the Beaver Creek State 1-36H well exploded into flames on July 24, 2011.\u201cMy memories of it are bad,\u201d he said. \u201cI seen a big, bright, white light, and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d make it out. And then that big blast hit me. I was a big ball of flame, running out of there, my safety glasses melting around my eyes. I thought I was blind. Dying.\u201dMr. Rohr, who is called A.J., stared into his coffee cup, crying.Erick Hartse, 23, who had been his assistant driller and escaped injury in the blowout, winced. \u201cI have a lot of guilt,\u201d he said. \u201cI sent A.J. down to check the inside choke that day. It was per our blowout procedures, but I was the last one to see this guy unhurt, unscathed.\u201dMr. Rohr and two colleagues were airlifted to a burn center in Minneapolis. With serious burns over 60 percent of his body. Mr. Rohr spent a month hospitalized. Still in constant pain and reliant on painkillers, he has not returned to the oil fields, the only job he has ever known.The two men and their boss, Wally Dschaak, said they thought from the start that the well, situated in a remote, serene spot about a mile from the Little Missouri River, was going to give them trouble.\u201cFrom the day we moved onto that miserable, slimy, dirty location, things had been fighting us,\u201d Mr. Hartse said.Mr. Dschaak said, \u201cThat well was one step away from getting out of control at all times.\u201dContinental, which declined to discuss the case, imported oil fire specialists from Texas to extinguish the blaze. Later, Cyclone sent Mr. Hartse to Wyoming to help build a replacement rig, he said, but did not allow him to accompany it back to North Dakota. \u201cContinental wanted no part of anybody who was there that day,\u201d Mr. Hartse said.\u201cI understood Cyclone\u2019s position,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill the goose that lays the golden egg.\u201dAfter an unusual land deal, a giant spill and a tanker-train explosion, anxiety began to ripple across the prairie.\n            Gov.

{"Headline": "Defying Industry Trend, Virgin Hotels Resists Tacked-On Fees", "Date": "2014-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the RoadA NEW hotel company plans to buck the trend when it opens its first property, in Chicago, in January by not charging travelers those annoying extra fees, while allowing reservation cancellations till late on the day a guest is scheduled to arrive.Set to open in mid-January, the Virgin Hotel Chicago will not impose fees on various things that other hotels routinely charge for, including high-speed Wi-Fi and business center services. And travelers will be able to cancel a reservation as late as midnight on the day of arrival without being charged.\u201cWe really tried to home in on the pain points that customers complain about,\u201d said Laura Kilroy, a spokeswoman for Virgin Hotels, which also plans to open a hotel in Nashville in 2016 and in New York in 2017, and has said that London is among the other cities it is considering in an eventual introduction of 25 hotels with the same policies.Virgin\u2019s no-fee and liberal cancellation policies are in contrast to a trend among hotel companies, which have been increasing revenue by adding surcharges to the basic room rate for various services that will total a record $2.25 billion this year, according to a forecast by Bjorn Hanson of the New York University Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism and Sports Management.As we all know, airlines for years have been busily adding fees on top of basic fares for services including seat choice, preferred boarding-queue position and checked bags. And there was more bad news for fliers last week when JetBlue, an airline that is especially popular with business travelers on transcontinental routes, said it would start charging basic-fare passengers to check a bag. This will leave Southwest as the only major domestic airline not charging for checked bags. JetBlue also said it would refit its cabins to add more seats.In the hotel industry, which is experiencing record occupancy rates this year in the United States, fees and surcharges are, oddly enough, most common at higher-priced hotels in the four-star and five-star niches, like big-city convention and luxury hotels, as well as resorts. In many of these hotels, it is not unusual for guests to be charged $14 for in-room Wi-Fi service, or various other fees for using the hotel business center or room-service delivery. Conversely, most midlevel and economy hotels include Wi-Fi and other services in the basic room rate, and many even include free breakfast and free airport shuttle service.The cancellation policy changes at Marriott and Hilton apply to all of their brands. Cancellation rules at those hotels and resorts that already have stricter policies \u2014 sometimes requiring three or more days\u2019 notice \u2014 will not be affected.The changes will increase fee revenue. But several business travelers pointed out another reason for these changes. When planning a trip, many travelers book directly on the hotel\u2019s website to guarantee the room. But hotel room rates fluctuate, so, closer to their departure date, they check third-party booking sites like Hotels.com, Orbitz or Expedia. If they find a better rate, they book that and cancel the initial reservation with the hotel, knowing there is no penalty.\u201cYou make the secure booking, and then when you\u2019re ready to go, you check around online. If I find a cheaper rate on another site like Hotels.com, and I\u2019m not being penalized for canceling the first reservation, I\u2019m going to jump on that better rate,\u201d said Jayne M. Cronin, a Texas businesswoman who travels frequently. \u201cSurely if I figured this out, and I\u2019m not a professional travel agent, lots of other people did too, so I completely understand that hotels need to protect themselves with stricter cancellation policies.\u201dAs to hotel fees, the best sure way around many of them is by earning elite status in a hotel\u2019s loyalty program, which can provide benefits like free Wi-Fi and upgrades. But Virgin Hotels plans to drill deeper by eliminating extra charges even on things like room service delivery or using the printer in the business center.Virgin also plans to confront hotel-room minibar annoyances by charging \u201cstreet prices\u201d for drinks, candy bars and other snacks, comparable to what a traveler would find at a grocery store, Ms. Kilroy said.\u201cI was just in a hotel where I was charged $8 for a bottle of water in my room. I paid it only because it was 12 o\u2019clock at night, and I was dying for a glass of water,\u201d she said.That reminded me of the very expensive Snickers bar that I grabbed from my room minibar when I arrived late one night recently at a four-star convention hotel, famished after an all-day journey in airline coach purgatory.\u201cYou just hate yourself after eating a $7 Snickers bar,\u201d I said.\u201cFor multiple reasons,\u201d she replied.Email: jsharkey@nytimes.com Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Philip M. Crane, Former Illinois Congressman and Conservative Leader, Dies at 84", "Date": "2014-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFormer Representative Philip M. Crane of Illinois, who fought for conservative causes in 35 years in the House and who made a failed run for president in 1980, died on Saturday in Jefferson, Md. He was 84.The cause was lung cancer, his family said.But long before the wider political world took notice, Mr. Crane was spreading the conservative message. In the wake of Barry Goldwater\u2019s 1964 defeat \u2014 Mr. Crane worked for him in Illinois \u2014 he spoke at dozens of colleges for the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, a nonprofit that promotes conservative thought on campus.He won his House seat in 1969 in a special election to succeed Donald Rumsfeld, who had resigned to work in the Nixon administration. The most conservative of seven hopefuls, Mr. Crane won the Republican primary with 23 percent of the vote. Campaigning to end all trade with communist countries and to ban aid to nations that did trade with them, he won the general election easily. No Democrat had won the district since 1912.But his most innovative step was to put on the first political infomercial, a half-hour program shown 209 times around the country. Mr. Crane presided, calling the canal \u201cthe American Canal at the Isthmus of Panama,\u201d which he insisted was \u201cvital to our economy, our national defense and our spirit.\u201d He introduced other speakers and urged viewers to write their senators and send money to the American Conservative Union. The organization turned a profit and sharply increased its membership after the broadcasts.The treaties were approved by the Senate in March 1978, but Mr. Crane drew on the recognition he had received to run for president. With good looks that some compared to John F. Kennedy, he promised to make the conservative case energetically, citing the age difference between him and Reagan (47 years old to 67).Although he had campaigned for Reagan in 1976, he said he was not sure Reagan would run again because of his age. Announcing in August 1978, he said he had to start so early because he was relatively unknown.But his campaign was disorganized and hindered by accusations that he was dividing conservative voters. In fact, he drew few of them, getting only 7 percent of the vote in the Iowa primary and 1 percent in New Hampshire in 1980. Mr. Crane dropped out and endorsed Reagan in April 1980.He had left the chairmanship of the Conservative Union in 1979, and though he continued to win re-election easily, he was no longer a major figure on the right. But his voting record never wavered. Over his career, he got a 99 percent rating from the American Conservative Union.He was not known as a lawmaker, though in 1974 he won passage of legislation permitting the private ownership of gold. In a 2011 interview for this obituary, he said that was the proudest achievement of his career.But after Republicans won control of Congress in 1994, his role on the Ways and Means Committee became more important. A staunch advocate of free trade, he worked with Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat, to reduce tariffs on products from Africa. And despite opposition from some conservatives, he successfully pushed legislation establishing permanent normal trade relations with China in 2000.That same year, he underwent treatment for alcoholism, at the insistence of friends. He later told reporters that he had sometimes consumed 10 Heinekens in an evening. \u201cAlcohol drains your energy,\u201d he said. \u201cAbsent it, I feel more energetic and I have more time to engage in constructive things.\u201dIn the 2011 interview, he traced his conservative views to his parents\u2019 lessons, from the staunch conservatism of dinner table talk to attending his father\u2019s church classes to working for things he wanted, at 10 cents an hour, on the family\u2019s Indiana farm.He earned a B.A. from Hillsdale College in 1952, served in the Army and worked in advertising. He obtained a Ph.D. from Indiana University in 1963.Survivors include his son, George; his daughters, Catherine Hott, Susanna Crane, Rebekah Crane, Jennifer Oliver, Sarah Crane and Carrie Crane; his brothers Daniel, also a former congressman, and David; his sister, Judy Ross; and numerous grandchildren. His wife, Arlene, died in 2012.He wrote three books and contributed to six others. But not all of his writing was serious.\u201cNow everybody loves him. And Santa loves him too,\u201d the song goes. \u201cAnd ever since on Christmas Eve, he\u2019s helped bring gifts to you.\u201dAn obituary on Monday about the former Illinois congressman Philip M. Crane misstated the name of the university from which he received a Ph.D. It is Indiana University \u2014 not the University of Indiana, which does not exist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Asia\u2019s \u2018Big Guy\u2019 Spreads Cash and Seeks Influence in Pacific Region", "Date": "2014-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisBEIJING \u2014 When China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, visited the Australian state of Tasmania last week, he was greeted by a front page of the local newspaper written in Chinese. He ate the island\u2019s salmon, which will soon be available in China, and met a rare beast known as the Tasmanian devil.While President Obama quickly returned to the White House after a series of Asian summits, Mr. Xi kept going. He spent more days than Mr. Obama did in Australia, America\u2019s staunch ally; toured New Zealand, another American ally; and flew to the tiny Pacific island of Fiji.Everywhere Mr. Xi went, he left a trail of money, a bounty aimed at showcasing China as the dominant economic power in Asia. The largess was wrapped in a long-range message: Don\u2019t worry, he suggested in his speeches. China, the \u201cbig guy,\u201d is friendly and worthy of consideration not only as an economic partner, but as a strategic one, too.From the opening of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Beijing nearly two weeks ago through Mr. Xi\u2019s tour in the Pacific, China announced that it would spend $70 billion on loans and infrastructure in the Asia-Pacific region, according to an analysis by the Australian National University.The impact of some of the money, like $40 billion for a Silk Road infrastructure fund in Central and East Asia, could be decades away, the university\u2019s East Asia Bureau of Economic Research said. Still, it noted that the $20 billion for loans and infrastructure for the 10 countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations was a substantial amount for projects that could come on line quite soon.The figures were particularly stark when stacked against American promises. The White House pledged $150 million for Myanmar during Mr. Obama\u2019s recent visit for an Asian summit. On the edges of the same meeting, China pledged $7.8 billion to refurbish decrepit roads and increase energy production.Mr. Xi has his own challenges in the region. China\u2019s ambitions to control more of the South China and East China Seas \u2014 including territory claimed by other countries \u2014 has set many of its neighbors on edge. Still, its financial ties in the region are undeniable.Besides promising money, the Chinese pushed hard on trade agreements that analysts say they view as being as much about diplomacy as about business.During the APEC summit, China called for the start of a new free-trade area in the Asia Pacific that Beijing advertised as more inclusive and less demanding in its rules than the Obama administration\u2019s pet project, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The partnership, is still being negotiated and does not include China.In Australia, Mr. Xi and the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, declared the completion of a China-Australia free-trade pact, 10 years in the making, that will open China\u2019s markets to Australian beef, dairy products and that Tasmanian salmon.\u201cThe last two weeks showed that in Asia, even though China is not a security partner, China is an important economic partner,\u201d said Wu Xinbo, director of American studies at the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University. \u201cIt shows the United States can say a lot about regional prosperity but doesn\u2019t do much. China only says some things, but does a lot.\u201dWhat Mr. Xi did say in Australia, though, was intended as reassurance backed by resolve.In an address to Parliament, he spoke of China\u2019s power relative to its regional neighbors. \u201cChina is a large country of over 1.3 billion people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is like the big guy in the crowd. Others naturally wonder how the big guy will move and act, and they may be concerned that the big guy may push them around, stand in their way or even take up their place.\u201dChina, he said, is interested in delivering development to the Asia-Pacific region through its own prosperity in \u201ca virtuous cycle of development and security.\u201dBeneath the reassurance, though, was a sharp message, reminding Australia that China would stand firm in upholding the \u201ccore interests\u201d of its sovereignty and territorial integrity.Looking at the longer term, Mr. Xi seemed to be trying to entice Australia, one of America\u2019s closest intelligence-sharing allies, away from its more than half-century alliance with Washington. \u201cWe have every reason to go beyond a commercial partnership to become strategic partners who have a shared vision and pursue common goals,\u201d Mr. Xi said.Hugh White, professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University, said: \u201cXi and his colleagues are very serious about their strategic ambitions. In the long run they believe that the gravitational force of China\u2019s economy will pull Australia into its political and strategic orbit and keep it there.\u201dMr. Obama was apparently attuned to what Mr. Xi might offer. Two days before the Chinese leader appeared before Parliament while in Australia for the Group of 20 summit, President Obama, in an address to university students there, essentially warned America\u2019s ally not to get too close to China.In not-so-oblique references to China\u2019s assertive behavior in strategic waters, Mr. Obama said, \u201cAn effective security order for Asia must be based not on spheres of influence, or coercion, or intimidation where big nations bully the small, but on alliances of mutual security, international law and international norms.\u201dMomentarily, at least, Australia seemed giddy about Mr. Xi. The Australian press, usually an unwavering proponent of the United States alliance, embraced the Chinese leader. Mr. Obama, by contrast, was criticized for implicitly raising objections in his speech at the university to Mr. Abbott\u2019s opposition to ambitious climate change goals.After appearing before Parliament, Mr. Xi, who was on his fifth visit to Australia \u2014 he visited several times as vice president \u2014 flew to Tasmania. In doing so, he completed a circuit of all seven of Australia\u2019s states. Not even Mr. Obama had accomplished that, Australian commentators said.The cold smoked Tasmanian salmon served to Mr. Xi at a Government House lunch was a product that, under the terms of the China-Australia free-trade pact, will start arriving in China next month. Tariffs on sales of the fish will disappear over the next four years, said Mark A. Ryan, chief executive of the Tassal Group, which farms and exports the salmon.The appearance of the salmon in Chinese markets will carry an early strategic favor for the Chinese government: The Tasmanian variety is expected to cut further into the sales of Norwegian salmon that have already dwindled since Norway\u2019s Nobel Committee awarded the 2010 Peace Prize to a jailed Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo.A news analysis article on Nov. 23 about efforts by China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, to showcase his country as the dominant economic power in Asia referred incorrectly to the front page of a local newspaper in the Australian state of Tasmania where he visited after a series of Asian summit meetings. The articles were written in Chinese \u2014 not in Mandarin, a form of spoken Chinese. (Standard written Chinese is based on Mandarin.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Solvency, Lost in the Fog at the Fed", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseWhen it comes to the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency lending powers, the crucial word is \u201csolvent.\u201d That\u2019s because both by tradition and, since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, by law, the Fed can use its emergency powers to make loans only to a solvent institution.But what did \u201csolvent\u201d mean to those officials?Recent testimony in the continuing litigation over the government\u2019s rescue of the insurance giant A.I.G. \u2014 its former chairman and chief executive, Maurice Greenberg, claims that the bailout was unconstitutionally punitive \u2014 suggests that solvency had little or nothing to do with the Fed\u2019s decision to lend. Numerous firms deemed insolvent nonetheless got emergency loans, while Lehman alone was denied one before it went bankrupt. Judging by their actions, Fed officials seemed to have defined solvency on a case-by-case basis.Consider the testimony of Timothy Geithner, who later served as Treasury secretary. As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York when the financial crisis unfolded, Mr. Geithner had to make the crucial determination of which firms under his jurisdiction (which included Wall Street) were solvent and thus eligible for emergency relief. When questioned by David Boies, the lawyer for Mr. Greenberg, Mr. Geithner struggled to define \u201csolvent.\u201d\u201cEven the solvent can be illiquid in that context, and that would make them insolvent,\u201d Mr. Geithner testified. \u201cSo, as I said here,\u201d referring to notes he produced as part of the litigation, \u201ccomplete fog of diagnostic problem.\u201dBut how can a firm be both solvent and insolvent at the same time? And how could such an important determination be a \u201ccomplete fog\u201d to the president of the New York Fed?To be fair, Mr. Geithner was backed into something of a corner by Mr. Boies, who as part of the discovery process obtained notes in which Mr. Geithner wrote, without any qualification, \u201cCertainly Citi and Bank of America were insolvent.\u201d Yet both Citigroup and Bank of America received emergency loans from the Fed. Mr. Geithner also agreed that there were serious questions as to A.I.G.\u2019s solvency, and A.I.G., too, received extensive Fed support.As he put it: \u201cRelative to many other institutions getting caught up in that storm, Citi and B of A were at the weaker end of that spectrum. If all were insolvent because they became illiquid, then they were all \u2014 they were certainly insolvent.\u201dLegal memo from 1999, introduced at the A.I.G. trial, written by a lawyer at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Joseph H. Sommer.Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Geithner declined to elaborate on his testimony.Hal S. Scott, a professor at Harvard Law School and the author of \u201cThe Global Financial Crisis,\u201d says the bottom line is, \u201cSolvent is pretty much whatever the Fed says it is.\u201d He added: \u201cI have a lot of sympathy for what Geithner was trying to say. It\u2019s difficult in the middle of a run or a panic to determine whether something is insolvent, because you don\u2019t know how to value the assets. At the end of the day, it\u2019s an art, not science. The issue of how does a lender of last resort determine whether an institution is, or isn\u2019t, solvent has been one of the most difficult problems for a very long time.\u201dMarvin Goodfriend, a professor at the Carnegie Mellon Tepper School of Business who spent 12 years as a policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to define insolvency in a financial crisis, since it depends on the behavior of the entire financial system,\u201d he said. \u201cSolvency is only well defined when a particular firm is in trouble but the rest of the economy is O.K. When you come to a systemic problem, where the Fed\u2019s very action has a bearing on whether those firms are solvent or not, you have a Catch-22 problem that can\u2019t be solved.\u201dThe Fed seems to have been well aware of the issue. In a legal memo from 1999 produced at the A.I.G. trial, a lawyer at the New York Fed, Joseph H. Sommer, cautioned that the Fed\u2019s emergency lending \u201cmust be an exercise in on-the-fly policy making.\u201d And he posed two questions that, in light of the financial crisis, seem prescient: \u201cDoes the lending bank have enough time to make a reasoned decision?\u201d and \u201cDoes the lending bank understand the procedural consequences of its actions?\u201dAfter the financial crisis, and facing persistent questions as to why some firms were bailed out and others weren\u2019t, Congress sought to clarify the Fed\u2019s emergency lending powers as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Federal Reserve Act was amended to make it explicit that only solvent firms qualified for loans, and the act further defined \u201cinsolvent\u201d to mean \u201cin bankruptcy\u201d or other insolvency proceeding at the time of the loan request. But that definition is so broad as to be all but meaningless. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge loophole,\u201d Professor Goodfriend said. By that standard, Lehman Brothers was plainly solvent, since it wasn\u2019t in bankruptcy proceedings when it sought the Fed\u2019s support.A spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve in Washington and a spokesman for the New York Fed declined to comment.The Federal Reserve\u2019s friends and foes alike seem to agree that the current state of affairs is untenable and that the nation is ill prepared for another crisis. They argue that either the Fed should have broad discretion to lend in an emergency, without being hobbled by technical definitions of solvency and ambiguous limits to its powers, or it shouldn\u2019t have any discretion at all.Those wanting to curb the Fed\u2019s powers \u201cdon\u2019t really want a better definition of solvency,\u201d Professor Scott said. \u201cThey want the function of lender of last resort itself taken away. I think that would be a disaster. The Fed was created to be a lender of last resort to curb panics. Its monetary function came later.\u201dProfessor Goodfriend said, \u201cEither you give the Fed all the tools it needs, which I call the monarchist approach, or you give the fiscal authorities,\u201d meaning Congress, \u201cthe responsibility under the rule of law so the Fed doesn\u2019t get itself into impossible situations like A.I.G. and Lehman. I call that the republican approach, meaning republican in the classic sense, with a small \u2018r.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe issue is almost certain to heat up now that Republicans, with a capital \u201cr,\u201d have taken control of the Senate and expanded their majority in the House, since some of the most ardent critics of the Fed\u2019s emergency powers are Republicans (among them, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a possible presidential candidate). But the issue doesn\u2019t break along traditional party lines. Liberal Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have criticized what they deemed the Fed\u2019s bailout of wealthy Wall Street bankers. Senator Warren has joined a Republican senator, David Vitter of Louisiana, in calling for more curbs to the Fed\u2019s emergency lending powers.Whatever the political outcome, testimony in the A.I.G. case has further undermined the Fed\u2019s claim that it acted consistently during the financial crisis, rescuing only those firms that were solvent while letting an insolvent Lehman fail.\u201cIn my opinion, A.I.G. was clearly insolvent, but they lent to them anyway,\u201d Professor Scott said. \u201cAnd Lehman, whether it was insolvent or not, that wasn\u2019t the issue. The Fed and Treasury were getting hammered on a daily basis for bailing out Bear Stearns, and they decided they had to teach Lehman a lesson.\u201dProfessor Goodfriend agreed that the Fed and the Treasury Department acted \u201cinconsistently\u201d in their handling of the solvency question during the financial crisis: \u201cThere was ambiguity about the extent to which the Fed could support the fiscal system. That was deadly because they ran afoul of the fiscal authorities in Congress, and then there was open warfare. That took us from a serious downturn into the Great Recession.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Increasing barriers to obtain cash from refinance products will not eliminate the underlying pressure on homeowners who need their equity savings for rising educational costs or unexpected medical expenses.The broader economic conditions of the middle class are also the reason it is not appropriate to point the finger exclusively at the mortgage industry. The majority of mortgage transactions \u2014 home purchase or refinance \u2014 are not through big banks but through local mortgage companies, mortgage brokers and community banks.Like the consumers they serve, these companies, brokers and banks were not the creators or the driving force behind modern subprime lending.

But there is another developing line of thought in Iran that is far more hopeful, and reflects the desires of many urban Iranians. Some insiders say that a nuclear deal is being planned by powerful figures in the Iranian leadership as the start of a fundamental shift in Iran\u2019s ideology, aimed not only at normalizing relations with the world but also at rebranding the now 35-year-old Islamic Revolution, turning away from its founding principles of anti-imperialism, anti-Americanism and strict limits on personal freedoms.There was nothing of that in the air at the state-sanctioned hard-liners meeting, however, where copies of a book of speeches by Ayatollah Khamenei, with a title taken from one of his most famous quotes, \u201cI Am a Revolutionary, Not a Diplomat,\u201d were selling well for around 50 cents a copy. Inside the auditorium, a smiling young man led a lone foreigner to a seat, as a cinema-size screen showed portraits of several Iranian nuclear scientists who were killed from 2010 to 2012, \u201cby the Americans,\u201d as one speaker insisted.\u201cWhat are these nuclear dealings that no one has information about?\u201d asked one cleric, Hamid Rouhani, no relation to President Rouhani. \u201cIt is as if we have returned to the time of the monarchy, with secret deals without involvement of the people.\u201dSumming up their position, one young man held up a yellow placard proclaiming: \u201cNo Compromise. No Submission. Only Fighting With America.\u201dThe ease and confidence with which hard-line representatives organize such meetings \u2014 where visitors walk over American flags and, recently, shout things like \u201cDeath to Obama\u201d \u2014 are signs of their deep hold on power in Iran. In contrast, Iran\u2019s Interior Ministry, which is controlled by the government, has not allowed public rallies or meetings to denounce the negotiations.\u201cIn the name of our almighty God, who is greater than American imperialism,\u201d said Alireza Mataji, a 26-year old organizer of the event, \u201cwe are granted permits for meetings because we represent the people and pay ourselves.\u201dTheir march to power, which has given them control over the judiciary, Parliament, the security forces and large parts of the economy, was partly facilitated by Iran\u2019s leaders. That has made people like Mr. Mataji loyal foot soldiers and firm ideological believers.The hard-liners say they operate under the banner of Iran\u2019s leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, who has repeatedly warned that he is \u201cnot optimistic\u201d over the chances of reaching a nuclear deal with the West and particularly the United States, which he regards as Iran\u2019s archenemy.\u201cWe will witness the leader coming out after a bad deal with a speech elaborating on why the United States cannot be trusted,\u201d Mr. Mataji said. \u201cAll except some wealthy people who are ready to sell out the country\u2019s sovereignty will understand the deceiving nature of the Americans.\u201dWhether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.Still, Ayatollah Khamenei has also publicly stated that no group can actively oppose the Iranian nuclear negotiators during the talks, labeling them \u201cchildren of the revolution.\u201d While expressing his doubts, he has emphasized that when talking to the enemy \u201cheroic flexibility\u201d can be a tactic in achieving Iran\u2019s goal of escaping sanctions while keeping its right to enrich uranium and pursue a peaceful nuclear program.In recent weeks, commentators here say, hard-liners have swallowed hard and followed Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s lead in supporting the nuclear team, outwardly, at least.\u201cThey stand to lose power, money and influence if the deal happens,\u201d said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to the government. \u201cNaturally, they are worried, but they will be isolated as many of the wealthy and key figures will join those leading the changes that are inevitably coming.\u201dFailure to complete a deal and a breakdown in the talks, many here say, would almost surely make Mr. Rouhani, the main promoter of d\u00e9tente, a lame-duck president, ending any chance of his executing his agenda of more personal freedoms and better international relations.If a deal is reached, though, they say the opposite could happen, and those who have been marginalized over the years by the hard-liners \u2014 the reformists, centrists, moderates and groups that have long and unsuccessfully promoted change \u2014 will be the beneficiaries.Surprisingly, a political adviser long aligned with Iran\u2019s hard-line faction predicts that this is precisely what is going to happen, with Iran repositioning itself after a successful agreement. \u201cIf there is a deal, and if it is good, the entire system will go along with it,\u201d said the adviser, Amir Mohebbian, who is close to several prominent Iranian leaders. \u201cThere will be a huge political shift after a deal.\u201dHe said that with the rise of Sunni radicalism in the Middle East, Iran\u2019s ideology of radical resistance against imperialism needs an update. \u201cWe strive to be the leading nation in the Islamic world, and faced with the Islamic State it is much better for us to attract support if we represent a moderate version of Islam. We still demand justice, but will try to get it in another way.\u201dMr. Mohebbian\u2019s views, based he says on contacts with the highest circles of Iran\u2019s establishment, are taboo, publicly, at least, among those holding power in Iran. But they are attuned to many if not most middle-class Iranians, who increasingly feel alienated from the rigid ideology that has remained frozen in time since the 1979 revolution.\u201cIt is my conviction that those who make decisions within the system want it to be alive and supported,\u201d he said. \u201cFor survival, we need change.\u201dSuch a prospect may seem far-fetched, in that consistently at critical moments over the past 15 years, Iran\u2019s leaders have thrown in their lot with the hard-liners, suppressing protests and promoting laws like a recent one against dog ownership to maintain harsh Islamic discipline.\u201cI am not saying we are Switzerland,\u201d Mr. Mohebbian said. \u201cWe have learned from history that if leaders show weakness they lose. But now our leaders feel strong and confident, so this is the moment for change.\u201dHard-liners laughingly dismiss such ideas.\u201cEven if there is a deal, Mr. Rouhani and like-minded people will be losers because it will not bring the prosperity that they have promised,\u201d said Mr. Mataji, the engineer and organizer of Monday\u2019s conference. \u201cAnybody who thinks this will bring about ideological change must be joking.\u201dBut Mr. Mohebbian insisted change was coming. All the stars have aligned, he said, the society is beyond ready, and regionally Iran is strong and the United States confirms that. He pointed to Iran\u2019s military successes in the region, the fact that in Yemen pro-Iranian rebels had seized power, that Iraq was under even more Iranian influence and that the United States seemingly had abandoned plans to remove Iran\u2019s ally in Syria, President Bashar al-Assad.\u201cThe fact that Obama writes letters directly to our leader Khamenei highlights Iran\u2019s importance and confidence,\u201d Mr. Mohebbian said. \u201cThis is a golden moment for us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China, America and Our Warming Planet", "Date": "2014-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBEIJING \u2014 The United States and China are the world\u2019s two largest economies, two largest consumers of energy, and two largest emitters of greenhouse gases. Together we account for about 40 percent of the world\u2019s emissions.We need to solve this problem together because neither one of us can solve it alone. Even if the United States somehow eliminated all of our domestic greenhouse gas emissions, it still wouldn\u2019t be enough to counteract the carbon pollution coming from China and the rest of the world. Likewise, even if China went down to zero emissions, it wouldn\u2019t make enough of a difference if the United States and the rest of the world didn\u2019t change direction.That\u2019s the reality of what we\u2019re up against. That\u2019s why it matters that the world\u2019s most consequential relationship has just produced something of great consequence in the fight against climate change.Our announcement can inject momentum into the global climate negotiations, which resume in less than three weeks in Lima, Peru, and culminate next year in Paris. The commitment of both presidents to take ambitious action in our own countries, and work closely to remove obstacles on the road to Paris, sends an important signal that we must get this agreement done, that we can get it done, and that we will get it done.The targets themselves are also important. Ambitious action by our countries together is the foundation to build the low-carbon global economy needed to combat climate change. The United States intends to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 \u2013 a target that is both ambitious and feasible. It roughly doubles the pace of carbon reductions in the period from 2020 to 2025 as compared to the period from 2005 to 2020. It puts us on a path to transform our economy, with emissions reductions on the order of 80 percent by 2050. It is grounded in an extensive analysis of the potential to reduce emissions in all sectors of our economy, with significant added benefits for health, clean air, and energy security.The Chinese targets also represent a major advance. For the first time China is announcing a peak year for its carbon emissions \u2013 around 2030 \u2013 along with a commitment to try to reach the peak earlier. That matters because over the past 15 years, China has accounted for roughly 60 percent of the growth in carbon dioxide emissions world-wide. We are confident that China can and will reach peak emissions before 2030, in light of President Xi\u2019s commitments to restructure the economy, dramatically reduce air pollution and stimulate an energy revolution.China is also announcing today that it would expand the share of total energy consumption coming from zero-emission sources (renewable and nuclear energy) to around 20 percent by 2030, sending a powerful signal to investors and energy markets around the world and helping accelerate the global transition to clean-energy economies. To meet its goal, China will need to deploy an additional 800 to 1,000 gigawatts of nuclear, wind, solar and other renewable generation capacity by 2030 \u2013 an enormous amount, about the same as all the coal-fired power plants in China today, and nearly as much as the total electricity generation capacity of the United States.There is no question that all of us will need to do more to push toward the de-carbonization of the global economy. But in climate diplomacy, as in life, you have to start at the beginning, and this breakthrough marks a fresh beginning. Two countries regarded for 20 years as the leaders of opposing camps in climate negotiations have come together to find common ground, determined to make lasting progress on an unprecedented global challenge. Let\u2019s ensure that this is the first step toward a world that is more prosperous and more secure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India\u2019s Obligation on Climate", "Date": "2014-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe breakthrough announcement last week by the United States and China of a deal setting limits on greenhouse gases has offered new hope for a global agreement on climate change. The U.S.-China deal follows the European Union\u2019s ambitious pledge to reduce emissions by 40 percent of 1990 levels by 2030. Now the world needs India, already the world\u2019s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, to add to the momentum. Without India on board, the best efforts of the rest of the world will not be enough. Which means that India must rethink its relationship with coal and redouble its investment in developing renewable energies.India\u2019s long-held position is that it will not sacrifice eradicating poverty to limit carbon emissions. Nearly 300 million Indians have no access to electricity, and millions more live with regular power cuts and brownouts. India\u2019s current share of global greenhouse gas emissions is 7 percent, compared with a combined share of about 45 percent for the United States and China. But India\u2019s economy is growing fast, and the energy infrastructure India builds now will determine its capacity to rein in emissions over the next critical decades for climate change. To its credit, India is making a big push for solar energy, and is home to Asia\u2019s largest solar plant. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to create a 50,000-strong \u201csolar army\u201d to help rapidly expand India\u2019s solar capacity \u2014 and train job-hungry young Indians in the technologies of the future.Unfortunately, India is also betting big on coal. In the last five years alone, India increased its coal power capacity by 73 percent. To fuel the new plants, India plans to double domestic coal production to one billion tons a year by 2019, and boost imports, notably from Australia. Pollution from India\u2019s coal plants \u2014 largely unregulated and unmonitored \u2014 kills up to 115,000 Indians a year, and costs India\u2019s economy as much as $4.6 billion. India\u2019s air is among the world\u2019s dirtiest. It is in India\u2019s interest to act. The droughts and floods that are likely to result from unchecked climate change will hit India particularly hard. The next round of climate talks convene in Lima, Peru, on Dec. 1. India should be willing to join other major emitters by indicating, at least in broad terms, how much it intends to limit greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 with details to be filled in at the climate summit meeting in Paris next year.

In this era of hyperpartisan politics, it is rare for an elected official to do or say the morally right thing without regard to the political consequences.To those who characterize Mr. Obama as acting as if he were an emperor, I would ask if Speaker John A. Boehner is acting any less imperial for refusing to allow a vote (which would almost certainly pass with bipartisan support) on the immigration bill already overwhelmingly passed by the Senate.This is not some theoretical issue; real lives are profoundly affected.\u00a0To the Editor:At a recent news conference before taking action on immigration, President Obama challenged Republicans, \u201cGive me a bill that addresses those issues, I\u2019ll be the first one to sign it and, metaphorically, I\u2019ll crumple up whatever executive actions that we take and we\u2019ll toss them in the wastebasket.\u201dPresident Obama has offered the Republicans in Congress the opportunity to cooperate. The ball is now on their side of the court.\u00a0To the Editor:Well-intentioned liberals impatient with the normal workings of the democratic process will rue the day they supported President Obama\u2019s expansion of executive power when a different administration wields it in a far more malevolent manner.\u00a0To the Editor:The big mistake we make is lumping together what are really four separate groups of undocumented immigrants.First, people entering illegally solely in pursuit of a better economic situation are, indeed, \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d and should not be tolerated.Second, families of undocumented immigrants, here for decades, American in all but paperwork, must be seen through a different lens.Third, the women and children fleeing Central American violence constitute a refugee crisis and should be handled accordingly.But the fourth and largest group, those who were encouraged to come here by American agribusiness and the hospitality industry to do work that most American citizens won\u2019t deign to do, must be given special consideration. The most obvious fix would be a guest worker program.Will it be messy sorting all this out? Of course. This issue has been festering for decades. Some who don\u2019t deserve amnesty will receive it. But no system is perfect, and we can\u2019t hold out for perfection in the face of this crisis.\u00a0To the Editor:After reading your editorial, I am left to wonder if the word \u201cillegal\u201d means anything anymore. Undocumented aliens are here illegally; they know it, and their supporters know it.What President Obama intends to do by executive action is also lawless, according to many constitutional scholars. The \u201cchaotic status quo\u201d you describe will become even more chaotic, and the attendees at his immigration rally at a Las Vegas high school will learn close up that crime pays.How can this possibly be a good lesson for the youth of our country or a good beginning for this undocumented community?\u00a0To the Editor:I fail to understand many people\u2019s lack of empathy for the plight of illegal immigrants. Under the \u201cright\u201d conditions, there are many of us who would take similar action \u2014 illicit action \u2014 to ensure our family\u2019s safety and security. But because of the availability of public assistance in this country \u2014 programs the G.O.P. is clamoring to gut \u2014 Americans do not have to resort to illegal immigration to address their family\u2019s needs, at least not yet.It seems to me that if the United States spent less money on fences and deportation and more on helping Mexico improve its economy, we would be taking steps to render illegal immigration unnecessary. And isn\u2019t that what everybody wants?\u00a0To the Editor:Gov. Paul R. LePage of Maine, who adopted a boy from Jamaica, is quoted as saying \u201cit took us nearly 11 years\u201d to get a green card for his son. He then irrationally states, \u201cWhy should everybody just get one tomorrow?\u201dA more reasonable \u2014 and empathetic \u2014 response would be, \u201cNo one should have to go through the 11 years of bureaucratic hurdles that we did to enable our son to be here legally.\u201d The system is truly broken and must be changed. Unfortunately, the immigration system seems to be the one area of government that conservatives don\u2019t want to attack.I write this as an active Republican who hopes that the Republicans can apply their antigovernment sentiments to the dysfunctional and inhumane immigration system we now have.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Workers in Silicon Valley Weigh In on Obama\u2019s Immigration Action", "Date": "2014-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s constant stream of new apps and services depends on hundreds of thousands of foreign-born engineers to help create them. So the technology industry has been pushing for changes to the nation\u2019s immigration policy for more than a decade to allow more skilled workers into the country.President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration last week falls well short of what both immigrants and industry leaders were seeking. The most vexing issues they face, like speeding up the process for obtaining permanent residency and getting more visas for high-skilled technology work, would require an act of Congress.Nonetheless, some immigrants working in technology were heartened by the president\u2019s actions and said they could potentially make life and work in the United States easier.One of Mr. Obama\u2019s initiatives, for example, would give entrepreneurs starting a company a special founder\u2019s visa, provided that they raise outside funding. That appeals to Laks Srini, a founder of the San Francisco start-up Zenefits.Right now, the law is so Kafkaesque that Mr. Srini, who is from India, had to get his American co-founder, Parker Conrad, to officially hire him as Zenefits\u2019 database administrator simply to transfer his visa from his previous employer so they could create the company.In less than two years, the two of them have built Zenefits, an online service that helps companies manage their employee benefits, into a company with 450 employees.But Mr. Srini, the chief technology officer, still has not been able to upgrade his visa to a more flexible type that reflects his role at the company. He is applying for a visa for people of extraordinary talent \u2014 nicknamed the \u201cI am awesome\u201d visa because it essentially requires applicants to meet about a dozen requirements to prove eminence in their fields.Gesturing at the cluster of desks around his own open-plan work space, Mr. Srini said the American visa restrictions had also crimped his ability to hire talented engineers. Because the primary visas used to hire software workers, known as H-1B visas, run out in a few days when the lottery is opened every April, he really has one chance a year to hire foreigners. And if they don\u2019t win the lottery, they have to wait another year, often forcing Zenefits to find someone else.\u201cWhen you\u2019re a start-up, you live and die by speed,\u201d Mr. Srini said.Zenefits plans for now to divert some potential San Francisco jobs to Vancouver, where Canadian immigration laws make it much easier to bring in foreign engineers.He said that immigration was a \u201cgnarly problem\u201d but one thing the politicians fighting in Washington don\u2019t understand is that for every foreign engineer Zenefits hires, it also hires more than 10 American citizens or permanent residents to do various jobs.Two of the Obama administration\u2019s other proposals could help Zenefits and other Silicon Valley companies with their recruiting.One would extend the amount of time that someone who has earned an American science or technology degree could work at a company after graduation. Currently the limit for such \u201coptional practical training\u201d is 29 months. Mr. Obama has directed immigration officials to begin a formal process to set more permissive rules for the program.A longer training period would help companies hire more workers than the current annual cap of 85,000 new H-1B visas allows.Mr. Srini said provisions that would allow spouses of high-tech visa holders to work would also help. Zenefits has lost promising overseas job applicants because they had wives who did not want to give up the ability to work so that their husbands could take jobs in the United States.Glynn Morrison, a Scotsman on an H-1B visa who was one of Zenefits\u2019 earliest employees, said his wife, a South Korean citizen, is still unable to work after nearly two years in the United States. She wants to be an accountant, but cannot legally work even as a basic bookkeeper. Although she has a bachelor\u2019s degree, she is considering a second degree just to get a work permit, he said.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to have so many people in America not working,\u201d Mr. Morrison said. \u201cYou want them to pay taxes.\u201dWhile Mr. Srini and Mr. Morrison will most likely find ways to stay in the United States for the long term, the future is more hazy for Charlotte Brugman, a Dutch citizen who is working at Samahope, a small San Francisco nonprofit that provides medical services in developing countries.Ms. Brugman said that she and her Swiss husband, an M.B.A. student at the University of California, Berkeley, were trying to figure out what Mr. Obama\u2019s proposals meant for them.Ms. Brugman\u2019s ability to work is tied to the visa of her husband, Johannes Koeppel, who is on a Fulbright scholarship that entitles him to a more permissive visa. The spouses of other foreign students at the Berkeley business school cannot work at all.Although Mr. Koeppel is also building an online travel start-up with two American co-founders, when he finishes his business degree next year, it\u2019s unclear how much longer he and his wife can stay in the country. Without a change in visa status, they would have to leave after 18 months.Mr. Koeppel is hoping to qualify for the founder\u2019s visa that Mr. Obama has proposed. But based on the details released so far, he may be in a Catch-22: It\u2019s difficult to get that visa without raising money from investors, and it\u2019s difficult to raise money if the investors don\u2019t know if the founder can stay in the country.Confounding everyone is the vagueness of the president\u2019s proposals. While it\u2019s clear that he cannot solve the biggest problems without going to Congress, people in the tech industry said they still did not understand how exactly his proposals would play out. In many cases, the president has outlined broad ideas, which have been assigned to the immigration agencies and various task forces to figure out.\u201cThe two lines in the speech did not really give us much more clarity about what it will mean for us,\u201d Ms. Brugman said.Collectively, the president\u2019s visa proposals for highly skilled workers would add about 147,000 people to the work force by 2024, according to an analysis by the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.That\u2019s too little, too late for many in the technology industry.Carl Guardino, chief executive of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which represents most of the region\u2019s large tech companies, said the industry was disappointed that Mr. Obama never followed through on his original campaign promise to pass comprehensive immigration legislation in his first year in office.\u201cHe talked eloquently and in depth about low-wage workers, and I appreciate that,\u201d Mr. Guardino said, referring to the president\u2019s speech on Thursday. \u201cBut from an innovation economy perspective? I wasn\u2019t expecting a lot, and it lived up to my expectations.\u201dAn article on Monday about reaction in Silicon Valley to President Obama\u2019s immigration policy misstated the legal authority Mr. Obama used to propose changes on immigration. They are executive actions, not an executive order. The error was repeated in the headline. The article also referred incorrectly to the status of a Swiss student, Johannes Koeppel, after he graduates from the University of California, Berkeley. Without a change in his visa status, Mr. Koeppel will have to leave 18 months after graduation; he does not have to leave immediately.Advertisement"}

President Obama won only 36 percent of the vote in 2012.Ms. Capito is expected to be one of the more centrist Republican senators and could emerge as a swing vote on some issues. However, she is sure to side with other Republicans in trying to throttle back regulations proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency. A co-founder of the Congressional Coal Caucus in 2010, she has accused the Obama administration of taking \u201cdrastic measures to destroy coal.\u201dMs. Capito wants to require the E.P.A. to pay more attention to the effects of its policies on jobs and the economy.After 38 years in the House, Representative Nick J. Rahall II, a Democrat, fell to a Republican challenger, State Senator Evan Jenkins.Mr. Rahall, who has more seniority than all but six other House members, could not survive the anti-Obama, anti-Washington sentiment in his district, which President Obama lost to Mitt Romney by 32 percentage points in 2012.Mr. Jenkins is the executive director of the West Virginia State Medical Association and has been an outspoken critic of the Affordable Care Act since it was enacted in 2010. He was a Democrat until last year, when he switched parties to run against Mr. Rahall. \u201cWest Virginia is under attack from President Obama and a Democratic Party that our parents and grandparents would not recognize,\u201d Mr. Jenkins said then.In the First Congressional District, which spans the northern part of the state, Representative David B.

{"Headline": "A Super-Simple Way to Understand the Net Neutrality Debate", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternet GatesFor all the arcana in telecommunications law, there is a really simple way of thinking of the debate over net neutrality: Is access to the Internet more like access to electricity, or more like cable television service?Regulated electrical utilities perform a remarkable service. Nearly every time I flip a light switch in my home, energy that was generated at some distant power plant and that flows through a complex network of transformers and power lines makes its way to the bulbs overhead, so that I can see.I pay my local electric utility (mine is Pepco, which serves Washington) a nice fee for this service every month, tied to how much of this energy I use and its current price per kilowatt hour, with some money built in for the utility to make a comfortable profit. But beyond that, Pepco has no role in determining what I use that electricity for.Pepco doesn\u2019t get to offer more reliable, cheaper service if I go with Pepco\u2019s preferred brand of refrigerator, with which the utility has some financial arrangement. They do not know, let alone control, what types of light bulbs or clothes dryer I power using the electricity they sell to me.Yes, there are some broad efforts by electric utilities to urge me and other consumers to conserve energy, especially at peak times, but those are less about Pepco having special deals and more about trying to reduce energy consumption at the times it costs them the most to generate it.For all the technical complexity of generating electricity and distributing it to millions of people, the economic arrangement is very simple: I give them money. They give me electricity. I do with it what I will.Things are completely different with cable service.Comcast, my cable provider, offers me a menu of packages from which I might choose, each with a different mix of channels. It goes through long and sometimes arduous negotiations with the owners of those cable channels and has a different business arrangement with each of them. The details of those arrangements are opaque to me as the consumer; all I know is that I can get the movie package for X dollars a month or the sports package for Y dollars and so on.The downside is that it is easy to end up paying a few hundred dollars a month for cable service. The upside is that this state of affairs has a profusion of new channels and entertainment options. Whether your preference is for high-quality literary scripted television dramas, trashy-but-amusing reality shows or live sports from every corner of the world, you have more options available than ever before, both live and on demand. That is a genuine improvement over the state of Americans\u2019 home entertainment options from just a generation ago.All of which brings us to net neutrality and the Internet.In the president\u2019s logic, and that of the Internet content companies that are the most aggressive supporters of net neutrality, just as your electric utility has no say in how you use the electricity they sell you, the Internet should be a reliable way to access content produced by anyone, regardless of whether they have any special business arrangement with the utility.Those arguing against net neutrality, most significantly the cable companies, say the Internet will be a richer experience if the profit motive applies, if they can negotiate deals with major content providers (the equivalent of cable channels) so that Netflix or Hulu or other streaming services that use huge bandwidth have to pay for the privilege.The same kind of business model that has created a boom in content for cable television customers can create a more fertile environment for an explosion of creativity on the Internet, goes this logic.It would also give your Internet provider considerably more economic leverage. It would, in the non-net-neutrality world, be free to throttle the speed with which you could access services that don\u2019t pay up, or block sites entirely, as surely as you cannot watch a cable channel that your cable provider chooses not to offer (perhaps because of a dispute with the channel over fees).Keep in mind, just because the Obama administration has weighed in doesn\u2019t mean this debate is over. The decision, as the president\u2019s own statement acknowledges, belongs to the Federal Communications Commission alone. Regardless of where it comes out, what is at play is a question that cuts to the core of what role the Internet will play in our daily lives.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fixes Came Too Late", "Date": "2014-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 1984 Pontiac Fiero made its debut with a captivating design, a midengine layout that conveyed sports car aspirations and a name that meant \u201cproud\u201d in Italian. The $8,000 base price attracted young buyers. Initial media reaction was generally positive; Car and Driver magazine put the Fiero on its 10 Best Cars list. But the Fiero, hobbled by parts borrowed from economy cars, did not perform like a sports car. First-year sales approached 137,000, but disappointment set in quickly as the Fiero developed a reputation for a stiff ride, lackluster quality, clunky handling and, worse, some engine failures and fires. Sales dropped 40 percent in the second year, when an optional V6 engine helped to address the deficient performance.Still, the Fiero earned a five-star federal safety rating. Credit went to the car\u2019s novel construction method, developed to keep production costs low. A separate chassis included a cagelike steel structure around the passenger cabin.The plastic body panels could be removed relatively easily for repairs, spurring the kit-car industry to offer Ferrari look-alikes. One such car, the Mera, was offered through some Pontiac dealers. Onix Taveras, a Fiero aficionado in Paterson, N.J., said a car from Canada, the Stinger, was a more accurate copy of the Ferrari 308 popularized on \u201cMagnum P.I.\u201dA 1986 Fiero owned by a friend of Mr. Taveras, Hank Venhorst of Rochelle Park, N.J., had been stripped down in preparation for a body conversion. When legal action by Ferrari shut down suppliers of copycat bodies, the disassembled car was stored for many years until Mr. Venhorst bought and reassembled it. The car, which is like new, has been driven only 75 miles.Significant chassis improvements for 1988 earned the Fiero respect from the enthusiast media. In a comparison test with a supercharged Toyota MR2, MotorWeek TV preferred the Fiero Formula.\u201cIt took Pontiac four years to get the Fiero right,\u201d said John Davis, the MotorWeek host and producer. \u201cWe hope it\u2019s not too late.\u201d But it was. Just over 26,400 Fieros were sold in 1988, the final year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Might Obama and the G.O.P. Agree? Here Are Possibilities", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon GroundNow that Republicans are set to control both houses of Congress, the great question is: What will they do with it?The message from Washington (and Louisville, Ky., where the incoming Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell spoke) on Wednesday was of constructive desire to find areas for common ground. The question is what concrete legislation that might lead to, and whether it will dissolve the first time that concrete legislation makes its way to the Senate floor.When there has meaningful lawmaking in this environment, it has tended to be on more below-the-radar issues in which the party leading Congress has greater enthusiasm. Analysts who try to handicap what will happen in Washington have been grappling with what, if anything, that might consist of in the 114th Congress, which begins in January. Here\u2019s a rundown of the possibilities.Keeping the government running.Republicans will have to decide how aggressively they will use the need to fund the government to extract policy concessions from the Obama administration. Will these be the Republicans of 2011 through 2013, when a hard-edged approach culminated in a two-week government shutdown driven by demands that the president agree to a repeal of his signature health reform law?Or will they be the Republicans of 2014, who presented themselves as a responsible governing party while looking to chip away at Obamacare and other White House priorities piece-by-piece and without a grand, disruptive showdown?One way or another, the debt ceiling will need to be raised sometime in the first part of 2015 to prevent a government default, and deals will need to be made to continue funding the federal government without the high drama of standoffs like that over the debt ceiling in 2011, the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d of late 2012 and the shutdown in 2013.It will pit two sides of the G.O.P. against each other. One team of Republican leadership seeks to bolster the party\u2019s brand in the run-up to 2016 elections and is responsive to business interests who prefer stability. The other is the harder-right contingent of the caucus that wants to try to shut down Obamacare at any cost. Presidential politics may come into play as well, as potential candidates like Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky push for a harder-edged approach than that preferred by the majority leader Mitch McConnell. (\u201cLet me be clear: There will be no shutdowns and no default on the national debt,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Wednesday in his appearance in Louisville).Sean West, who heads the United States practice of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, argues that the odds of a return to disruptive showdowns of the recent past is only about 25 percent. \u201cThe Republicans have no incentives to play games,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re focused on looking like a party that can govern.\u201dA trade deal on the way?The likelihood of a major trade deal with Pacific Rim nations is, if anything, higher after the Republican victory than before. The soon-to-be-former Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, and many other Democrats have been skeptical of further American trade agreements because of union opposition and a fear of the impact of continued globalization on American wages. The Obama administration has pursued the deals, viewing them both as positive for American exporters and as part of a geopolitical strategy of creating stronger ties with Asian nations that can counter Chinese influence.So the Obama administration may have better luck with the Republican Senate than it would have with a Democrat-led chamber in obtaining passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a sweeping trade agreement with 11 countries stretching from Japan to New Zealand to Chile.That said, there are many hurdles to getting a complicated deal done. They need to finesse a two-step process in which Mr. Obama first wins \u201ctrade promotion authority\u201d to fast-track negotiations and then separately secures passage of a finished agreement, which has many moving parts. Early signs are that the Republican Congress could move on that authority early next year.Republicans will probably demand greater heed to businesses\u2019 wishes than the organized labor and environmental concerns that are priorities for Obama. And with just over two years left in his presidency, the clock is ticking.A second trade agreement, with Europe, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, is moving more slowly and will be even more challenging for Mr. Obama and congressional Republicans to enact in the coming two years.Is it time to overhaul the corporate income tax?The tax system for American corporations is, by all accounts, a mess. It places higher tax rates on businesses than most other advanced nations, yet raises less revenue relative to the economy thanks to a byzantine set of carve-outs and special deductions. It makes possible so-called corporate inversions, in which American firms cut their tax bill by buying a smaller company overseas and relocating their headquarters. The tax code hasn\u2019t been systematically reformed since 1986.In other words, it would seem ready made for a bipartisan compromise to cut the rate, cut the deductions, and make the system overall more fair and efficient. It is easy in theory to imagine a bill that a Republican Congress might pass that President Obama would happily sign. \u201cThe political noise on inversions obscures the broad similarity of the political parties\u2019 approach to tax reform,\u201d wrote Terry Haines, head of political analysis at ISI Evercore, in a report. \u201cIf anything, the continued inversions controversy continues to provide a powerful stimulus for both parties to address the fundamental noncompetitiveness of the U.S. tax code.\u201dThe challenge is not the theory, but the practical dimensions.Tax reform legislation is almost by definition a hard slog even when the parties broadly agree, pitting lobbyists for companies that win from the changes against those who would lose. Things are also complicated by Republicans\u2019 desire to keep reform of the individual income tax code on the table as part of the process, with an eye toward reducing tax rates \u2014 most likely a nonstarter for Mr. Obama and other Democrats.Some less likely policies.There are other areas that superficially would seem to fit the model of a policy area where there is room for bipartisan compromise, but in which legislation appears unlikely to make it to President Obama\u2019s desk before he leaves office.Second, housing finance reform. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under government control since 2008, leaving the government managing a vast proportion of the mortgage market.But Democrats and Republicans remain far apart on how much government support should exist for home lending in any deal, and neither side shows much interest in compromising. Throw in the fact that the status quo is working O.K., making a lot of money for taxpayers and keeping a flow of cheap money into housing that makes the politically powerful real estate industry happy, and it\u2019s not clear what would force a compromise.Given those realities, writes Brian Gardner, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a financial services consultancy, \u201cwe remain confident that mortgage finance legislation is unlikely to pass Congress until 2017 at the earliest.\u201dThat\u2019s what everyone wants to hear: confidence in Washington.The Upshot presents news, analysis\nand graphics about politics\nand policy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Toyota\u2019s Quarterly Profit Jumps", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 As quarterly earnings surged, Toyota issued a rosier outlook for the year, forecasting record profit on rising sales and a weaker Japanese currency.Toyota has been among the biggest beneficiaries of a steady decline in the value of the yen over the last two years. Japan\u2019s central bank has been furiously printing money to try to stimulate the country\u2019s economy, an effort that has helped knock more than 30 percent off the currency\u2019s value against the dollar.The decline has had the effect of making the foreign currency Toyota earns by selling cars in other markets more valuable, flattering its profits. Most of Toyota\u2019s customers are outside Japan and the currency swing has magnified the benefits of recovering worldwide demand.Toyota\u2019s new forecast for profits in its full financial year, which ends in March, is 12 percent higher than its previous estimate. If it meets that new target \u2014 and Toyota is known for making conservative projections, then beating them \u2014 it would become the first Japanese company to earn a net profit of 2 trillion yen in a single year.On Wednesday, the yen was trading at just below 114 yen to the dollar. Toyota\u2019s forecast, by contrast, assumes a rate of 105 to the dollar \u2014 closer to the currency\u2019s level before the central bank acted. Other things being equal, the difference represents pure added profit on Toyota\u2019s foreign income.\u201cThey\u2019ve been reducing costs, and their yen and sales volume forecasts look conservative,\u201d said Koji Endo, an industry analyst at Advanced Research Japan.

{"Headline": "In Change of Strategy, China Cuts Interest Rate", "Date": "2014-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China finally admitted it has a growth problem \u2014 and that is a big step to getting the global economy back on track.For months, Beijing avoided broad stimulus measures, signaling that it was comfortable with the country\u2019s slowing growth. But China\u2019s pockets of weakness, coupled with the continuing woes in Japan and Europe, prompted anxiety in the financial markets. Now China is changing its stimulus stance, announcing a surprise interest rate cut on Friday. The action will lift the country\u2019s flagging housing market and large state-owned companies, as well as bolster other nations that have come to rely on those core parts of China\u2019s economy.With the Fed stepping back in the United States, the collective action elsewhere \u201csupports the growth outlook for next year,\u201d said William Adams, senior international economist with the PNC financial services group. \u201cGlobal liquidity remains abundant and will continue to be so in 2015.\u201dThe rate cuts by China helped soothe the global markets, which had become increasingly volatile with the drumbeat of bad economic data coming out of China and other parts of the world. American stocks rose modestly on Friday.\u201cThe Chinese economy has been an engine of growth for the global economy for quite some time, so any measures to head off a softening of growth in China is a plus,\u201d said Paul Edelstein, director of financial economics at IHS Global Insight, a research firm. China\u2019s move \u201cgives confidence to investors.\u201dEven as China\u2019s economy showed signs of weakness, policy makers refrained from broad measures like rate cuts to support growth. Instead, they made more targeted efforts, including making new credit lines available to certain banks and financial institutions. They also focused on specific goals like supporting the agriculture industry and constructing subsidized housing.But those unconventional measures appear to have had limited effect. Borrowing costs remain high, and growth in new lending remains lackluster.Other signs of strain have also mounted. Home prices continue to slide, declining in October from a year earlier in 67 of the 70 biggest cities, data released this week showed. Foreign investment, a boon to the economy for years, is contracting. And China\u2019s huge manufacturing sector, a major employer and a driver of exports, is struggling with rampant overcapacity in many industries, leading to falling prices.So far this year, China has come up short in its growth goals. Gross domestic product in the third quarter increased 7.3 percent. While such growth would be the envy of many countries, it looked weak by Chinese standards. It was slowest pace since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. Many economists now expect the country to fall short of the government\u2019s official growth target of 7.5 percent for the year.The rate cut, the first since the summer of 2012, reflects a discomfort among the country\u2019s leaders with the speed of China\u2019s economic deceleration.The central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, cut its benchmark one-year deposit rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 2.75 percent, and reduced the one-year lending rate by 0.4 percentage points, to 5.6 percent. Policy makers also said they would give China\u2019s banks more leeway in determining interest on deposits, allowing them to pay as much as 120 percent of the benchmark rate, up from 110 percent previously. Most immediately, the rate cuts will make financing easier for the country\u2019s large state-owned companies, which tend to enjoy easier access to loans from the government-controlled banking sector. That will help ease China\u2019s debt pressure, as companies find it cheaper to pay off or refinance loans that are coming due.\u201cThe impact on G.D.P. growth will be small,\u201d Mark Williams, the chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, wrote Friday in a research note. \u201cThe main effect will be to improve the financial position of large firms.\u201dBut the move is not without risks. While cheap credit helped fuel an aggressive expansion after the global financial crisis, it also led to ballooning levels of corporate and local government debt. The rate cuts \u2014 and any new lending they spur \u2014 may raise further alarms that the debt levels are unsustainable. A wave of bad loans could set the stage for a severe economic downturn or another financial shock. Despite the surprise move, Chinese policy makers tempered expectations for more aggressive stimulus. The central bank on Friday emphasized that monetary policy would not change direction in a fundamental way. \u201cOver all, the country retains a mid to high rate of macroeconomic growth, price inflation has slowed, the economic structure is continuously being optimized and upgraded and growth is shifting from being investment-driven to being driven by innovation,\u201d the central bank said in a statement. \u201cThus, there is no need to undertake strong stimulus measures, and the prudent monetary policy direction will not change.\u201dSome economists and analysts took a different view, indicating that the rate cuts raised the likelihood of more stimulus measures. Li-Gang Liu, chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation, pointed to trouble spots like consumer price inflation, which recently dropped below 2 percent, as well as high borrowing costs, especially for small and medium-size firms.\u201cThe conditions for further policy easing are ripe,\u201d Mr. Liu wrote in a note on Friday. \u201cToday\u2019s rate cut suggests that the overall policy orientation has shifted to be more supportive.\u201dPatricia Cohen contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Business Tycoons of Airbnb", "Date": "2014-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyTwo years ago, when the monthly rent on his two-bedroom apartment rose to $5,000 from $2,800, a 35-year-old real estate agent in Lower Manhattan had a quick fix. Rather than move, or take on some random Craigslist subletter, he listed the smaller bedroom on Airbnb, the vacation-rental website. Eventually he was charging $175 a night for short-term stays. It earned him enough to cover the astronomical rent increase, said the agent, who insisted on anonymity to avoid professional and legal consequences.The founders of Airbnb heard lots of stories like this in 2009, during the height of the recession, when they traveled from Silicon Valley to New York to meet the early East Coast adopters of their new website. Paul Graham, the founder of the start-up incubator Y Combinator, which was Airbnb\u2019s first major backer, wrote in an email that the company was struck by \u2018'how many of their users actually needed to do these rentals to pay their rents.'\u2019But the agent\u2019s relationship with Airbnb soon shifted from desperation to opportunism. Realizing the potential to exploit the difference between long- and short-term rental prices, he signed a lease on a second Manhattan apartment this summer. He now uses it solely for Airbnb, generating up to $6,000 a month in profit. Last month, he added a third rental \u2014 this one under his wife\u2019s account. He plans to add more, he said, possibly even under phony accounts to avoid legal scrutiny.According to the office of the New York State attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, almost half of Airbnb\u2019s $1.45 million in 2010 revenue in the city came from hosts who had at least three listings on the site. There were only 119 of these users, a small minority, claiming a large share of the business. Schneiderman suspects that many hosts are violating a law that forbids apartment residents from renting out their place for less than 30 days if they are not present.The so-called sharing economy is supposed to offer a new kind of capitalism, one where regular folks, enabled by efficient online platforms, can turn their fallow assets into cash machines. According to its fans, Airbnb, along with the car-sharing company Uber, and others, is leading us into a less wasteful, more virtuous future. In it, anyone with excess time or space \u2014 or a car and a driver\u2019s license \u2014 can easily become an entrepreneur with little to no start-up costs. But the reality is that these markets also tend to attract a class of well-heeled professional operators, who outperform the amateurs \u2014 just like the rest of the economy.The success of eBay spawned many imitators. Prosper Marketplace, which started in 2006, was described in the media as an \u2018'eBay of loans.'\u2019 The site allowed individuals to borrow money directly from other people online, at an interest rate that was lower than borrowers might pay on credit-card debt but high enough to give lenders a decent return. The venture even had backing from Omidyar, who invested through his philanthropic fund.But Prosper, like eBay, came to rely on large players. Today, according to the company, two-thirds of the lenders on the site are hedge funds and other large financial institutions. These investors helped the platform issue $177 million in loans last month alone, three and a half times more than in October 2013.\u2018'There\u2019s a certain amount of liquidity that these large sellers inject into a marketplace that can be very helpful for the marketplace to grow rapidly,'\u2019 Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business who studies the sharing economy, told me. The competition should also help drive down costs, which helps consumers. But these marketplaces, he added, must \u2018'balance the short-term accelerating their growth while also maintaining the quality, and in some sense staying true to what their consumers are looking for'\u2019 \u2014 which might be freedom from big banks, or the stultifying sterility of budget hotels.Still, commercial operators seem to appear wherever the opportunity arises. Juliet Schor, a sociology professor at Boston College who is studying the sharing economy for the MacArthur Foundation, said she discovered evidence of ad-hoc temp agencies on TaskRabbit, an online market for farming out errands and chores. For gigs like copy-editing or proofreading, she said, people who rate highly on the site and get a large volume of requests sometimes subcontract their work to others, taking a bit off the top for themselves.Getting ahead on Airbnb is much more simple: just sign multiple leases in desirable locations. Of course, that requires upfront investment and financial savvy. But once it\u2019s up and running, an Airbnb rental network can become seriously lucrative. One operation of 272 listings booked $6.8 million in revenue from 2010 through June of this year, according to the attorney general. The economic forces at play are similar to what the French economist Thomas Piketty discusses in his recent blockbuster book, \u2018'Capital in the Twenty-First Century,'\u2019 only in miniature. In a slow-growth economy, Piketty argues, wealth delivers better returns than labor, so those with wealth to invest in things (like, for example, rent-earning apartments) will tend to get wealthier; those without probably won\u2019t. Listing a spare room on Airbnb might keep you current on your always-climbing Manhattan rent, but real entrepreneurship (as always) requires real dough.But after renting out his apartment on Craigslist and through word of mouth, he signed up for Airbnb in early 2011, with a plan to make short-term rentals his full-time job. He signed leases on former factory spaces in Lower Manhattan, renovating them and listing them on Airbnb. At his peak, he said, he managed 12 listings and hired a team of cleaners, greeters and handymen to keep his scatter-site hotel operating. His relationship with Airbnb, however, turned sour when Schneiderman sought data from the company about operators like him.Now, he is leading a group of users suing Airbnb to prevent it from handing over the information.

{"Headline": "When Government Succeeds", "Date": "2014-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe great American Ebola freakout of 2014 seems to be over. The disease is still ravaging Africa, and as with any epidemic, there\u2019s always a risk of a renewed outbreak. But there haven\u2019t been any new U.S. cases for a while, and popular anxiety is fading fast.Before we move on, however, let\u2019s try to learn something from the panic.Guess what: Those officials actually did know what they were doing. The real lesson of the Ebola story is that sometimes public policy is succeeding even while partisans are screaming about failure. And it\u2019s not the only recent story along those lines.Here\u2019s another: Remember Solyndra? It was a renewable-energy firm that borrowed money using Department of Energy guarantees, then went bust, costing the Treasury $528 million. And conservatives have pounded on that loss relentlessly, turning it into a symbol of what they claim is rampant crony capitalism and a huge waste of taxpayer money.The moral of these stories is not that the government is always right and always succeeds. Of course there are bad decisions and bad programs. But modern American political discourse is dominated by cheap cynicism about public policy, a free-floating contempt for any and all efforts to improve our lives. And this cheap cynicism is completely unjustified. It\u2019s true that government-hating politicians can sometimes turn their predictions of failure into self-fulfilling prophecies, but when leaders want to make government work, they can.And let\u2019s be clear: The government policies we\u2019re talking about here are hugely important. We need serious public health policy, not fear-mongering, to contain infectious disease. We need government action to promote renewable energy and fight climate change. Government programs are the only realistic answer for tens of millions of Americans who would otherwise be denied essential health care.Conservatives want you to believe that while the goals of public programs on health, energy and more may be laudable, experience shows that such programs are doomed to failure. Don\u2019t believe them. Yes, sometimes government officials, being human, get things wrong. But we\u2019re actually surrounded by examples of government success, which they don\u2019t want you to notice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Donor Generation Stimulates U.S. Giving", "Date": "2014-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial SectionWhen the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg gave the federal Centers for Disease Control foundation $25 million to help combat the Ebola crisis last month, it served as a public service announcement of sorts.Five years after the recession reshaped the global economy, charitable giving is back in a big way in the United States. What is more, a new generation of donors is meeting significant challenges with transformative gifts.Mr. Zuckerberg has emerged as one of the most generous entrepreneurs of his generation, doling out eight- and nine-figure gifts to education, health and community development causes. And to a surprising degree, much of the country has followed in Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s footsteps, even after the financial crisis.Overall charitable giving in 2013 was up 3 percent from the previous year, the largest year-over-year increase since the recession, according to Giving USA and the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, which track contributions. Donations from individuals, companies, foundations and bequests topped $335 billion in 2013, approaching the peak from before the financial crisis. It was the fourth consecutive year of gains.And while few are as wealthy as Facebook or its founder, the American people and the business community have largely shrugged off the financial crisis and resumed their charitable ways.\u201cIt\u2019s really recovered,\u201d said Melissa Berman, chief executive of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors. \u201cAmerica has a long, long tradition of generosity.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t always clear this would be the case. In the throes of the recession, giving plunged 15 percent, to $298 billion in 2009 from $350 billion in 2007, according to the Giving USA data, which is figured in constant, inflation-adjusted dollars.Even then there was a silver lining. The country was poorer, meaning there was less to give, yet as a proportion of wealth generated, Americans appeared to maintain their generosity.\u201cAlthough total giving has predictably declined, we are still giving at high levels and at nearly the same proportion of total dollars as before,\u201d wrote Rob Reich and Christopher Wimer of Stanford University, in a 2012 paper examining the recession\u2019s impact on philanthropy.But where those dollars were going \u201cchanged pretty significantly,\u201d said Eileen R. Heisman, chief executive of the National Philanthropic Trust. Donations to organizations that fight homelessness and food banks spiked in 2008 and 2009, while giving to arts and education causes slumped.\u201cWhen there\u2019s a recession and high unemployment, people respond to those immediate needs,\u201d said Ms. Berman.But as the direst days of the recession have passed, giving to different causes has returned to precrisis levels. \u201cAs the recovery has persisted, people are moving back to the areas where they have traditionally given,\u201d said Dr. Patrick M. Rooney, associate dean of Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.Giving to the arts and education has outpaced charity to hunger and homelessness causes in recent years. And when disasters strike, be it an earthquake in Haiti or a tsunami in Japan, Americans can generally be relied on to open their wallets.Perhaps most surprising about giving since the recession is who has proved most generous. It turns out that poorer individuals give a greater percentage of their income, even during tough times. Though low-income Americans cut back on charitable giving the most during the recession, they tend to give a higher proportion of their wealth away than those in the middle and upper classes.\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable how generous low-income Americans are,\u201d said Ms. Berman. \u201cTheir giving dropped the most in the recession because they don\u2019t have as much expendable income, but they tend to give a higher proportion of their money away to charity.\u201cFolks that see so clearly how their lives can be upended by one thing \u2014 a child that gets sick or a family member having a hard time \u2014 have a sense of, \u2018There but for the grace of God go I.' \u201dThe richest individuals have also resumed their charitable ways. \u201cMore high-net-worth households are giving, and they\u2019re giving more,\u201d said Mr. Rooney.In recent months, a number of large gifts from billionaires have made headlines. In addition to Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s donation to fight Ebola, last month Charles T. Munger, the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, gave $65 million to the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. And last year, the billionaire real estate developer Stephen Ross gave $200 million to the University of Michigan.Today\u2019s youth, enabled by online giving and best exemplified by Mr. Zuckerberg, are also participating. \u201cThe millennials are really committed to giving,\u201d said Ms. Heisman. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a baby boomer phenomenon.\u201dAnd companies, too, are gradually resuming their philanthropic initiatives, though progress is slow. Just 64 percent of companies increased total contributions from 2010 to 2013, according to a report by the CECP, in association with the Conference Board. And corporate giving, while up 10.8 percent since 2011, dropped 3.2 percent from 2012 to 2013, Giving USA says.Yet despite this broad-based recovery in giving, the recession did set back philanthropy in America. The $335 billion in gifts last year remains below the precrisis high of $350 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty slow build-back,\u201d said Ms. Heisman.The biggest drag is individual giving, which is down $21 billion from before the recession began, according to Mr. Rooney. Efforts like Giving Tuesday, a charitable take on the likes of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and new online sites like Donors Choose and Kickstarter, have failed to meaningfully bolster giving levels.As a result, Americans still give away roughly 2 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product per year. That is higher than other countries and has largely recovered since the recession. But the proportion is not growing substantially.\u201cThe \u2018glass half empty\u2019 view is that we\u2019re back to where we were about a decade ago,\u201d said Mr. Rooney. \u201cThe \u2018glass half full\u2019 is that giving dropped during the Great Recession, but it didn\u2019t fall off the charts. There\u2019s a reason they call it the Great Recession.\u201dAn article on Friday about an increase in charitable giving omitted a source for a report that found that just 64 percent of companies had increased their total philanthropic contributions from 2010 to 2013. The report was done by CECP, in association with the Conference Board \u2014 not by the Conference Board alone.Advertisement"}

Some economists say the principal reason for a so-called skills gap is that employers aren\u2019t willing to pay more to attract these employees. But new research argues that the problem is real, in part because work-force development has shriveled.\u201cEmployers find it hard to fill occupations ranging from health care technicians to technical sales and service,\u201d said the Harvard study, carried out with Accenture and Burning Glass Technologies, a labor market analytics firm. \u201cCompanies cite fears about the availability of skilled labor as a major deterrent to their growth plans. The current system is failing to serve the interests of employers and aspiring workers alike.\u201dWhen Tesla announced Nevada as the home for its huge high-tech plant, the state\u2019s governor, Brian Sandoval, said the move would \u201cchange Nevada forever.\u201dBut some economists have questioned whether Nevada, which for decades has been tied to the dwindling casino industry, can provide enough qualified workers to operate complicated machinery in the Tesla plant.The state offered Tesla $1.25 billion in incentives to lure it inside its borders. A local work force is the best way to ensure that the state recoups a sizable portion of its subsidies in the form of taxes from Nevada workers, said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has been studying the region.\u201cThe alternative,\u201d Mr. Muro said, \u201cwill be a lot of workers commuting from California.\u201dThings have been looking up. Besides the arrival of Tesla, the Reno area has won federal designation as a test site for drones. The city has a budding high-tech community, and manufacturers are building office parks in the desert outside the city.All that could mean new jobs for qualified candidates.Nevada ranks last among states for the share of its work force in STEM occupations, Brookings researchers said. A Brookings analysis found that job openings in these fields in the first quarter of 2013 took a week longer to fill compared with those in other sectors, a sign of too few qualified candidates.\u201cThe gigafactory is a real test of how fast a state and region can set up a sizable STEM worker training system that reflects the unfolding needs of a leading-edge advanced manufacturing company,\u201d said Mr. Muro, an author of the study.Nevada\u2019s economic development officials have been working with local colleges to offer more courses that might better prepare workers for jobs with Tesla or in the drone industry.Diarmuid O\u2019Connell, vice president for corporate and business development at Tesla, said he was confident that Nevada could meet the labor force needs for its plant and noted that the company was already helping to develop STEM education and training in the state. \u201cThe gigafactory will benefit from, and deliver benefits to, Nevada\u2019s work force for years to come,\u201d he said.The Brookings authors argue the state needs to bolster its pipeline for middle-skills jobs, starting before kindergarten with equal access to quality education. Schools should incorporate more science and creative thinking; build an internship program; tap grants; and offer Internet coding classes for children and specifically for girls, the study said.\u201cTesla\u2019s arrival in Reno,\u201d Mr. Muro said, \u201cis a nationally significant example of how radically the nation\u2019s regions need to reorient and upgrade their worker training systems.\u201dIf better collaboration between educators and businesses to offer more training helps solve Nevada\u2019s work force deficit, it will prove that there is a real skills gap, and that employers are not just crying wolf.

{"Headline": "Welcome to the Failure Age!", "Date": "2014-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Innovations IssueWhen you pull off Highway 101 and head into Sunnyvale, Calif., the first thing you notice is how boring innovation looks up close. This small Silicon Valley city, which abuts both Cupertino, the home of Apple, and Mountain View, the site of the Googleplex, is where Lockheed built the Poseidon nuclear missile. It\u2019s where the forebear of NASA did some of its most important research and where a prototype for Pong debuted at a neighborhood bar. Countless ambitious start-ups \u2014 with names like Qvivr, Schoolfy, eCloset.me and PeerPal \u2014 appear in Sunnyvale every year. Aesthetically, though, the city is one enormous glass-and-stucco office park after another. Its dominant architectural feature, the five-story headquarters of Yahoo, a few minutes from Innovation Way, looks about as futuristic as a suburban hospital.As an industry becomes more dynamic, its architecture, by necessity, often becomes less inspiring. These squat buildings have thick outer walls that allow for a minimal number of internal support beams, creating versatile open-floor plans for any kind of company \u2014 one processing silicon into solar-power arrays, say, or a start-up monitoring weed elimination in industrial agriculture. In Sunnyvale, companies generally don\u2019t stay the same size. They expand quickly or go out of business, and then the office has to be ready for the next tenant. These buildings need to be the business equivalent of dorms: spaces designed to house important and tumultuous periods of people\u2019s lives before being cleaned out and prepped for the next occupant.Perhaps the best place to behold the Valley\u2019s success as a platform for innovation is a 27,000-square-foot facility just down the block from Yahoo. This is the warehouse of Weird Stuff, a 21-person company that buys the office detritus that start-ups no longer want. One section of the space teems with hundreds of laptops and desktops; another is overloaded with C.P.U.s and orphaned cubicle partitions. \u201cIf founders are in a building that\u2019s costing $50,000 a month, and they\u2019ve lost their funding and have to be out by next Friday, we respond very quickly,\u201d said Chuck Schuetz, the founder of Weird Stuff.Weird Stuff also acquires goods from the start-ups that succeed, when they are ready to upgrade offices and need to offload their old equipment. \u201cWe get truckloads every day,\u201d Schuetz told me. He said that he receives a lot of calls from government offices and large corporate-network operators who desperately need, for example, a 1981 Seagate ST506 hard drive in order to keep a crucial piece of equipment running. But much of his stuff is bought by new waves of start-ups in search of inexpensive keyboards or cubicle partitions. What doesn\u2019t move is sold to scrap dealers. \u201cThis,\u201d he said, gesturing to the giant scrap bin out back, \u201cis where everything ends up.\u201dFor decades, entrepreneurs and digital gurus of various repute have referred to this era, in a breathlessness bordering on proselytizing, as the age of innovation. But Weird Stuff is a reminder of another, unexpected truth about innovation: It is, by necessity, inextricably linked with failure. The path to any success is lined with disasters. Most of the products that do make it out of the lab fail spectacularly once they hit the market. Even successful products will ultimately fail when a better idea comes along. (One of Schuetz\u2019s most remarkable finds is a portable eight-track player.) And those lucky innovations that are truly triumphant, the ones that transform markets and industries, create widespread failure among their competition.An age of constant invention naturally begets one of constant failure. The life span of an innovation, in fact, has never been shorter. An African hand ax from 285,000 years ago, for instance, was essentially identical to those made some 250,000 years later. The Sumerians believed that the hoe was invented by a godlike figure named Enlil a few thousand years before Jesus, but a similar tool was being used a thousand years after his death. During the Middle Ages, amid major advances in agriculture, warfare and building technology, the failure loop closed to less than a century. During the Enlightenment and early Industrial Revolution, it was reduced to about a lifetime. By the 20th century, it could be measured in decades. Today, it is best measured in years and, for some products, even less. (Schuetz receives tons of smartphones that are only a season or two old.)The closure of the failure loop has sent uncomfortable ripples through the economy. When a product or company is no longer valued in the marketplace, there are typically thousands of workers whose own market value diminishes, too. Our breakneck pace of innovation can be seen in stock-market volatility and other boardroom metrics, but it can also be measured in unemployment checks, in divorces and involuntary moves and in promising careers turned stagnant. Every derelict product that makes its way into Weird Stuff exists as part of a massive ecosystem of human lives \u2014 of engineers and manufacturers; sales people and marketing departments; logistics planners and truck drivers \u2014 that has shared in this process of failure.Innovation is, after all, terrifying. Right now we\u2019re going through changes that rip away the core logic of our economy. Will there be enough jobs to go around? Will they pay a living wage? Terror, however, can also be helpful. The only way to harness this new age of failure is to learn how to bounce back from disaster and create the societal institutions that help us do so. The real question is whether we\u2019re up for the challenge.But that all changed in 1856, with a discovery by an 18-year-old English chemist named William Henry Perkin. Tinkering in his home laboratory, Perkin was trying to synthesize an artificial form of quinine, an antimalarial agent. Although he botched his experiments, he happened to notice that one substance maintained a bright and unexpected purple color that didn\u2019t run or fade. Perkin, it turned out, had discovered a way of making arguably the world\u2019s most coveted color from incredibly cheap coal tar. He patented his invention \u2014 the first synthetic dye \u2014 created a company and sold shares to raise capital for a factory. Eventually his dye, and generations of dye that followed, so thoroughly democratized the color purple that it became the emblematic color of cheesy English rock bands, Prince albums and office chairs for those willing to dare a hue slightly more bold than black.Perkin\u2019s fortuitous failure, it\u2019s safe to say, would have never occurred even a hundred years earlier. In pre-modern times, when starvation was common and there was little social insurance outside your clan, every individual bore the risk of any new idea. As a result, risks simply weren\u2019t worth taking. If a clever idea for a crop rotation failed or an enhanced plow was ineffective, a farmer\u2019s family might not get enough to eat. Children might die. Even if the innovation worked, any peasant who found himself with an abundance of crops would most likely soon find a representative of the local lord coming along to claim it. A similar process, one in which success was stolen and failure could be lethal, also ensured that carpenters, cobblers, bakers and the other skilled artisans would only innovate slowly, if at all. So most people adjusted accordingly by living near arable land, having as many children as possible (a good insurance policy) and playing it safe.Our relationship with innovation finally began to change, however, during the Industrial Revolution. While individual inventors like James Watt and Eli Whitney tend to receive most of the credit, perhaps the most significant changes were not technological but rather legal and financial. The rise of stocks and bonds, patents and agricultural futures allowed a large number of people to broadly share the risks of possible failure and the rewards of potential success. If it weren\u2019t for these tools, a tinkerer like Perkin would never have been messing around with an attempt at artificial quinine in the first place. And he wouldn\u2019t have had any way to capitalize on his idea. Anyway, he probably would have been too consumed by tilling land and raising children.Perkin\u2019s invention may have brought cheap purple (and, later, green and red) dyes to the masses, but it helped upend whatever was left of the existing global supply chain, with its small cottage-size dye houses and its artisanal crafts people who were working with lichen and bugs. For millenniums, the economy had been built around subsistence farming, small-batch artisanal work and highly localized markets. Inventions like Perkin\u2019s \u2014 and the steam engine, the spinning jenny, the telegraph, the Bessemer steel-production process \u2014 destroyed the last vestiges of this way of life.The original age of innovation may have ushered in an era of unforeseen productivity, but it was, for millions of people, absolutely terrifying. Over a generation or two, however, our society responded by developing a new set of institutions to lessen the pain of this new volatility, including unions, Social Security and the single greatest risk-mitigating institution ever: the corporation. During the late 19th century, a series of experiments in organizational structure culminated, in the 1920s, with the birth of General Motors, the first modern corporation. Its basic characteristics soon became ubiquitous. Ownership, which was once a job passed from father to son, was now divided among countless shareholders. Management, too, was divided, among a large group of professionals who directed units, or \u201csubdivisions,\u201d within it. The corporation, in essence, acted as a giant risk-sharing machine, amassing millions of investors\u2019 capital and spreading it among a large number of projects, then sharing the returns broadly too. The corporation managed the risk so well, in fact, that it created an innovation known as the steady job. For the first time in history, the risks of innovation were not borne by the poorest. This resulted in what economists call the Great Compression, when the gap between the income of the rich and poor rapidly fell to its lowest margin.The secret of the corporation\u2019s success, however, was that it generally did not focus on truly transformative innovations. Most firms found that the surest way to grow was to perfect the manufacturing of the same products, year after year. G.M., U.S. Steel, Procter & Gamble, Kellogg\u2019s, Coca-Cola and other iconic companies achieved their breakthrough insights in the pre-corporate era and spent the next several decades refining them, perhaps introducing a new product every decade or so. During the period between 1870 and 1920, cars, planes, electricity, telephones and radios were introduced. But over the next 50 years, as cars and planes got bigger and electricity and phones became more ubiquitous, the core technologies stayed fundamentally the same. (Though some notable exceptions include the television, nuclear power and disposable diapers.)Celebrated corporate-research departments at Bell Labs, DuPont and Xerox may have employed scores of white-coated scientists, but their impact was blunted by the thick shell of bureaucracy around them. Bell Labs conceived some radical inventions, like the transistor, the laser and many of the programming languages in use today, but its parent company, AT&T, ignored many of them to focus on its basic telephone monopoly. Xerox scientists came up with the mouse, the visual operating system, laser printers and Ethernet, but they couldn\u2019t interest their bosses back East, who were focused on protecting the copier business.Corporate leaders weren\u2019t stupid. They were simply making so much money that they didn\u2019t see any reason to risk it all on lots of new ideas. This conservatism extended through the ranks. Economic stability allowed millions more people to forgo many of the risk-mitigation strategies that had been in place for millenniums. Family size plummeted. Many people moved away from arable land (Arizona!). Many young people, most notably young women, saw new forms of economic freedom when they were no longer tied to the routine of frequent childbirth. Failure was no longer the expectation; most people could predict, with reasonable assurance, what their lives and careers would look like decades into the future. Our institutions \u2014 unions, schools, corporate career tracks, pensions and retirement accounts \u2014 were all predicated on a stable and rosy future.We now know, of course, that this golden moment was really a benevolent blip. In reality, the failure loop was closing far faster than we ever could have realized. The American corporate era quietly began to unravel in the 1960s. David Hounshell, a scholar of the history of American innovation, told me about a key moment in 1968, when DuPont introduced Qiana, a kind of nylon with a silklike feel, whose name was selected through a computer-generated list of meaningless five-letter words. DuPont had helped to create the modern method of product development, in which managers would identify a market need and simply inform the research department that it had to produce a solution by a specific date. Over the course of decades, this process was responsible for successful materials like Freon, Lucite, Orlon, Dacron and Mylar. In Qiana, DuPont hoped that it had the next Lycra.But not long after the company introduced Qiana to the market, it was met by a flood of cheap Japanese products made from polyester. Qiana, which only came close to breaking even during one year of sales, eventually sustained operating losses of more than $200 million. Similar shudders were felt in corporate suites across America, as new global competitors \u2014 first from Europe, then from Asia \u2014 shook up the stable order of the automotive and steel industries. Global trade narrowed the failure loop from generations to a decade or less, far shorter than most people\u2019s careers.For American workers, the greatest challenge would come from computers. By the 1970s, the impact of computers was greatest in lower-skilled, lower-paid jobs. Factory workers competed with computer-run machines; secretaries and bookkeepers saw their jobs eliminated by desktop software. Over the last two decades, the destabilizing forces of computers and the Internet has spread to even the highest-paid professions. Corporations \u201cwere created to coordinate and organize communication among lots of different people,\u201d says Chris Dixon, a partner at the venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. \u201cA lot of those organizations are being replaced by computer networks.\u201d Dixon says that start-ups like Uber and Kickstarter are harbingers of a much larger shift, in which loose groupings of individuals will perform functions that were once the domain of larger corporations. \u201cIf you had to know one thing that will explain the next 20 years, that\u2019s the key idea: We are moving toward a period of decentralization,\u201d Dixon says.Were we simply enduring a one-time shift into an age of computers, the adjustment might just require us to retrain and move onward. Instead, in a time of constant change, it\u2019s hard for us to predict the skills that we will need in the future. Whereas the corporate era created a virtuous cycle of growing companies, better-paid workers and richer consumers, we\u2019re now suffering through a cycle of destabilization, whereby each new technology makes it ever easier and faster to create the next one, which, of course, leads to more and more failure. It\u2019s enough to make us feel like mollusk-gland hunters.Some professions, however, are already demonstrating ways to embrace failure. For example, there\u2019s an uncharacteristic explosion of creativity among accountants. Yes, accountants: Groups like the Thriveal C.P.A. Network and the VeraSage Institute are leading that profession from its roots in near-total risk aversion to something approaching the opposite. Computing may have commoditized much of the industry\u2019s everyday work, but some enterprising accountants are learning how to use some of their biggest assets \u2014 the trust of their clients and access to financial data \u2014 to provide deep insights into a company\u2019s business. They\u2019re identifying which activities are most profitable, which ones are wasteful and when the former become the latter. Accounting once was entirely backward-looking and, because no one would pay for an audit for fun, dependent on government regulation. It was a cost. Now real-time networked software can make it forward-looking and a source of profit. It\u2019s worth remembering, though, that this process never ends: As soon as accountants discover a new sort of service to provide their customers, some software innovator will be seeking ways to automate it, which means those accountants will work to constantly come up with even newer ideas. The failure loop will continue to close.Lawyers, too, are trying to transform computers from a threat into a value-adding tool. For centuries the legal profession has made a great deal of money from drawing up contracts or patent applications that inevitably sit in drawers, unexamined. Software can insert boilerplate language more cheaply now. But some computer-minded lawyers have found real value in those cabinets filled with old contracts and patent filings. They use data-sniffing programs and their own legal expertise to cull through millions of patent applications or contracts to build never-before-seen complex models of the business landscape and sell it to their clients.The manufacturing industry is going through the early stages of its own change. Until quite recently, it cost tens of millions of dollars to build a manufacturing plant. Today, 3-D printing and cloud manufacturing, a process in which entrepreneurs pay relatively little to access other companies\u2019 machines during downtime, have drastically lowered the barrier to entry for new companies. Many imagine this will revitalize the business of making things in America. Successful factories, like accounting firms, need to focus on special new products that no one in Asia has yet figured out how to mass produce. Something similar is happening in agriculture, where commodity grains are tended by computer-run tractors as farming entrepreneurs seek more value in heritage, organic, local and other specialty crops. This has been manifested in the stunning proliferation of apple varieties in our stores over the past couple of years.Every other major shift in economic order has made an enormous impact on the nature of personal and family life, and this one probably will, too. Rather than undertake one career for our entire working lives, with minimal failure allowed, many of us will be forced to experiment with several careers, frequently changing course as the market demands \u2014 and not always succeeding in our new efforts. In the corporate era, most people borrowed their reputations from the large institutions they affiliated themselves with: their employers, perhaps, or their universities. Our own personal reputations will now matter more, and they will be far more self-made. As career trajectories and earnings become increasingly volatile, gender roles will fragment further, and many families will spend some time in which the mother is a primary breadwinner and the father is underemployed and at home with the children. It will be harder to explain what you do for a living to acquaintances. The advice of mentors, whose wisdom is ascribed to a passing age, will mean less and less.To succeed in the innovation era, says Daron Acemoglu, a prominent M.I.T. economist, we will need, above all, to build a new set of institutions, something like the societal equivalent of those office parks in Sunnyvale, that help us stay flexible in the midst of turbulent lives. We\u2019ll need modern insurance and financial products that encourage us to pursue entrepreneurial ideas or the education needed for a career change. And we\u2019ll need incentives that encourage us to take these risks; we won\u2019t take them if we fear paying the full cost of failure. Acemoglu says we will need a far stronger safety net, because a society that encourages risk will intrinsically be wealthier over all.History is filled with examples of societal innovation, like the United States Constitution and the eight-hour workday, that have made many people better off. These beneficial changes tend to come, Acemoglu told me, when large swaths of the population rally together to demand them. He says it\u2019s too early to fully understand exactly what sorts of governing innovations we need today, because the new economic system is still emerging and questions about it remain: How many people will be displaced by robots and mobile apps? How many new jobs will be created? We can\u2019t build the right social institutions until we know the precise problem we\u2019re solving. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are quite there yet,\u201d he told me.Generally, those with power and wealth resist any significant shift in the existing institutions. Robber barons fought many of the changes of the Progressive Era, and Wall Street fought the reforms of the 1930s. Today, the political system seems incapable of wholesale reinvention. But Acemoglu said that could change in an instant if enough people demand it. In 1900, after all, it was impossible to predict the rise of the modern corporation, labor unions, Social Security and other transformative institutions that shifted gains from the wealthy to workers.We are a strange species, at once risk-averse and thrill-seeking, terrified of failure but eager for new adventure. If we discover ways to share those risks and those rewards, then we could conceivably arrive somewhere better. The pre-modern era was all risk and no reward. The corporate era had modest rewards and minimal risks. If we conquer our fear of failure, we can, just maybe, have both.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts, Both Republicans, Undefeated in Kansas", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOPEKA, Kan. \u2014 The Democratic surge that was supposed to end Republican control of Kansas never happened. Gov. Sam Brownback and Senator Pat Roberts survived unusually close races to keep their seats on Tuesday, fortifying their party\u2019s political grip on this plains state.Mr. Roberts, 78, who has served in Washington for more than three decades, fought back a chorus of anti-incumbent and anti-Washington sentiment. Mr. Brownback, a former United States senator who easily rode into office four years ago, prevailed despite a philosophical split in his party and a harsh race focused on deep tax cuts that his critics said had put the state in a precarious financial position.Just a year ago it would have seemed all but certain that Mr. Brownback, who won his first term with more than 60 percent of the vote, would win re-election. Republicans far outnumber Democrats among registered voters here, and most of the state\u2019s lawmakers are cut from the same conservative cloth as Mr. Brownback. But Mr. Brownback had been steadily lagging in recent polls as his Democratic opponent, Paul Davis, sought to turn the race into a referendum on the governor\u2019s conservative economic policy. Mr. Brownback had proudly said that he was embarking on a fiscal turnaround in Kansas when he took office nearly four years ago, and enacted the largest tax cuts in state history. The governor eliminated income taxes on nonwage earnings for nearly 200,000 small businesses and, over the course of two legislative sessions, worked with the Republican-controlled State Legislature to deeply slash individual income tax rates, arguing that the policies would attract new businesses and residents, thus stimulating the economy.The results so far have hardly been promising. The most recent fiscal year ended with revenue falling more than $300 million short of expectations. Job growth in Kansas has trailed that of the rest of the nation, education funding has remained mostly flat and both Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s have downgraded the state\u2019s credit rating.The latest round of bad fiscal news for the Brownback campaign came less than a week before the election when the state\u2019s Revenue Department announced that October revenue had fallen $23 million below estimates. Still Mr. Brownback insisted the fiscal situation would turn around. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten the state in a good position to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we can move forward solidly in working with the people of Kansas,\u201dMr. Davis argued that it was time for the state to change course. Mr. Brownback\u2019s agenda extended beyond tax policy to loosening gun restrictions, making it harder for women to get abortions and slashing public assistance rolls and it deepened a longstanding divide between moderate and conservative factions within the state party. Mr. Roberts, the incumbent senator, faced a formidable challenge from Greg Orman, a businessman running as an independent candidate. Mr. Roberts entered the general election bruised from a strong challenge by a candidate with Tea Party support. While Mr. Orman tried to convince the electorate that Mr. Roberts had been in Washington for too long and was out of touch with Kansas voters, Mr. Roberts linked his challenger to President Obama and Harry Reid, the Democrat who serves as Senate majority leader. \u201cTonight, Kansas stood up and said enough,\u201d Mr. Roberts said as he declared victory. \u201cEnough of the gridlock, enough of the failed leadership under President Obama and, yes, Harry Reid. I will be bold, I will be conservative and I will be constructive.\u201d Mr. Roberts said. \u201cAnd I promise you this: We will get things done.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sarkozy Tries Quick Comeback, but France May Not Go Along", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cGood thing that it\u2019s going so badly,\u201d Mr. Sarkozy said, looking over the filled seats pressed up against the stage in this city in central France. \u201cWhat kind of a venue would I have needed if things were going well?\u201dPerhaps he could not see that, behind the phalanx of television cameras set up on a midcourt platform, the gym was rather empty.Mr. Sarkozy, tanned and dapper, has been holding American-style town hall meetings around the country. His stated goal is the presidency of his center-right party, the Union for a Popular Movement, or U.M.P., for its initials in French.But there is little doubt that this campaign \u2014 with stickers that say simply \u201cMy President\u201d \u2014 is intended as a steppingstone for another run at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.On stage here, Mr. Sarkozy does not hide his delight at being back. Experts say they believe he will win more than enough votes from party members to clinch its presidency later this month. But it is becoming clearer every day that Mr. Sarkozy may be facing a far more complicated, potentially embarrassing campaign should he make another bid for the French presidency in 2017.For one thing, since Mr. Sarkozy announced his return to politics on Facebook on Sept. 29, he has been losing ground in public opinion polls. One poll by Ipsos, taken in mid-October, found that an increasing majority of French people think his return to politics is a bad idea. Another, by IFOP, found that he was losing support even among U.M.P. members.In the past few weeks, Mr. Sarkozy has also proved unable to influence legislators from his own party, suggesting that they at least doubt he will be around for long. When party members voted on a new leader in the Senate last month, Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s favored candidate lost, an awkward turn of events for the former president.\u201cIt may be that the party faithful want him back,\u201d said Christian Delporte, a history professor at the Universit\u00e9 de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, and a frequent political commentator. \u201cBut 60 percent of the public does not.\u201dWhen Mr. Sarkozy retired in 2012 after losing his re-election bid to Mr. Hollande, few analysts said they believed that he had really bowed out of politics for good, as he then claimed. But few said they expected him back quite so soon.Mr. Sarkozy has framed his comeback in patriotic, even heroic, terms: The country was suffering through such a crisis that it would have been unconscionable for him to stay on the sidelines. But many experts say that his early return had more to do with the number of investigations piling up around him and the growing popularity of Alain Jupp\u00e9, his likely rival in primaries expected in 2016.It was a question of stepping in now before it was too late, experts say. The party presidency will give Mr. Sarkozy a platform, control over party machinery and perhaps a shade of cover from the investigations that dog him, including questions about how much he knew about the vast overspending on his failed re-election bid, and then its cover-up.But running for the party presidency has also put Mr. Sarkozy in the uncomfortable position of campaigning for a job that is far smaller, and less glamorous, than the presidency of France.The U.M.P. is a troubled organization, torn apart by recent scandals and hugely in debt. Mr. Sarkozy faces several rivals within the organization, including his own former prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, who said this weekend that he would sue the newspaper Le Monde for reporting that he had tried to encourage legal action against Mr. Sarkozy in order to keep the former president from resuming a political career.Coming back so early also means that Mr. Sarkozy, should he run for the French presidency, would face a marathon of a campaign, offering numerous opportunities for his volatile side to get him into trouble.The left has already made him a target. Officials in the Hollande administration refer routinely to problems they inherited in 2012 and look for ways to embarrass Mr. Sarkozy. Recently, government officials released figures showing that Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s presidential travel in 2011 had cost on average three times as much per trip as Mr. Hollande\u2019s in 2013, figures that were clearly meant to reinforce Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s image as a flashy free spender.While experts say the French public has been sympathetic to political comebacks in the past, there is no previous case when a defeated president won another term. And two and a half years on the sidelines may not prove sufficient to have changed public perceptions of him, experts say.\u201cThere is not enough time for the public to think that he has really had time for reflection,\u201d said Pascal Perrineau, the director of the Center for Political Research at the Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques in Paris.There is a joke going around, Mr. Perrineau added, that Mr. Sarkozy had not \u201ccrossed the desert\u201d before his return to politics, \u201conly a sandbox.\u201dWith the presidential election so far away, there is plenty of time for Mr. Sarkozy to advance in the polls, and he is generally considered a skilled strategist. His supporters admire what they see as his take-action approach. He frequently tells his audiences that France needs to get some backbone back into its politics.Mr. Sarkozy draws laughs from audiences by telling them that what he sees lately from Mr. Hollande\u2019s government is the launching of proposals, then the second-guessing of those proposals, then the withdrawal of those proposals.But exactly what Mr. Sarkozy himself stands for these days remains something of a mystery.As he crisscrosses the country, he says he is focused on rejuvenating his party. He turns away questions about his views on various issues, saying he wants to hear every idea, not just impose his own. He says that this is so the party can be completely reorganized with a new platform. He suggests he is a calmer, wiser candidate, ready to collaborate with his rivals, including Mr. Jupp\u00e9, known as more statesmanlike.This leaves some listeners frustrated. In St.-Cyr-sur-Loire, Amin Brimou, a high school student, asked Mr. Sarkozy what he intended to do for young people if he won the presidency in 2017. Mr. Sarkozy deplored the fact that so many young French people went abroad to find work, but he offered no solutions.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t much of an answer,\u201d Mr. Brimou said. \u201cHe is not that impressive.\u201dBut some say that Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s biggest problem may be that he has simply failed to change, which makes it that much harder to sell himself as a new candidate.\u201cThe right was ready to discover Sarkozy 2.0,\u201d said Thomas Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9, who wrote a book analyzing why Mr. Sarkozy was likely to come back. \u201cThey could have been receptive, but it isn\u2019t there. He is the same. Exactly the same.\u201dAn article on Nov. 11 about voters\u2019 lack of enthusiasm for an attempted political comeback by Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president, misstated the timing of a vote for president of the Union for a Popular Movement, Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s center-right party. It was scheduled for late November, not \u201cnext month.\u201d The article also misspelled the surname of a high school student who asked Mr. Sarkozy what he intended to do for young people if he won the presidency in 2017. He is Amin Brimou, not Baimou.Yann Cres contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Uighur Unrest Is Opportunity for Afghans", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Since the British first tried and failed to subdue Afghanistan in the 19th century, stumbling into a costly Afghan war seems to have become a mandatory step for global power players. The Soviet Union did it in the 1980s, and the American battle here has passed the 13-year mark.Now, China seems to be taking its turn in coming to grips with Afghanistan\u2019s role in its national security.No one expects China to be sending troops any time soon, even with the United States and NATO pulling out the last of their combat forces at year\u2019s end. But China has taken a major step in formalizing closer relations with the Afghan government: Last week, it said it planned to provide billions of dollars in new economic and security assistance.That is being taken as good news by American officials, who have sought to encourage China to take a larger role in Afghanistan beyond just trying to develop the country\u2019s mineral wealth. And Afghan officials, whose economy is in dire shape and whose government is struggling to pay its bills, are eager to find a new source of aid and investment.Since 2001, a smattering of Uighur militants have fought in Afghanistan and elsewhere. And Chinese officials blame a Uighur separatist group, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, for a spate of attacks that have killed hundreds of people in China over the past two years.Some experts say Chinese fears that the Uighur separatist cause might spread widely among other militant groups are overblown. But where some see unfounded fears, the Afghans have sensed an opportunity to secure a new, rich benefactor.Further, interviews with Afghan officials suggest that they also hope to use the presence of Uighur militants here to drive a wedge between China and Pakistan, which has aided and sheltered the Taliban in the past and is a longstanding ally of Beijing.In the past year, Afghanistan\u2019s main intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, has persistently flagged to Beijing each and every one of the dozens of Uighurs who it says were caught by Afghan forces fighting inside the country. And Afghan and Western officials familiar with the effort say that the intelligence agency has painstakingly prepared dossiers for Chinese officials, laying out evidence tracing the militants back to Islamist training camps inside Pakistan.The subject was atop the agenda last month when Rahmatullah Nabil, the acting director of the Afghan intelligence agency, quietly visited Beijing before President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s first state trip to China, officials familiar with the negotiations said.Then, after a meeting last week between Mr. Ghani and President Xi Jinping in Beijing, Chinese officials said the two had agreed to jointly press the fight against Uighur militants.\u201cIn the area of security, President Ghani expressed readiness and staunch support from the Afghan side in China\u2019s fight against East Turkestan Islamic Movement terrorist forces,\u201d Kong Xuanyou, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official, told reporters after the meeting, according to Reuters.Mr. Nabil said it was \u201ca big achievement\u201d that the Chinese government was now listening to the Afghans about Uighurs who were being trained in Pakistan.\u201cA big number of Uighurs were arrested, and during the investigation they were talking about where they received training, how they received training,\u201d he said in an interview before his most recent visit to China. \u201cWe think they are preparing themselves, which is a big issue for the Chinese.\u201dHe added that the new Afghan government was trying \u201cto manage\u201d the issue, which is precisely what Mr. Ghani appears to have done during his visit to Beijing. There, China pledged nearly $330 million in aid through 2017, a sharp jump from the $250 million it had provided in the past 13 years.China also said it was planning new commercial investments along with an unspecified amount of increased security assistance. Afghan officials say that aid will go far beyond the limited help Beijing had previously provided, much of which focused on counternarcotics efforts.That was seven years ago. And in the intervening years, the Chinese have done little to move forward with the project, put off by the threat of Taliban attacks and the general chaos of doing business in Afghanistan. Commitments to build housing for villagers who would be displaced by the mine and to build a railway line and a 400-megawatt power plant have yet to be fulfilled. Afghan officials have in the past year talked of possibly renegotiating the contract.Still, Mr. Ghani unsurprisingly struck a positive note about China\u2019s newfound willingness to aid Afghanistan upon his return home last weekend.A closer relationship, he told reporters, would help Afghanistan toward becoming \u201can intersection for Asia, as it was during the time of the Silk Road.\u201dThe camel caravans were long ago replaced by trucks. But the banditry remains, and the raging Taliban insurgency has left stretches of the old Silk Road as dangerous as they have ever been. American projects aimed at creating what officials liked to call a New Silk Road in the past 13 years have yielded little beyond talk and misspent money.Mr. Ghani, in his comments to reporters, acknowledged that peace was needed to ensure any kind of sustained economic development in Afghanistan, be it spurred by Chinese renminbi or American dollars.Asked directly about whether he had asked China to become more involved in putting pressure on the Taliban \u2014 and in pressing Pakistan to do more to push the Taliban\u2019s leadership to negotiate \u2014 Mr. Ghani was careful to avoid specifics. Instead, he spoke of the miseries of war and said, \u201cWe are tired of blood.\u201dThen he added, \u201cThe only one who can be effective in peace is the one who has good relations with all sides.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. and China Reach Climate Accord After Months of Talks", "Date": "2014-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe landmark agreement, jointly announced here by President Obama and President Xi Jinping, includes new targets for carbon emissions reductions by the United States and a first-ever commitment by China to stop its emissions from growing by 2030.Administration officials said the agreement, which was worked out quietly between the United States and China over nine months and included a letter from Mr. Obama to Mr. Xi proposing a joint approach, could galvanize efforts to negotiate a new global climate agreement by 2015.It was the signature achievement of an unexpectedly productive two days of meetings between the leaders. Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi also agreed to a military accord designed to avert clashes between Chinese and American planes and warships in the tense waters off the Chinese coast, as well as an understanding to cut tariffs for technology products.A climate deal between China and the United States, the world\u2019s No. 1 and No. 2 carbon polluters, is viewed as essential to concluding a new global accord. Unless Beijing and Washington can resolve their differences, climate experts say, few other countries will agree to mandatory cuts in emissions, and any meaningful worldwide pact will be likely to founder.\u201cThe United States and China have often been seen as antagonists,\u201d said a senior official, speaking in advance of Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks. \u201cWe hope that this announcement can usher in a new day in which China and the U.S. can act much more as partners.\u201dAs part of the agreement, Mr. Obama announced that the United States would emit 26 percent to 28 percent less carbon in 2025 than it did in 2005. That is double the pace of reduction it targeted for the period from 2005 to 2020.Administration officials acknowledged that Mr. Obama could face opposition to his plans from a Republican-controlled Congress. While the agreement with China needs no congressional ratification, lawmakers could try to roll back Mr. Obama\u2019s initiatives, undermining the United States\u2019 ability to meet the new reduction targets. Still, Mr. Obama\u2019s visit, which came days after a setback in the midterm elections, allowed him to reclaim some of the momentum he lost at home. As the campaign was turning against the Democrats last month, Mr. Obama quietly dispatched John Podesta, a senior adviser who oversees climate policy, to Beijing to try to finalize a deal.For all the talk of collaboration, the United States and China also displayed why they are still fierce rivals for global economic primacy, promoting competing free-trade blocs for the Asian region even as they reached climate and security deals.The maneuvering came during a conference of Pacific Rim economies held in Beijing that has showcased China\u2019s growing dominance in Asia, but also the determination of the United States, riding a resurgent economy, to reclaim its historical role as a Pacific power.Adding to the historic nature of the visit, Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi were scheduled to give a joint news conference on Wednesday that will include questions from reporters \u2014 a rare concession by the Chinese leader to a visiting American president.On Tuesday evening, Mr. Xi invited Mr. Obama to dinner at his official residence, telling his guest he hoped they had laid the foundation for a collaborative relationship \u2014 or, as he more metaphorically put it, \u201cA pool begins with many drops of water.\u201dGreeting Mr. Obama at the gate of the walled leadership compound next to the Forbidden City, Mr. Xi squired him across a brightly lighted stone bridge and into the residence. Mr. Obama told the Chinese president that he wanted to take the relationship \u201cto a new level.\u201d\u201cWhen the U.S. and China are able to work together effectively,\u201d he added, \u201cthe whole world benefits.\u201dBut as the world witnessed this week, it is more complicated than that. Mr. Xi won approval Tuesday from the 21 countries of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to study the creation of a China-led free-trade zone that would be an alternative to Mr. Obama\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trading bloc that excludes China.On Monday, Mr. Obama met with members of that group here and claimed progress in negotiating the partnership, a centerpiece of his strategic shift to Asia.Negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership are much further along than those for the nascent Chinese plan, known as the Free Trade Area of Asia Pacific, and some analysts said the approval by the Pacific Rim nations of a two-year study was mainly a gesture to the Chinese hosts to give them something to announce at the meeting.For all the jockeying, the biggest trade headline was a breakthrough in negotiations with China to eliminate tariffs on information technology products, from video-game consoles and computer software to medical equipment and semiconductors.The understanding, American officials said, opens the door to expanding a World Trade Organization agreement on these products, assuming other countries can be persuaded to accept the same terms. With China on board, officials predicted a broader deal would be reached swiftly.\u201cWe\u2019re going to take what\u2019s been achieved here in Beijing back to Geneva to work with our W.T.O. partners,\u201d said Michael B. Froman, the United States trade representative. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t take anything for granted, we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll be able to work quickly\u201d to conclude an expansion of the agreement, known as the Information Technology Agreement.On Wednesday morning, Mr. Xi formally welcomed Mr. Obama at a ceremony in the Great Hall of the People; they later toasted each other at a state banquet.Administration officials said Mr. Obama had pressed Mr. Xi to resume a United States-China working group on cybersecurity issues, which abruptly stopped its discussions after the United States charged several Chinese military officers with hacking.\u201cWe did see a chill in the cyber dialogue,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser. \u201cWe do believe it\u2019s better if there\u2019s a mechanism for dialogue.\u201dOn Tuesday, Mr. Obama credited APEC with originating the work on reducing tariffs, saying, \u201cThe United States and China have reached an understanding that we hope will contribute to a rapid conclusion of the broader negotiations in Geneva.\u201dTalks with China over expanding the 1997 accord on information technology broke down last year over the scope of the products covered by the agreement. But after intensive negotiations leading up to Mr. Obama\u2019s visit, Mr. Froman said, the Americans and the Chinese agreed Monday evening to eliminate more than 200 categories of tariffs.While the United States still exports many high-technology goods, China is the world\u2019s dominant exporter of electronics and has much to gain from an elimination of tariffs. Taiwan, South Korea and Japan increasingly find themselves supplying China\u2019s huge electronics industry, deepening their dependence on decisions made in Beijing.The administration estimated that expanding the Information Technology Agreement would create up to 60,000 jobs in the United States by eliminating tariffs on goods that generate $1 trillion in sales a year. About $100 billion of those products are American-made. The administration faces a longer path on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, including whether Mr. Obama will obtain fast-track trade authority from Congress. That could make it easier for the United States to extract concessions from other countries, since they would have more confidence that the treaty would be ratified by Congress.While Mr. Froman conceded that sticking points remained, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s become clearer and clearer what the landing zones are.\u201d He said that Mr. Obama would seek fast-track authority, but that the best way for him to win congressional passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership would be to negotiate the best deal.Keith Bradsher and Chris Buckley contributed reporting from Hong Kong, and Coral Davenport from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Compromise Plan, Limited Fracking Is Approved for National Forest in Virginia", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrilling for oil and natural gas will be mostly off-limits in the largest national forest in the East, whose streams bring drinking water to Washington and Richmond, Va., the federal government said Tuesday.The decision was a compromise that allowed some fracking while closing 90 percent of the forest to fracking and conventional drilling, which the earlier proposal would have permitted. In an unusual outcome, groups on all sides \u2014 industry, environmentalists and the governor of Virginia \u2014 claimed victory in the compromise management plan, years in the making.Unlike in national parks or wilderness areas, industrial development \u2014 including mining, forestry and ski resorts \u2014 is permitted in national forests. The final plan reversed a 2011 draft that would have allowed drilling in much of the 1.1-million-acre forest. It drew more than 50,000 public comments, most opposed to gas development anywhere in the forest, but some from industry saying fracking could be done safely, according to Forest Service officials. The plan will allow drilling on 10,000 acres in the forest now leased for energy development and on 167,000 acres whose mineral rights are privately owned. Currently, there are no active gas wells in the forest or in surrounding private tracts.Although the George Washington National Forest is on the southeast edge of the Marcellus Shale formation, where there has been an enormous gas drilling boom, forestry officials said the gas beneath the Virginia forest was less than 1 percent of the formation and so far not commercially attractive. Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, who has voiced opposition to fracking anywhere in the scenic forest, applauded the decision.\u201cOver the past few months I have communicated with Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and top administration officials about Virginians\u2019 concerns regarding proposals to open public lands in the forest to fracking activity, and I believe today\u2019s unprecedented decision is evidence that our voices were heard,\u201d he said in a statement.Environmental groups also welcomed the decision.It was a compromise also welcomed by the Virginia Petroleum Council.\u201cHorizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is helping to unlock the tremendous economic and job creation benefits that Virginians, and all Americans, need and want,\u201d said Michael Ward, executive director of the council.

{"Headline": "Midterms, for Clinton Team, Aren\u2019t All Gloom", "Date": "2014-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the coming weeks, Hillary Rodham Clinton will stop delivering paid speeches. She will embark on an unofficial listening tour to gather ideas from the business community, union leaders and others. And she will seek advice from such far-flung advisers as an ad man in Austin, Tex., behind the iconic \u201cDon\u2019t Mess With Texas\u201d campaign and a leading strategist at a Boston-based public affairs consulting firm with ties to the Kennedys.The Democratic debacle in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections has put new urgency on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s efforts to create a blueprint for a 2016 presidential candidacy, including exploring White Plains as a possible national headquarters and digesting exit polls to determine what the midterm results could mean for the presidential electoral map.A number of advisers saw only upside for Mrs. Clinton in the party\u2019s midterm defeats. Before then, opinions had been mixed about when she should form an exploratory committee, the first step toward declaring a presidential candidacy, with some urging her to delay it until late spring.But over the past few days, a consensus formed among those close to Mrs. Clinton that it is time to accelerate her schedule: She faces pressure to resurrect the Democratic Party, and she is already being scrutinized as the party\u2019s presumptive nominee, so advisers see little reason to delay. No action will be taken before the Dec. 6 runoff in Louisiana between Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a Democrat and a Clinton friend, and her Republican challenger, Rep. Bill Cassidy, putting the likely date for the establishing an exploratory committee in early next year, said several Clinton advisers who insisted on anonymity in discussing private conversations.Donors, meanwhile, have already started to discuss a Clinton candidacy, at times barely veiling a giddy excitement. On Wednesday evening, Ready for Hillary, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d that supports her candidacy, sent a fund-raising email. \u201cNow more than ever we need to show Hillary that we\u2019re ready for her to get in this race,\u201d the plea for donations read. \u201cAmerica needs Hillary\u2019s leadership.\u201d In many ways, Tuesday\u2019s election results clear a path for Mrs. Clinton. The lopsided outcome and conservative tilt makes it less likely she would face an insurgent challenger from the left. And a Republican-led Senate creates a handy foil for her to run against: Rather than the delicate task of trying to draw a stark contrast with an unpopular president in whose administration she served, her loyalists say, Mrs. Clinton can instead present herself as a pragmatic alternative to what they predict will be an obstructionist Republican Congress.\"Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and their allies in the House\" will be \"pushing Republican leadership hard,\" said Geoff Garin, a pollster who succeeded Mark Penn as chief strategist for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign. \"When that happens it will give Hillary Clinton or whoever the Democratic nominee is a better platform to run.\"But before any campaigning begins, Mrs. Clinton will first embark on a listening tour that echoes what she did first as a candidate for the Senate in New York and then as a freshman senator, gathering ideas and advice from a cross-section of influential people about their concerns. \u201cShe\u2019ll slow down a bit, get off the radar, get ready for this, and ready includes being a good freshman senator, with a legal pad and lots of conversations,\u201d said one person with direct knowledge of her plans who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans have not been made public. Meanwhile, the people around Mrs. Clinton will speed up their efforts to vet potential campaign aides, casually connect with donors and begin to help Mrs. Clinton craft a clearer message, especially on the economy. Although Mrs. Clinton\u2019s midterm campaigning schedule took her to Iowa, Pennsylvania, Colorado, North Carolina and other important 2016 states, she did not spend much time getting to know the specific concerns of voters, something she would need to do ahead of a presidential campaign. Exit polls from Tuesday are being pored over for signs about what voters\u2019 opinions could mean for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s message and approach. Midterm voters expressed frustration with government, but also economic unease.\u201cOne of the questions for 2016 is: Which of those will 2016 be about? Will it be about the size and cost of government, or will it be about who the economy works for?\u201d Mr. Garin asked. \u201cIf it\u2019s an election about who the economy works for, then the Democratic nominee will be in a much better position to win,\u201d he added.To help Mrs. Clinton do just that, several advisers are already being eyed for senior positions in a potential 2016 campaign. People close to Mrs. Clinton often point to a potential campaign manager in Robby Mook, a 34-year-old operative who managed the campaign for the Clintons\u2019 longtime money man, Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia. In addition to her small personal staff, Mrs. Clinton also receives advice from Minyon Moore, a savvy former White House adviser who works at the Dewey Square Group, a Boston-based consultancy with an office in Washington. A spokeswoman for Dewey Square said the firm has no formal relationship with Mrs. Clinton.Ms. Moore is close to other potential campaign aides like Guy Cecil, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and who previously worked at Dewey Square. Other advisers are more far-flung. Roy Spence, the Austin advertising executive who helped develop the state\u2019s ubiquitous \u201cDon\u2019t Mess with Texas\u201d anti-littering campaign and who has known the Clintons for decades, is offering advice about image and messaging.Mrs. Clinton turned to Sean Wilentz, a Princeton professor and presidential historian, for advice on shaping her stump speech ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election. During the 2008 Democratic primary, Professor Wilentz, a longtime Clinton defender, accused Barack Obama\u2019s campaign of \u201cthe most outrageous deployment of racial politics since the Willie Horton ad campaign in 1988.\u201d(A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton declined to comment, and Mr. Spence and Professor Wilentz did not respond to requests for comment.)During the midterm campaign, Mrs. Clinton raised more than $10 million for Democrats,\u00a0and she and former President Bill Clinton attended at least 75 events on behalf of more than 30 candidates, building and rebuilding the relationships she and her husband are known for.The Clintons worked hard on behalf of Alison Lundergan Grimes, a candidate for Senate in Kentucky, and Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, and were somewhat startled by their double-digit losses. But it was former Gov. Charlie Crist\u2019s loss to Gov. Rick Scott of Florida that carried the biggest implications for a 2016 presidential campaign, as the Clintons had hoped for Democratic leadership in a critical battleground state. Other Democratic defeats had a silver lining. The Maryland governor\u2019s race in which a Republican, Larry Hogan, defeated the Democrat, Anthony G. Brown, 51.6 percent to 46.9 percent, for example, diminished the likelihood that former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, another Democrat, could emerge as a serious primary challenge to Mrs. Clinton.As the outline for a campaign is drawn, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters describe what they envision as a \u201cNew Clinton Map\u201d that they believe could create a winning coalition for 2016, drawing on the white working-class women who have long supported Mrs. Clinton and the young voters and African-Americans who helped elect Mr. Obama.Advertisement"}

But no event in the 29-year history of the arena has attracted as many people or earned as much money as last month\u2019s performances of \u201cDisney on Ice Presents \u2018Frozen.\u2019 \u201d For six days, waves of little blue-and-white Princess Elsas \u2014 and quite a few costumed parents \u2014 sang the movie\u2019s hit song, \u201cLet It Go,\u201d at the top of their lungs, enjoyed $15 snow cones, posed for $25 pictures with cardboard cutouts and waved plastic sticks, which had miraculously become $28 magic wands.Behold the bewitching power of branding. In the year since Disney\u2019s latest princess movie, \u201cFrozen,\u201d opened last November, Elsa and her sister, Anna, have rapidly become two of the world\u2019s most successful product endorsers. Disney said earlier this month that it had already sold three million \u201cFrozen\u201d dresses in North America, which, as it happens, is roughly the number of 4-year-old girls in North America. In January, \u201cFrozen\u201d wedding dresses go on sale for $1,200. Next summer, \u201cAdventures by Disney\u201d is offering tours of Norwegian sites that inspired the film\u2019s animators at prices starting north of $5,000. The company is also rolling out \u201cFrozen\"-branded \u201capples and grapes, juice, yogurt, bandages and a complete oral-care line.\u201d Disney estimates that \u201cFrozen\u201d brought in more than $1 billion in retail revenue over the last year. The chief executive, Robert A. Iger, told CNBC that he expected holiday sales to be \u201cvery, very hot.\u201dThe creators of \u201cFrozen,\u201d Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, told me that they set out to create characters young girls would recognize. \u201cI love Cinderella,\u201d Lee says. \u201cAm I anything like her? No. I grew up and became someone more independent.\u201d Elsa and Anna, she says, \u201care princesses because they\u2019ve got the weight of a kingdom on their shoulders, not as the solution to a happy ending.\u201dThey realized they had succeeded, and then some, soon after the movie was released, when they went to see it like ordinary people. Lee found herself in a New York theater, where many audience members already knew the words. Then she started to hear people singing on the street. A year later, they haven\u2019t stopped. Does she ever get tired of hearing \u201cLet It Go\u201d? No. Not really. Not yet. \u201cWhen I\u2019m old, it will be the only thing left in my brain,\u201d she says.As a result, Disney is in the midst of a golden age of profitability. Disney characters have been endorsing products since 1929, when Walt Disney put Mickey Mouse on a writing tablet. But licensing, which began as a sideline, has become the main event. In most years, Disney makes more money from selling branded movie merchandise than from the actual movies. \u201cWe create products that extend the storytelling \u2014 the emotional connection that the consumer has when they\u2019re seeing the film carries on in the three-dimensional world,\u201d says Josh Silverman, the executive vice president for global licensing. A recent favorite, he says, is the Olaf snow-cone maker. Modeled after the slapstick snowman who provides the comic relief in \u201cFrozen,\u201d it emits frosty treats from a somewhat disturbing hole in Olaf\u2019s belly.The popularity of \u201cFrozen\u201d is also buoyed by the expanding toy market for girls. Princesses may seem like a permanent feature of the toyscape, but they were less common before the 1990s. \u201cThe idea that pink princess fantasy dream dolls have always been a part of girlhood is false,\u201d says Elizabeth Sweet, a lecturer at the University of California, Davis, who studies the cultural history of toys. Sweet has found that the popularity of gender-neutral toys reached a peak in the mid-1970s. Since then, toy makers have embraced the market-doubling effect of pushing certain toys to boys and other toys to girls. Sweet says the level of gender segregation has never been higher. A typical big-box store might have four aisles of blue toys and four aisles of pink toys with an aisle of yellow toys in between. \u201cSeparate but equal,\u201d she says. Legos, for example, evolved from simple packs of building blocks into play sets mostly sold to boys, often with brand tie-ins. In 2012, the company introduced Lego Friends, which are basically Legos for girls.Disney really began to focus on princesses in 2000, after a new executive went to see a \u201cDisney on Ice\u201d show and was struck by how many of the girls in the audience were wearing homemade princess costumes. \u201cThey weren\u2019t even Disney products,\u201d the executive, Andy Mooney, told the writer Peggy Orenstein for her book about the rise of princesses, \u201cCinderella Ate My Daughter.\u201d The Disney Princess line now makes about $4 billion a year, on par with the earning power of Mickey Mouse himself. (The \u201cFrozen\u201d girls are not, as yet, official members of the Princess ensemble.)This market has similarities with, of all things, the pharmaceutical industry. Drugs are marketed to patients, who tend to trust brand names over generics, and are paid for by insurance companies, under their contractual obligations. This has an inflationary effect on drug prices, leading to those eye-popping numbers that send the uninsured fleeing U.S. drugstores to try their luck in Tijuana. Similarly, toys and the like are marketed to children and purchased by parents. People who would never buy a $15 snow cone for themselves will buy one, gladly or grudgingly, for each of their children.After all, who wants to say no to their princess?Advertisement"}

But that is what happened.Ms. Martinez lives in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, with her younger daughter, a United States citizen who was born not long after Ms. Martinez, her husband and their older daughter arrived here on a tourist visa from Ecuador in 2005. Ms. Martinez later sent her older daughter to live with friends in another state because she feared the girl would be discovered by immigration officials and deported.Ms. Martinez and her husband faced\u00a0deportation themselves in 2011, after\u00a0being apprehended by a border patrol agent during a family\u00a0trip to Rochester. As their daughters watched in shock, they were led away in handcuffs and detained for a day before being released.\u00a0Their marriage did not survive, crumbling\u00a0under the constant stress of living illegally\u00a0in this country, Ms. Martinez said. Now it is just Ms. Martinez and her younger daughter in a rundown, three-bedroom apartment furnished with hand-me-downs from friends and Craigslist.\u201cI don\u2019t have money, I don\u2019t have papers, I don\u2019t have a family, but I have my faith and my hope that something is going to change,\u201d said Ms. Martinez, 50, wiping away tears during an interview in her apartmentMs. Martinez\u2019s struggle to stay in this country helped break her family apart, and it still exacts a daily toll as she toils in a clerical job that does not require her to show work papers, earning so little that she cannot afford to buy new clothes or hire a tutor for her daughter, she said.\u201cShe\u2019s exactly why this country needs immigration reform,\u201d said Jacqueline Esposito, a lawyer who has worked on behalf of Ms. Martinez and has become a friend. \u201cWe should be taking obstacles away from Sara, who has so much to offer.\u201dThere are millions of undocumented parents like Ms. Martinez across the country, including 250,000 to 350,000 in New York State, according to the New York Immigration Coalition, a policy and advocacy organization.\u201cWe can no longer wait for a do-nothing Congress to address the needs of millions of immigrants who are critical to the fabric of America,\u201d Steven Choi, executive director of the coalition, said in a statement. \u201cBy acting boldly on administrative relief, the president will demonstrate the enormously positive impact of giving immigrant families a chance to live without fear, come out of the shadows and contribute to the economy in a meaningful way.\u201dAs Ms. Martinez told her tale, she hugged a framed photo of the aged woman who raised her in Ecuador, a neighbor who took her in when her own mother abandoned her as a three-month-old. Ms. Martinez said she could not go to her funeral in Ecuador in 2012 because she feared she would not be able to come back to New York.\u201cFor us, family is everything,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes, I think it\u2019s not worth it, because where is the family now?\u201dMs. Martinez\u2019s younger daughter, who is 9 and in fourth grade at a public elementary school, said she worries that they might have to move to Ecuador some day. \u201cI want to live here because I know it a lot and I have friends,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I go over there, I don\u2019t know anyone.\u201dMs. Martinez asked that the names of her daughters and former husband not be disclosed to protect their privacy.Ms. Martinez grew up living in a one-room shack in the riverfront city of Guayaquil. She would rise at 5 a.m., she recalled, to get in line to use the single outdoor bathroom shared with five other families. Her adoptive mother worked long hours washing clothes in the homes of the wealthy to pay for her school books, and brought table scraps home to feed to her.Ms. Martinez studied hard, graduating at the top of her high school class, and earned a university degree in business administration. She worked for a lumber company for two decades, starting as a secretary\u2019s assistant and eventually running the purchasing department. She bought a two-bedroom, one-bath house for herself and her adoptive mother, and added a third bedroom after she married a co-worker, an accountant, and their first daughter was born.When she was 40, her husband, who had lost his job, said he was moving to Sunset Park, where his brother was living; he had heard that opportunities were plentiful there. She gave up her job and went with him.They moved in with her husband\u2019s brother, and he found a job selling costume jewelry. She cried constantly, she said, and cried even harder when she found out she was pregnant. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIf I left, my daughters were going to grow up without their father. I didn\u2019t want them to have the life I had: no love, no father, in poverty.\u201dMs. Martinez signed up for English classes at a family support center. The social workers held a baby shower for her. At night and on weekends, she cleaned other people\u2019s homes, usually earning $200 a week or less. It was the first of many jobs she was overqualified for.Her family joined a church. The pastor helped them rent an apartment of their own, vouching for them with the landlord.Their new life was derailed in 2011 after the\u00a0trip to Rochester to visit friends for Christmas.\u00a0As Ms. Martinez and her husband tried to get on the bus to go home, a border patrol agent asked to see their papers.\u00a0As her\u00a0husband panicked, Ms. Martinez said, she told the truth. Deportation proceedings were started.\u00a0Ms. Martinez turned for help to the New York Immigration Coalition. Ms. Esposito, then its director of immigration advocacy, said the group fought to keep Ms. Martinez from being deported under a directive from the Obama administration that expanded the use of prosecutorial discretion in such cases. But Ms. Martinez\u2019s appeals were repeatedly rejected until United States Representative Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez called top immigration officials on her behalf, Ms. Esposito said. Ms. Martinez\u2019s case was closed.\u201cAll it was,\u201d Ms. Esposito explained, \u201cwas a decision not to deport Sara. It did not give her any way to gain legal status, essentially leaving her in limbo.\u201dSince then, Ms. Martinez said she has not taken any buses out of town, ever fearful that she might be stopped again and her case reopened. Her ex-husband comes to visit their daughter every two weeks, but she does not ask about his status. His brother was deported to Ecuador a couple of years ago, she said.Her younger daughter has suffered from depression, and is small for her age because she barely eats, Ms. Martinez said.Her older daughter, now 20, was angry at first, but has thrived in her new life, she said. She finished high school and attends college in another state.\u201cShe\u2019s in a safe place,\u201d is all Ms. Martinez will say.Benjamin Mueller and Julia Preston contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pursuing a Shipping Revolution as Big as His Airship", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMONTEBELLO, Calif. \u2014 Somewhere beneath the graying shock of mad-professor hair, the dark circles under his eyes and the Russian-strained, cigarette-stained baritone, there remains in Igor Pasternak a boy with a dream.It has been this way since his curiosity was piqued growing up in the Soviet Union during the last throes of the space race. Photos of blimps and dirigibles in magazines fascinated him. By the time he was 10, with the encouragement of an airship designer to whom he had written a letter, Mr. Pasternak was consumed with the idea of building a vessel that would float across the sky.\u201cIt stuck,\u201d Mr. Pasternak said with a grin.\u201cBecause I don\u2019t have enough imagination,\u201d he continued. \u201cI just stuck with this and became a boring person. I\u2019ve become the horse with blinders.\u201dThis singular path has taken Mr. Pasternak, 50, a long way from his childhood in Lviv, Ukraine. He studied to become an engineer, started his own company, now called Aeroscraft Corporation, in the midst of perestroika and moved to the United States when the post-Soviet economy collapsed.Now, he says he believes he is on the verge of developing an aircraft that will change the way large cargo can be shipped.Mr. Pasternak envisions this hulking, 770-foot-long, silver-skinned airship, which is kept aloft by helium-filled tanks, delivering fresh fruit to Alaska, dropping triage units at disaster sites or depositing heavy machinery into remote locations \u2014 no ports, rail lines, roads or airstrips necessary.It would be able to fly at up to 120 knots, four times as fast as a cargo ship. Its capacity of 250 tons is about twice that of a C-5 cargo plane, and it has a range of about 5,870 miles, enough to go from Boston to Burkina Faso.Last month, several congressmen and local officials were present for the christening of a more modest, conventional airship from Mr. Pasternak\u2019s company, a blimp that has been sold to a Mexican company that plans to use it to monitor oil pipelines. Mr. Pasternak speaks about the possibilities of his project with a salesman\u2019s promise and a zealot\u2019s conviction.When the Aeroscraft is completed, which he says will be four years from now, it will have the ability to transform the distribution of goods the way the Internet has transformed communication.\u201cWhen the Internet was created, it was to solve the problem of: In a nuclear war, how is the world going to communicate?\u201d Mr. Pasternak said. \u201cNo one was thinking about the vision of Google and Facebook and Alibaba. We will change the distribution system same way with this project.\u201dBut Chris Caplice, executive director for M.I.T.\u2019s Center for Transportation and Logistics, is wary of such hyperbole. In many cases, he sees airships like the Aeroscraft as only marginally more efficient than trains, ships and cargo planes for large deliveries.\u201cIt has its uses, but they\u2019re narrow,\u201d Dr. Caplice said. He added that many new technological developments \u2014 in this case, the helium buoyancy system that mimics a fish\u2019s air bladder \u2014 go through the Gartner hype curve, in which a period of inflated expectation is followed by the trough of disillusionment, which eventually gives way a middle ground as a product finds its niche. He cited as an example smart tags, radio frequency identification markers that can be used to track goods or animals. The tags have not quite revolutionized how people keep track of things.\u201cIt\u2019s like spaghetti,\u201d Dr. Caplice said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to throw it on the wall and see if it sticks.\u201dDirigibles have long dealt with a perception problem \u2014 nobody wants to get on the next Hindenburg. The sell has been much easier among scientists, who understand that these ships run on nonflammable helium, unlike the Hindenburg, which immolated when its hydrogen tanks exploded while docking in Lakehurst, N.J., in 1937.Airships have found their most reliable use not in carrying people or cargo, but instead as slow-moving billboards in the sky, notably for Goodyear and MetLife. Interest was also keen from the military, but that has cooled in recent years in the face of cutbacks. Representative Brad Sherman, a California Democrat and a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the Air Force leadership was being shortsighted.\u201cIt\u2019s natural for the military to underinvest in research and logistics,\u201d Mr. Sherman said. \u201cIt\u2019s less sexy. The Air Force wants a fighter plane to shoot down a Chinese plane invented 10 years from now and deployed 20 years from now. The truth is logistics is terribly important, for both military and civilian purposes.\u201dMr. Sherman cited two potential uses for the military: being able to drop 100 soldiers and their equipment in any open field, and plastering an American flag over the Aeroscraft to serve as a valuable advertisement when it is delivering humanitarian aid to foreign countries.But Richard Aboulafia, a cargo industry and transportation analyst, said the private sector market for an airship like the Aeroscraft \u201cis a problematic one.\u201dMr. Aboulafia said there were three hurdles to overcome: the difficulty in making a new market entrance in air transportation, Cold War-era Russian planes that can be leased inexpensively and the fact that exotic cargo is often a one-way trip, which raises costs.Yes, Mr. Pasternak said, he has heard the doubts. Now, the technology is complete, he said. All he needs is further testing, and then customers.A small fleet of smaller models, which are 555 feet with a 66-ton capacity, should be ready in three years, he said. The plan is for the 250-ton capacity ship to be ready another year after that.Mr. Pasternak professes to be patient. He has dealt with other setbacks. Last year, weeks after a flight demonstration of a one-third scale model Aeroscraft ship, part of the hangar roof where it was being housed collapsed, damaging it beyond repair. The accident added about nine months to the timeline, he said.Beyond the military contracts, Aeroscraft has signed partnership agreements with companies including Bertling Logistics, Air Charter Service and Pacific Airlift, though the terms of those deals are unclear.As for financing?\u201cHah,\u201d he said with a dismissive nod of his head, adding, \u201cThe best financing is customer financing. It keeps you honest. There is a difference between a financial investor and a customer because a financial investor is looking for a return on his investment and a customer is looking for performance. When you go with this approach, it gives you more freedom.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mark Strand, 80, Dies; Pulitzer-Winning Poet Laureate", "Date": "2014-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMark Strand, whose spare, deceptively simple investigations of rootlessness, alienation and the ineffable strangeness of life made him one of America\u2019s most hauntingly meditative poets, died on Saturday at his daughter\u2019s home in Brooklyn. He was 80.His daughter Jessica Strand said the cause was liposarcoma, a rare cancer of the fat cells.Mr. Strand, who was named poet laureate of the United States in 1990 and awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1999 for his collection \u201cBlizzard of One,\u201d made an early impression with short, often surreal lyric poems that imparted an unsettling sense of personal dislocation \u2014 what the poet and critic Richard Howard called \u201cthe working of the divided self.\u201dHis first poetry collection, \u201cSleeping With One Eye Open,\u201d published in 1964, set the tone.\u201cIn a field/ I am the absence/ of field,\u201d the much-anthologized poem \u201cKeeping Things Whole\u201d begins. \u201cThis is/ always the case./ Wherever I am/ I am what is missing.\u201dIt goes on:When I walkI part the airand alwaysthe air moves into fill the spaceswhere my body\u2019s been.We all have reasonsfor moving.I moveto keep things whole.Echoes of Wallace Stevens and Elizabeth Bishop could be heard in his compressed, highly specific language and wintry cast of mind, as could painters like Giorgio de Chirico, Ren\u00e9 Magritte and Edward Hopper, whose moody clarity and mysterious shadows dovetailed with Mr. Strand\u2019s own sensibility.\u201cHe is not a religious poet on the face of it, but he fits into a long tradition of meditation and contemplation,\u201d said David Kirby, the author of \u201cMark Strand and the Poet\u2019s Place in Contemporary Culture\u201d and a professor of English at Florida State University. \u201cHe makes you see how trivial the things of this world are, and how expansive the self is, once you unhook it from flat-screen TVs and iPhones.\u201d Reading Mr. Strand, he said, \u201cWe learn what a big party solitude is.\u201dIn 1980, Mr. Strand felt that he had reached an impasse and stopped writing poetry for several years. He wrote children\u2019s books, beginning with \u201cThe Planet of Lost Things\u201d (1982), and short stories, 14 of them collected in \u201cMr. and Mrs. Baby\u201d (1985). \u201cI didn\u2019t like what I was writing,\u201d he told the magazine Ploughshares in 1995. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe in my autobiographical poems.\u201dChafing at the restrictive vocabulary and tight boundaries he had imposed on himself, he began writing longer poems and packing more of the outside world into them, a turn reflected in \u201cA Continuous Life\u201d (1990), whose poems showed a more expansive dramatic scope, and \u201cDark Harbor\u201d (1995), a single poem divided into 45 sections and encompassing an entire life\u2019s voyage.\u201cHe is up there with Donald Hall, Maxine Kumin and Philip Levine,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. \u201cYou can contrast those poetic friends very readily and have the great achievements of that period in American poetry.\u201dMark Apter Strand was born on April 11, 1934, in Summerside on Prince Edward Island in Canada. His father\u2019s job with Pepsi-Cola entailed many transfers. Mr. Strand spent his childhood in Cleveland, Halifax, Montreal, New York and Philadelphia and his teenage years in Colombia, Mexico and Peru.He initially set his sights on becoming an artist. \u201cI was never much good with language as a child,\u201d he told The Los Angeles Times Magazine in 1991. \u201cBelieve me, the idea that I would someday become a poet would have come as a complete shock to everyone in my family.\u201dAfter earning a bachelor\u2019s degree at Antioch College in Ohio in 1957, he enrolled in the Yale School of Art and Architecture, studying under Josef Albers. By the time he received his bachelor of fine arts in painting in 1959, he had discovered his vocation as a poet. He spent a year in Florence on a Fulbright Grant studying 19th-century Italian poetry and was accepted into the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, from which he graduated with a master of fine arts in 1962.His career took off when the celebrated poetry editor Harry Ford accepted his second volume of poems, \u201cReasons for Moving,\u201d at Atheneum, which went on to publish the collections \u201cDarker\u201d (1970), \u201cThe Story of Our Lives\u201d (1973) and \u201cThe Late Hour\u201d (1978). To critics who complained that his poems, with their emphasis on death, despair and dissolution, were too dark, he replied, \u201cI find them evenly lit.\u201dInterviewed in The Paris Review by the actor Wallace Shawn in 1998, Mr. Strand described his poetic territory as \u201cthe self, the edge of the self, and the edge of the world,\u201d what he called \u201cthat shadow land between self and reality.\u201d The severe economies of his early work, however, led to frustration and its \u201cbleak landscape\u201d came to feel repetitive.\u201cI felt I had to sort of break through that limitation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so you have, in my long poem \u2018Dark Harbor,\u2019 many other things cropping up. You have Marsyas and the Mafia, the muzhiks being slaughtered, Russian women at a dinner party.\u201dMr. Strand\u2019s interest in visual art remained constant. He wrote books on the painters Hopper and William Bailey, and a collection of critical essays, \u201cThe Art of the Real\u201d (1983). About five years ago he began making collages, using paper he made by hand. The work was exhibited in New York by Lori Bookstein Fine Art in Chelsea.Mr. Strand had been living in Madrid and was in the process of moving to Brooklyn.In addition to his daughter Jessica, Mr. Strand is survived by his partner, Maricruz Bilbao; another daughter, Fritha Strand; his son, Thomas; a sister, Judith Major; and a grandson. His two marriages ended in divorce.In 1987, Mr. Strand was named a MacArthur fellow by the MacArthur Foundation, and in 1993 he was awarded the Bollingen Prize for Poetry, given every two years by the Beinecke Library at Yale. Until quite recently, he taught at Columbia University.This year, Alfred A. Knopf published \u201cCollected Poems: Mark Strand,\u201d a collection that allows readers to absorb the work as a whole.Absence, negation and death were abiding themes for Mr. Strand. In a sense, he wrote his epitaph many times over, most poignantly perhaps in \u201cThe Remains,\u201d from his 1970 collection \u201cDarker.\u201dI empty myself of the names of others. I empty my pockets.I empty my shoes and leave them beside the road.At night I turn back the clocks;I open the family album and look at myself as a boy.What good does it do? The hours have done their job.I say my own name. I say goodbye.The words follow each other downwind.I love my wife but send her away.My parents rise out of their thronesinto the milky rooms of clouds.How can I sing? Time tells me what I am.I change and I am the same.I empty myself of my life and my life remains.An obituary last Sunday about the poet Mark Strand referred incorrectly in some copies to his survivors. He did not have any brothers; he is not survived by a brother, Thomas. The obituary also omitted the name of a survivor. Among the survivors is a daughter, Fritha Strand. In addition, the obituary misstated part of the name of the province in Canada where Mr. Strand was born and misspelled the name of a company that published a number of his books. He was born on Prince Edward Island, not on Prince Edward\u2019s Island, and the books were published by Atheneum, not by Athenaeum. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Team Player to the Very End", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerHARRISON, N.J. \u2014 If retirement is near for Thierry Henry \u2014 and he is not yet saying it is \u2014 he will follow Derek Jeter as the next great athlete to leave New York, minus the season-long goodbyes and parting gifts.Even as assessments of his career edge toward farewell, and he is celebrated as one of the great international strikers of his generation and perhaps the most skilled player ever in Major League Soccer, Henry, 37, deflects individual praise for collective ambition.\u201cI can\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Henry said Friday of his future as the Red Bulls prepared to travel to D.C. United for Saturday\u2019s second leg of an Eastern Conference semifinal, holding a 2-0 goal advantage. \u201cIt\u2019s playoff time. The focus should be on the team and nothing else.\u201dWhile David Beckham brought glamour and celebrity to M.L.S. and helped the L.A. Galaxy win two titles, Henry brought something equally valuable: sporting credibility at a crucial period of expansion, new stadiums and enhanced television and multiplatform media deals.He has won about all there is to win: a World Cup (1998) and a European championship (2000) with France, the Champions League (2009) with Barcelona, the Premier League (2002, 2004) with Arsenal.A statue of Henry\u2019s likeness stands, or, more accurately, kneels outside Emirates Stadium in London. There, the discussion is whether he is the greatest striker ever in the Premier League or the greatest overall player.\u201cThe credibility he brought us is just not something we could have achieved without him,\u201d Don Garber, the M.L.S. commissioner, said Friday. \u201cWhen I travel around the world, there isn\u2019t a soccer person in any country that doesn\u2019t know that Thierry Henry is playing in the United States in Major League Soccer.\u201dIn July, when Arsenal visited the United States for an exhibition against the Red Bulls, Manager Arsene Wenger told this story: When he moved Henry from the wing to center forward, Henry cautioned, \u201cLook, I can\u2019t score goals.\u201dYet, with elegant technique, anticipation, touch, composure and intelligence, especially intelligence, Henry became Arsenal\u2019s career leader with 228 goals and France\u2019s with 51.\u201cFor somebody who can\u2019t score goals,\u201d Wenger told reporters with amusement, \u201che has done quite well.\u201dIn truth, though, Henry has felt a bit constrained by his reputation as a goal scorer, the way an actor can feel typecast by a great role. Why is it, he wondered, that the top scorer receives a trophy in the world\u2019s best leagues, but the leader in assists does not?While Henry has scored 52 goals in 132 regular-season and playoff games with the Red Bulls over four-plus seasons, he has also delivered 47 assists. In the first leg against D.C. United, he set up both goals, one with a delicious backheel pass, the other with a 35-yard chip that was a wonder of vision, control and economy of movement. It seems no coincidence that Bradley Wright-Phillips of the Red Bulls, who had searched until this season to find his way, tied the M.L.S. regular-season record with 27 goals.From his childhood in the Paris suburbs, Henry said, he operated on this principle: \u201cWe have to score,\u201d not \u201cI have to score.\u201d\u201cRight from the start, you have been told you have to share the glory, share the moments, share the ball,\u201d Henry said. \u201cThe pass is more important than the goal. Because if you don\u2019t pass well, the ball doesn\u2019t reach there.\u201dThe highlight of his career, one might reasonably think, came when France won the 1998 World Cup at home. The team bus drove onto the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es into a crowd of a million revelers, said to be the largest celebration in Paris since the City of Light was liberated during World War II.The ethnic diversity of Les Bleus, as the French national team is known, became a repudiation of the anti-immigration stance of the ascending far-right National Front Party.Riding on the team bus, Henry said, felt \u201calmost unreal.\u201d From the place he grew up, \u201cyou don\u2019t go to the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es every day.\u201dNow he was triumphant. He had won the World Cup at Stade de France, so close to home that his family arrived by train.\u201cTo be on that bus, with everybody there, with the cup and what it represented, people coming from everywhere, what France is, was a great moment,\u201d Henry said.But his greatest moment? No. He is more fond of the origin of his success than its culmination, of the eager and unfinished teenager who made his professional debut for Monaco in the French league at 17.\u201cThe highlight is the first time I was able to let people know, especially my coaches, that I could, that I can,\u201d Henry said.In fact, Henry said, he has never rewatched any of France\u2019s 1998 World Cup matches from start to finish. \u201cIf you stay thinking too much about the past, you can\u2019t grab the future,\u201d he said.A career does not travel in a straight line but can bend and dip like a free kick. There have been bad moments, too, for Henry, none worse than his deliberate and decisive handball that put France into the 2010 World Cup ahead of Ireland. Some labeled him a cheat. Briefly, he has said, he thought of quitting.His defense has been this: He handled the ball, but he was not the referee.\u201cThat\u2019s the way the game is,\u201d Henry said Friday.A players\u2019 strike and a feckless effort by Les Bleus during that 2010 World Cup brought condemnation and government inquiry at home. France\u2019s sports minister at the time called the players\u2019 behavior a \u201cmoral disaster.\u201dHenry retired from international football and soon joined the Red Bulls. It has been a restorative move. Sure, he has lost some pace at 37, but who hasn\u2019t? And some teammates have found his demanding style to be withering. But Coach Mike Petke recently said that talking to Henry about soccer was \u201clike talking to Albert Einstein about physics.\u201dOn Friday, Petke elaborated: \u201cThierry is the most intelligent soccer mind I\u2019ve ever been around. He sees things three or four steps ahead.\u201dAn M.L.S. Cup would be \u201camazing and outstanding,\u201d but it will be won or not won, Henry said. What matters most, he added, is that through a long career, he gave his best.\u201cFor me, what is most important is to watch your teammates in their eyes at the end of the game,\u201d Henry said. \u201cThat tells you usually how you played.\u201dM.L.S.

{"Headline": "The Mine Disaster That Shook Turkey", "Date": "2014-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat morning, Tugba woke at 4 to clean the three-room stone house, which leaned into a hill full of apple trees. She and her husband, Ahmet, grew up here in Kayrakalti, a village in the western Aegean region of Turkey, between conservative Anatolia and the raki-and-cigarettes coast. Already, a bus that would pick up Ahmet for work was making its way through the area\u2019s cypress trees and olive farms. Tugba had gone to the bedroom to nurse their daughter, who was just three days shy of her first birthday, and they had fallen back asleep, so Ahmet left without eating breakfast. Tugba was 18 and Ahmet 30, and sometimes they still blushed around each other; their faces shone with youth, hers heart-shaped, his angular and fair. That morning, Tugba, asleep with the baby who looked like her, did not say goodbye.The bus stopped at the end of the village road, so just before 5, Ahmet left his home and walked down the dirt path opposite his mother\u2019s house (whose outhouse they shared), around the old farm equipment and his unfaithful car. Ahmet had tried for some time to sell Ramadan bread from the car before it broke down; he and Tugba were Muslims but rarely had enough money for celebratory Ramadan dinners themselves. Many of the 350 villagers in Kayrakalti used to grow Turkey\u2019s famous tobacco and raise sheep. But three decades ago, when the country opened up to the world, the government started importing Marlboros and Parliaments and raising the price of animal feed, and soon no one could make enough money from farming anymore. Some Turks migrated from the countryside to the cities seeking better lives, though they often ended up worse. Other men, like Ahmet, stayed behind to keep working the land, not knowing that modernization would catch up to them there anyway. These days, Ahmet left his village every day to go to work an hour and a half away as a machine operator in a coal mine.Turkey, even where poor, tends to be well maintained and orderly, and the mining town of Soma is no exception. In the evenings, the men, and sometimes women, gather in one part of a central tea garden; and the women and children, and sometimes men, gather in another section called the family salon; and everyone, especially in summer, sits for hours, smoking and gossiping until bedtime. It\u2019s not a well-to-do town, though there is a nice coffee shop with plush gray chairs and a relatively expensive chain restaurant called Kofteci Ramiz. The place\u2019s wholesome, upright quality derives in part from the buildings that dominate the center of town: the mosques, the men\u2019s teahouses, the mining-company offices, the Police Department, the local office of the country\u2019s ruling Justice and Development Party, the governor\u2019s hall, the miners\u2019 union.After working for a year at Imbat, Ahmet was owed his first vacation, and he used it to run off with Tugba. He shared his plans with his superior, who understood the importance of such matters and consented to his taking time off. But when Ahmet returned, his job was gone. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you,\u201d the superior said. Ahmet went to work in the mine next door, called Eynez and operated by Soma Holding.Ahmet bought a bun from the company canteen before his shift and chatted with his fellow miners. Some lived in Soma, and some in nearby villages. Some were young, and some were old. Some had come from coal mines elsewhere \u2014 Zonguldak, Kutahya \u2014 and some had never worked outside Soma. Some had children, and some were as young as 18. There were around 700 of them, and on that day, May 13, 2014, almost half of them would die in the worst industrial disaster in Turkey\u2019s 90-year history.The Justice and Development Party, or the A.K.P., which has been in power for more than a decade now, needed the coal for electricity, for construction projects and, as the miners saw, for gifts to dole out at election time. The country\u2019s prime minister and now president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had bags of coal delivered to poor Turks during his last three campaigns. Most miners supported the A.K.P.: If the party didn\u2019t win, their bosses told them, you won\u2019t have jobs. Sometimes, the miners said, they were paid their daily wage to take a bus to the A.K.P.'s famous, techo-thumping rallies, which often gave the impression that the entire nation had gathered in impromptu parties of collective joy. The miners, too, waved their hands in the air and screamed.Ahmet liked the A.K.P. because it built good hospitals, made health insurance cheaper and helped farmers\u2019 cooperatives with their debts. That wasn\u2019t enough, though. In the mines, working 30 days a month, Ahmet could make 1,800 lira, or around $900, less than $11,000 a year. (Others\u2019 salaries could be as low as $600 a month.) Working conditions varied, depending on the location within in the mine. In the weeks before the disaster, some miners complained that certain areas were hotter than usual; they found themselves drinking more water and sweating profusely, their skin growing irritated and suffering from rashes. They told their wives: It\u2019s as if we\u2019re burning. Many went to the hospital for creams. They worried about the rising heat, about the small fires that broke out, about the methane and carbon monoxide.The older miners hazed the newer ones, sprinkling bits of earth over their heads in the dark to make them think the mine was caving in. This was not an idle concern; Ahmet had already been in two accidents that involved falling materials. Once, a large stone landed on his back. Another time, a rock crushed his finger, and he had to have a metal plate put in it. A week before the disaster, he mentioned to his wife that if he was ever burned in the mine, they could identify his body by the metal in his finger.Ahmet arrived at his tunnel, in a section called A Panel, one of the deepest parts of the mine, and relieved the worker at his station. (Changing shifts underground increases the risk of more casualties in the event of an accident.) His work area, around 80 yards long, was where a shearer machine, a giant pinwheel-like cutter, broke apart the earthen walls so the coal could be extracted from the rock. Other machines, one of which Ahmet operated, provided support overhead to keep the ceiling from collapsing. Eynez is not as mechanized as most modern mines. Still, coal extraction is no longer just the backbreaking work associated with mines in Britain in the 1930s: men on their knees in low spaces, shoveling out coal. Many Soma miners clean, do electrical or security work, pump water out of the mine or, as in Ahmet\u2019s case, push buttons on earth-moving equipment. The machines are modern, but the work and safety conditions are ancient.The men in Ahmet\u2019s tunnel, who numbered around 40, typically got a half-hour to eat lunch, but they took turns eating alone while their fellow miners stayed on the job. There was no designated room (or time) for meals, nor even a place set aside for them to relieve themselves. They ate and did their business wherever they worked. Ahmet recalled how most new miners went through one adaptation at lunchtime. On their first day, they opened a plastic container full of yogurt only to find black dust on it seconds later, and then they threw it out. The same thing happened on the second day too, and maybe the third. By the fourth day, they just scooped out the bits of coal and ate their yogurt. When inspectors showed up, the managers hung lights and a sheet to create a protected eating area; otherwise the men just ate in the dark and in the open. Rats often stole their lunches, though some miners befriended the culprits, knowing that they were a good way to detect whether poisonous gas had filled the mine; many of the Soma miners did not trust the gas sensors. In any case, small fires were so common that the superiors often ignored the alarms.Ibrahim, an engineer in Ahmet\u2019s tunnel, tried calling the surface with one of the mine phones, but they didn\u2019t work, either. So Ibrahim and Vedat, the tunnel supervisor, said, What the hell, we might as well leave. They told Ahmet he was in charge and began the half-hour ascent to the exit. When they had gone, other men suggested that the whole group should leave \u2014 clearly something was wrong, and the shift was almost over anyway. But ordinary miners rarely left a shift early; that could result in the loss of an entire day\u2019s pay. So the men in A Panel waited, chatting. Some minutes later, Ibrahim and Vedat returned. They had run into some electricians wearing gas masks, who said a cable had exploded and a fire was discharging black smoke.It was a mine, and there were fires in mines. Lignite, prone to spontaneous combustion, often burned on its own. And the electrical cables were old and flammable and hung haphazardly. So the men didn\u2019t panic and stayed in place.Unlike German or American mines \u2014 or the Chilean mine where, in 2010, 33 miners survived for 69 days underground after a cave-in \u2014 the Eynez mine had no safe rooms, which were expensive to create and maintain. The tunnel where Ahmet worked was connected to a ventilation tunnel at one end and an exit tunnel at the other. The circulating air was controlled by a series of wood doors throughout these tunnels. Ibrahim and Vedat told the miners that they could leave, but not through the normal exit tunnel, which they themselves had tried to use earlier. Around the corner, perhaps 200 yards down the ventilation tunnel, however, there was a passage that provided access to a higher level in the mine.The men were told they could try that route out. But the smoke was pushing in from the far end of the ventilation tunnel, fighting the circulating air from the other direction. Smoke was then being sucked out through the passageway up. They were stuck.Carbon monoxide can kill a miner in minutes, if not seconds, depending on how much oxygen is in the area. If the carbon monoxide is concentrated enough, a man can begin to die after three to five breaths of it. But these 40 miners were lucky. Their area was the site of the shearer machine, which cut into the earth\u2019s wall, and supporting machinery that created a higher ceiling, where some of the carbon monoxide could collect. Other men from elsewhere in the mine had fled the smoke and moved to Ahmet\u2019s section, till about 140 of them were gathered there.They figured they would get out shortly, maybe in a half-hour. After an hour, they began to worry. What was taking so long? Why hadn\u2019t anyone come to talk to them? Some of the men worked as security experts, and they had gone to investigate what was happening \u2014 clearly this had been going on for too long now \u2014 but they never came back.Every minute brought more worry. The men considered trying to leave, but the air was fresh there, and they assumed it was better to wait. When the smoke seemed to increase, Ibrahim suggested that they use a door to block their section. The men paced behind their barricade and prayed.Something must have happened at the mines, his wife said. There are so many ambulances.The area was home to five different mines, each of which employed thousands. Everyone knew that ambulances meant something bad at the mines. Even so, this was a lot of sirens. Tevrat called a friend who worked at Soma Holding.There is a fire in Eynez, the friend told him, but the phones are jammed from all the phone calls. I don\u2019t know what it is. They might need rescue. You should go.Tevrat was 28, slight and wiry, with short brown hair, thick-lashed eyes and a fair face that was all cheekbones and jaw. He had moved his wife and son to Soma from a city called Ordu, on the Black Sea. He started working in construction at 16. It paid well, but traveling to jobs kept him from his family for months at a time. His uncle lived in Soma and worked as one of the subcontractors whose job was to round up and recruit men to work in the mines. As an incentive, some recruiters lured the men with promises that their salaries would qualify them for credit cards, which were new and alluring to many Turks. Luxury goods were flooding the country, and the people of Soma wanted nice televisions, too. But many miners never seemed to be able to get ahead of the interest charges, and soon they found themselves needing to make the kind of money it was hard for them to make outside the mines.Tevrat\u2019s uncle had persuaded him to come to Soma. Tevrat hated the claustrophobia, the lack of freedom inside and outside the mine. A full workday, door to door, lasted almost 12 hours. That meant two hours a day at most with his family. His one day off every month consisted of cleaning his home and going to the bazaar \u2014 if you could call the one in Soma a bazaar, he said. Maybe once a year you could have a picnic. He had no social life, no life at all. But, he said, this is my personality; I don\u2019t leave things I started. Tevrat\u2019s job was to operate the coal conveyor belt. He once warned his superiors that there were dangers in the mines, but they yelled at him, told him he was hardheaded.He went first to the Soma state hospital; it was swarming with miners\u2019 relatives. One man wailed: My brother was there \u2014 where is my brother? There were so many people, but no miners from Eynez. Tevrat caught a ride to the mine.The next shift of miners had already arrived at Eynez and begun to change, so hundreds of men milled around the entrance, trying to get in to help. They knew only that more than 700 men were trapped underground by a fire, and that carbon monoxide killed fast. One rescue team, from the nearby Imbat mine, had already gone in, and another team of seven was dressing. Tevrat joined them.Many of the rescuers that day were ordinary miners, men who ran down through the one entrance that was clear of smoke. The Imbat crew, equipped with oxygen tanks, went in another entrance and was able to save five men, but the smoke was too thick, and the carbon-monoxide concentrations too high, for them to go deeper into the mine. The tunnel needed to be cleared. A few hours after the fire started, those leading the rescue operation reversed the airflow of the fans, and Tevrat prepared to descend.The men began to panic, running back and forth. They were trapped. They didn\u2019t know when it would hit them, the carbon monoxide they couldn\u2019t see. They crowded together in the tunnel away from the smoke. They all had gas masks on their belts, but few trusted them: They were old, their expiration dates rarely checked. Some miners put them on and breathed in coal dust that had collected inside; other masks did not work at all. Ahmet knew his was only four years old, but he also knew it would last for only 45 minutes.The smoke began to burn their faces and their mouths. Ahmet started to feel lightheaded. He knew what was happening: Even with the space above the shearer machine, there was too much smoke. Some men knelt to the ground and stuck their faces in the mud, rubbing it over their skin, filling their mouths with it, even breathing it, anything to avoid the poisonous smoke.Ahmet saw 20 or so standing in the ventilation tunnel, in the smoke. They were panicking. He put on his mask, and with the help of a friend pulled one struggling miner back to what had been fresher air, but the entire area was filling up with smoke. The miners were staggering, looked ill. Ahmet found Ibrahim, the engineer, sitting on the ground, his gas mask slung around his neck. He was breathing, but blood was coming out of his nose. He turned and saw a friend named Ali sitting under an old, unused conveyor belt. He went to help him. His body was cold. Ahmet realized the miners were dying.He was growing weak, too. He looked at Ibrahim again, wanting to help, but Ahmet weighed only 135 pounds, and Ibrahim was twice his size. There was nothing he could do. As Ahmet moved toward the passage to the next level up, he had to step around the men sprawled across the ground. Some of them turned and stretched out their arms toward him, as if reaching for his hand.Vedat, Ahmet\u2019s superior, had glassy eyes, but he was alive. They couldn\u2019t speak to each other through their masks, so Ahmet signaled: Let\u2019s go. Up. They climbed to the level above and into more smoke.There, Ahmet and Vedat reached a conveyor belt, which could be used for coal or miners, but almost always for coal. The coal can take the belt, the superiors would say, you can walk. Ahmet saw men laid out on it, as if in their desperation they hoped the conveyor belt would carry them out. Other men were on the ground. Near them, also on the dirt floor, Ahmet saw hundreds of lifeless rats. He knew they were dead because their fangs were showing, their jaws open and stiff. Here we are, Ahmet thought, the brotherhood of rats and men.Aboveground, thousands of family members, gendarmerie, state rescue workers, police officers and E.M.T.s thronged around the mine entrances. People screamed, pushed, cried, demanded answers: Who was in the mine? Where was the day\u2019s register? No one seemed to know. Every time a man emerged alive, coughing and black-faced, the crowd applauded. Every time a body was clumsily brought out on a stretcher, the crowd lurched forward, trying to get a glimpse of the face to see if any feature could be recognized: the cut of the hair, the curve of an eyebrow, the bend of a nose.Tugba was home that afternoon when some men stopped in the village to tell people about the fire at Eynez. She tried to call Ahmet on his phone, thinking his shift was over and he might have left the mine, but the phones still weren\u2019t working. She sent a boy to find Ahmet\u2019s mother in the fields.A car convoy quickly assembled to head to the mines, but the villagers didn\u2019t want to take Tugba with them \u2014 she was distraught, and she had a baby to take care of. After they left, a man on a moped stopped outside her home. \u201cThey are all dead,\u201d he said.Over the last few decades, as its state-run economy struggled, Turkey opened up its markets. In the early 2000s, to help repay a $16 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, the newly elected Justice and Development Party began to sell off significant state companies. One was Tekel, which controlled tobacco production; its removal of price supports and eventual privatization led to the loss of jobs for hundreds of thousands of small tobacco farmers, like those around Soma. Some coal mines were privatized, too, but Eynez\u2019s rodovans arrangement kept it effectively under state control. In this way, the government was not simply looking the other way while big business did as it pleased \u2014 at Eynez, the government was enabling and profiting from barely restrained big business.As privatization took hold, Turkey\u2019s unions languished. In the 1960s, the left coalesced primarily around two unions: DISK and Turk-Is (\u201cIs\u201d means work in Turkish). Turk-Is was close to the state; DISK was more radical. When military generals took over the country during the 1980 coup and dissolved the government, they also broke up DISK and passed laws restricting union activities. While the Soma miners have blamed both the company and the government for the disaster, many of them reserve a special anger for Turk-Is. In the weeks after the fire, the union\u2019s local administrators acquiesced to miners\u2019 demands that they step down because of their failure to push for better working conditions, or better pay, or paid sick days, or reduced hours. Union leaders had led the miners, they said, to think they would be fired if they did not comply with the union\u2019s directives.A founding member of the miners\u2019 union in Soma told me that the union was unfairly criticized after the disaster. \u201cEven the government to some extent scapegoated the union,\u201d he said. Like many miners, he did not want his name to be published. Ahmet, whom I first met at the union\u2019s office in June, also felt that the union was a victim of the relationship between the mining company and the government. \u201cI can\u2019t really blame the union, because they are forced to be under the control of the company,\u201d he told me. \u201cNormally, the mine should be subject to the union, not the union subject to the mine.\u201dThe A.K.P., perhaps the best-run political party the country has known, dominates life in Turkey: It has a majority in Parliament and support among half the population, including many miners in Soma. Over the last decade, miners pointed out, Soma has slowly come under the control of the A.K.P. The unemployment office is the A.K.P. office. If you want to open a store, you have to vote A.K.P. If you want to do construction work on your house, they joked, you have to be an A.K.P. supporter. And if you want a job in the coal mine, you need to back the A.K.P. The general manager of the Soma mine, Ramazan Dogru, was married to Melike Dogru, an A.K.P. representative on the City Council. They had been nobodies, the miners said, and suddenly there they were, running the mine, sitting in the front row at the Somaspor soccer games. The police, the hospitals, the local businesspeople \u2014 the A.K.P.'s role in Turkish life makes it seem like more than a political party. The miners called the thing that controlled their lives \u201cthe octopus.\u201dThe images from outside the mine were broadcast every night on TV and were some of the most painful many Turks had seen in some time: dead bodies, women screaming, old men collapsing in tears. But after the disaster, which many miners call a \u201cmassacre,\u201d one day passed before Prime Minister Erdogan visited Soma. Even that delay was a surprise: Wasn\u2019t the prime minister a man of the people? Erdogan is an authoritarian but often brilliant politician; the tragedy called for him to deliver an emotional speech, even shed a tear, as he was known to do (though usually on state visits to foreign countries). It was natural to expect that Erdogan would use the tragedy to pull on the heartstrings of a nation and win a few more votes when he ran for president later in the summer.Instead, Erdogan proclaimed that he should not be criticized for Soma. Turkey, just as England had in the 19th century, was going through its industrial revolution and would suffer some of the same consequences every developing nation experiences. He said: \u201cI went back in British history. Some 204 people died there after a mine collapsed in 1862. In 1866, 361 miners died in Britain. In an explosion in 1894, 290 people died there. Take America, with all of its technology and everything. In 1907, 361. These are usual things.\u201dIn 2010, Erdogan referred to a mining tragedy that killed 30 men as the profession\u2019s \u201cdestiny.\u201d Erdogan is a religious man, so some Turks, especially those secularists who associate religion with backwardness, have been inclined to interpret these types of comments as ignorance. Many have seen them as pure callousness. In another way, though, Erdogan seems to be expressing something else: his belief in the divine power of the capitalistic system whose rise he presided over.Deeper in the mine, he found supervisors gathered together. They gave orders to Tevrat and the others: Go about 150 yards down this main road, and you will see the entrance for S Panel. They expected that many miners had taken shelter there. Tevrat, now wearing his mask, dipped under a conveyor belt, turned into S Panel and stopped.Unlike the rest of the mine, it wasn\u2019t dark. Dozens of lights played upon the ceiling; the room was illuminated from below. It had the strange light of hell, Tevrat thought. The beams of light were coming from the helmets of miners who had collapsed on the ground.There were so many bodies, maybe a hundred. It was as if someone had just thrown them, one by one, into a heap. The space was not big: The miners had fainted, fallen, collapsed on top of one another. Some were stiff, their arms up in the air. Some were in the position of prayer, both hands turned upward. They were so tangled up together that you would have to lift a leg to see the face below. A couple of miners from the rescue team couldn\u2019t handle the scene and left the room. If you vomited in your oxygen mask, you could join the dead yourself.Tevrat was nervous. The gas must have been everywhere. The rescuers saw a headlamp move and ran to feel the man\u2019s skin. He was warm. They dragged the survivor away from the room, back up the 150 yards or so to where the air was better and more rescue teams were waiting. Then Tevrat went back in.The rescuers threw themselves at the pile of legs and arms, touching them, feeling for warmth. Trying to discern which arm belonged to which body. None of the bodies were warm, except one. They wrested him from the pile and carried him out too.Tevrat ran down another ramp into another tunnel. There were more bodies, bodies everywhere on the belts and on the floor. Someone said, \u201cNo one is alive here.\u201d If there were this many, there could be so many more.There were some miracles that day. A hundred or so men near the shearer machine where Ahmet worked were discovered alive, for example. But when Tevrat got there, he also found about 20 bodies, on the ground and under the conveyor belt, including that of Ibrahim, with his gas mask around his neck. They had died while trying to escape through the ventilation tunnel. It was the same route Ahmet had taken.At one point when Tevrat was near the mine entrance, he went to operate the conveyor belt, which was bringing out bodies \u2014 he was a coal-\u00adconveyor-\u00adbelt operator, after all. The belt was moving faster than people could take bodies off it and get them into ambulances. At the end, the bodies were piling up on top of one another. Some had blood on their faces because their lungs had exploded. Others were burned, on their hands, on their boots, their skin like leather. Tevrat and others placed blankets over the dead and oxygen masks on their faces so the hysterical crowd would think they might still be alive and refrain from rushing the rescuers in their grief. In the days after the catastrophe, many Turks accused state rescue teams of putting oxygen masks on the dead to cover up, for insurance purposes, how many miners actually died inside the mine. But according to Tevrat, it was because too many bodies were coming out on that conveyor belt, too many for the operators like Tevrat to handle.That night, the fire in the mine still burned. The rescue teams stayed overnight and slept under the dead\u2019s blankets.For a moment, it felt as if the government might fall. Surely this was the sort of industrial calamity that would spark outrage in everyone. But three months later, Erdogan, who had already been prime minister for a dozen years, was elected president of the republic for four more. This outcome was not unexpected; he is a popular leader, partly because of Turkey\u2019s growth under his leadership, partly because he has undermined any opposition to his rule. A country like Turkey might be in some sort of industrial childhood, like Britain in the 19th century, and Erdogan might be right that you can\u2019t go through an industrial revolution without tribulations. But Britain and the United States in the 19th and early 20th centuries probably had more effective influences supporting reform \u2014 unions, a free press, stronger opposition parties, the fear of Communism \u2014 than 21st-\u00adcentury Turkey, where globalization and capitalism have been overwhelming forces. Ordinary people felt as if they were shouting into a void.Much of the attention paid to Soma has faded in light of Turkey\u2019s larger geopolitical issues, namely new tensions with the country\u2019s Kurdish population and allegations that the government has allowed thousands of members of the Islamic State militant group to pass through Turkey to the Syrian border. But the legal cases against Soma Holding continue. This month, Turkish prosecutors asked for eight company executives to be imprisoned; 29 other employees, including mine managers, engineers and security supervisors, have been charged with involuntary manslaughter. The September report from the Soma public prosecutor found 20 counts of gross negligence at the Eynez mine: inadequate ventilation, flammable equipment, inadequate education for miners, lack of gas sensors, poor telephone systems inside the mine, defective gas masks, an incomplete fire-escape plan. It\u2019s still not known what caused the fire: whether methane gas, which often causes an explosion, or the oxidation of coal, which emits carbon monoxide. Ayhan Yuksel, the coal-mining engineer, said Eynez might not have monitored its coal-oxidation levels carefully. \u201cAnd because of overproduction, there were more workers than should have been in the mine,\u201d he said.This month, a parliamentary investigation undertaken by representatives from all political parties concurred with many of the report\u2019s findings, including the claim that the pressure to produce so much coal caused mine managers to overlook safety concerns. But Ozgur Ozel, an opposition member of Parliament who has been warning about the conditions in Soma mines for years, criticized the A.K.P.-led commission for declining to explore the larger systemic issues that might have created the poor mine conditions in the first place: the relationships between the companies and the government, the lack of transparency in licensing the mines, the way the government uses coal as a form of patronage to the poor. \u201cWhen you want to talk about these reasons,\u201d Ozel told me, \u201cthey prevent it.\u201d (Erdogan\u2019s office denied these claims.)A \u201cSoma bill\u201d recently passed the Parliament, too. It met some of the miners\u2019 demands: six-hour shifts, a lowering of the retirement age, the erasure of debts for victims\u2019 families, paid vacations. Ozel believes that Turkey\u2019s mines are still unsafe, however. \u201cMost of the promises were kept to the families of the dead,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were given houses and money. There has been a little improvement in terms of the miners\u2019 basic rights. But with respect to the security of the mines, none of the promises have been kept.\u201d Critics also contend that a system in which the state subcontracts out coal production to a private company, which in turn subcontracts some of its labor to unaccountable middlemen, will always be an irresponsible and destructive one.Since the Soma disaster, Ozel says, some 30 additional miners have died in Turkey; in late October, 18 miners drowned in a flooded mine in Ermenek, a town in central Anatolia. In response, the government has pledged to issue a reform bill for work safety, while opposition members of Parliament have demanded the resignation of Taner Yildiz, the energy minister. Also, protests returned to Soma this month because a construction company illegally ripped up 6,000 olive trees belonging to small farmers in order to build a new coal-burning thermal power plant. When farmers occupied the land, the company\u2019s security team beat them up. The construction firm, Kolin Group, is part of a consortium of companies recently chosen to build a controversial third airport in Istanbul, which the A.K.P. promises will be the largest in the world.The miners of Soma remain traumatized. They say they feel as if their lives have no value. When Tevrat was finally ready to go home after days at Eynez, he began to walk the 17 miles back to Soma. A passing car gave him a ride until they reached a checkpoint. The A.K.P., fearing insurrection, had dispatched the police to prevent people from entering Soma. Tevrat approached a policeman. His appearance made it obvious that he was a miner.\u201cCan a car take me home, or just open the road?\u201d Tevrat asked.\u201cNo, we cannot open the road.\u201d\u201cI have been at the mine for five days. I want to go home.\u201d\u201cI cannot open it.\u201dTevrat didn\u2019t understand.Another policeman approached. \u201cWhat is going on here?\u201dThe first policeman flicked his head at Tevrat and said, \u201cThis wants to pass.\u201d\u201cThis!\u201d Tevrat yelled. \u201cWho are you calling this?\u201dJust as four rescuers happened upon them, Ahmet and Vedat saw smoke coming through a collapsed part of a wall. Ahmet thought this might have been a source of the smoke that flooded his work area. He felt a strange burst of energy, and he and Vedat and the rescuers picked up an old wooden door lying nearby and laid it across the collapsed area. Ahmet took off his shirt and stuffed it into one of the holes. Then he and Vedat continued the long walk forward, into the bright, shining lights.It was late at night when Tugba screamed. Her husband\u2019s face was on the television screen, and he was alive. Ahmet had emerged into the grieving crowds and cameras with only shorts on; during his trek, he felt so tired, he had stripped off all his clothing, even his boots. But he held onto one thing the entire five hours he was trapped in the mine. Some months earlier, he had found a white helmet that belonged to a superior in the locker room. Ordinary miners wore cheap yellow helmets that broke easily, but superiors wore sturdy ones that Ahmet believed were made in Germany. That day, Ahmet took the white helmet and had worn it up to and on the day of the fire. When Ahmet walked out of the mine, even at the moments he felt himself dying, he held onto his white helmet \u2014 he wasn\u2019t about to let it go.And as of this month, Ahmet has kept his promise to Allah.An article on Nov. 30 about the worst industrial disaster in Turkey\u2019s history misstated how long it took for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to visit the accident site in the town of Soma. He arrived at the scene the day after the mining disaster, not days later. The article also included an erroneous translation of a quotation from Erdogan regarding the year a mine collapsed in Britain, killing more than 200 people. He said the collapse occurred in 1862, not 1838.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Picking Your Car\u2019s Computerized Brain", "Date": "2014-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMachine LearningEVEN with their high-tech gadgets and computerized machinery, most cars still do a pretty poor job of providing helpful information about things like mechanical problems and fuel use \u2014 and of connecting to the devices we use the most, our phones.Improvements are on the horizon. Wireless connections are available in some new models, which could lead to more helpful tools. But even for many older models, there is an easy way to get better information about your car, including fuel usage, diagnostics and data about your driving habits.I tried out two new devices that can connect almost any car, back to the 1996 model year, to a smartphone. Mojio, released in October, and Automatic, released last year, both use apps to offer a surprising, interesting and occasionally overwhelming look inside your car.Neither offers entertainment, multimedia or navigation elements, but both can give you useful information about your car, especially if there are mechanical problems. Of the two devices, on the basis of cost and simplicity, Automatic is the one I\u2019d recommend.The port is most often used by mechanics and dealers. It outputs a standardized set of information about a car, like codes that indicate mechanical problems. It also uses sensors throughout the vehicle to gather data on power, emissions, fuel use and more.And a growing number of them integrate with your smartphone in some way.Mojio has grand ambitions to become an app store for cars. The company\u2019s $150 device, which plugs into the port and uses Bluetooth to connect with a smartphone app, has both GPS and a 3G cellular connection, so it\u2019s online practically everywhere. The device includes a free year of service; after that, it\u2019s $5 a month.The service does basic monitoring out of the box, including translating diagnostic codes and tracking trip mileage and fuel efficiency. It can also remind you where you parked and can tell you whether the car has been towed or stolen.And the app provides contextual information while you drive, like where you can find parking. When you approach to your destination, you\u2019ll see a pop-up in the app offering nearby gas stations or parking.The app can also, with just a tap, send a text message to friends whose contact information you add to the app. The text lets them know if you\u2019re on your way, with updates on your route so you can avoid texting while driving.Mojio hopes app developers will jump on its platform and add features like parking payments and integration with smart home devices \u2014 such as a feature that could turn on the lights in your home when you pull into the driveway.For all of Mojio\u2019s potential, though, it feels unfinished. Its app is available only for iOS, so Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry users are out of luck.It\u2019s also bare-bones and often puts the burden on the user to figure out what to do \u2014 even when installing the device. There are no instructions on where to find your OBD-II port, for example \u2014 and how many people are familiar with that?By contrast, Automatic\u2019s app shows you a diagram of common locations of the port in vehicles, putting emphasis on the three likeliest options.And when my Mojio device failed to connect to my phone, there was no indication of how I might try to reconnect or why it failed.The Mojio app interface is a little clunky, too. The app tries to organize every event on your calendar into a \u201ctrip,\u201d even if it\u2019s a birthday or something without a location. And for navigation, you must switch to the Google Maps app.Worse, Mojio is downright distracting while you\u2019re driving. The app requires you to look at it, to some extent, while you\u2019re moving; otherwise you won\u2019t see things like pop-ups that direct you to parking. Moreover, the directions are tiny, the parking signs aren\u2019t tappable and looking at them for any length of time could cause swerving or worse.And although Mojio offers some neat features, paying $5 a month seems like a stretch, considering that other apps can do most of its tricks (other than telling me if my car is being towed). Google Now can tell me where I\u2019m parked, Glympse can let people know I\u2019m on my way home, and several apps can help me find parking nearby.Sure, those apps are not organized into one interface as they are with Mojio, but those apps are free, not $60 a year.Automatic keeps it simpler: The device costs $99 and focuses primarily on improving things like fuel economy, tracking driving habits and providing car diagnostics \u2014 with no monthly fee. Setup is straightforward and took just a few seconds, and its app is available for Android and iOS.In terms of the data it provides, Automatic is a little like a wearable activity tracker. There\u2019s information that\u2019s interesting to look at, like how far a trip was and how much gas you used. But unless you drive for a living or are focused on minimizing your fuel use, it\u2019s not always obvious what to do with all that information.You also get a driver score for good behavior, like avoiding speeding, rapid acceleration and hard braking. That sounds like a buzz kill for those who like to drive for sport, but it\u2019s helpful if there\u2019s a teenager in the house or if you\u2019ve had a lot of speeding tickets. And both Mojio and Automatic would come in handy if you had a mechanical problem and needed a quick diagnosis.Automatic also offers some free features that make it attractive to parents. One called License Plus coaches people through hours of driving practice to improve their overall skills and responses. Parents can also track their children\u2019s driving habits through a web-based version of the Automatic software.I wouldn\u2019t pay a monthly fee for those features, but I could imagine Automatic being useful for parents and daily drivers. It\u2019s still a long way from a truly connected car, but at $99, it\u2019s an easy and inexpensive place to start.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Anatomy of a Presidency While It\u2019s Still Unfolding", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesFor his inaugural program this September as moderator of NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Chuck Todd landed a big guest: Barack Obama. If the president reads Mr. Todd\u2019s new book \u201cThe Stranger,\u201d it\u2019s hard to imagine him wanting to return to the program anytime soon. The book delivers a stinging indictment of his presidency so far, one underscored by this week\u2019s elections, which resulted in huge gains for Republicans and are widely seen as a repudiation of Mr. Obama and his policies.In these pages, Mr. Todd dissects \u201cthe promise versus the reality of Obama\u201d and concludes that he will be regarded, at least in the near future, as \u201ca president whose potential wasn\u2019t realized.\u201d He writes that \u201cincome inequality is worse than ever,\u201d that the Middle East could well be \u201cmore unstable when Obama leaves office than when he took it,\u201d and that while he \u201cwanted to soar above partisanship,\u201d his tenure in office will likely \u201cbe remembered as a nadir of partisan relations.\u201d The underlying problems Mr. Todd diagnoses have already been pointed out by many reporters and politicians, especially in the run-up to the midterm elections. Those problems include what critics see as Mr. Obama\u2019s passive leadership and lack of managerial experience; his disdain for, but inability to change, politics as usual in Washington; and his reluctance to reach out to Congress and members of both parties to engage in the sort of forceful horse trading (like Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s) and dogged retail politics (like Bill Clinton\u2019s) that might have helped forge more legislative deals and build public consensus. Mr. Todd acknowledges the challenges the president faced entering office: a tottering economy, two wars inherited from the Bush administration, and an obstructionist Republican opposition. But he suggests that Mr. Obama was frequently his own worst enemy, allowing his temperamental inclinations (his detachment, his caution, his impatience with the often-irrational aspects of politics) to hobble the implementation of his vision of transformative change. Mr. Todd goes so far as to write that \u201cObama\u2019s arrogance got the better of him,\u201d and chides him for an unwillingness to apply the necessary elbow grease to make progress on difficult issues like gun control and immigration.The overall picture that emerges here is that of a highly insular and centralized White House that is reluctant to listen to outside experts, prone to cutting cabinet members out of the loop and unable or unwilling to learn from its mistakes. If many of this book\u2019s overarching arguments will be familiar to those within the Beltway, \u201cThe Stranger\u201d nonetheless provides the lay reader with a brisk, if depressing overview of the Obama White House, while giving Washington insiders plenty of colorful new details.In contrast to Bob Woodward with his I-am-a-tape-recorder approach, Mr. Todd does not shy away from analysis, which mostly proves revealing, though it can tip over into the speculative. For instance, citing unnamed \u201ccircumstantial evidence,\u201d Mr. Todd suggests that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s opposition to \u201calmost every troop increase the Pentagon proposed\u201d for Afghanistan might have been part of a \u201cgood cop/bad cop\u201d routine: that is, \u201cThe president needed someone to take another position in order to rein in the Pentagon\u201d and Mr. Biden filled that role. Of the president\u2019s flip-flops on Syria \u2014 initially leaning toward limited military action (after concluding that President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces had used chemical weapons against their own people) then deciding to back away and seek approval from Congress \u2014 Mr. Todd writes that here was one of the few times that many of his advisers \u201cquickly and vociferously disagreed with their boss.\u201d Mr. Obama announced his change of mind after taking a walk with his chief of staff, Denis R. McDonough, who, Mr. Todd notes, had also been one of the dwindling number of aides skeptical of arming the Syrian rebels. Like Mr. Gates and Mr. Panetta, Mr. Todd points to this administration\u2019s proclivity for trying to centralize decision making in the White House. He writes that as secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton felt that Mr. Obama\u2019s White House, in Mr. Todd\u2019s words, \u201ctended to micromanage American diplomacy to an extent unprecedented in previous administrations,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s one of the undertold stories\u201d that \u201cthe Obama national security team sometimes treated Clinton almost as a figurehead, and they certainly drove policy and the agenda.\u201d As for the administration\u2019s handling of the Arab Spring, Mr. Todd reports that Mr. Gates, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Biden all believed \u2014 and were hoping \u2014 that Egypt\u2019s longtime president, Hosni Mubarak, would survive the 2011 protests against him; they worried that without him the country could spiral \u201cinto the unknown.\u201d But Mr. Obama, writes Mr. Todd, sided \u201cwith his younger staff\u201d (including Mr. McDonough, Susan Rice, Samantha Power and Benjamin J. Rhodes) \u201cover the more seasoned principals,\u201d and told Mr. Mubarak that he needed to step down. Egypt would, in fact, begin to spiral downward: Last year, military officers removed the country\u2019s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi and suspended the constitution; its new leader, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, has presided over a highly repressive regime, jailing political opponents and cracking down on dissidents (acts that in turn have threatened to radicalize civilians). Mr. Todd reports that a prominent, recently retired Democratic senator argues that the Obama White House made a \u201cfundamental policy mistake\u201d in \u201cgetting involved in Egypt, which led to Libya then Syria,\u201d and sending mixed messages to the Middle East. Much of this book focuses on domestic policy and politics, including a stale chapter about Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign. Mr. Todd uses the roller-coaster story of the administration\u2019s health care plan as a kind of window into both its ideals and dysfunction. He contends that as a candidate Mr. Obama pledged himself to speedy and concrete action on universal health care \u201calmost on a whim,\u201d needing a way, in an early 2007 speech, to differentiate himself from his Democratic primary opponents, Mrs. Clinton and John Edwards.Although several top Obama aides like Rahm Emanuel cautioned against rushing into health care as the administration\u2019s first big initiative (as opposed, say, to financial regulatory reform), the president decided to push ahead. The process would bog down in Congress and only barely squeak through after a nerve-racking year.The troubles with health care, combined with a cascade of other crises \u2014 the rise of the Islamic State, an increasingly chilly relationship with Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia and the Ebola epidemic in Africa \u2014 have further wounded the White House, creating the impression of a reactive, even flailing administration. Republicans racked up big wins in this week\u2019s elections in no small part because of Mr. Obama\u2019s growing unpopularity. (According to exit polls, nearly six out of 10 voters expressed negative feelings about his administration.)Some of the dysfunction that came to be associated with Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure, Mr. Todd says, \u201cwas forced upon\u201d him, and \u201csome of it came from him.\u201d\u201cIf a huge reason for the failure of Washington to get anything done is a focus on means instead of productive ends,\u201d he writes, \u201cObama\u2019s struggles came from his focus on ends to the exclusion of productive means.\u201d THE STRANGERBarack Obama in the White HouseBy Chuck ToddIllustrated. 518 pages.

{"Headline": "E.P.A. Postpones Setting Standards for Biofuel Blends", "Date": "2014-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Environmental Protection Agency quietly announced on Friday that, after much delay, it had been unable to decide this year on a rule setting levels for the amount of biofuel it would require to be blended into conventional vehicle fuels.Because of the delay, a spokeswoman said in a statement, the agency will not take up the rule, known as the Renewable Fuel Standard, until next year, when it seeks to set levels for 2015 and 2016.The notice also said the agency would adjust reporting requirements so refiners could comply retroactively.Now, however, the country is awash in domestic oil from shale drilling, while more efficient cars and an anemic economy have cut demand. The market is saturated with regular corn ethanol, while production of cellulosic, or so-called advanced, biofuel \u2014 made from nonfood parts of corn plants or other biomass like wood waste \u2014 has fallen short of what the mandate requires refiners to use.\u201cA lot of the motivation for biofuels is gone,\u201d said Michael E. Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cI think this delay is not just a stall tactic. I think the E.P.A. really doesn\u2019t know what to do. They need to kind of give it another year to figure out, \u2018Well does this biofuels policy make sense anymore?\u2019\u201dOn Friday, supporters and opponents of increased biofuel production expressed a rare consensus that the E.P.A.\u2019s move was a punt and that the rule needed to be fixed, whether they were in favor of revision or repeal.Michael McAdams, president of the Advanced Biofuels Association, a trade group, said, \u201cWe\u2019re still in suspended animation, and the uncertainty is just kicked down the road.\u201dJeff Lautt, the chief executive of Poet, a corn ethanol producer that recently opened a cellulosic plant, said through a spokesman that the company was \u201cpleased the administration did not finalize the flawed proposed rule\u201d but was unsure if officials would avoid provisions that could stifle advanced biofuel development going forward.Others said that this latest wrinkle was a clear signal that Congress should revisit the law.\u201cIt\u2019s not a good signal that they can\u2019t get this done,\u201d said Mike Lavender, a policy analyst at the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization that is in favor of biofuels but is critical of corn ethanol. \u201cThe only real option at this point is in 2015 for Congress to take up the reins and take a serious look at reform.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Afghan Border, Graft Is Part of the Bargain", "Date": "2014-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORKHAM, Afghanistan \u2014 Some call them \u201cthe men who sit on golden chairs\u201d \u2014 Afghan customs officials who preside over a vast ecosystem of bribery that stretches from dusty border crossings to the capital.They have become fabulously wealthy by depriving their aid-dependent treasury of at least $500 million a year, according to the most conservative foreign estimates.Unseating those kings of customs, or at least stemming their thievery, is now a job for President Ashraf Ghani as he takes up his campaign promise of fighting graft. Customs is a central factor in rescuing the ailing economy, and accounted for 26 percent of government revenue last year.Yet in interviews with a wide array of Afghan and foreign officials who live with the issue, a picture emerges of such rampant bribery and extortion that corruption can no longer be described as a cancer on the system: It is the system, they say. And it is deeply enmeshed with Afghan politics.The scale of the problem is evident at Torkham, a major crossing point on Afghanistan\u2019s southeastern border with Pakistan. Every day, up to 500 trucks trundle across the Khyber Pass, kicking up clouds of dust as they cross into Afghanistan and enter a customs apparatus that has been transformed by a decade of foreign assistance.The trucks pass a giant X-ray machine delivered by the United States military. Western-trained officials assess their cargo for import duties. The paperwork is entered into a computer system paid for by the World Bank. American-financed surveillance cameras monitor the crossing.Yet for Afghan officials, every truck represents a fresh opportunity for personal enrichment.Border guards pocket a small fee for opening the gate, but that is just the start. Businessmen and customs officials collude to fake invoices and manipulate packing lists. Quantity, weight, contents, country of origin \u2014 almost every piece of information can be altered to slash the customs bill, often by up to 70 percent.\u201cThe only thing you can\u2019t change is the color of the truck,\u201d said one customs official who agreed to meet after work to explain how the system operated.The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared losing his job, said he had paid $5,000 to a customs administrator to secure his job, a low-level processing position, 10 years ago. It was a spectacularly good investment: He now makes up to $4,000 every month on top of his basic salary of $150. Similar positions now cost at least $15,000 and require political connections, he said.Every official at the customs post in Torkham and in nearby Jalalabad, where customs fees are paid, is complicit in the scheme, he said \u2014 even the office cleaners. A day earlier, for example, 85 trucks filled with garments had passed through customs, costing the importer $1,400 per truck in bribes: $900 to the customs chief, $250 to the customs broker, and $250 to be divided among various customs officials who facilitated the clearance.The official said he had chosen to speak out partly out of guilt, and partly because he had been inspired by Mr. Ghani\u2019s election.\u201cThis system is why I have clean clothes and good shoes,\u201d he said, pointing to himself. \u201cBut I know it is wrong, and I want to stop it. This money belongs to the martyrs, the disabled and the widows. But if I raise my voice, I will lose my job.\u201dAt the customs headquarters in Jalalabad, the deputy director, Haji Baryali Gardi Wal, dismissed claims of corruption as \u201cexaggerated,\u201d describing them as the calculated provocations of Pakistani, Iranian and Chinese intelligence agents.\u201cAfghanistan has many enemies,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to embarrass us before the West to reduce the funds coming into our country.\u201dIn Kabul, the deputy finance minister for customs and revenue, Gul Maqsood Sabit, echoed that claim. \u201cOurs is a world-class system,\u201d he said. \u201cI admit there are problems. But we have come a long way.\u201dIt is certainly true that, partly thanks to at least $290 million in foreign training and equipment, the system has made strong progress in the past decade. Processing times at customs have fallen sharply \u2014 to two days from 10 at Kabul\u2019s airport, and to 90 minutes from 18 hours at Torkham.And revenue has soared to just over $1 billion in 2012 from a paltry $50 million in 2003 \u2014 although it slumped last year because of uncertainty over the American military drawdown.One senior international official with long experience in customs reform said the figure was closer to two-thirds.\u201cFor every dollar that should be collected, the trader saves 33 cents, 33 cents goes to the officials, and 33 cents to government coffers,\u201d the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity under orders from his organization.In conversation, Afghan officials casually reel out accounts of the ostentatious wealth enjoyed by senior bureaucrats and politicians involved with customs, usually involving expensive properties in Kabul, Dubai, Europe or Canada. Less prominent officials are also doing well. According to American aid officials, some customs leaders are reluctant to visit Kabul for training because they would lose too much money in forgone bribes.Mr. Ghani, who vowed \u201cstrict legal action\u201d against corruption officials in his Sept. 29 inauguration speech, is intimately familiar with the kleptocratic customs system \u2014 as minister of finance under President Hamid Karzai in 2004, he started the current modernization program. He will also be aware that previous attempts to clean it up have met with strong political resistance.Under Mr. Karzai, criminal investigations into corrupt officials and businessmen were repeatedly frustrated through direct interventions from parliamentarians, ministers and even Mr. Karzai\u2019s office, according to several Western and Afghan officials. Not a single senior customs official has been prosecuted for graft.Other government departments view customs as a shakedown target, they said. Government auditors extort money from customs officials in return for a clean bill of health. Prosecutors accept cash payments to slow or derail corruption investigations.If Mr. Ghani is to truly attack this powerful web of interlocking interests, his main obstacle is political.A serious customs overhaul would hurt the interests of major tribal or regional power brokers with links to Mr. Ghani or the country\u2019s chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah. The main border post in the north is controlled by Atta Muhammad Noor, the governor of Balkh Province and a prominent supporter of Mr. Abdullah. In the south, the powerful police chief of Kandahar, Gen. Abdul Raziq, has a tight grip on border posts at Spin Boldak, with Pakistan, and Nimroz, with Iran.Aside from its sheer cost, endemic corruption is also a sign of pessimism among Afghanistan\u2019s elites, whose hoarding of assets has been widely interpreted as a sign of worry as Western aid slows down and Western combat troops pull out. Mr. Ghani will seek to allay some of those fears by securing promises of continuing international aid at a donor conference due to take place in London late this month or early the next.But he is also showing a steely hand on corruption. Just a few weeks into his tenure, he has already reinvigorated the stalled court investigation into the $900 million Kabul Bank fraud scandal. And he vowed to shake up the office of the attorney general, Mohammad Ishaq Aloko. \u201cPeople must trust it,\u201d he said in a Twitter message posted on Oct. 8.But with the political situation still fragile, some here worry that Mr. Ghani may be moving too quickly.\u201cCorruption has become so interwoven with the political system in Afghanistan that it\u2019s going to take years to undo,\u201d one American official said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t forget that Afghanistan is a treacherous place, where some actors are capable of anything.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Early Results Are Disappointing in Japan\u2019s Economic Program", "Date": "2014-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsThe government reported this week that the economy declined at an annual rate of 1.6 percent during the third quarter, after a 7.3 percent fall in the second quarter. Those figures are adjusted for inflation, or deflation, as the case may be.The second-quarter decline had been expected, coming after an increase in the national sales tax. In anticipation of that increase, many people and companies had accelerated their purchasing, leading to economic growth of 6.7 percent in the first quarter of the year. But economists who had forecast a third-quarter bounce back were disappointed.For much of the last two decades, the Japanese economy has been shrinking, at least before deflation is considered. In the fourth quarter of 1997 \u2014 nearly 17 years ago \u2014 the Japanese economy peaked, as measured in yen. Abenomics, as the economics program of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe became known, had promised to get Japan growing again. The central bank, the Bank of Japan, embarked on a program of quantitative easing and vowed to get inflation up to a 2 percent target. The value of the yen has fallen rapidly, in part as a result of that program, which it is hoped will spur Japanese exports. Structural reforms, promised but not yet passed, are supposed to help stimulate growth in a variety of ways, including by getting more women to join the labor force.The prime minister called a snap election for Dec. 14, and indicated that if he won, the government would postpone a planned second increase in the national sales tax.One depressing part of the report on third-quarter gross domestic product was that the overall inflation rate \u2014 known as the G.D.P. price deflator \u2014 fell again in the quarter, at an annual rate of 1.3 percent. Inflation leapt in the previous quarter, largely because of the sales tax increase, but the failure of inflation to continue is an indication that the Bank of Japan\u2019s program to promote inflation is not yet working, even though official figures indicate that average salaries are now rising at a 2 percent annual rate.The declining yen has served to depress the purchasing power of the Japanese, but it does not yet seem to be doing very much to stimulate exports. After years of large trade surpluses, Japan\u2019s trade balance turned negative in 2011 and has remained there. But income from overseas investments meant that the balance of payments remained positive until this year. Now it, too, is in deficit, albeit by small amounts.Japan has remained a rich nation throughout its long period of little or no growth, and its 3.6 percent unemployment rate is very low by international standards. It is far too early to pronounce Abenomics a failure. But the new G.D.P. report does provide a sobering reminder that halting deflation is not going to be easy.Advertisement"}

The album was pushed onto the playlists of some 500 million iTunes users, and Apple and U2 ended up in stockades on the web for what many consumers saw as an unwanted intrusion into their most personal territory \u2014 their music collection. \u201cOops, I\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d he said with a bit of mischief in his smile. \u201cI had this beautiful idea. Might have gotten carried away with ourselves. Artists are prone to that kind of thing: A drop of megalomania, a touch of generosity, a dash of self-promotion, and deep fear that these songs that we poured our life into over the last few years might not be heard. There\u2019s a lot of noise out there. I guess we got a little noisy ourselves to get through it.\u201dIn truth, U2 is on a dead run to remain relevant and avoid turning into a nostalgia act that makes buckets of money on tour but produces records people no longer care about \u2014 the Rolling Stones come to mind. Bono will tell anyone who will listen that the new album, which is written as a kind of origin story for U2, reflects the band at its best and most personal. He did not want a project that took five years to finish to then be missed by indifferent, busy ears. Thus the iTunes gambit. \u201cWe would rather be the first of a new breed than the last of a dying breed,\u201d he said on stage, \u201cand we could see, we could predict, the trajectory of our album, and we didn\u2019t like that idea, that it would be gone from the charts in six weeks.\u201d It was hard to peer through all the playfulness and discern whether he actually cared about the blowback. From the stage he said that, while it was unpopular, at least to some, the deal with iTunes was \u201cone of the proudest things for us, ever.\u201dSo I asked him backstage afterward: Not sorry?\u201cI really didn\u2019t apologize, I was having some fun. Nobody wants to upset some young woman on Facebook,\u201d he said, and then smiled and promised, \u201cI\u2019m working on the apology for the apology as we speak.\u201d Almost exactly a decade ago, Steve Jobs was accompanied on stage by U2 when he introduced an odd-sounding device called the iPod and a marketplace for music called iTunes. Even now, every time a listener presses the artist button on iTunes, their thumb lands on a silhouette of Bono\u2019s head. I assume it has been a profitable relationship that has burnished the image of both, until now. To my mind, the bigger hair shirt should belong to Apple. Given the context, the company should have been more sensitive to the consumer\u2019s right to be left alone \u2014 after all, the company is fresh off a hack that allowed strangers to steal, view and share nude photos of famous actresses from iCloud accounts. If the introduction of a new phone left Apple feeling a sense of largess, it could have offered music fans dozens of options of bands that they could download if they felt like it. Bono, a singer who often takes a knee when he wants to amp up the drama in an arena, has stood tall on business matters from the beginning. Back then, the band chose a letter and a number for its name \u201cbecause we could make it really big on posters.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve always worried about the marketing, even before people thought of bands as brands,\u201d Bono said as he nursed a Heineken backstage after a panel at the event.U2 saw its chance with Apple and grabbed with both hands. But in this instance, Bono\u2019s fervent desire that a passion project be heard by the masses may have gotten the best of him. We live in a time when music is meant to be pulled by consumers, not pushed on them by big rock music acts and an even bigger company. As savvy as he is, Bono probably knew this was one U2 caper that would not go unpunished. Still, it\u2019s surprising to see him strike a sour note, because as Jay Z might say, Bono\u2019s not just a businessman, he\u2019s a business, man. Bono is an investor in Elevation Partners, a venture capital firm with a futuristic bent, and he is hardly nostalgic for the good old days in the music business. From the stage, he railed against the lack of transparency in music label accounting. And even as he handed me one of the deluxe editions of U2\u2019s new record at his house, I asked him if he felt that a physical artifact was necessary to validate the work of the artist. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said.\u201cThe old model is broken. People in music rail against Spotify, but streaming is here to stay, audiences want it, and we have to figure out a way for it to work for everyone,\u201d he said after the panel.He said that while he thought streaming would eventually become a meaningful source of revenue for musical acts, he\u2019s worried that the people who write the songs, the copyright holders, will still be out of luck. \u201cI have a lot of friends who are songwriters and they\u2019re getting a raw deal,\u201d he told me. \u201cCole Porter did not sell T-shirts. I\u2019m not going to be the public face of this \u2014 no one cares or thinks the singer in U2 needs more money \u2014 but I\u2019m working behind the scenes to work toward some models that will work for them.\u201d With that, he was fetched to lead a pub crawl for the summit event, which has been exploding in size and scope, doubling its attendance this year to 22,000. It has all but overwhelmed Dublin, spilling the gospel of entrepreneurism in a culture and economy still wounded, but recovering, from the crash in real estate in Ireland.Bono became involved after getting buttonholed at a dinner by Paddy Cosgrave, one of the founders of the Web Summit. Mr. Cosgrave, along with his partners Daire Hickey and David Kelly, are kindred spirits, Irish kids with big ambitions and a gangster\u2019s facility for getting things done. From the stage at the conference, Bono compared the young people in attendance building apps and businesses to the punk bands of yore, a D.I.Y. response to the conventions of the establishment. \u201cI love what has happened in Dublin with the summit. I like little guys with big ideas in their head,\u201d Bono said. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain braggadocio in the Irish psyche. You could call it small island syndrome or small rock star syndrome but, you know, we are very attracted to big ideas.\u201dThat ambition was on full view at the Web Summit, a tiny event just a few years ago that is growing quickly and in danger of being overwhelmed by its own success. Think of it as the Irish version of Austin\u2019s South by Southwest conference, but with a lot more Guinness.Seeing Bono there brought to mind one of the problems with being the little guy who is always punching up.

{"Headline": "Keystone Pipeline Pros, Cons and Steps to a Final Decision", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQ. and A.In their natural state, the thick, tarlike oil sands, also known as bitumen, are combined with sand, clay and water in a dense, gooey mix. There are two ways producers get the sands out of the ground, both damaging to the immediate environment. In one method, large amounts of water and natural gas are used to pump steam into the sands to extract the oil, which creates toxic environmental runoff.Alternatively, energy companies strip-mine the sands and then heat them to release the oil, a practice that has already destroyed many acres of Alberta forest. An environmental review by the State Department concluded that production of oil-sands petroleum creates about 17 percent more carbon pollution than production of conventional oil.Environmentalists also fear that a leak from a pipeline carrying the heavy oil-sands petroleum could cause more environmental damage than a leak from a standard oil pipeline.The report estimated that building the pipeline would contribute about $3.4 billion to the American economy.The State Department review concluded that even if the pipeline were not built, global oil demand is such that companies would continue to develop the Alberta oil sands and bring the petroleum to market in other ways. The oil could come by rail or by building other pipelines. But moving oil by rail has its own hazards. As transport has increased in recent years, so have explosions of rail cars carrying oil.Building the pipeline would also help provide a conduit for oil from a friendly ally, Canada, and cement trade relations for the United States and Canada.In 2011, the most recent year for which comprehensive international data is available, the global economy emitted 32.6 billion metric tons of carbon pollution. The United States was responsible for 5.5 billion tons of that (coming in second to China, which emitted 8.7 billion tons). Within the United States, electric power plants produced 2.8 billion tons of those greenhouse gases, while vehicle tailpipe emissions from burning gasoline produced 1.9 billion tons.By comparison, the oil that would move through the Keystone pipeline would add 18.7 million more metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere annually than would be produced by conventional oil, according to estimates by the Environmental Protection Agency. In other words, those added carbon emissions would amount to less than 1 percent of United States greenhouse gas emissions and an infinitesimal slice of the global total.In January, the State Department released an 11-volume environmental impact statement concluding that the pipeline was unlikely to significantly increase the rate of carbon pollution in the atmosphere. That analysis kicked off a 90-day review process in which Secretary of State John Kerry sought comment from eight other agencies, including the E.P.A. and the Commerce, Defense and Homeland Security departments. Mr. Obama will make the final decision. But the State Department halted the review in April after a Nebraska district court blocked the governor\u2019s decision to allow the pipeline to pass through the state.If the Nebraska court concludes that the governor does not have the authority to allow the pipeline to pass through the state, TransCanada may have to resubmit an application, a process that could take months or even years.Mr. Obama has said that he will delay his own decision until the Nebraska court weighs in.However, Congress could send a bill to the president\u2019s desk demanding that he approve the pipeline. Although Mr. Obama would be likely to veto the bill on the grounds that the process is incomplete, the new Republican Congress that convenes in January may be able to muster a nearly veto-proof majority for such a vote, opening the door for a Keystone deal between Mr. Obama and Republicans.But some of Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers strongly oppose the pipeline and are urging him to reject it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Calling Early Elections in Japan, Abe Rolls the Dice on the Economy ", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow it appears that he spoke too soon.Faced with troubling economic data showing that Japan has slid back into recession, Mr. Abe called Tuesday for early elections, raising fears not only that his vaunted program for economic revival was faltering, but that his popularity might fade with it.Mr. Abe took office with promises of drastic stimulus and change, pursuing a program supercharged with nationalism that he offered as an antidote to Japan\u2019s decades of economic stagnation and chronic malaise. It is not yet clear why his program stalled. Was it that he tried to do too much \u2014 unleashing the central bank to pump out cash while raising taxes to rein in the national debt? Or was he not bold enough, failing to enact painful market-opening measures and structural changes needed to make the recovery last?Mr. Abe is banking on voters to choose growth.\u201cThere are divided opinions about the economic policies that we are pursuing,\u201d Mr. Abe said in a speech on national television. \u201cThere is also resistance. To continue advancing that growth strategy with the support of the people, we need to listen to the voice of people.\u201dMr. Abe announced that he would dissolve Parliament this week and hold an election for the lower house next month. He said he wanted voters to approve his decision to postpone a scheduled increase in the national sales tax, which he said would have slowed the economy further.With a mixture of increased government spending and an aggressive flow of cash into the economy from the central bank, the program spurred a recovery in Japan, lifted the country\u2019s stock market and won praise as a potential model for other developed economies.That bad economic news, along with criticism of his policies from opposition parties, prompted his call for early elections, Mr. Abe said. \u201cThere is criticism that Abenomics is a failure,\u201d Mr. Abe said. \u201cSo what should we do? Unfortunately, I have yet to hear one concrete idea.\u201dAnalysts said a prolonged economic slowdown could spell the end of a strong two-year run by Mr. Abe. Success in lifting Japan\u2019s economic gloom and restoring confidence is critical to his popularity, the analysts added.\u201cThe size of the economy\u2019s decline was a big shock to Abe and the Liberal Democratic Party,\u201d said Katsuyuki Yakushiji, a professor of politics at Toyo University in Tokyo. \u201cIt makes Abenomics look like a failure. Abe suddenly looks desperate to stay in power.\u201dAnalysts also said the signs that Abenomics was fizzling could hamper Mr. Abe\u2019s efforts to take less popular actions, like expanding the role of Japan\u2019s military or restarting its shuttered nuclear plants.However, many political experts said they also detected deep pessimism in Mr. Abe\u2019s decision: He was essentially admitting that he did not see the economy regaining energy any time soon, they said, and that he would rather face the voters now than after they have become unhappier.\u201cThere is only one reason to call an election now, and that is the fear that things will be only worse if he waits,\u201d said Gerald L. Curtis, a specialist on Japanese politics at Columbia University. \u201cThe expectation of political stability and an Abe administration unchallenged for six years, that so many thought just two weeks ago was the most likely scenario, is now history.\u201d Even so, Mr. Abe was betting that his party was still more appealing to voters than the main opposition party, the Democrats, who have fallen into disarray since their defeat two years ago.In fact, experts said, one reason to call an early election is to deny the Democrats and other opposition parties the chance to enlist a full slate of candidates and mount a serious challenge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indian Factories Will Count and Sell Their Energy Savings", "Date": "2014-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreen ColumnSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 India, the world\u2019s third-largest producer of greenhouse gas, after China and the United States, has resisted international pressure to commit to capping planet-warming emissions. But when it comes to saving energy, India is moving ahead briskly.The program sets a goal of cutting energy use an average of about 4 percent per unit of output at the factories. Those that save extra energy can sell their savings to plants that fail to meet their targets. It is a market-style system akin to cap-and-trade, but the \u201ccap\u201d is an energy efficiency target. Linking the savings to output lets India reduce the intensity of energy use but still increase production to meet its needs as a developing nation.\u201cWhat\u2019s being launched is a national program of trading in certificates representing energy savings,\u201d said Noah Sachs, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, who spent the spring studying the program. \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting. There\u2019s no other country in the world that\u2019s doing this so ambitiously.\u201dIndia\u2019s motivation stems partly from climate concerns, but it is mostly about being thrifty with energy across its growing economy. The nation imports a large and increasing amount of fossil fuels, including coal, which is its dominant source for generating electricity. Energy saved by factories could be made available for economic development and to provide electricity to the nearly 300 million Indians who lack it.Nearly 500 industrial plants are covered by the program, which takes full effect next year and applies to factories in eight industries, including aluminum, cement, steel, thermal power and textiles. The plants together accounted for about 36 percent of the total fossil fuel consumption in India in 2010, according to the country\u2019s Bureau of Energy Efficiency.\u201cThe Indian program is particularly promising because it is a national, as opposed to a regional or statewide or provincial, program,\u201d said Richard Sandor, the chairman of Environmental Financial Products, a firm that has helped introduce several climate-related financial exchanges.At the beginning of the program, the government sent auditors to verify each plant\u2019s energy use and economic output: for example, the number of tons of steel a plant might produce. The plants were then given energy reduction targets \u2014 generally between 1 percent and 8 percent per unit of output \u2014 to achieve over three years. Less-efficient plants were asked to save more energy than plants that were already efficient, said Ajay Mathur, director general of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency.Next year, from April to June, the factories will be evaluated again. Companies that save more energy than their targets required will receive certificates that starting in August they can then sell to companies that do not meet targets.Many questions remain about how well India\u2019s program will work. Nobody knows how many companies will meet their targets next year, how much trading will take place or how much the certificates will cost. Both Indian government officials and outside experts emphasized that the program was in an early phase.\u201cIt is a start for energy efficiency in India, but it is not clear how much a success the program is, since the first round is still to end\u201d next year, Aruna Kumarankandath, who works on renewable energy issues at the Center for Science and Environment, a New Delhi environmental group, said in an email.Of the 478 plants in the program, at least 217 reported that they had already met their targets by the end of March, a year ahead of time, according to the Bureau of Energy Efficiency. About 60 other companies seemed to be on a path to meet it. (The bureau has not verified the reports.)Professor Sachs of the University of Richmond said that the program\u2019s initial goals did not substantially exceed energy-efficiency improvements that many Indian industrial plants would have made anyway because of competitive pressure or other factors. He noted, however, that the least-efficient plants might be forced to make improvements beyond business as usual.Saurabh Kumar, a former official at the bureau who now works at Energy Efficiency Services Limited, a company overseen by the government, said that it was important to start conservatively and that he expected the targets to be stronger in the next three-year phase of the program. That phase will begin by 2016 at the latest, after the first round\u2019s effectiveness is assessed.\u201cWe are following a gradual approach,\u201d Mr. Kumar said. \u201cIt is good to be inclusive to begin with and then ratchet up the standard.\u201dSeveral industry representatives expressed support for Perform, Achieve and Trade and its goal of encouraging factories to save more energy. But Rupa Naik, executive director of the All India Association of Industries, and Vijay Kalantri, the association\u2019s president, noted that new plants would have an easier time making efficiency improvements than existing ones. The cost to Indian industry of achieving the program\u2019s targets \u201cwill be in the billions\u201d of dollars, they said in a joint email comment.K.N. Rao, director for energy and environment of ACC Limited, a major Indian cement manufacturer, said that the three-year window helped ensure that the energy targets were largely achievable. Still, for various reasons, \u201csome units are finding it difficult to meet the target,\u201d he said in an email.One key to the program is ensuring the independence of the auditors who measure the energy use and economic output of the plants. The auditors are trained and accredited, Mr. Mathur said, and about 10 percent of the plants will be audited for a second time, by another auditor, to verify the initial report.In the next three-year phase, Mr. Mathur said, India\u2019s program will expand to more sectors, possibly including refining, petrochemicals, railroads and electricity distribution. Smaller industrial plants will also be covered.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea and China Reach Trade Accord", "Date": "2014-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 China and South Korea declared on Monday that they had reached a trade agreement that would further deepen their economic ties by removing tariffs on more than 90 percent of goods traded between the two global export giants over the next 20 years, officials here said.President Park Geun-hye of South Korea, who is visiting Beijing for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, met her Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, on Monday and the two leaders agreed that their nations had removed enough obstacles in their negotiations to announce that a deal was at hand.With their top leaders watching, the trade ministers of the two nations signed a protocol declaring that they have \u201ceffectively\u201d reached an agreement, although the South Korean government said there remained some \u201ctechnicalities\u201d to sort out. The two nations hoped for a formal agreement by the end of December, the South Korean government said in a statement.Such a deal has yet to be ratified by the parliaments of the two nations. In South Korea, opposition lawmakers and farmers have resisted trade agreements while the government has vigorously pursued them to maintain momentum in the economy.China is already South Korea\u2019s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade amounting to $228.9 billion in 2013, or 21 percent of South Korea\u2019s total trade valued at $1.08 trillion. About 16 percent, or $83 billion, of all South Korea\u2019s imports last year came from China. South Korea\u2019s bilateral trade with China is bigger than South Korea\u2019s combined trade with the United States and Japan, its second- and third-biggest trading partners, respectively.The new deal will further increase biltarrateral trade by removing or sharply reducing barriers to trade and investment between the two global export powerhouses, officials here have said.South Korea\u2019s economy depends heavily on exports. The country already has 12 free trade agreements, covering 46 nations, in force. The deal with China, which follows South Korea\u2019s trade agreements with the United States and the European Union, will help South Korea gain easier access into their biggest export market.Deepening economic ties between Seoul and Beijing also carry political ramifications. South Korea often finds itself in an awkward position amid the rising political and military rivalry between the United States and China in the region. It relies on its alliance with Washington for its security and to help contain North Korea\u2019s military threats. China remains North Korea\u2019s only major ally. South Korea has been hoping that growing economic ties between South Korea and China will help persuade Beijing to tame North Korea.South Korea and China have been negotiating a trade accord since 2012. During their last summit meeting in July, Mr. Xi and Ms. Park had agreed to sign a deal by the end of the year.Negotiators from both nations have been haggling over tariff cuts. South Korea has requested a wider range of cuts on industrial products, such as cars, machinery and oil products. China made similar demands on farm and fisheries products.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Manhattan Rowhouses With the Welcome Mat Out Back", "Date": "2014-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreetscapesIt\u2019s the inside-out tenement of the 1930s and 1940s, which had that elegant ingenuity born of necessity. Developers took rows of tenements facing commercial avenues, switched the residential entrances around to the back, and made the fronts into stores. But Depression economics pressed owners to further rethink the dwindling revenue stream from blocks of tenements. A near deathblow came in 1936, when the city required extensive upgrades in old-law (pre-1901) tenements, and the typical owner faced a bill in the thousands of dollars to fireproof stairs. In the back, Mr. Faile let \u2019er rip with a 200-foot-long swath of tennis and badminton courts, past which the tenants walked to a double stairway rising over the backs of the stores, to their apartments on the second floor. These were set on a terrace with white-painted brick and Regency details. For those who landed one of the eight $150-per-month Goelet apartments, living over the stores was a little urban dream \u2014 unless the clatter and roar of the El happened to bother you. The entire structure cost $120,000, whereas minimal renovations of the old tenements would have been $80,000. Nothing has been built to rival its ingenuity since. Another inside-out creation was the Doelger family\u2019s Sutton Mews, finished in mid-1941 on First Avenue, from East 55th to 56th Streets. The family\u2019s architect, Walter Schneider, took a row of tenements, moved the residential entrances to the rear, where they faced a garden with flagstone paths, and redid the retail fronts.The stores had tenants like Billy\u2019s Bar, famous for its brass rails, dark paneling and gas lamps. Billy\u2019s served all kinds: \u201cTruckmen and Fashionables Rub Elbows\u201d said The New York World-Telegram in October 1941. The Architectural Forum compared Sutton Mews to the fancy Sutton Place apartments and observed that \u201ca brightly polished penny outshines a $20 gold piece.\u201d The apartments had Venetian blinds (sometimes used as room dividers), built-in bathtubs, electric fireplaces and house phones.The courtyard walls were painted green, although the plantings seem to have been oversold: Photographs published in July 1941 show patches of dirt, spindly plants and indifferently laid pieces of bluestone, probably salvaged. Sutton Mews apartments ranged from $37 to $67 a month \u2014 despite the polish, this penny still had the aura of a tenement. The postwar pickup spelled the end for the inside-out tenement, as the dire economics of the Depression eased. I always liked the Doelgers\u2019 Sutton Mews, and was sorry to see it replaced by the colossally unfortunate Plaza 400, a co-op apartment building, around 1968. These days you will have to search wide for an inside-out tenement. There are a few hiding on First and Second Avenues, but none as ambitious as the Goelet apartments and Sutton Mews.

{"Headline": "The Company Is Still Tight-Lipped, but Shareholders Aren\u2019t", "Date": "2014-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Haggler_____In this episode, the Haggler returns yet again to Conn\u2019s, the Texas-based chain of appliance stores that is in no mood to talk, at least not to the Haggler.The Haggler must repeat that, in the absence of a discussion with Conn\u2019s, he can\u2019t opine about the merits of Ms. Smith\u2019s contentions. But given the company\u2019s cold-shoulder approach to media relations, he sees no other option: He will write about this company until it feels chattier.Fortunately, the inner workings of Conn\u2019s are fascinating, a window into a segment of the retail economy that caters to \u2014 others may prefer the word \u201ctargets\u201d \u2014 the poor and those with bad credit. And the more the Haggler learns about this company and its executives, the less surprised he is that they are such big fans of the silent treatment.The misrepresentation part is for a judge to decide, but the plunge is not a matter of dispute. From late December 2013 to Sept. 2 this year, the complaint states, shares in Conn\u2019s fell 61 percent, to $31 from $79.24. (As of Friday, they traded at $32.11.) The trouble started in February, when the company announced disappointing preliminary results and blamed an \u201cunexpected delinquency increase.\u201dTo understand what that means, you need to know that roughly three-fourths of purchases at Conn\u2019s are financed through the company\u2019s internal credit system.In March, when a full earnings report was released, the company said it was in the midst of hiring about 200 employees to cope with increased sales after the opening of additional stores. Many of those new employees were not \u201cup to speed,\u201d as the company\u2019s chief executive put it in a conference call that month, which meant that they lacked the skills to collect delinquent accounts.But the law firms suing Conn\u2019s found a number of former high-level Conn\u2019s employees, who are acting as confidential witnesses, and they offer a different version of events. What follows is their account, as articulated in the lawsuit\u2019s 118-page complaint:In late 2012, Conn\u2019s decided to jump-start expansion plans by lowering its credit standards. Until then, a person with a credit score below 520 would not be eligible to finance purchases. (Scores below 620 are widely considered \u201cbad.\u201d) Afterward, people with credit scores as low as 400 could walk out with their carts full, even if they had a history of repossessions.These relaxed standards were promoted hard at newly opened stores. The company set a quota in these stores of $1 million in sales for the first month. To help achieve that number, the company dispatched a traveling group of 10 to 15 sales staff members, known internally as the \u201cDream Team.\u201d\u201cThe Dream Team obtained automatic approval of credit lines of $2,500 to $5,000 for these high-risk customers,\u201d the complaint states, \u201cand then used aggressive sales tactics to pressure the customers to \u2018max out\u2019 the credit line.\u201dHere\u2019s a spoiler: This tactic had serious downsides. The first-payment default rate \u2014 the percentage of people who never cough up a dollar \u2014 shot up to 25 percent. The Haggler is condensing here, but analysts eventually caught on to the problems in Conn\u2019s credit portfolio, which is why the stock price was shellacked in February.Conn\u2019s has filed a motion to dismiss the suit, but calls and emails to employees at Conn\u2019s headquarters, including its media relations contact, were not returned. Lawyers at Vinson & Elkins, the firm defending Conn\u2019s, were nonresponsive, too. Neither the company nor the firm even acknowledged that it had received the Haggler\u2019s messages.This is a shame because, as the Haggler read the narrative in this lawsuit, he had a question: Why, oh why, did Conn\u2019s give so much credit to people with such bad credit history? How did that seem viable in the long term?One possible answer is in the complaint. It states that bonuses for the company\u2019s chief executive, Theodore M. Wright; its chief operating officer, Michael J. Poppe; and its chief financial officer, Brian E. Taylor \u2014 named defendants in the suit \u2014 were largely tied to the company\u2019s operating income.Consider Mr. Wright. His maximum bonus of $850,000 would be achieved if Conn\u2019s booked $165.8 million in operating income in 2014, according to the suit. The company came close, with $162 million. Mr. Wright took home a $820,000 bonus.The complaint also states that both he and Mr. Poppe also sold shares of Conn\u2019s in 2013, the period when the plaintiffs maintain that those shares were \u201cartificially inflated.\u201d Mr. Wright had not sold any shares since 2007. In 2013, he sold enough to yield $1.9 million. Mr. Poppe cashed out $2.6 million the same year.So top executives at Conn\u2019s made out quite nicely courtesy of the credit-for-all strategy, with big bonuses and marvelously timed stock sales. Others fared much worse, including Grace Bunmi Salako Smith. She was one of the customers with poor credit history who bought merchandise at Conn\u2019s in 2013.Sell, urgeth the Haggler! And if there ever is new management, this columnist has but one humble request: a phone call.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Gives North Korea the Silent Treatment", "Date": "2014-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama took the unusual step of sending the nation\u2019s top spy, instead of a senior diplomat, to win the release of two American prisoners in North Korea, administration officials said Sunday, specifically to signal that he would not reward the North with sanctions relief or a new round of negotiations in return for the freedom of the latest Americans to be locked up during visits to the isolated nation.The official said the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., was dispatched in response to the North\u2019s request, made in backchannel communications with the administration, for a senior official of the United States government to oversee the release. But Mr. Clapper, a retired general whose career has spanned many conflicts with three generations of North Korean leaders, never met Kim Jong-un, the young dictator whose health, hold on power and progress in developing a deliverable nuclear weapon have all been sources of intense scrutiny to American intelligence officials.As a matter of diplomatic tactics, the gambit worked: Mr. Bae, a 46-year-old missionary who had been held for two years, and Mr. Miller, 25, were reunited with their families at an Air Force base. But as a matter of strategy, it is unclear that Mr. Clapper made any progress: His message was that for a resumption of relations with the United States, North Korea had to deliver on its past promises to dismantle a nuclear program now believed to have six to a dozen weapons. That question has frozen North Korea\u2019s discussions with the United States for six years, and all the indications are that the North is accelerating its nuclear and missile programs, rather than backing off.\u201cMy sense of the Obama administration is that they are less averse to talking to the North Koreans\u201d than the Bush administration was, he said, \u201cbut are pretty convinced there is nothing there to talk about.\u201dThe difference in approach reveals much about how Mr. Obama views the threats posed by the two adversaries, and the strategies needed to counter them.If Iran got nuclear weapons, Mr. Obama has often told his aides, a \u201ccontainment\u201d policy would not work; Saudi Arabia and other Sunni-dominated Arab states would rush to do the same. A regional arms race would ensue, he has said, in one of the most volatile corners of the earth. North Korea, much further along than Iran, has already detonated three nuclear tests. But in Mr. Obama\u2019s view, the country can be contained: China is already a nuclear power, and Japan and South Korea are treaty allies with the United States, meaning that the United States would be legally bound to act as their ultimate protector against the North. So Mr. Obama has reacted mildly to many types of North Korean provocation: The seizing of American tourists, the launching of missiles and nuclear tests. The warning about broken promises that Robert M. Gates described as defense secretary \u2014 \u201cI am tired of buying the same horse twice\u201d \u2014 has outlasted his tenure. There appears to be no enthusiasm in Washington for resuming the \u201cSix Party Talks\u201d with the North \u2014 the Asian equivalent of the multination negotiations now underway with Iran \u2014 until Pyongyang begins to dismantle nuclear facilities it has promised to take apart.So while Mr. Obama could have sent a looming political figure like former President Bill Clinton, who negotiated a previous prisoner release, his decision to turn to Mr. Clapper was rooted in the conclusion that entering a negotiation now would ultimately violate the Gates rule. But it also raises the question of whether the United States is missing Mr. Kim\u2019s first real effort to signal that he wants to resume some kind of dialogue.There are several theories in Washington about why the North Korean leader would make that attempt now. \u201cThe report did not have much to do with holding American citizens,\u201d Mr. Eberstadt said on Sunday, \u201cbut it\u2019s possible they want to show a change of course.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 Fieros for Want of a Ferrari ", "Date": "2014-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAuto Ego17 PhotosPATERSON, N.J. \u2014 A visit with Onix Taveras and his Pontiac Fieros begins with a basement tour in his neat Cape Cod style home \u2014 and a chat about television. Displays of action figures, wall posters and scale models from the various \u201cStar Trek\u201d series give away his favorite show.The topic quickly changes to his favorite car and its screen roles. Mr. Taveras looks for TV shows and movies that feature the Fiero, a small, plastic-body two-seat sporty car that Pontiac offered in 1984-88. (The name is Italian for \u201cproud.\u201d) He especially likes an episode of the TV sitcom \u201cHow I Met Your Mother,\u201d in which the character Marshall Eriksen (played by Jason Segel) mourns his Fiero\u2019s engine failure just as the car is about to crest 200,000 miles. Mr. Taveras said he identified with the story line, which recounted how the Fiero touched the lives of several friends. \u201cEverywhere I go with my car, people tell me their stories of a Fiero, one that they owned or rode in as a kid,\u201d he said. It was a TV series from three decades ago, \u201cMiami Vice,\u201d that put Mr. Taveras on the path to owning a Fiero. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really interested in cars until I saw that show,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, I was hooked.\u201d In the series, which depicted a glamorized version of South Florida\u2019s violent illicit narcotics trade, fashion-forward detectives battled nefarious crime lords from the bucket seats of Ferraris \u2014 unlikely undercover police cars. The exotic sports cars liberally featured on the show kept Mr. Taveras, now 46, tuning in \u2014 and he still watches episodes on DVD.\u201cI love Ferraris, but I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be buying one anytime soon,\u201d he said. Mr. Taveras grew up in Manhattan and the Bronx, where his first car, a Pontiac Firebird, was stolen. While shopping for a new one, something else caught his eye at the Pontiac dealership.\u201cI saw the Fiero GT on a brochure and knew that was my car,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, it was like a semiexotic.\u201dThe Fiero shared its midengine layout, with the motor between the rear wheels and the cabin, with exotic cars like Ferraris and Lamborghinis. But it was closer in stature to the Toyota MR2 and Bertone X1/9 \u2014 originally known as the Fiat X1/9 \u2014 two other relatively affordable midengine runabouts.The Fiero was in its final year in 1988, and with inventory scarce Mr. Taveras had to settle for an automatic transmission rather than the 5-speed manual he wanted. He paid about $17,000 for a red GT, the top-of-line model with a V6 and a fastback roofline distinct from the standard car\u2019s notchback design. It was his first new car.When his Fiero was stolen six years later, Mr. Taveras replaced it with a 4-cylinder version, but that car proved unsatisfying. \u201cIt was slow, and the transmission was horrendous,\u201d he said. He then bought a 1988 Fiero Formula, a model that packaged the GT\u2019s V6 engine and performance upgrades in the standard body. The last-year versions are the most desirable Fieros, he explained, because they gained a new suspension that addressed criticisms of the car\u2019s clunky handling and harsh ride.\u201cPontiac designed that suspension for the first year, but G.M. wouldn\u2019t give them the money to build it,\u201d said Mr. Taveras, who is immersed in Fiero history. In his view, General Motors\u2019 internal politics blocked Pontiac from making the Fiero a more capable sports car. As Mr. Tavares tells it, Chevrolet lobbied to preserve its Corvette as G.M.\u2019s performance-image leader, and those efforts kept Pontiac from giving the Fiero anything more powerful than a Chevy-designed 140-horsepower 2.8-liter V6. The standard engine, a coarse 4-cylinder known as the Iron Duke, made some 45 fewer horses. Mr. Taveras next showed off his large two-car garage. He called it a main selling point for the house that he and his wife, Noemi Galloza, a nurse, bought five years ago in a quiet suburban pocket of this city. The couple spent spare time over three years converting it into a workshop for the Fiero \u2014 or Fieros. Mr. Taveras owns two.Parked next to his red Fiero Formula, which is undergoing a restoration, is a red 1988 GT nearly identical to the one stolen from him two decades ago. This one, too, has an automatic transmission, but also the bonus of the optional T-top roof with removable panels. He bought the GT eight years ago and restored it, doing all the mechanical work himself.Such endeavors come easily for Mr. Taveras, a certified Mercedes Master Technician employed by Prestige Mercedes-Benz in Paramus. Becoming an auto technician was a career change after years running a dry-cleaning store.\u201cThat was a nightmare,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I went to technical school. That opened the door for me to get into Prestige.\u201d He\u2019s in his 11th year with the dealership, where he specializes in interior electronics. \u201cI love the technology in Mercedes cars,\u201d he said. \u201cI love gadgets.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Taveras has equipped his Fiero GT with the latest infotainment features, including satellite radio, an iPod connection and Bluetooth wireless for his smartphone, which also provides navigation. He is especially proud that he installed everything without splicing any of the car\u2019s wires or cutting interior panels.\u201cI could remove everything and put it back to original easily,\u201d he said.He added similar equipment to his daily driver, a 14-year-old Oldsmobile Intrigue. Mr. Taveras puts the electronics to good use. Last year, he drove his GT to Indianapolis for the 30th Anniversary Fiero Reunion, a three-day event that included high-speed driving on the famous racetrack. His devotion to the sporty Pontiac extends to managing a Facebook page on which he posts the work he does on his Fieros as tutorials for other enthusiasts. Projects have included removing and replacing the engine. It\u2019s an operation that requires a full-car lift \u2014 Mr. Taveras\u2019s garage has a small one \u2014 because the engine comes out from below. He said that many owners today replace the original power plant with something more potent. \u201cThey designed the Fiero with a big engine compartment,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost anything will fit.\u201dA 3.8-liter Buick V6, an engine used in millions of G.M. cars until 2008, is the most popular swap, Mr. Taveras said. Corvette and Cadillac V8s are also used. He has considered installing a turbocharged Mitsubishi 4-cylinder in his Fiero Formula, modified to make about 400 horsepower.\u201cI want to do something that\u2019s not been done with the Fiero,\u201d he said.His Fiero GT, however, will remain in factory-stock condition. The cabin, though restored, shows its age in the design, particularly the modular-look instrument panel trimmed with fake screw heads. The driving, Mr. Taveras promises, compensates for any of the car\u2019s crimes of style. The little V6 growls pleasingly under acceleration, then fades politely into the background when cruising. Its raspy, burbling exhaust note, broadcast through four chrome tailpipes, is an entertaining consolation for any perceived power deficit. Yet the engine delivers a noticeable kick in the 2,800-pound car. He heads to his favorite local road, Riverview Drive, a lightly trafficked and unexpectedly pastoral route that winds along the Passaic River in the neighboring town of Totowa. Taking sweeping curves and traversing patches of rough pavement reveals admirable composure in the nearly 30-year-old car. The earlier Fieros, whose suspension was derived from the Chevrolet Chevette and Citation economy cars, do not handle as well.Passing a cemetery, he mentions another attraction of Riverview Drive: Locals say it\u2019s haunted.Onix TaverasOccupation: Automotive technicianLocation: Paterson, N.J.Vehicle: 1988 Pontiac Fiero GTYear acquired: 2006Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chance for Tax Overhaul Is Seen in Shift of Power ", "Date": "2014-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe have this tax code that doesn\u2019t bring stability and certainty to the economy,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and chairman of the Finance Committee, who will hand over his gavel to a Republican, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, in the next Congress. \u201cHistorically, Republicans have wanted efficiency. Democrats want fairness. I want both, and we\u2019re getting neither.\u201d\u201cBudgets matter,\u201d said Mr. Price, who is currently vice chairman of the Budget Committee, below Mr. Ryan. \u201cThe role of the federal government to get our fiscal house in order is important.\u201dBut there are deep policy differences between Republican leaders and the White House. Chris Krueger, a Washington policy analyst at Guggenheim Securities, told clients Thursday morning that he saw the chances of tax reform eroding, not improving, because professions of comity would soon be swamped by budget brinkmanship.But on Tuesday, the incentives changed. Mr. Obama wants to rebound after Democrats\u2019 midterm-election drubbing. Republicans want to show themselves to be a governing party ahead of the 2016 presidential campaign.\u201cWe have to do this in the next year and a half, and that means we\u2019re going to need presidential leadership,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cIt would be a great legacy for him to leave behind.\u201dMr. Wyden said he spoke with Mr. Hatch and Mr. McConnell on Wednesday about moving forward quickly. The issue of tax policy is likely to be raised at the White House on Friday, when congressional leaders from both parties meet with the president.The rise of fiscal matters comes as their urgency actually recedes. The federal deficit fell to less than 3 percent of gross domestic product in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 \u2014 below the 40-year average. Economic growth, which both sides say a tax overhaul would help, was stronger over the last six months than in any similar stretch since 2002.But Republican leaders do not see it that way.\u201cTax reform is absolutely imperative to get this economy rolling,\u201d Mr. Price said.Much of the foundation work is done. The Treasury\u2019s plan details just how many loopholes would have to be eliminated or curtailed to bring the corporate tax rate down to 28 percent, a level Republicans do not consider low enough. The retiring Ways and Means chairman, Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, produced an even broader proposal that would include individuals and small businesses, and that could form the basis of Mr. Ryan\u2019s plan.It includes provisions that should have broad appeal among Democrats: a tax on large banks, a surtax on high-income individuals, and a narrower limit on deductions for large mortgages and retirement savings. It also includes a variant of Mr. Obama\u2019s infrastructure spending plan.\u201cI\u2019m kind of known for that over the last 38 years,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.Bigger still is the scale of ambition. So far, Mr. Obama wants to confine the overhaul to the byzantine corporate tax code, leaving the tax forms of individuals and most small businesses untouched. Administration officials worry that any simplification of the individual tax code would reduce tax rates on the rich at the expense of lower-income families.To Republicans, such a limited overhaul is impossible, philosophically and politically. Business lobbies like the National Federation of Independent Business and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce would stand in the way, and Republicans would worry about being castigated as helping big business while ignoring the travails of other taxpayers.Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, a Republican on the Finance Committee, said Thursday that a compromise might be a broader business-tax overhaul that simplified the code for corporations and so-called pass-through entities \u2014 small businesses, partnerships and limited liability corporations \u2014 but left the individual tax code alone.The window for action is short, given the complexity of the task, Mr. Obama\u2019s lame-duck stature and the looming presidential election. A senior Republican House aide involved in tax policy said that unless both the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee drafted and approved legislation, a potential deal would probably slide to the next president. Mr. Hatch said \u201ca year and a half is the max.\u201dBut if Mr. Obama sends aides to negotiate with the tax-writing committees immediately, both he and Mr. Wyden said it could be done.\u201cTax reform is absolutely, totally, completely impossible,\u201d Mr. Wyden said, \u201cuntil 15 minutes before it happens.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iraq and Kurds Reach Deal on Oil Exports and Budget Payments", "Date": "2014-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBAGHDAD \u2014 Iraq\u2019s central government and the autonomous region of Kurdistan reached an interim agreement on Thursday over oil exports and budget payments, at least temporarily easing a bitter dispute that has threatened the government\u2019s stability.The standoff began earlier this year when Kurdish officials angered Baghdad by exporting oil produced in their region directly to Turkey and not through the Iraqi Oil Ministry.The government in Baghdad called the move unconstitutional and suspected that the Kurds were trying to use oil to advance a bid for independence. So the central government stopped sending to Kurdistan the 17 percent of the national budget allotted to the regional government.Under the agreement signed Thursday, the central government will pay $500 million to the Kurdistan Regional Government, or K.R.G., from the national budget while the Kurds will let the Iraqi government sell 150,000 barrels per day of the oil exported by the Kurds.Although the agreement put in place no long-term solutions, some hailed it as an important step. \u201cHopefully this will be the starting point for addressing all the outstanding issues between Baghdad and the K.R.G.,\u201d said Hoshyar Zebari, a Kurd and Iraq\u2019s finance minister.He said that resolving the disputes between the Kurdish government and Baghdad had taken on a greater urgency because the country was facing an economic crisis caused in part by the recent drop in the price of oil, the basis of Iraq\u2019s economy. This in turn could undermine efforts to fight the Islamic State, the jihadist organization that has seized about one-third of Iraqi territory.Others noted the limits of the interim agreement.The amount of oil given to the Iraqi government to sell is at most half of what the Kurds export, said Kirk Sowell, a political risk analyst who publishes the Inside Iraqi Politics newsletter. And $500 million is only about half of what Kurdistan is meant to receive monthly from the central government.The interim agreement did not even touch on larger, thornier issues, including whether Baghdad will continue to allow the Kurds to export their own oil and who will control the rich Kirkuk oil field in northern Iraq. The field came under full Kurdish control this summer after Iraqi government troops fled the Islamic State\u2019s advance into the area.Under the agreement, the prime minister of the Kurdish region, Nijervan Barzani, will travel to Baghdad within three days to meet with the central government to try to resolve the outstanding issues.\u201cThis signifies pretty significant progress,\u201d said David Goldwyn, a senior State Department energy official in the first Obama administration, noting that both sides had made concessions.\u201cThey have crossed the Rubicon here on the K.R.G.\u2019s right to export oil,\u201d he said, \u201cand they have foreshadowed the mechanism on how the K.R.G. will meet its obligation to the central Iraqi budget going forward.\u201d Azam Ahmed contributed reporting from New York, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Bad Economic News for Japan, Abe\u2019s Magic Seems to Evaporate", "Date": "2014-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisTOKYO \u2014 Is this the end of Abenomics? And if so, why did it fail?The answers, economists and political experts say, may turn on the difficulty that Japanese leaders have had in choosing between competing policy approaches: monetary stimulus and fiscal austerity. And that indecision reflects an intense debate about which aspect of Japan\u2019s severe economic woes represents the greater problem: the downward spiral of deflation that stimulus proponents blame for causing two \u201clost decades\u201d of stagnation, or the ballooning national debt that fiscal hawks worry could doom the nation\u2019s future.But there is a third view, that neither a balanced budget nor a major stimulus alone will be enough to produce a lasting recovery. What are needed, proponents of this view argue, are painful, market-opening reforms that Mr. Abe has thus far failed to produce. Abenomics, they say, has so far amounted to little more than a short-term supercharging of the economy.\u201cAbenomics has just been a mixed bag of tricks so far,\u201d said Takao Komine, a specialist on economic policy at Hosei University in Tokyo. \u201cIts success or failure will depend on whether Prime Minister Abe can deliver on the long-term structural changes.\u201dJust a few weeks ago, Abenomics was still winning accolades as a rare success story among developed nations, many of which seemed to have caught the same disease of low to no growth and corrosive price declines known as deflation. When Mr. Abe took office two years ago, he pressured the central bank into making a drastic push to reinflate the economy by pumping it full of cash, which he backed up with huge government stimulus spending. Japan\u2019s stock market soared as the moves seemed to work a miracle, transforming the economy into one of the world\u2019s most robust growth stories.Then, seemingly overnight, Mr. Abe\u2019s magic seemed to evaporate. The mortal blow came on Monday, when government figures showed that the world\u2019s third-largest economy shrank by a steep 1.6 percent in the three months ending in September. It was the second straight quarter of economic contraction, the definition of a recession. Mr. Abe, who enjoyed high approval ratings just a few weeks ago, suddenly looked desperate, appearing live on national television to plead for his economic program.Most economists agree that the immediate cause was the increase on April 1 of the sales tax to 8 percent from 5 percent, which prompted a tightening of consumer spending that rippled through the $5 trillion economy.Koichi Hamada, a former professor of economics at Yale University who has been an architect of Mr. Abe\u2019s revival policies, said the tax increase was never part of Abenomics. Rather, he said, it was a legacy from the previous administration, which passed a law mandating that it be put in effect this year. He said fiscal hawks within Mr. Abe\u2019s own governing Liberal Democratic Party had urged the prime minister to let it take effect as scheduled to help tame Japan\u2019s ballooning national debt, which has grown to the equivalent of more than two years of economic output and is already the largest in the developed world.The real force behind the tax increase, he and others said, was the Ministry of Finance, the strongest of Japan\u2019s powerful central ministries and an advocate of balanced budgets. As Japan\u2019s deficits have spiraled upward during its long economic downturn, the ministry has pushed for increasing the national sales tax as the best way to raise new revenue.Mr. Hamada and others said the ministry scared the Abe government into going through with the tax increase by arguing that any delay in the tax would make Japan look fiscally irresponsible and cause a stock market crash. Fiscal hawks like those at the ministry fear that a failure to address Japan\u2019s national debt could lead to a crisis of confidence in which Japan can no longer sell its bonds.But on Tuesday, Mr. Abe defied the fiscal hawks and postponed the second tax increase until 2017. Investors applauded his renewed focus on growth, sending stocks rebounding after the biggest one-day drop in six months on Monday. \u201cThe Ministry of Finance is a tough and powerful opponent, but Abe has the guts to fight back,\u201d Mr. Hamada said.Some analysts described the snap election as an attempt to curtail the ministry\u2019s influence. By making the tax increase the election\u2019s top issue, Mr. Abe is forcing the ministry\u2019s supporters within his own party to fall in line behind him. \u201cCalling the election is a calculated move by Abe to silence his opponents,\u201d said Mr. Komine, the economist from Hosei University.Mr. Hamada expressed optimism that the recession was just a temporary setback, and that the central bank\u2019s decision late last month to pump even more cash into the economy would bring back growth. \u201cThe rocket has faltered, but it won\u2019t crash,\u201d he said. \u201cAbenomics is still the right policy for Japan.\u201dOther experts are not so sanguine, pointing out that the tax increase was relatively small given the size of the economy. It was a sign of the underlying weakness of Abenomics that it caused such damage, they said.In particular, these critics argue that Mr. Abe has failed to deliver on promises to nurture entrepreneurship and new industries, and has proved unwilling or unable to challenge the central bureaucrats and vested interests in Japan that are resisting market-opening reforms. The farm lobby, for example, has blocked a trans-Pacific trade deal meant to showcase Mr. Abe\u2019s more competitive Japan.Mr. Abe\u2019s policies have also failed to stop sliding wages. The average income of working households fell in September for a 14th consecutive month. The stimulus and tax increase may have exacerbated the problem. The central bank\u2019s very success in curtailing deflation drove prices higher for the first time in nearly two decades. But because wages did not climb, and the sales tax pushed prices up further, most Japanese felt poorer.\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s time to call Abenomics a failure,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of politics at Temple University\u2019s campus in Tokyo. \u201cThe recession means Abe has failed to deliver on growth, and he has whiffed the structural reforms. All that is left is disappointment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. to Give $3 Billion to Climate Fund to Help Poor Nations, and Spur Rich Ones", "Date": "2014-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe two announcements, both unveiled at prominent global meetings with world leaders, highlight Mr. Obama\u2019s intention to use the last two years of his administration to push forward on climate change policy, which he sees as a cornerstone of his legacy.\u201cWe\u2019re doing this because it is in our national interest to build resilience in developing countries to climate change,\u201d said the senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to explain the announcement.\u201cIt is a vital part of establishing momentum\u201d behind the global climate talks in Paris next year, a second American official said.But Mr. Obama\u2019s pledge, spending American tax dollars on foreign aid related to climate change, is certain to garner further criticism from Republicans, who have already denounced his domestic climate change policies as \u201cjob-killing\u201d regulations.On Wednesday, after Mr. Obama announced in China that the United States would cut its emissions by 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, Speaker John A. Boehner said, \u201cThis announcement is yet another sign that the president intends to double down on his job-crushing policies no matter how devastating the impact for America\u2019s heartland and the country as a whole.\u201dIt is not clear whether Mr. Obama\u2019s $3 billion pledge will come from existing sources of funding, or whether he will have to ask Congress to appropriate the money. Since 2010, the Obama administration has spent about $2.5 billion to help poor countries adapt to climate change and develop clean sources of energy, but Republicans are certain to push back against additional funding requests linked to climate change and foreign aid.The American contribution is meant to spur other countries to make similar pledges. Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, has called for governments to create an initial fund of about $10 billion.Even before Mr. Obama\u2019s pledge, at least 10 countries, including France, Germany and South Korea, had pledged a total of around $3 billion to the fund. On Thursday, the Kyodo News Agency reported that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan would announce a contribution of about $1.5 billion at the Group of 20 meeting. The American contribution is expected to be the largest.\u201cThe contribution by the U.S. will have a direct impact on mobilizing contributions from the other large economies,\u201d said Hela Cheikhrouhou, executive director of the Green Climate Fund. \u201cThe other large economies \u2014 Japan, the U.K. \u2014 have been watching to see what the U.S. will do.\u201dDavid Waskow, an expert on climate change negotiations with the World Resources Institute, a research organization in Washington, said: \u201cThis continues the momentum and really builds on what they did with the announcement in China. I think we\u2019ll now see a broader set of actors who are willing to make contributions.\u201dMoney, and lots of it, is viewed as a crucial part of reaching a climate change deal in Paris in 2015. In particular, the world\u2019s least developed economies insist that the world\u2019s richest economies \u2014 which are also the largest greenhouse gas polluters \u2014 must commit to paying billions of dollars to help the world\u2019s poorest adapt to the ravages of climate change.Other nations are likely to view an American pledge of climate funding as a small down payment on a long-term commitment to ultimately send tens of billions of dollars in public aid and private investment related to climate change.\u201cFinance has become this zero-sum game. Put money on the table and we\u2019ll talk; if you don\u2019t put money on the table then we\u2019ll walk,\u201d said Rachel Kyte, vice president for sustainability for the World Bank, which is closely involved in the climate funding talks. \u201cIt\u2019s an essential component of a deal.\u201dAt a 2009 climate change summit meeting in Copenhagen, Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the secretary of state, pledged that by 2020 the United States would help mobilize $100 billion, through a combination of public aid and private investments, to flow annually from rich countries to help the poor economies deal with climate change.Coral Davenport reported from Washington, and Mark Landler from Yangon, Myanmar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Monte dei Paschi di Siena\u2019s Former Executives Sentenced to 3.5 Years in Prison", "Date": "2014-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySIENA, Italy \u2014 Three former managers blamed for the crisis that has befallen the world\u2019s oldest bank, and devastated the community whose economy depended on it, were sentenced on Friday to jail time and banned from public office for five years.A three-judge panel handed down three-and-a-half-year jail sentences to the executives: Giuseppe Mussari, former president of Monte dei Paschi di Siena; Antonio Vigni, the former chief executive; and Gianluca Baldassarri, the former chief financial officer.They were also sentenced to pay civil damages still to be determined. All three will appeal the decision, their lawyers said, a process that in Italy suspends the execution of the sentence.Under Mr. Mussari, Monte dei Paschi acquired another Italian bank, Antonveneta, in 2008, for 9 billion euros, or $11.3 billion at current exchange rates, a price that was considered wildly inflated and left the bank financially weakened.After the executives left the company in 2012 because of its poor financial performance, the derivatives contract, with the Japanese bank Nomura, was found in a safe in the bank\u2019s fortresslike medieval headquarters in the historic center of Siena.Though the charges of obstructing regulators were relatively minor, the damage caused by years of mismanagement and possible fraud at Monte dei Paschi has been enormous. The bank, founded in 1472, was the largest employer in Siena, and it helped finance a host of community projects and services, including child care, ambulance services, the local professional soccer team, and Siena\u2019s famous bareback horse race, the Palio.That largess has evaporated.Shortly after the verdict, Siena\u2019s mayor, Bruno Valentini, posted a message on Twitter, saying \u201cJustice finally starts running its course.\u201dThe capital shortfall at Monte dei Paschi was the largest of all 130 banks examined by the central bank. The assessment was part of an attempt to clean up the eurozone\u2019s ailing banking system and to restore the flow of credit.After the central bank\u2019s review, Monte dei Paschi said it had hired UBS and Citigroup as financial advisers, to help it devise a plan to raise capital and evaluate \u201call strategic alternatives.\u201d The alternatives could potentially include a merger with a stronger bank.Prosecutors had asked for a seven-year sentence for Mr. Mussari, and six-year sentences for Mr. Vigni and Mr. Baldassarri. The maximum sentences would have been eight years. All three men face at least one separate investigation in Milan into possible insider trading, a more serious charge that carries a maximum sentence of 12 years.The Bank of Italy, the central bank that supervises lenders in the country, has imposed \u20ac5 million in fines on Montei dei Paschi executives for violations involving risky trades, among other lapses.Mr. Vigni and Mr. Mussari are also the targets of civil suits brought by Monte dei Paschi.In a speech in Rome on Friday, the central bank\u2019s governor, Ignazio Visco, said that Montei dei Paschi\u2019s troubles were \u201cin large part the legacy of past episodes of \u2018mala gestio\u2019 that the Bank of Italy, jointly with judicial authorities, helped to bring to light.\u201d He was using the Latin expression for \u201cbad management.\u201dDuring the trial, defense lawyers had argued that the derivatives contract at the center of the case was kept in a safe, where the bank\u2019s current chief executive, Fabrizio Viola, discovered it in October 2012, because of its contentious content. Many people at the bank were aware of the contract, they said.Prosecutors contend the defendants deliberately concealed the contract from inspectors at the Bank of Italy in 2011.During the trial, Mr. Mussari tried to shift blame to Mr. Vigni, saying the former chief executive was responsible for the derivatives contract. Mr. Mussari became chairman in 2006, a year after the contract was signed.In testimony, Mr. Vigni said that many people at the bank had known about the agreement. \u201cI didn\u2019t hide that document in the safe,\u201d Mr. Vigni said in a hearing. \u201cI just forgot it.\u201dDeutsche Bank was also accused of fashioning a derivatives contract that helped Monte dei Paschi hide losses. Last year, as part of a settlement, the bank agreed to forfeit \u20ac221 million, or about a third of its profit from the transaction.During the sentencing hearing on Friday, Mr. Baldassarri, wearing a pinstriped blue suit and crossing his arms much of the time, looked on attentively. Mr. Vigni, sitting in the front row next to his lawyers, took notes. Mr. Mussari did not attend.Giuseppe Grosso, one of the prosecutors, said Friday morning that the executives\u2019 actions had \u201cput at risk the credibility of the entire Italian banking system.\u201dDefense lawyers, for their part, said that there had been no attempt to hide the deal. \u201cA document kept in a safe, regularly registered \u2014 how is that hiding?\u201d Fabio Pisillo, one of Mr. Mussari\u2019s lawyers, asked at the hearing on Friday.A separate investigation could lead to charges of stock manipulation. Prosecutors in Milan are handling that more complex inquiry because they have more investigators on staff and more expertise with financial crimes.In 2012, Siena prosecutors tried to seize \u20ac1.8 billion in assets from Nomura, arguing that the bank had fraudulently helped Monte dei Paschi hide losses. An appeals court refused to endorse the seizure, however, saying there were insufficient legal grounds.A spokesman for Nomura, which has been sued by Monte dei Paschi for its role in creating the derivatives contract, declined to comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Classic or Custom, Wearing One\u2019s Art on One\u2019s Sleeve", "Date": "2014-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Henry Deakin, a seventh-generation maker of cuff links, both classic and customized, believes those small pieces of jewelry at the end of a sleeve are a small but important way for men to express themselves.\u201cThere\u2019s a limit to what a guy can do to stand out,\u201d Mr. Deakin said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your ties and watches, but you can actually express yourself with cuff links and show your passions and a fine bit of detail.\u201dAlong with his brother, James, Mr. Deakin owns Deakin & Francis, a maker of accessories founded in 1786 in Birmingham, England.\u201cThe market for cuff links has grown hugely in the last five years,\u201d Mr. Deakin said. \u201cWhen the recession first hit, we were quite concerned, but you don\u2019t get any brownie points for looking scruffy in the boardroom,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can make a suit look a lot smarter with cuffs. It might make you stand out in a boardroom if people see a great cuff link poking out behind a jacket sleeve.\u201dDeakin & Francis goes well beyond the classic: \u201cWe have 3,000 different cuff models from classic to funky, and we also do a huge amount of customization,\u201d Mr. Deakin said. \u201cPeople can send images of their dog, boat, car, mistress \u2014 and we will create the cuff link with that image.\u201dGetting creative with cuff link design has attracted the attention of companies with varied backgrounds.Alice Walsh, the founder of the London-based accessories brand Alice Made This, became interested in making cuff links when she and her fianc\u00e9 were disappointed by the selection they found while shopping for their wedding in 2012.\u201cIt became apparent that nobody had done a new approach to cuff links, and for myself, as a product designer, it seemed like a nice introduction to my own brand into men\u2019s wear,\u201d said Ms. Walsh, who worked for many years in industrial furniture design. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find any cuffs that were clean, refined. They were status-led or branded, but we wanted to get something that showed character and added attention to detail.\u201dMs. Walsh decided to incorporate her experience in industrial design into men\u2019s jewelry. Her goal was to take what she had observed behind factory walls and turn that into sleek, simple designs.\u201cWe look at industrial processes in Britain and translate that into men\u2019s accessories,\u201d Ms. Walsh said. \u201cJust because something is manufactured doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not beautifully crafted.\u201d\u201cWe use aerospace parts,\u201d she continued, \u201cFormula One car parts and knee and hip joints, or any product that needs material that can function under extremes. These are very fascinating materials for us.\u201dIn the two years since she started her business, Ms. Walsh found that clients were drawn to the hand-crafted use of raw materials. One of her favorite examples involves rope work and a bit of British shipping history.\u201cWe developed a cuff link called the William that\u2019s a kind of old stopper knot,\u201d she said, referring to the way loose ends of rope were tied when ships came into port, mostly to prevent unraveling. \u201cIt\u2019s where the term \u2018shipshape\u2019 was coined. Knots were beautifully tied, and therefore the boat looked beautiful when inspected in port.\u201d\u201cYou can have a beautifully tailored suit, but this adds a bit of character that is slightly more abstract,\u201d Ms. Walsh said. \u201cWith today\u2019s more buoyant economy, men are feeling the desire to invest in a bit of attention to detail. I think men are allowed to make more of an effort in the way they dress.\u201dFor a more classic, and more jeweled look, Boucheron makes a mix-and-match box of cuff links. \u201cThe Epure cuff links box comes with six interchangeable cuff links, allowing the wearer to pick a pair to match his outfit, or whatever he wishes to wear that day,\u201d said Claire Choisne, creative director at Boucheron in Paris. \u201cOne of our favorite aspects of the box is its petite size. It is perfect for men who travel frequently.\u201dThe box is crafted from leopardwood and includes six interchangeable colors of cuff links: rock crystal, lapis, malachite, onyx, leopardwood and either white or yellow gold.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeking New Tools to Address a Wage Gap", "Date": "2014-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneWhat can be done about income inequality?For all the attention devoted to the widening chasm between the very rich and the rest of American society, perhaps the most urgent question is whether the trend can realistically be turned around within, say, the next two or three decades.The answer may well be no.\u201cI am very pessimistic about the capacity of the American political system to redistribute income within a reasonable period of time,\u201d said Robert Solow, the Nobel laureate economist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in concluding comments at a seminar on inequality that drew some of the top scholars on the subject to New York last month.\u201cI simply don\u2019t think that legislation either to support the safety net or to tax high incomes stands a chance in the Congress,\u201d Mr. Solow told me in a follow-up interview last week, particularly given the likelihood that the midterm election will lead to a more conservative Senate next year. If further redistribution turns out to be politically impossible, the question is whether any better tools are available.During the Great Recession from 2007 to 2010, the market income of the poorest fifth of the population, before taxes and government transfers, fell more than 30 percent. Yet adding in taxes and all government transfer payments except health insurance, the income loss of the poor was limited to about 4 percent.\u201cSubstantial changes in tax and transfer policies during the Bush and Obama administrations have increased dramatically the resources available at the middle of the distribution and at the bottom more so,\u201d Professor Burkhauser told me.President Obama has certainly tried to redistribute more. In a deal with Republicans in Congress two years ago, he was able to increase the top tax rate on long-term capital gains and push the top rate of income tax back to 39.6 percent, where it was when President Bill Clinton left office in 2001.After all this redistribution, however, the question remains: Is any of this enough to make a noticeable impact on the income gap? The answer still seems to be no.According to the Tax Policy Center, federal taxes in 2014 will trim the one-percenters\u2019 share of national income to 14.1 percent, from 17.1 percent. That\u2019s only slightly more than in 2008, when taxes reduced their slice of the national pie to 13.6 percent, from 15.5 percent.And the underlying tide is so powerful that redistribution efforts can only slow the trend. By 2024, at the end of the Policy Center\u2019s forecast window, it expects the richest 1 percent of Americans to take 19.7 percent of income before federal taxes. Under current law, taxes would trim that to 16.6 percent.Reducing inequity is hard. Last year the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office took a look at the history of government efforts to temper rising income inequality over the last three decades. It didn\u2019t find much improvement.In 1979, government taxes and transfers shrank the Gini index, a measure of income inequality, to 0.358 from 0.476 \u2014 about the same as cutting inequality to the level prevalent in a more egalitarian European nation like Spain from the level prevalent today in a highly unequal Latin American country like Chile.American inequality has increased significantly over the intervening decades. But the government does roughly the same job today. In 2010 taxes and transfers reduced the Gini measure to 0.434 from 0.586.Are we condemned, then, to largely futile efforts to reverse the widening gap?Many economists argue that there are better tools than government redistribution to mitigate rising inequality. Education is a favorite. Raising the minimum wage is also a popular choice. Reducing tax benefits for corporations and well-to-do Americans (tax breaks for oil companies or the mortgage interest deduction, for example) might also help.Thomas Piketty, who prompted the current inequality fever when he published the English translation of his blockbuster \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century\u201d in March, still holds hope that redistribution could save the day.\u201cThings can change faster than expected,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe U.S. invented sharply progressive taxation of income and inherited wealth in the interwar period, and nobody would have guessed this around 1910.\u201dBut maybe we should think about inequality in a different way. If redistribution via taxes and transfers cannot make more of a dent in the prevailing pattern of income inequality, perhaps a focus on what determines market incomes, before taxes and transfers kick in, would prove more promising.\u201cWe need to think of ways to change the market determination of income,\u201d Professor Solow told me. \u201cHow does capitalism generate inequality?\u201dTo the extent that widening inequality is caused by the yawning gap between the epicurean pay deals in the executive suite and the stagnant wages paid to those on the shop floor, it might best be addressed at the level of the corporation, not by government.Voters seem to agree. Research by Leslie McCall of Northwestern University finds that while American voters remain lukewarm about government interventions to reduce income inequality, they say corporations themselves could do more to attack the income gap.Among Republicans, 36 percent say major companies are most responsible for narrowing the income gap, Professor McCall found, compared with 23 percent who say it is the responsibility of poor Americans to improve their own lot and 12 percent who say it is the government\u2019s job.To Professor Solow, that means \u201cwe have a better shot at doing something with changes in corporate governance than with direct redistribution.\u201dIt\u2019s worth trying. Redistribution hasn\u2019t made much difference.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nancy H. Teeters, First Woman on Federal Reserve Board, Dies at 84", "Date": "2014-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNancy H. Teeters, a liberal economist who was the first woman appointed to the Federal Reserve Board and who broke with tradition by openly criticizing decisions of fellow board members that she felt hurt consumers and working people, died on Nov. 17 in Stamford, Conn. She was 84.Her daughter, Ann Teeters Johnson, said the cause was complications of a series of strokes.Mrs. Teeters was a former economics adviser to President John F. Kennedy and the chief economist for the House Budget Committee when President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the Fed\u2019s seven-member Board of Governors in 1978.Her tenure, which ended in 1984, coincided with a period of economic volatility during which the Fed sought to combat a stubborn bout of inflation, generated by high oil prices and deficit spending, by tightening the money supply.While she agreed with the need to control inflation, which approached 14 percent in 1980, Mrs. Teeters criticized the Federal Reserve chairman, Paul A. Volcker, and the board\u2019s majority for squeezing the money supply too tightly. By sending the prime rate to a record high of 21.5 percent in 1981, she warned, the Fed risked pushing the economy into a recession and leaving millions of people out of work.Her analysis proved correct. But her dissent, first in internal meetings, then in public statements, did not succeed in changing the Fed\u2019s inflation policy.Mrs. Teeters raised other issues as well. She was outspoken in her opposition to the spate of mergers and acquisitions, beginning in the early 1980s, which created the current system of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d superbanks.When the Fed gave banks the right to raise credit card fees and interest rates without notice \u2014 only weeks after rejecting a measure that would have banned prepayment penalties for consumers \u2014 she accused the board of declaring, in effect, that \u201cconsumer issues are not big issues.\u201dSome saw her public statements, while restrained, as violating the clubby traditions of a panel that had made institutional harmony \u2014 or at least the appearance of it \u2014 its cornerstone since 1913, when the Federal Reserve Board of Governors was established by Congress to maintain the stability of the nation\u2019s financial system.In private, Mrs. Teeters was less restrained. \u201cI told them, \u2018You are pulling the financial fabric of this country so tight that it\u2019s going to rip,\u2019 \u201d she said in interview for the journalist William Greider\u2019s book \u201cSecrets of the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country,\u201d published in 1987.

Her father was an unsuccessful oil speculator who had returned to his hometown in Indiana in the late 1920s to work as a paper box salesman. Her mother, a homemaker, tried to discourage Nancy, her only daughter and a top student, from attending college.With her father\u2019s support, she went to college anyway, graduating from Oberlin in 1952. After marrying a fellow student, Robert D. Teeters, they both went to the University of Michigan to pursue graduate studies \u2014 he in biology, she in economics. She earned a master\u2019s degree in economics in 1954 and continued her studies at Michigan until 1957, when the Teeterses moved to Washington, where they both had secured jobs. Mr. Teeters worked at the Interior Department.Mrs. Teeter was hired by the research and statistics division of the Federal Reserve. She rose to staff economist, took a leave of absence from 1962 to 1963 to serve on President Kennedy\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, then returned to the Fed. In 1966, she went to work in the White House Bureau of the Budget, the forerunner of the Office of Management and Budget, under President Lyndon B. Johnson.Mrs. Teeter was a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution from 1970 to 1973. From 1974 until she joined the Federal Reserve board, she was the assistant staff director and chief economist for the House Budget Committee. After leaving the board, she was director of economics for IBM, forecasting business trends.Besides her daughter, Ann, Mrs. Teeters is survived by her sons, James and John; six grandchildren; and a brother, James Hays. Her husband died in 2008.When Mrs. Teeters attended a luncheon for current and past governors of the Federal Reserve in 2013 to commemorate the board\u2019s 100th anniversary, she sat at a table with seven other women who had served since she left, including Janet L. Yellen, who was awaiting Senate confirmation to become the first Fed chairwoman. The room buzzed with excitement and all eyes seemed to be on the women\u2019s table, Mrs. Teeters\u2019s daughter said, citing her mother\u2019s account.Mrs. Teeters, she added, liked telling friends and family afterward, \u201cIt was the first time I\u2019ve been seated at a women\u2019s-only table and been the envy of the room.\u201dAn obituary on Wednesday about Nancy H. Teeters, the first woman appointed to the Federal Reserve Board, misspelled the name of the city in Indiana where she was born. It is Marion, not Marian.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will the LeBron James Stimulus Be Good for Cleveland?", "Date": "2014-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyWhen LeBron James announced his return to the Cleveland Cavaliers in July, fans celebrated by hanging banners, getting drunk and digging old jerseys out of purgatory. They ran into the streets, honked horns and hugged strangers. And some of them started trying to figure out just how much money was about to rain down on Cleveland. According to one estimate, the return of the \u201cking,\u201d as James is known, will add $500 million a year to the city\u2019s economy. \u201cWhen people say this is just about an athlete making money, there\u2019s more to it than that,\u201d said Edward FitzGerald, the Cuyahoga County executive, at a news conference devoted to the anticipated windfall. \u201cOther people will make a living.\u201dJames is certainly a good investment for the Cavaliers, who will probably cover his $20.6 million salary just from increased ticket sales. The last season James played in Cleveland, after all, the Cavs sold every available regular-season seat at an average price of $55.95, earning about $47 million. Last season, the Cavaliers sold just 84 percent at an average price of just $43.31, for a decline of $16 million. This year, season tickets sold out the day James announced his return, and demand is so overwhelming that the team is raffling the remaining single-game tickets so that everyone in Cleveland has a fair chance. Everything else is gravy: playoff games, sponsorships, jersey sales and the team\u2019s local broadcast rights, serendipitously scheduled for renegotiation at the end of next season.What FitzGerald and some other Cleveland boosters envision, though, is a LeBron stimulus that enriches the city as a whole. Start, for example, with the restaurants along East Fourth Street, near the arena, whose business dropped significantly after James bolted for Miami. Scalpers are happy, too, and owners of nearby stores that sell T-shirts and jewelry also expect sales to pick up. To get that $500 million estimate, LeRoy Brooks, an emeritus professor of finance at John Carroll University, just outside Cleveland, assumed that all these people making more money will spend it in Cleveland, multiplying the James effect. Brooks told me he now thinks James will add between $163 million and $426 million to the regional economy. He said that he made the first estimate in haste, \u201con the day after my first grandson was born.\u201d FitzGerald\u2019s staff estimated a more modest bounce. The LeBron stimulus, they concluded, could reach $285 million, including the creation of about 550 new jobs.But James is not an entrepreneur: He\u2019s a wage-earning entertainer who manufactures jump shots and no-look passes. And there is a limit to how much difference one more union member can make. Last year, the Cleveland area\u2019s economic output was about $123 billion. By the most generous estimates, the return of James would expand output by less than one half of 1 percent. The biggest economic engine in postindustrial Cleveland is probably the Cleveland Clinic, a sprawling treatment and research center that estimates its own annual impact at about $10.5 billion, or 8 percent of the regional total. So the best case is that the return of James has about the same effect as a modest hospital expansion.Moreover, other experts regard these estimates as wildly inflated. Victor Matheson, an economist at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts, calls it \u201cthe worst economic-impact estimate ever,\u201d because most of the projected spending is just dollars sloshing around northeast Ohio. What\u2019s good for downtown Cleveland, in other words, is bad for the suburbs. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to result in a redistribution of entertainment spending from other activities to the Cavs,\u201d said Edward W. Hill, dean of the Levin College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University. \u201cMy wife is now beating me on top of the head to make sure that I get our tickets, which will mean one less dinner together at a restaurant as we go to the Cavs instead.\u201d It\u2019s also worth noting that Cleveland is paying for the right to host James. Cuyahoga County borrowed $120 million in the early 1990s to build the team\u2019s arena, and it still owes more than half that sum. Earlier this year, voters approved extending a tax that is projected to raise $260 million for the city\u2019s three stadiums. Any benefits of James\u2019s return are, in effect, a return on that investment.But Hill does see a more intangible benefit. Nike paid James roughly $13 million a year to endorse its products during his first stint in Cleveland. He has since signed a new deal that is said to be even more lucrative. Now James is effectively endorsing Cleveland too. People looking for basketball shoes may be more likely to value his endorsement than people looking for a place to live or to locate their businesses, but every little bit helps. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the best public relations for Cleveland since World War II,\u201d FitzGerald told a local radio station a few days after James announced his return. On a recent trip to Guangzhou, China, Hill said he saw a man in a park, dressed in a James jersey with \u201cCleveland\u201d emblazoned across the front. \u201cFor a midsize metropolitan area, the fact that you are affiliated with a global brand gives you name recognition that cuts across the clutter,\u201d he said.The return of James, which was announced just a week after the news that the 2016 Republican National Convention will take place in Cleveland, could also change the way residents think about their city. And economically speaking, mood matters. John Maynard Keynes regarded \u201canimal spirits\u201d as a primary motor of growth. When people are feeling good, they are more likely to take risks and make investments. Officials hope the excitement will stoke continued residential development in the gaptoothed downtown, where the population has roughly doubled since 2000. \u201cI want kids in Northeast Ohio . . . to realize that there\u2019s no better place to grow up,\u201d James wrote when announcing his decision in Sports Illustrated. \u201cMaybe some of them will come home after college and start a family or open a business.\u201dCleveland, in some sense, is hoping to follow the paradigm of Manchester, England, another downtrodden factory town that is now best known for its soccer teams. Manchester United sells 30 percent of its tickets to people from outside the region and, seeking to capitalize on the tourism, the city opened a national soccer museum in 2012. The region\u2019s economic-development brochures often feature an image of Old Trafford, United\u2019s stadium, and economic-development officials sometimes follow the team on road trips. This kind of glamour by association is an easy way to start a conversation, although a recent economic study of the city cautioned that it can only take that conversation so far. \u201cWhenever it comes down to the actual completion of a deal, it is the competitiveness of the offering that matters,\u201d it said.But there\u2019s an important difference between hosting the world\u2019s most famous soccer team and the world\u2019s most famous basketball player. Franchises stick around, but kings do not rule forever. Cleveland has just a few years to capitalize.Binyamin Appelbaum is an economics reporter\nfor The Times.Advertisement"}

There\u2019s nothing worse.Britten was inspired to write the work when he saw a Noh play during a visit to Japan in 1956. He was deeply impressed by the simplicity of the story, in which the mother was a Japanese noblewoman, as well as by the economy of style. True to Noh tradition, the play was performed by an all-male cast, the actor portraying the mother in a mask.Britten worked with the poet William Plomer to develop an English version of the Noh play. \u201cCurlew River\u201d takes place in a church by a river in the Fenlands of England during medieval times. An abbot and a procession of monks enter, singing a chant-like hymn. Then, led by the Abbot, they present the story of the bereaved mother to the congregation. The Madwoman has come to the banks of the river to ask a ferryman to take her across so she can continue her desperate search.In her production, Ms. Jones dispenses with masks and includes atmospheric, simple video images, which she designed, along with the costumes. The story is enacted on a platform. On one side, we see the sails and benches of the boat. There is a trace of smoke in the air, suggesting river mists but also chapel incense. Britten was fascinated by Japanese instruments, and hints of Japanese musical style are in this spare-textured score. Still, in its overall musical character, \u201cCurlew River\u201d is like a modern-day medieval liturgical drama. Often, just stray solo lines for horn, flute or viola will interact with the voices. During choral scenes, the music breaks into passages with repetitive percussion riffs and rippling harp arpeggios. Whole stretches are accompanied mostly by strange, sustained organ harmonies.During the crossing, the Ferryman explains that on the other side of the river, this is a day of sad commemoration. A year ago, a young boy was left to die by a brutish man. The people of the village regard the dead boy as a saint. Hearing this story, the Madwoman realizes that this boy was her son. Swaying with dread, Mr. Bostridge\u2019s Madwoman compulsively retied the laces of her son\u2019s shoes, which she carries with her, along with a shirt and a red streamer on a stick, the boy\u2019s toy. In a climactic scene, the Spirit of the Boy, played by Ian Osborne, a boy treble from the St. Thomas Choir School in New York, appears, looking bruised and raggedy, yet angelic. He sings to his mother, telling her they will one day meet in heaven.As performed by Mr. Bostridge in this grimly powerful production, the woman\u2019s peace of mind comes because finally she knows what has happened to him. Now she can grieve without false hope and await her death. \u201cCurlew River\u201d runs through Saturday at Synod House, the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights; 212-721-6500, whitelightfestival.org.

{"Headline": "Borrowers, Beware: The Robo-Signers Aren\u2019t Finished Yet", "Date": "2014-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameRemember the robo-signers, those mortgage loan automatons who authenticated thousands of foreclosure documents over the years without verifying the information they were swearing to?Well, they\u2019re back, in a manner of speaking, at least in Florida. Their dubious documents are being used to hound former borrowers years after their homes went into foreclosure.Robo-signer redux, as it might be called, has come about because of an aggressive pursuit of former borrowers by debt collectors hired by Fannie Mae, the mortgage finance giant. What Fannie is trying to recoup from these borrowers is the difference between what the borrowers owed on the mortgages when they were foreclosed and the amount Fannie received when it resold the properties.These monetary amounts \u2014 and they can be significant \u2014 are known as deficiency judgments. It is legal in most states for lenders to pursue them. (California is one notable exception.) The time limit for debt collectors to go after former borrowers varies from state to state; Florida allows deficiencies to be pursued for 20 years, and borrowers must pay a compounded annual interest rate of 4.5 percent.The problem, experts say, arises when robo-signed documents enabled banks to foreclose even when they didn\u2019t have legal standing to do so.\u201cSending these cases to debt collectors when the underlying foreclosures involved unlawful robo-signing is unfair and potentially even deceptive,\u201d said Kathleen C. Engel, a research professor at Suffolk University Law School in Boston. \u201cFannie Mae is not entitled to collect on those debts when the foreclosure was unlawful.\u201dA Fannie Mae spokesman, Andrew J. Wilson, declined to comment on Ms. Engel\u2019s contention. But he said Fannie filed deficiencies \u201cin a minority of cases where there was a foreclosure.\u201d He acknowledged, however, that Fannie was bringing several thousand cases in Florida because of a recent state law requiring that any such borrower suits be filed by July 1 of this year.\u201cWe do so in instances where we determine the borrower had the ability to pay but chose not to,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. When asked how the company determined a person\u2019s ability to pay, he declined to disclose the method.Fannie Mae is certainly justified in going after deficiencies from former borrowers, especially those who can pay. And given that the company is taxpayer-owned, its attempts to recover this money are to the greater good.But as Ms. Engel noted, Fannie\u2019s position loses some ground when the deficiencies it\u2019s pursuing are based on documents filed by known robo-signers. And it turns out that there are quite a few of those.Before a bank can foreclose on a borrower, it must prove that it has the right to do so. The lender must produce documentation, for example, showing that it holds the note underlying the mortgage.But this paperwork was often missing or inaccurate. Faced with mounting foreclosures in 2009 and onward, law firms representing the banks set up assembly lines to create new documents giving them the right to foreclose.During the summer of 2010, when Bill McCollum was Florida\u2019s attorney general, he told me he was concerned about the dangers posed by judges who accepted as factual what was put forward in foreclosure documents. \u201cThousands of final judgments of foreclosure against Florida homeowners may have been the result of the allegedly improper actions of these law firms,\u201d he said.If Dyck-O\u2019Neal pursues borrowers knowing that robo-signing might have tainted a foreclosure, it could run afoul of state laws barring unfair or deceptive acts or practices, said Ms. Engel, an expert in foreclosure law.\u201cThese entities often go into lower-level trial courts and file brief complaints without adequately documenting the basis for the claims,\u201d Ms. Engel said. \u201cNinety-five percent of borrowers don\u2019t even show up \u2014 they think they don\u2019t have a defense, or they\u2019re scared or can\u2019t afford a lawyer. As long as judges don\u2019t question the claims, the debt collectors win.\u201dWhile Fannie contends that it goes after only former borrowers with the resources to repay their debts, it\u2019s not clear that the people being targeted for deficiencies can pay them back.Ed Lawrence, an electrician in Queens, moved to Brevard County, Fla., to start a new business in 2007 but was not as successful as he had hoped. He fell behind on his mortgage, and his home went into foreclosure. Among the papers is an assignment of mortgage signed by Ms. Samons.His deficiency judgment is $92,466. \u201cIt is beyond my comprehension how I am supposed to pay this,\u201d Mr. Lawrence said in an interview last week. \u201cI\u2019m 60 and basically living hand-to-mouth.\u201dMr. Lawrence is not an anomaly among Mr. Parker\u2019s clients, the lawyer said. Most of the people he represents went into foreclosure as a result of divorce, illness or the shattered economy.The lead plaintiff in the class action is a former borrower who was sued in Florida but who lives in St. Louis.\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that Fannie Mae and their collectors are pursuing consumers many years after they\u2019ve lost their homes,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cBut the fact that these lawsuits may be built on a foundation of foreclosure fraud is galling.\u201dAmazing, isn\u2019t it, how the effects of the foreclosure crisis go on and on?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Fears for China Economy, Xi Says", "Date": "2014-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 President Xi Jinping told a gathering of Asia-Pacific business executives Sunday not to worry about the Chinese economy, saying there were risks but not so many as to lose sleep over.\u201cSome worry whether China\u2019s growth rate will slow down further, or whether China can overcome the obstacles \u2014 risks are indeed there, but they\u2019re not that scary,\u201d Mr. Xi said at the C.E.O. Summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting.Mr. Xi described a lower growth rate as the \u201cnew normal,\u201d saying that annual growth above 7 percent still placed China among the world\u2019s top-performing countries in speed and size. China\u2019s economy is forecast to grow at a rate of 7.5 percent this year, the weakest pace since 1990.Projecting confidence about China\u2019s influence beyond its borders, Mr. Xi said he wanted to create \u201can Asia-Pacific dream for our people,\u201d an idea that dovetailed with Beijing\u2019s push at the APEC summit for a new free-trade area for the Asia-Pacific that aimed to simplify rules under the more than 70 trade pacts in the region.As the host of the APEC summit this year, China wanted the trade and foreign ministers to agree to a feasibility study for the new regional free-trade area that would represent a signature project introduced by China at the summit.The United States Trade Representative, Michael Froman, described the idea of a Chinese proposal for a free trade area in the entire Asia Pacific area as far off compared with the immediacy of the Trans Pacific Partnership, which Washington has been negotiating with 11 countries. \u201cIt\u2019s a reaffirmation of a long-term aspiration for the region that\u2019s to be achieved through other ongoing negotiations,\u201d Mr. Froman said to reporters at the Beijing Convention Center. In the lead up to the summit, the Obama administration objected to such a study, saying it would interfere with the completion of the United States-led Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact that Washington sees as the centerpiece of its Asia policy.On Saturday, the APEC trade and foreign ministers agreed to a compromise: Over the next two years, APEC would conduct a \u201ccollective strategic study\u201d for a free-trade area in the Asia-Pacific region. Also, they said there would be no target date for the completion of the area.\u201cThe Chinese wanted to sound ambitious and said \u2018let\u2019s launch a feasibility study, and we can reach this thing by 2025,\u201d\u2019 said a senior Obama administration official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. \u201cThis would be their key initiative to bring order to the 75 trade pacts in the region.\u201dThe Obama administration, which has been working on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact that does not include China, did not want any distraction from completing the partnership, the official said. Moreover, China\u2019s idea of a regional free-trade area would have lower standards on such items as intellectual property than the Trans- Pacific plan, the official said.\u201cThe United States does not want disruption to the T.P.P.,\u201d the official said.In the face of a rising China, the Trans-Pacific Partnership has been promoted by the administration since 2009 as the centerpiece of its effort to show strength in Asia. Any hopes to complete the negotiations for the partnership, which covers environmental and labor standards, by the initial goal of the end of this year were abandoned.The United States trade representative, Michael Froman, met with trade ministers involved in negotiations for the Trans-Pacific plan on Saturday in Beijing.There was \u201csignificant progress\u201d and a \u201clot of momentum\u201d toward a conclusion of the pact, Mr. Froman said Sunday.The biggest sticking point remained Japan\u2019s heavily protected agricultural sector, which Prime Minister Shinzo Abe promised the Obama administration would be opened up under terms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201cWe\u2019ve made progress, but we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d Mr. Froman said.President Obama, due to arrive in Beijing on Monday for the APEC summit, is set to meet with the leaders of the 11 other countries involved in the partnership.  Mr. Obama, who visited Japan last spring, is not expected to meet separately with Mr. Abe, whose main goal at the summit is to meet with President Xi. The meeting between the Chinese and Japanese leaders, which is likely to take place Monday, would be a first step toward repairing the Cold War-style standoff between China and Japan since the two leaders came to power. Despite the drawn out negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the administration got a shot in the arm for completion of the pact last week when Republicans on Capitol Hill said they would vote to approve Trade Promotion Authority legislation. Such authority eases approval of complicated trade deals by stipulating that lawmakers cannot make changes to a trade pact once it has been signed by the participants. \u201cThe next time the president calls on Congress to approve Trade Promotion Authority legislation, he\u2019ll hear a resounding \u2018yes\u2019 from the new majority party,\u201d said Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming.In another effort to showcase its economic heft during APEC, China announced Saturday that it would contribute $40 billion to a Silk Road fund designed to finance infrastructure linking China to Central and South Asia, the Middle East and Europe. The projects would include railways and roads covering territory that centuries ago linked traders in China to the Mediterranean, said Xinhua, the state-run news agency. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World Is Fast", "Date": "2014-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe\u2019ve just had a nonsense midterm election. Never has more money been spent to think so little about a future so in flux. What would we have discussed if we\u2019d had a serious election? How about the biggest challenge we\u2019re facing today: The resilience of our workers, environment and institutions.Moore\u2019s Law, the theory that the speed and power of microchips will double every two years, is, as Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson posit in their book, \u201cThe Second Machine Age,\u201d so relentlessly increasing the power of software, computers and robots that they\u2019re now replacing many more traditional white- and blue-collar jobs, while spinning off new ones \u2014 all of which require more skills. And the rapid growth of carbon in our atmosphere and environmental degradation and deforestation because of population growth on earth \u2014 the only home we have \u2014 are destabilizing Mother Nature\u2019s ecosystems faster. In sum, we\u2019re in the middle of three \u201cclimate changes\u201d at once: one digital, one ecological, one geo-economical. That\u2019s why strong states are being stressed, weak ones are blowing up and Americans are feeling anxious that no one has a quick fix to ease their anxiety. And they\u2019re right. The only fix involves big, hard things that can only be built together over time: resilient infrastructure, affordable health care, more start-ups and lifelong learning opportunities for new jobs, immigration policies that attract talent, sustainable environments, manageable debt and governing institutions adapted to the new speed. Say what? S\u00e3o Paulo is running out of water? Yes.Jos\u00e9 Maria Cardoso da Silva, a Brazilian and senior adviser at Conservation International, explains: The drought hit a landscape that had been stripped of 80 percent of the natural forest along the Serra da Cantareira watersheds that feed six artificial reservoirs sustaining S\u00e3o Paulo. The Cantareira supplies nearly half of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s water. The forests and wetlands have been replaced by farmfields, pastures and eucalyptus plantations. So today the pipes and reservoirs that gather the water are still in place, but the natural infrastructure of forests and watersheds has been badly degraded. The drought exposed it all.\u201cNatural forests act like giant sponges soaking up rain and gradually releasing it into streams,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also protect watercourses and maintain water quality by reducing sediment and filtering pollutants. The forest loss in Cantareira increased erosion, caused the decline in water quality, and changed seasonal water flows, reducing the resilience of the entire system against climatic extreme events.\u201d The Cantareira system has fallen below 12 percent of capacity. Sadly, deforestation increased under Brazil\u2019s newly re-elected president, Dilma Rousseff, but this was also barely an issue in Brazil\u2019s election. Yet Reuters quoted Antonio Nobre, a leading climate scientist at Brazil\u2019s National Space Research Institute, arguing that \u201cglobal warming and the deforestation of the Amazon are altering the climate in the region by drastically reducing the release of billions of liters of water by rainforest trees. \u2018Humidity that comes from the Amazon in the form of vapor clouds \u2014 what we call \u2018flying rivers\u2019 \u2014 has dropped dramatically, contributing to this devastating situation we are living today,\u2019 \u201d Nobre said.Paul Gilding, the Australian environmentalist and author of \u201cThe Great Disruption,\u201d emailed from Brazil to say that the lack of a serious Brazilian response \u201creinforces to me that we\u2019re not going to respond to the big global issues until they hit the economy. It\u2019s hard to imagine a stronger example than a city of 20 million people running out of water. Yet despite the clear threat, the main response is \u2018we hope it rains.\u2019 Why such denial? Because the implications of acceptance are so significant, and we know in our hearts there\u2019s no going back once you end denial. It would demand that the country face up to the urgency of reversing rather than slowing deforestation\u201d and \u201cthe need to prepare the country for the risks that a changing climate presents.\u201dWhen changes in the market, Mother Nature and Moore\u2019s Law all get this fast, opportunities and stresses abound. One day, we\u2019ll have an election about how we cushion, exploit and adapt to them \u2014 an election to make America and Americans more resilient. One day. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Legacy of Fear", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the biggest surprise is how badly most of the post-communist nations have done since. There was a general expectation back then that most of these countries would step out from tyranny and rejoin the European club of prosperous nations. Most of us did not appreciate the corrosive power of distrust, and how long it would take to heal the mental scars caused by it.In the bottom group are basket-case nations that haven\u2019t even recovered the level of real income they had in 1990, as measured by real G.D.P. per capita. These failures include Ukraine, Georgia, Bosnia, Serbia and others \u2014 about 20 percent of the post-communist world. \u201cBasically,\u201d Milanovic writes, these \u201care countries with at least three to four wasted generations. At current rates of growth, it might take them some 50 or 60 years \u2014 longer than they were under communism! \u2014 to go back to the income levels they had at the fall of communism.\u201dThe next group includes those nations that are merely moderate failures, with per capita economic growth rates under 1.7 percent a year. These are nations like Russia and Hungary that continue to fall steadily behind the West \u2014 about 40 percent of the post-communist world by population.The third group includes those with growth rates between 1.7 percent and 1.9 percent. These countries, like the Czech Republic and Slovenia, are holding steady with the capitalist world.Finally there are the successes, the nations that are catching up. This group includes Poland, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. But Milanovic points out that many of these nations are growing simply because they have oil, or something valuable to dig out of the ground. There are only five countries that have emerged as successful capitalist economies: Albania, Poland, Belarus, Armenia and Estonia.To put it another way, only 10 percent of the people living in post-communist nations are living in a place that successfully made the transition to capitalism. Ninety percent are living under failed transitions of one sort or another. This fact is already yielding screwed up politics in places like Hungary and Russia and will shape the 21st century.Why did some countries succeed while others failed?First, leaders in some countries simply made better political decisions. Most of these countries enacted economic reforms, like deregulating prices and privatizing nationalized companies. Some nations like Estonia and Poland enacted reforms radically and quickly, while others tried to do them gradually or barely at all \u2014 with expensive security blankets for protected interests. The quick and radical group saw a slightly bigger output drop over the near term but much more prosperity over the long run.Then there is the level of institutions. Many Western advisers focused on the headline reforms \u2014 writing new constitutions and creating stock markets. But Larry Lawson, an economist who worked with the Poles and Ukrainians, points out that these nations lacked the basic building blocks we take for granted. Before you have a stock market, for example, you have to have publicly available data about companies, credit records and accounting systems.Finally, and most important, there is the level of values. A nation\u2019s economy is nestled in its moral ecology. Economic performance is tied to history, culture and psychology.Poland, for example, had been invaded throughout its history, yielding a pragmatic, survivor ethos. The Poles had a keen desire to initiate reforms on their own. Poles also had a clear sense of justice and injustice, since they had seen the Russians do things the wrong way on their own territory. They placed a high value on education and social mobility.Other countries lacked this cultural brew. Worse, life was marked by fear, by arbitrary power, by suspicion that people are watching you, by distrust. People raised in this atmosphere of distrust have trouble forming companies and associations. They are more likely to be driven by a grab-what-you-can logic \u2014 a culture of corruption and appropriation. They are more likely to hunker down and become risk averse.Many of the ailing countries are marked by distant power relationships. Those with power \u2014 even in an office or neighborhood \u2014 are aloof and domineering. Those without power hanker for security at all costs. They\u2019re nostalgic for the imagined stability of communism. When everything seems arbitrary and crooked, people tolerate strongman rule.The lesson of the past 25 years is that democratic prosperity is built on layers of small achievements 10,000 fathoms deep. Communism ripped at all that bottom-up society-making and damaged the psyches of its victims. Healing from those wounds is gradual. Progress is not guaranteed.Joe Nocera is off today. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Draghi Sounds Hopeful Note on Europe\u2019s Economy, but Reassures That E.C.B. Is Ready to Act", "Date": "2014-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The president of the European Central Bank on Monday gave a slightly more optimistic assessment of the eurozone\u2019s economy, saying that a decline in bank lending appears to have reversed and pointing out that the economies in most countries in the region are growing.\u201cWe have a certain amount of confidence that the credit cycle is now turning for the better,\u201d Mario Draghi, the E.C.B. president, told members of the European Parliament in Brussels.A lack of bank credit for businesses has been one of the fundamental problems in the eurozone, so a turnaround would be good news for the region\u2019s economy. That is particularly true in countries like Italy, where companies are especially dependent on banks, as opposed to capital markets, to finance expansion and hiring.Mr. Draghi acknowledged that economic performance was still \u201cdismal\u201d and that unemployment was unacceptably high. He repeated that the bank would be prepared to buy government bonds in order to stimulate the economy if the measures it had taken so far did not prove to be effective enough.\u201cOur expectation for a moderate recovery in 2015 and 2016 remains in place,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.His statement, though incrementally more upbeat, was consistent with others he has made in recent months, in which he has left the door open to the same \u201cquantitative easing\u201d used by the Federal Reserve in the United States and other central banks to stimulate their economies.The European Central Bank has been edging closer to large-scale purchases of government bonds, which are seen as an essential component of quantitative easing. But the bank also seems to hope that this controversial step will not be necessary.Mr. Draghi said he thought that previous measures by the bank were beginning to show results, including low interest rates and a program that grants loans to banks on very favorable terms, if they in turn lend the money to businesses and individuals.The central bank is already buying private-sector assets, but the amounts are seen as too small to have a major impact on the economy, at least so far. On Monday, the bank said that it had bought about 3.1 billion euros, or $3.9 billion, in covered bonds last week. Covered bonds typically are real estate loans packaged as debt and guaranteed by the issuing banks.In a separate speech, a European Central Bank official said that the bank could also buy gold, stocks or other securities traded on exchanges.But the official, Yves Mersch, a member of the bank's six-member executive board, listed numerous reasons why quantitative easing, and in particular large-scale purchases of government bonds, might not work as well in Europe as it did in the United States.The Federal Reserve \u201coperates in a completely different environment than the E.C.B.,\u201d Mr. Mersch said at a banking conference in Frankfurt.Bond purchases aimed at pushing down long-term interest rates would have less effect in Europe, Mr. Mersch said, because most credit flows through banks rather than capital markets.He also expressed concern that if some governments defaulted on debt purchased by the bank, it would face a conflict between printing money to cover the losses and keeping inflation under control.Mr. Mersch acknowledged that quantitative easing could have a positive psychological effect on markets. But he said he was concerned that government bond purchases by the bank would effectively make eurozone taxpayers liable for each country\u2019s debt, without the approval of elected officials. National governments in the eurozone are ultimately liable for any losses suffered by the bank.\u201cIt is questionable to what extent it would be justifiable to communalize credit risks,\u201d Mr. Mersch said.He noted that many of the calls for the E.C.B. to begin quantitative easing come from the United States and Britain.Mr. Mersch said he wished \u201cthat these well-meaning suggestions were based on thorough understanding of the institutional and legal limits of the E.C.B. as well as the economical particularities of the euro area.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Fines Automakers Hyundai and Kia for Misstating Mileage", "Date": "2014-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis type of conduct quite simply will not be tolerated,\u201d Mr. Holder said at a joint news conference at the Justice Department with Ms. McCarthy. The Justice Department, he added, \u201cwill never rest or waver in our determination to take action against any company that engages in such activities.\u201dThe settlement also signaled that the Obama administration intended to aggressively enforce new climate-change regulations. \u201cBusinesses that play by the rules shouldn\u2019t have to compete with those breaking the law,\u201d Ms. McCarthy said.Under the agreement, the automakers will pay $100 million in fines and forfeit an estimated $200 million in greenhouse-gas emissions credits, which auto companies earn by building vehicles with lower emissions than are required by law. The E.P.A. said the fuel efficiency standards reported by Hyundai and Kia were off by one to six miles per gallon.For years Hyundai and Kia built their brands around the idea that their cars got better mileage than their competitors, a claim they promoted in ads that denigrated less efficient rivals.But in 2012, Hyundai and Kia, which are both owned by the Hyundai Motor Group, acknowledged that they had overstated the fuel economy of vehicles sold in the United States over the previous two years. The admission came after an E.P.A. investigation into consumer complaints that their cars were underperforming the official mileage estimates on the window stickers of new cars. Although few drivers achieve the mileage claimed on the stickers, the government requires automakers to conduct standardized tests to calculate the figures so that buyers can more easily compare the fuel efficiency of different models.\u201cHyundai has acted transparently, reimbursed affected customers and fully cooperated with the E.P.A. throughout the course of its investigation,\u201d David L. Zuchowski, president and chief executive officer of Hyundai Motor America, said in a statement. \u201cWe are pleased to put this behind us, and gratified that even with our adjusted fuel economy ratings, Hyundai continues to lead the automotive industry in fuel efficiency and environmental performance.\u201dAlthough Hyundai cars are competitive with other manufacturers on fuel economy, they do not lead the pack in any category.The settlement comes as the Obama administration has used the Clean Air Act to create and enforce new regulations aimed at reining in planet-warming pollution. In 2009, the E.P.A. released new fuel economy standards requiring automakers to aggressively increase the average fuel mileage of passenger vehicles in order to cut carbon emissions from tailpipes. President Obama has also proposed major E.P.A. regulations curbing emissions from coal-fired power plants.\u201cThis is the first enforcement action we\u2019ve seen on greenhouse gas regulations, and they came out of the gate with the largest settlement in the history of the Clean Air Act,\u201d said Roger R. Martella Jr., an E.P.A. general counsel during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cThis is the first window we\u2019ve seen into how they\u2019ll approach the enforcement of greenhouse gas regulations.\u201dMr. Holder said that by inaccurately labeling their vehicles, the auto companies allowed the additional emission of 4.75 million tons of carbon pollution \u2014 or, by the E.P.A.\u2019s calculations, the equivalent of the emissions produced by power plants generating electricity for 433,000 homes for a year.\u201cAny company that misrepresents the performance of their test vehicles risks harming human health and the environment, either by causing more pollution than the law allows, or, as happened in this case, by claiming greenhouse gas emission credits they did not earn,\u201d Mr. Holder said.Environmentalists on Monday praised the penalties on the two automakers.\u201cFor many years, E.P.A. has enforced the Clean Air Act to make sure cars are as clean as they are advertised,\u201d said Frank O\u2019Donnell, president of the group Clean Air Watch. \u201cIt is very encouraging to see that E.P.A. plans to make sure that climate-related emissions must also be as advertised.\u201dE.P.A. officials said problems with fuel economy standards in Hyundai and Kia vehicles were apparent in an audit. They concluded that the Korean automakers\u2019 testing of fuel economy technologies included procedures that led to inaccurate fuel-economy ratings for vehicles including Hyundai\u2019s Accent, Elantra, Veloster and Santa Fe vehicles and Kia\u2019s Rio and Soul vehicles.That testing was done entirely in laboratories in Korea, government officials said. As part of the settlement, the companies must build a separate, American-based center for testing vehicle fuel economy.Analysts said they expected to see more enforcement actions like the one on Monday. \u201cThe government is basically saying there\u2019s no excuse for doing something wrong when it comes to regulations, whether it\u2019s fuel economy or safety,\u201d said David E. Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. Mr. Cole said that some automakers had long \u201cplayed internal games\u201d to increase fuel-economy figures for various models and then used the inflated mileage figures in their advertising campaigns.Coral Davenport reported from Washington and Bill Vlasic from Detroit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thawing Out Lessons From the Cold War", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropePARIS \u2014 As tensions in Ukraine mount anew, veteran diplomats are starting to think quietly about a way out of the worst East-West crisis since the end of the Cold War.It may seem a poor time to imagine a revamped security architecture for Europe when a frail cease-fire in eastern Ukraine is violated daily. The United States and the European Union have imposed three waves of sanctions on Moscow over its annexation of Crimea and its support for pro-Russian separatists in southeastern Ukraine \u2014 to no avail.Yet despite President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s diatribes against the West, neither Russia nor Europe has an interest in a long-term confrontation. The current conflict has already damaged both sides\u2019 economies and could undermine stability across Eastern Europe.As a result, wise diplomats like the former German ambassador Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference, and Igor Y. Yurgens, chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Development in Moscow, who is close to Russia\u2019s prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, are scouring the diplomatic handbook for a possible exit.While Mr. Ischinger calls Russia\u2019s behavior in Ukraine unacceptable and supports sanctions, he believes that strengthening the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the intergovernmental group of 57 countries, could help Europe move beyond the crisis. In the short run, he wants an international contact group comprising Russia, the United States, the European Union and the Ukrainian government to oversee the implementation of the cease-fire accords signed in Minsk in September between Ukraine and the pro-Russian rebels.In the longer term, Mr. Ischinger said, Serbia, which will take over O.S.C.E.\u2019s chairmanship in 2015, and Germany, which will lead the organization in 2016, should work to develop a new charter on European security.Under a security plan put forth by Mr. Medvedev weeks before a brief war between Russia and Georgia in 2008, no country or alliance operating in the European-Atlantic region would be entitled to strengthen its own security to the detriment of other nations.Mr. Yurgens, who has criticized Mr. Putin\u2019s policy in Ukraine, said Mr. Medvedev\u2019s initiative deserved a more constructive response than it had received.The West brushed off the proposal at the time because it seemed a blatant attempt to give Russia a veto over decisions by the NATO alliance, such as admitting new members or deploying American missile defenses in Europe. Mr. Putin has since followed the opposite route: taking unilateral military action in Crimea and establishing a Eurasian Union, which includes Belarus and Kazakhstan, as a Russian-centered counterweight to the European Union.The struggle for Ukraine was set off by Kiev\u2019s decision to move toward Europe and not join the Eurasian Union.If some people are looking now to O.S.C.E., it is because the organization was created during the Cold War to provide a framework for limiting and channeling geopolitical competition.Created in 1975 during a pan-European summit meeting that took place in a period of d\u00e9tente in the East-West conflict, the Helsinki Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe enshrined top ground rules including sovereignty, territorial integrity and chapters on human rights and economic cooperation.It set a framework for talks that eventually led to a treaty limiting conventional armed forces in Europe, one that also included measures to build trust between nations, such as giving countries prior notice of military exercises and allowing them to send observers.When the Cold War ended, 34 nations solemnly signed the Charter of Paris for a New Europe, codifying commitments to sovereignty and territorial integrity but also democracy, human rights, the rule of law and economic liberty.\u201cWe need to create the conditions for some repeat operation of the Paris Charter of 1990,\u201d Mr. Ischinger said, noting that Mr. Putin had praised the positive role of the O.S.C.E. in the Ukraine crisis.The 1990 document pledged \u201ca new quality in our security relations while fully respecting each other\u2019s freedom of choice in that respect.\u201d That was taken in the West as an acceptance by Moscow that former Soviet bloc states were free to join NATO and the European Union if they chose.After 12 central European states joined NATO, though, Mr. Putin sought to draw a red line against any further eastward expansion of the alliance to include Ukraine or Georgia. Russian diplomats have praised the example of Finland, which remained neutral and friendly toward Moscow in security terms while pursuing economic integration into Europe.In Western eyes, Moscow\u2019s military seizure of Crimea was a flagrant breach of O.S.C.E. principles. In Moscow\u2019s view, moving into Crimea was about protecting the overwhelmingly ethnic Russian population. It was to prevent its Crimean naval base of Sevastopol from falling into NATO\u2019s hands.The Ukraine conflict has reminded governments of the utility of O.S.C.E., the only security forum connecting all European and North American states. At best, it serves to build bridges and save face. At worst, it is a talking shop that is paralyzed by having to make decisions with the agreement of all 57 members. It performs tasks like observing elections and monitoring cease-fires, but Moscow has barred O.S.C.E. observers from Crimea.How a revised European security charter could stabilize the countries between Russia and NATO is unclear. Many Western officials privately say Crimea is lost, though their governments will not accept that officially.The West is unlikely to formally renounce letting Ukraine and Georgia into NATO one day if those countries meet the criteria and want to join. But many Western officials now acknowledge that this day will be far off, if ever.Mr. Ischinger, who served for more than a decade with Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German foreign minister who was a tireless promoter of O.S.C.E. over deep American suspicions, said there was a precedent for dealing with such problems.\u201cThe Helsinki Final Act didn\u2019t settle the final status of Germany or the Baltic states,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it did spell out that they couldn\u2019t be settled by force.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Demise of the White Democratic Voter", "Date": "2014-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is an ongoing debate among politicians, political scientists and partisans of both parties over the dismal support of Democratic candidates among whites. Does it result from ideological differences, racial animosity or a perception among many whites that they are excluded from a coalition of minorities, the poor, single women of all races, gays and other previously marginalized constituencies?Arguably, the poor Democratic showing among whites does not represent naked race prejudice, as Obama\u2019s election and re-election attest. But it can be seen as a reflection of substantial material interests that affect the very voters who carry greater weight in low turnout midterm Congressional elections.Asked whether the Affordable Care Act would make things better or worse for the country at large, 60 percent of whites said worse and 35 percent of whites said better.It\u2019s not hard to see, then, why a majority of white midterm voters withheld support from Democrats and cast their votes for Republicans.Republicans are not satisfied with winning 62 percent of the white vote. To counter the demographic growth of Democratic constituencies whose votes threaten Republican success in high-turnout presidential elections, Republicans have begun a concerted effort to rupture the partisan loyalty of the remaining white Democratic voters. Their main target is socially liberal, fiscally conservative suburbanites, the weakest reeds in the Democratic coalition. These middle-income white voters do not share the acute economic needs of so-called downscale Democratic voters and they are less reliant on government services.The Republican strategy to win over these more culturally tolerant, but still financially pressed, white voters is to continue to focus on material concerns \u2013 on anxiety about rising tax burdens, for example \u2014 while downplaying the preoccupation of many of the most visible Republicans with social, moral and cultural repression.The current effectiveness of the anti-tax strategy was demonstrated in the unexpected victory of Larry Hogan, the Republican gubernatorial candidate in deep blue Maryland, who defeated Anthony Brown, the highly favored Democratic lieutenant governor.In Colorado, Cory Gardner, the Republican Senate nominee, joined the Republican assault on Obamacare and taxes:The President\u2019s healthcare law has added countless new taxes to millions of Americans, and economic growth will continue to struggle until we can accomplish real, meaningful tax reform. The future of our economy depends on it.In a mea culpa comment rarely heard in campaigns, Gardner told The Denver Post:I\u2019ve learned to listen. I don\u2019t get everything right the first time. There are far too many politicians out there who take the wrong position and stick with it and never admit that they should do something different.The clear implication of these results for Republican candidates running in 2016 and beyond is that you can break with conservative orthodoxy on some issues to better appeal to a general election electorate without paying the price of losing white Christian support.If Republicans are successful in toning down their candidates, it will take from Democrats a weapon that has proved highly successful in state and federal elections: demonizing Republican Party candidates as a collection of knuckle-dragging Neanderthals.The Democrats\u2019 portrayal of Republicans has served to motivate both Democratic voters and donors, especially suburban white Democrats, by tapping into their anger and fear of a morally intrusive Republican Party.Anger leads citizens to harness existing skills and resources in a given election. Therefore, the process by which emotions are produced in each campaign can powerfully alter electoral outcomes.As they have after past Election Day defeats, Democrats can hope for Republican infighting between the establishment and Tea Party wings. Such internecine conflict, in fact, has already begun.One question presents itself: how transformative a political leader is Hillary Clinton? Can she avoid entrapment by divisive issues of key importance to competing wings of the center-left coalition: L.G.B.T. rights; marijuana legalization; climate change; gun control; racial profiling; fracking; pension rights for public employee unions; citizenship for undocumented immigrants; and the ever pressing social welfare needs of the country\u2019s poor?In May 2008, with Obama taking the lead, Hillary Clinton committed to continue the race \u201cfor the nurse on her second shift, for the worker on the line, for the waitress on her feet, for the small-business owner, the farmer, the teacher, the coal miner, the trucker, the soldier, the veteran.\u201dClinton didn\u2019t say \u201cwhite people,\u201d but she didn\u2019t need to. The message was clear. And she was even more explicit in an interview with USA Today that month, saying, \u201cObama\u2019s support among working, hardworking Americans, white Americans, is weakening.\u201dClinton has her work cut out for her, especially if the Republican nominee heeds the advice of party leaders and makes a concerted effort to further erode \u2014 by whatever means necessary \u2014 white Democratic support.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Investment Plan Aims for Billions to Spur Economy", "Date": "2014-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union authorities are set to unveil a long-awaited investment plan on Wednesday with the ambition of channeling 315 billion euros into public infrastructure projects like transportation, communications and energy over the next three years.The plan, worth the equivalent of $393 billion if it reaches its target, is meant to spur growth among the 28 nations in the bloc, in response to concerns that Europe is tumbling into a lost decade of low growth and high unemployment. The idea is that big projects, as well as programs to finance small and midsize companies, would put more people to work, provide business to construction and other types of companies and their suppliers, while also making the basic underpinnings of European commerce more modern and efficient to raise the region\u2019s competitive status in the global economy.But the plan, outlined to reporters on Tuesday before a formal presentation planned for Wednesday by the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, involves no new money beyond what is already part of the bloc\u2019s existing resources. Instead, it would rely on about \u20ac21 billion euros in European Union cash and loan guarantees, but would assume that the bulk of the financing would come from private lenders.That structure is already prompting analysts to say the initiative may have only a marginal impact on growth.\u201cTrying to put existing E.U. funds to better use might work to some extent,\u201d said Jennifer McKeown, the senior Europe economist at Capital Economics in London. \u201cBut if private investors were not willing to take these risks to start with, then these relatively small guarantees might not make all that much of a difference.\u201dRaising investment in Europe is a priority for Mr. Juncker, who assumed the presidency of the commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, three weeks ago. He has pledged to keep Europe from lapsing into a period of Japanese-style economic stagnation.The European Central Bank has also called for politicians and policy makers to step up public investments \u2014 which remain below levels in 2007, before the outbreak of the European debt crisis \u2014 to accompany any measure the central bank might take to stimulate the economy using monetary policy.The Juncker plan, besides relying heavily on a combination of financial engineering and incentives for more private investment, would also still need approval from the European Parliament and national governments.The idea is to have the European Union and its lending agency, the European Investment Bank, provide a combination of cash and guarantees worth \u20ac21 billion to a new European Fund for Strategic Investments, which would be up and running by mid-2015.The European Investment Bank would manage the new fund, which would in turn grant a total of \u20ac60 billion across a large range of projects that could include transportation links, high-speed Internet access and renewable energy. The loans could go to a range of recipients, whether private investors, public-private partnerships or even governments, according to European officials who spoke only on the condition of anonymity on Tuesday.With that money from the new fund in hand, project managers would then raise more money from private lenders for projects that might not otherwise have received financing because of the uncertain outlook for the European economy and low investor confidence. Officials said the payback of the loans from the European Investment Bank would depend on the length and the financing model for each individual project.The officials said they wanted the total investment generated by the plan to amount to \u20ac315 billion. They said that investment would be equivalent to 2 percent of the bloc\u2019s gross domestic product over three years and could create up to 1.3 million jobs.Candidate projects are already being screened, and a list of future projects will be drawn up, the officials said.The commission has tried similar initiatives in the past, including so-called project bonds. But European Union officials said Tuesday that the new plan, with the creation of the European Fund for Strategic Investment, would be different because the money would not be limited to specific sectors like transportation and energy, but could also be directed to fields including education and research. It would also be based on a wider variety of financial instruments, including equity investments, and would seek to leverage much more money.Part of the reason for the complex structure of the proposed program is to protect the triple-A credit rating of the European Investment Bank, which European Union officials say is the largest multilateral lender and borrower in the world. But European officials insisted that the approach still represented smarter and more targeted use of existing European resources to unlock investment than has previously been attempted.To encourage additional investment into the fund from the European Union\u2019s member governments, the commission said it would consider making such spending exempt from the strictures of the bloc\u2019s budget rule book, which holds penalties for countries that fail to bring their budget deficits to 3 percent or less of national G.D.P.But the inducements might not be sufficient to attract contributions into the fund from Germany and other relatively prosperous countries.\u201cThere will be some pressure on Germany to contribute to show it\u2019s doing more to stimulate growth in the eurozone and harness investments badly needed in its energy sector,\u201d said Fredrik Erixon, the director of the European Center for International Political Economy, a research group in Brussels.\u201cBut the new project is also likely to be seen by many in Berlin as a potential vehicle for redistributing resources that they cannot fully control,'\u2019 Mr. Erixon said, \u201cso I would not hold my breath on German participation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Martin revived it last year, adding a digital projector and expanding the programming to include not just art flicks but also readings by sci-fi and fantasy authors and occasional one-off screenings of, say, Vincent Price classics or \u201cPulp Fiction.\u201d (Not to worry, Thronies: Mr. Martin has delegated daily operations and gone back to work writing.)Dating back to 1905, and smack in the center of town, the Plaza Cafe is not the tourist trap one might expect. Instead, it\u2019s an unpretentious Greek diner (the Razatos family has run it since 1947) where you can get a feta omelet as well as a breakfast burrito ($10.75) or lacy blue-corn-and-pine-nut pancakes ($10.50). A kitchen fire closed it for two years, leaving a hole in the city fabric. Since its 2012 reopening, the place is a bit shinier, but most of the regulars are back, nursing their bowls of posole, reading The Santa Fe New Mexican and arguing about city politics.Santa Fe has a big backyard, and one patch of it, Valles Caldera National Preserve, is especially beautiful when the snow falls. In the Jemez Mountains northwest of the city, the 89,000-acre former ranch is home to elk, coyotes and bald eagles. You can tour the caldera, a vast basin formed by a collapsed volcano, on snowshoes (for rent at preserve headquarters for $15) or cross-country skis. But even when there\u2019s no white stuff, the stark solitude is beautiful. Join a 45-minute van tour ($5) to the old ranch house, then take a solo hike across the treeless expanse of Valle Grande, the large central meadow.Whispering snow melts/Falling on steaming bodies/Am I in Japan? No, you\u2019re still in Santa Fe \u2014 but Ten Thousand Waves, a series of outdoor pools set amid pine trees on a hill outside town, does perfectly impersonate a rural ryokan. Since its founding in the early 1980s, the bathhouse has evolved from a hippie hot tub spot to a full-service spa resort. Block out several hours to enjoy the facilities (from $23.50 in the public tubs, $33 per hour in private ones) plus an herbal wrap or an excellent massage (from $112) from one of the 125 therapists on staff.Guests at Izanami, the restaurant at Ten Thousand Waves, which opened a year ago, are welcome to shuffle over from the spa in their robes and slippers. The elegant mountain-lodge atmosphere and the menu, developed by the locally beloved chef Kim M\u00fcller, earned the place a position as semifinalist for the James Beard Foundation award for best new restaurant. Diners on a post-bath health high can nibble light dishes like burdock-root salad ($7), while heartier eaters can dig in to Japan-meets-America pub grub, such as the supremely beefy burger seasoned with yakitori sauce ($14). The sake list is detailed and enlightening.Conscientiously sourced coffee isn\u2019t new to Santa Fe \u2014 Ohori\u2019s has been roasting it in small batches for 30 years. Swing by its comfortable two-year-old location on Cerrillos Road for a cup of ink-black java, then, with senses duly sharpened, plunge into some bargain-hunting a few blocks away at El Museo Cultural Winter Market. With 60 or so eclectic vendors in the converted warehouse space, you might spy vintage cowboy regalia, first-edition books or found-object art, plus live music and from-scratch soups and baked goods. Get there before 10:30, when the train from Albuquerque deposits a fresh batch of eager shoppers. For crafts, head across the tracks to the Railyard Artisan Market, in the farmers\u2019 market pavilion every Sunday. A cafe in back can replenish you with green drinks and other healthy morning essentials.11. Art House | NoonTo many Santa Feans, the Lannan Foundation, based here since 1997, is synonymous with the reading series it sponsors every year (check the schedule for such authors as Karen Russell and Noam Chomsky). The foundation\u2019s charitable largess extends to myriad writing grants, art projects in Marfa, Texas, and the prestigious Prize for Cultural Freedom \u2014 as well as a deceptively modest-looking gallery set in two adjacent houses east of the Railyard. Modern and contemporary acquisitions are shown here before being donated to institutions around the country. A recent show focused on nature and the border, and the next one, in January, will feature the landscape photographer Thomas Joshua Cooper. Until then, viewers can call to make appointments to see other pieces from the collection.12. Here\u2019s the Beef | 1 p.m.You can\u2019t live in or visit New Mexico without developing an opinion about the best green-chile cheeseburger. A recent entrant in the continuing competition is the walk-up Shake Foundation, opened in January by Brian Knox, formerly of the slow-food bistro Aqua Santa. A Santa Fean by way of Wisconsin, Mr. Knox opts for thin patties (regulars usually order a double, $6.50) and lightly toasted, lavishly buttered buns. Seating, year-round, is at picnic tables outside. If it\u2019s too cold, check out Santa Fe Bite, the reincarnation of the longtime burger champ Bobcat Bite. The new location is bigger and far more central, but the 10-ounce chuck-sirloin GCCB ($12) is unchanged.Another good reason to visit Santa Fe in winter: hotel rates drop dramatically, especially at the top end.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Diesel BMW for the Long Haul", "Date": "2014-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAround the BlockIn the early 1970s, when BMW owners got together, most of us were driving boxy 2002 models that people routinely thought were made by \u201cBritish Motor Works.\u201d None of us ever imagined that an enthusiast\u2019s car could have a diesel engine.But after a recent 442-mile Interstate trip, pulling up to a diesel pump in the X3 xDrive28d seemed neither as odd nor inappropriate as I\u2019d have once imagined. And in contrast to diesel cars of decades past, there was no feeling of clattering kinship with the diesel 18-wheelers that passed by.When it comes to kinship, the X3, which BMW calls a sports activity vehicle, is a kissing cousin of the old-style station wagon. For 2015, the big news is the availability of a turbo diesel engine for $1,500 more than the base gasoline-burning turbo 4.I topped off the tank and checked the figures: The average speed for the 442 miles I covered was about 70 miles per hour, and the X3 got 36 m.p.g. \u2014 better even than the federal estimate.But one catch with diesels is making sure the fuel economy is good enough to offset the currently higher price of diesel fuel. The diesel X3\u2019s 27/34 m.p.g. rating compares with 21/28 for its 4-cylinder gas-fed sibling. The E.P.A. calculates that the diesel version will save about $350 a year compared with the gas model, assuming an already outdated premium-fuel price of $3.43 a gallon and a diesel price of $3.64, with 15,000 miles evenly split between city and highway.There is a Sport setting for the powertrain, but on the Interstate the most fuel-efficient mode is Eco Pro, which compels the transmission to quickly seek the highest gear possible, allowing the engine to loaf.Eco Pro is a snooze cruise. Should a burst of speed be needed, the delay in acceleration is minimized by the responsive 8-speed automatic and the 280 pound-feet of torque at engine speeds as low as 1,750 r.p.m.BMW says the diesel takes 7.8 seconds to go from zero to 60 m.p.h. That compares with 6.2 for the 4-cylinder gasoline model.The suspension is firm, and on a rough surface the X3 skitters a bit under hard cornering. The steering is nicely weighted but a bit selfish about sharing its feelings concerning the road. Still, the X3 heads quickly into a turn, helped by the ideal 50-50 front-back distribution of its weight.No hardcore sport sedan, the X3 has a different mandate. The diesel sound is easily heard outside, but for the most part is inaudible to occupants. Four adults have adequate room. and there is a reasonable 27.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row. There are no mysteries about the basic controls, including iDrive, which one uses to make changes to the navigation and other systems. Such facility is a pleasant change. When iDrive was introduced a dozen years ago it was so confusing and aggravating that BMW was shunned for crimes against ergonomics.Considering the extra cost to purchase the diesel, there could be a reasonable debate about whether it makes fiscal sense, particularly if the buyer doesn\u2019t keep the vehicle for long; the more you drive, the more you save.The X3 is a charming but common-sense package, though with a 17.7-gallon tank you\u2019ll never be able to buy enough diesel at a truck stop to take advantage of a common incentive there: a free shower.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Homeownership and Wealth Creation ", "Date": "2014-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialSince the housing bust, renting has been in and owning a home has been out, especially among young adults who in earlier decades would have been first-time home buyers. As the rate of homeownership has declined, from a peak of nearly 70 percent in 2004 to a 20-year low of 64.3 percent recently, the number of owner-occupied homes has barely budged, while the number occupied by renters has increased by nearly 25 percent.Those trends have led to questions about the future of homeownership. Would more and longer rentals be a bad thing? Are the benefits of homeownership overrated? The answer to the first question is yes; the answer to the second is no. Homeownership long has been central to Americans\u2019 ability to amass wealth; even with the substantial decline in wealth after the housing bust, the net worth of homeowners over time has significantly outpaced that of renters, who tend as a group to accumulate little if any wealth. Renting, in contrast, offers the potential for comparable wealth building only if renters invest an amount equal to a down payment plus any savings from renting. As a practical matter, most renters do not do that. Even in instances where renters have excess cash, saving a substantial amount is difficult without a near-term goal, like a down payment. It is also difficult to systematically invest each month in stocks, bonds or other assets without being compelled to do so. The analysis does not downplay the risks of homeownership or the devastation of the housing bust. But the lesson of that debacle is not for individuals to avoid homeownership or for policy makers to devalue its importance. Rather, the lesson should be to foster conditions under which middle- and lower-income Americans can sustain homeownership and avoid the ruin of foreclosure. For starters, legal and regulatory protections against practices that inflated the housing bubble need to take root. The Dodd-Frank financial reform law, for example, requires lenders to ensure that borrowers have the ability to repay their home loans and outlaws complex mortgage terms that enrich lenders but expose borrowers to payment shocks. The law also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with the purpose of looking out for consumers\u2019 interests in financial transactions. The C.F.P.B. has gotten off to a good start, but Republicans, who now control Congress, have consistently tried to weaken the agency and the provisions of Dodd-Frank generally. President Obama must be prepared to veto legislation to repeal or weaken mortgage-finance and consumer-protection reforms. Equally important, larger economic forces that make homeownership less possible for working people need to be in the forefront of political debate \u2014 even if Republican control of Congress makes actions to address them unlikely. Long-term wage stagnation, for example, has made it increasingly difficult to accumulate enough for a down payment, and has led many homeowners to refinance their mortgages in order to pull out equity for consumer purchases. The solution is to lift wages, not only with new policies like higher minimum wages and toughened labor standards, but also with approaches to managing the economy to ensure that a fair share of growth goes to wages and salaries, rather than going disproportionately to corporate profits. Renting can make sense as a lifestyle choice or because of income constraints. As a means to building wealth, however, there is no practical substitute for homeownership. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under Pressure From Uber, Taxi Medallion Prices Are Plummeting", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarket TurmoilIn major cities throughout the United States, taxi medallion prices are tumbling as taxis face competition from car-service apps like Uber and Lyft.The average price of an individual New York City taxi medallion fell to $872,000 in October, down 17 percent from a peak reached in the spring of 2013, according to an analysis of sales data. Previous figures published by the city\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission \u2014 showing flat prices \u2014 appear to have been incorrect, and the commission removed them from its website after an inquiry from The New York Times.In other big cities, medallion prices are also falling, often in conjunction with a sharp decline in sales volume. In Chicago, prices are down 17 percent. In Boston, they\u2019re down at least 20 percent, though it\u2019s hard to establish an exact market price because there have been only five trades since July. In Philadelphia, the taxi authority recently failed to sell any medallions at its asking price of $475,000; it will try again, at $350,000.Most major American cities have long used a system to limit the number of operating taxicabs, typically a medallion system: Drivers must own or rent a medallion to operate a taxi, and the city issues a fixed number of them. In New York, which established its medallion system in 1937, that number is 13,437. The number has risen only gradually since the late 1990s, even as the city\u2019s economy has boomed.The turmoil in the medallion market has been obscured in part because publicly disclosed data about taxi medallion prices can be misleading. And the turmoil suggests that the taxi business, which has undergone little change over many decades, is now in the midst of a revolution.\u201cI\u2019m already at peace with the idea that I\u2019m going to go bankrupt,\u201d said Larry Ionescu, who owns 98 Chicago taxi medallions. That might be overly dramatic; after all, Mr. Ionescu also compared Chicago\u2019s pro-Uber mayor, Rahm Emanuel, to Nicolae Ceausescu, the reviled ex-dictator of his native Romania. It\u2019s likely Mr. Ionescu remains a very rich man. In November, Chicago medallion sale prices averaged $298,000, well below the $357,000 price that was typical this spring, but far up from the $50,000 price of a decade ago.But it\u2019s easy to see why he\u2019s worried about the medium term: A seven-mile ride from the Loop to the University of Chicago in a medallion taxi costs about $26, including tip. The same trip cost $12.29 this April with UberX, the lowest-cost service option from Uber.The crucial question for medallion owners like Mr. Ionescu is, if Uber is that much cheaper than a taxi, why would anyone take a taxi, and therefore why would any driver pay to lease a medallion? Mr. Ionescu says his revenues are down around 25 percent, and he\u2019s having trouble leasing out his whole fleet.Official data on medallion prices can be misleading for two main reasons: simple inaccuracy \u2014 as in New York, where officials excluded most sales from their calculations \u2014 or the very small number of sales. In Chicago, for example, there have been only 11 medallion sales since July 1, compared with 147 during the same period last year. Just because somebody sold a medallion for $300,000 doesn\u2019t mean it will be consistently possible to sell at that price into a thin market.\u201cThose are fake prices,\u201d said Mohammad Kamran, a medallion broker in Chicago, who blames UberX. \u201cThe price has plunged big time, and there are no buyers or sellers because the lenders are not lending money.\u201dMr. Kamran said owners are increasingly unable to charge Chicago\u2019s maximum weekly lease rate for medallion taxis, which is around $780, including taxes and insurance, for a late-model Toyota Prius. Drivers have been bargaining that rate down to $700 or $725, he says; others are defecting to services like Uber.In Boston, the story is similar. As recently as April, Boston taxi medallions were selling for $700,000. The last sale, in October, was for $561,000.\u201cRight now Uber has a strong presence here in Boston, and that\u2019s having a dramatic impact on the taxi industry and the medallion values,\u201d said Donna Blythe-Shaw, a spokeswoman for the Boston Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association. \u201cWe hear that there\u2019s a couple of medallion owners that have offered to sell at 425 and nobody\u2019s touched them.\"Not long ago, with demand for taxis rising and the supply fixed, medallions soared in value: A medallion that could be bought for $250,000 in New York a decade ago (or about $315,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars) was worth over $1 million last year.Medallion sales volume has often fluctuated in New York, but right now it is at a low point. There was only one medallion sale in September, followed by nine in October. Ominously, five of the 10 sales in those two months were foreclosure sales. New York\u2019s taxi market had generally been thought less vulnerable because of the importance of street hails, which Uber can\u2019t do, and because New York requires Uber drivers to be licensed by the T.L.C. and drive vehicles with livery plates and commercial insurance.Yellow taxis in New York also face competition from new green \u201cboro taxis,\u201d which may pick up fares only in the boroughs outside Manhattan and in northern Manhattan. That program has been in the works for three years, including during a period when medallion prices were still rising. The vast majority of yellow cab pickups occur in Manhattan below 110th Street or at airports, where yellow cabs face competition from Uber but not from green cabs. Still, the green cab program has faced strong opposition from yellow cab medallion owners, and the start of falling medallion prices coincides with a June 2013 court ruling upholding the green cab program.The trouble in New York\u2019s market was also partly obscured by a flaw in the average price reports that were published monthly by the city\u2019s taxi commission until September. Those reports erroneously said average prices for individual medallions had stayed largely the same since setting a record of $1.05 million in June 2013.In fact, individual medallions have traded below $1 million for most of the last year. But the commission excludes from its statistics any transaction at a price more than $10,000 below the previous month\u2019s reported average.The commission does so in the name of excluding sales that do not occur at an arm\u2019s length \u2014 say, between two relatives. When prices are flat or rising, as they generally have been for decades, the methodology can produce a reasonably accurate result. But when prices are falling, the commission\u2019s method is guaranteed to mischaracterize the market.A spokesman for the T.L.C. pointed to disclaimer language saying its average price reports \u201cmay be misleading and may not accurately convey trends in medallion prices, among other things.\u201dThe Upshot: The Upshot presents news, analysis and graphics about politics and policy.\nnytimes.com/upshotAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "ThyssenKrupp, an Old European Conglomerate, Tries to Learn a New Business Style", "Date": "2014-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThyssenKrupp is one of Europe\u2019s largest and oldest industrial companies, with roots tracing to the early 19th century.ESSEN, Germany \u2014 Heinrich Hiesinger was stunned by what he found in early 2011 when he became chief executive of ThyssenKrupp, one of Europe\u2019s biggest and oldest industrial companies.Not long after he took the helm, the company plunged into a series of deep losses totaling about 8 billion euros, or $10 billion, mostly as a result of his predecessor\u2019s ill-timed investments in steel plants in Brazil and the United States. The company had been solidly profitable as recently as 2008, when it earned \u20ac2.3 billion.\u201cWe had to ask ourselves how could it happen that our company is running into such a difficult situation and nobody is raising hands, or correcting it early enough,\u201d he said during a recent conversation at the company\u2019s steel and glass headquarters here.Mr. Hiesinger has started a sweeping overhaul, no easy task at a tradition-bound organization like ThyssenKrupp. The company\u2019s roots trace to the early 19th century, and its historical contributions include forging formidable artillery pieces for two world wars and developing the gleaming steel alloys that adorn the top of the Chrysler Building in New York.The question is: Can an old-line European industrial company be truly recast as a competitive global player? Especially one constrained by a moribund regional economy, a predominantly unionized work force of 160,000 worldwide and a continued heavy emphasis on steel, which has devolved into a commodity business?The questions are particularly relevant in the case of Mr. Hiesinger, 54, who before joining ThyssenKrupp spent most of his career at Siemens, another German industrial conglomerate scrambling to adapt to the rigors of the global marketplace.Mr. Hiesinger\u2019s latest report card will be issued on Thursday, when ThyssenKrupp is scheduled to report its financial figures for the year that ended on Sept. 30. The company has forecast, and analysts generally agree, that it will break even or make a small profit for the first time since 2010. It expects earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation \u2014 a metric its investors watch even more closely than net profit \u2014 will be about \u20ac1.2 billion, about double the amount of the previous year.But edging into profitability would not necessarily mean the return of good times. The chief financial officer, Guido Kerkhoff, says the company still pays out more cash than it takes in, partly because of around \u20ac600 million a year in pension obligations to retired employees.On Wednesday, the ThyssenKrupp board gave Mr. Hiesinger a vote of confidence by extending his contract until 2020. But not everyone is so sure.\u201cIf there is a letdown in the economy, things could become difficult for Thyssen again,\u201d said Carsten Riek, an analyst in London with UBS.And though the company\u2019s share price is up more than 11 percent this year, it is still down by about a third since Mr. Hiesinger took over.Mr. Hiesinger has overseen the sale of businesses including civil shipbuilding and various steel units that were money losers or marginal, totaling about \u20ac10 billion in annual sales \u2014 about a quarter of the company\u2019s total before he arrived.One of his major goals, Mr. Hiesinger says, is to reduce the company\u2019s dependence on steel, in which it is increasingly difficult for European companies to make money but which has long dominated thinking at ThyssenKrupp. So far, Mr. Hiesinger has shaved steel to less than 30 percent of sales from about 40 percent when he took over.The businesses he favors include elevators, in which ThyssenKrupp is among the top four global leaders, though still far behind the No. 1 player, Otis, a subsidiary of United Technologies, an American company. He is also trying to fine-tune the company\u2019s large business in furnishing components like steering systems for automobiles.ThyssenKrupp\u2019s most profitable unit last year was a business called industrial solutions that designs fertilizer and cement plants in places like the Gulf Coast of the United States and Saudi Arabia.Last year, elevators, auto components and industrial solutions each reported about \u20ac6 billion in sales or about 43 percent of the company\u2019s total \u2014 although the three together earned most of the company\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation.If Mr. Hiesinger fails, it would be a hard blow for the network of factories strung across the already struggling Ruhr Valley, where about half of the company\u2019s 60,000 employees in Germany work.The Ruhr workers are warily watching Mr. Hiesinger\u2019s progress. Peter Trox, head of procurement and sales at a ThyssenKrupp plant in M\u00fclheim that makes high-end electric power steering systems for Mercedes and BMW automobiles, said the company\u2019s struggles were very much on the minds of employees.\u201cEveryone is talking about that,\u201d Mr. Trox said. \u201cLet\u2019s face it: These are good jobs.\u201dJeff Largey, an analyst in London with the investment firm Macquarie Group, said the businesses Mr. Hiesinger favors should be helped by global trends like the need for more concrete and elevators in the growing cities of emerging-market countries like India and China.\u201cThese businesses may not be considered \u2018sexy,\u2019 but they should continue to benefit from favorable demand trends over time,\u201d Mr. Largey wrote in an email.But analysts including Mr. Riek of UBS say ThyssenKrupp\u2019s performance still depends too heavily on the steel business, which is cyclical and plagued by overcapacity in Europe, where ThyssenKrupp is the second-largest producer after ArcelorMittal.Mr. Hiesinger has tried to unload some of the excess baggage.Beginning in 2005 ThyssenKrupp spent about \u20ac12 billion, a little more than its current market value, to build steel mills in Brazil and in Alabama in the United States. The idea was to make raw steel in Brazil and finish it in the United States. But that effort led to billions of euros in losses, as the Brazilian currency appreciated and it proved difficult to quickly penetrate the American market.Last year, ThyssenKrupp sold the Alabama plant to a joint venture of ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal for about $1.5 billion. Mr. Hiesinger has also sold most of the troubled stainless steel business. Mr. Hiesinger has failed to find a buyer for the Brazilian plant but would like to sell it.In the short term Mr. Hiesinger does not see any quick way out of ThyssenKrupp\u2019s steel business in Europe, despite its being only marginally profitable. So he is pushing the steel business to develop higher-tech products that bring in a premium from automakers and other key customers.At the research and development center near the company\u2019s giant blast furnaces at Duisburg, one of the managers, Lutz Kessler, showed off a prototype of a partly plastic car door panel the company has developed. Mr. Kessler said it would reduce weight to allow steel to remain competitive with lighter-weight aluminum.\u201cWe are fighting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still have hope.\u201dParadoxically, the company\u2019s travails may be giving Mr. Hiesinger more management leeway. The debacle of the last few years has curbed the clout of the Krupp Foundation, an Essen-based institution that formerly exercised enormous influence on the company and had gone along with the previous management\u2019s ill-fated decisions like the investment in the Americas. After bringing in Mr. Hiesinger, the foundation, which has reduced its stake in the company, has given him a free hand.The foundation did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Hiesinger has an ally, at least for the time being, in Cevian Capital, an activist hedge fund that has taken advantage of ThyssenKrupp\u2019s anemic share price to build a stake of about 15 percent. A Cevian partner, Jens Tischendorf, has been nominated for election to the board in January.In an interview this year, Christer Gardell, Cevian\u2019s managing partner, said investors panicked over the steel business in the United States and Brazil and overlooked the company\u2019s other assets. Mr. Gardell, who is based in Stockholm, said that ThyssenKrupp\u2019s current management was on the right track.Mr. Hiesinger concedes that the changes he began in 2011 are far from over. What is important is \u201cto prove and demonstrate that each and every year we move forward,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is also our clear understanding, which we share with all, that we are still not there,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Berlin\u2019s Fractious Unity", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThose first years were the time of sky-high cranes, the overnight birth of entire new urban districts where vast empty spaces had sat for years, when people seemed to prefer going to construction sites instead of the theater, opera or museums. When I\u2019d get on the subway and head east from Alexanderplatz in the center to the Ostbahnhof station, even at 2 a.m. there wouldn\u2019t be a single empty seat. I\u2019d find myself squeezed in amid a poor but cheerful bohemian crowd on its way from one club to the next \u2014 since the clubs, too, had all established themselves in the eastern half of the city.In contrast, the western half of the city \u2014 with the exception of the bustling immigrant neighborhoods in Kreuzberg and a few squares in Sch\u00f6neberg and Charlottenburg \u2014 seemed to have fallen asleep. Long-distance rail service had been suspended at the Zoo train station, old West Berlin\u2019s main station; the war-ravaged ruins of the famous Ged\u00e4chtniskirche were, and have remained for years, hidden by scaffolding. The Zoo Palast movie house and the Theater des Westens, which had once attracted thousands of people a day, seemed like faded stars from the past. And when I\u2019d cross the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm \u2014 our Broadway \u2014 on my way home at 11 p.m., I\u2019d see deserted sidewalks, and would watch in disbelief as cafe waiters stacked chairs, closing early for lack of business.Over the past five years or so, though, this has begun to change. The Kurf\u00fcrstendamm is once again full, with lines forming in front of new clubs and restaurants. In early 2013 the Waldorf-Astoria Berlin opened, just off the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm \u2014 at 387 feet, it is one of the tallest buildings in the city, and a shiny beacon for the West\u2019s newfound appeal. The Zoo Palast has been fully renovated, and is now one of Berlin\u2019s most beautiful and popular movie houses.Clever architects turned the so-called Bikini-Haus, a 1950s office building that runs alongside the Berlin Zoo, into a trendy mall, with an elegant hotel next door. When I wanted to go to the Monkey Bar on the hotel\u2019s 10th floor, I had to wait half an hour before I was able to get on the elevator. The bar\u2019s glass walls offer a panorama of the western city center and a view of the monkey cages in the zoo \u2014 though every time I looked for the monkeys, a cocktail glass in my hand, they seemed to be asleep in their houses.Until the early 1930s, West Berlin was the city\u2019s racing heart. Now, it is beating once again. But it has not eclipsed the east \u2014 far from it. The whole city is prospering: Unemployment has fallen; the economy is growing faster than in any other German city. Finally, Berliners feel good in their city.No, wait: not so much in their city as in their kiez, the local term for neighborhood. Interestingly, even as the city has rebalanced itself, it has broken apart into dozens of pieces. An August survey by Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg, a regional broadcaster, found that while 52 percent of respondents said they could easily imagine leaving Berlin for a good job in another city, fewer than 18 percent, answering a separate question, said they could imagine leaving their kiez.Perhaps neighborhood loyalty is more or less evident in any major city. But Berlin\u2019s case is special. It\u2019s as if, even as all the surface evidence points to a unifying city, Berlin still can\u2019t accept its own unification. Four out of 10 Berliners in the survey said they still didn\u2019t feel at home in a united Berlin.In part that\u2019s because of the long, painful division between east and west. But it\u2019s also because the city, in a country famous and infamous for efficiency and other \u201cGerman virtues,\u201d can\u2019t seem to move forward on the kind of grand projects that might symbolize unity. The only large-scale project that is currently on schedule is the reconstruction of the palace of the Hohenzollern kings, in central Berlin, which many Berliners consider completely unnecessary.Another major project, the Berlin-Brandenburg international airport, which really is indispensable, was originally scheduled to open on Oct. 30, 2011. After an initial postponement to 2012, it became apparent that there were problems with the airport\u2019s fire protection system. In the meantime, thousands of other defects have come to light, further opening dates have come and gone, and the airport\u2019s new chief executive doggedly refuses to name a new date. Instead, dates for the announcement of yet another projected opening are announced.Berliners are reminded of a remark by a former East German head of state. Two months before the wall was built, in June 1961, Walter Ulbricht proclaimed, \u201cNo one intends to build a wall.\u201d In a variation on this lie, Berliners now quip, \u201cNo one intends to open an airport.\u201dEven so, there is no lack of signs of a new \u201cwe-feeling\u201d in Berlin. After Germany won the World Cup this year, I headed to the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm. After just a few minutes, the procession of cars came to a standstill amid a concert of honking horns. Even though it began to drizzle lightly, none of the many convertible drivers put up their tops. Arms, legs and necks jutted out of every car window, roof and hatchback, celebrating with a collective victory sign. It was loud and cheerful, and hardly a false note was struck.Suddenly a shrill voice behind me yelled: \u201cDeutschland, Deutschland!\u201d Repulsed, I turned around to discover that the piercing voice belonged to a young dark-skinned woman walking arm in arm with three girlfriends, carrying a long banner in the colors of the German flag, who eyed me belligerently, as if to say: Got a problem with the fact that I\u2019m excited about our team\u2019s win?In short, Berlin is finding new ways to celebrate, to feel good about ourselves as Berliners, as Germans, no \u201ceast\u201d or \u201cwest\u201d or \u201cforeigners\u201d allowed. The fact that more and more people feel at home in Berlin today is more or less unwittingly supported by the diversity of our government, which was unthinkable in the years of the Cold War. For the past nine years, a woman from the former East Germany has been running the country from right here in Berlin; the federal president, also from the East, lives out of wedlock with his partner; the Ministry of Finance is overseen by a vigorous and highly respected man who happens to use a wheelchair; the Ministry of Defense by a woman with seven children; the longtime mayor of Berlin \u2014 now stepping down \u2014 is openly gay.And these people, rather than living aloof from their fellow Berliners, mingle as if they were any old office workers. Years ago I discovered a wonderful little Italian place, and made it my own; years later, Angela Merkel started eating there, too. But when she does, there is no black limousine waiting out front, no secret service agent at the next table; the plainclothes security detail is sitting somewhere at the back of the room, inconspicuously drinking water or beer.The chancellor always sits at the same table by the window, facing the door, though she doesn\u2019t look up when someone enters, to avoid having to return any greetings. Quietly and intently, she engages in conversation with one or, at most, two partners, and also listens for long stretches. Her unobtrusive manner inadvertently spreads to the other guests. There is no murmuring at the tables \u2014 at most, a quiet allusion to the out-of-the-ordinary neighbor, coupled with the admonition, \u201cBut please don\u2019t look over there now!\u201d\u201cAm I getting too soft?\u201d I asked my fellow diner, my voice lowered. \u201cThis comes pretty close to my idea of a civilian government!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Climate Change Plan Raises Questions", "Date": "2014-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is a very serious international commitment between the two heavy hitters,\u201d said Li Shuo, who researches climate and coal policy for Greenpeace East Asia.Still, many questions surround China\u2019s plans, which President Xi Jinping announced in Beijing alongside President Obama after months of negotiations. In essence, experts asked, do the pledges go far enough, and how will China achieve them?Mr. Xi said China would brake the rapid rise in its carbon dioxide emissions, so that they peak \u201caround 2030\u201d and then remain steady or begin to decline. And by then, he promised, 20 percent of China\u2019s energy will be renewable. Analysts said that achieving those goals would require sustained efforts by Beijing to curb the country\u2019s addiction to coal and greatly increase its commitment to energy sources that do not depend on fossil fuels.Many scientists have said that 2030 may be too long to wait for China\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to stop growing, if the world is to keep the average global temperature from rising more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above the preindustrial average. That goal was adopted by governments from around the world at talks in Copenhagen in 2009.Almost no country has done enough yet to reach that goal, but because of its size and industrial development, China is crucial to any effort to even come close. (So is the United States, which promised on Wednesday to emit 26 percent to 28 percent less carbon dioxide in 2025 than it did in 2005.)Some experts said that China should try to halt the growth of its emissions much sooner than it has pledged, by 2025 rather than 2030.\u201cBased on China\u2019s current coal consumption numbers, they can do much more,\u201d Mr. Li said on Wednesday. He said of the pledges made on Wednesday that \u201cthis should be the floor on which they work, rather than a ceiling.\u201dLast month, the departing European Union climate commissioner, Connie Hedegaard, said that halting the growth in Chinese carbon dioxide emissions much sooner than 2030 would \u201cbe a very important gift from China to the whole world,\u201d according to a report by Agence France-Presse.Policy makers and climate experts inside and outside China face the task of assessing the trajectory that China\u2019s emissions are on now, and whether China must do more to change course.Internally, Chinese scientists and officials have been crunching data to try to pinpoint when carbon emissions will peak and how high that peak will be, given current economic growth projections and energy policies, but their estimates have varied. Foreign scientists and policy makers are also trying to judge whether Mr. Xi\u2019s 2030 pledge represents a genuine campaign by the Chinese government to fight climate change, or just a business-as-usual date when emissions would probably have leveled off anyway.Wang Tao, an expert on climate and energy policy at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, said that meeting President Xi\u2019s 2030 pledge \u201cwould still demand quite a lot of change from China, in terms of energy structure and pushing for nonfossil-fuel renewables to reduce the reliance on coal.\u201dHe called the 2030 goal a \u201creasonable target,\u201d but he added, \u201cCertainly the government could do more than that, and should be encouraged to.\u201dWang Yi, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, said that a consensus had grown recently among experts in China that the 2030 date was achievable, and that 2025 would be a more ambitious goal. But as recently as last week, researchers from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the China Meteorological Administration issued a report saying that even with \u201cstringent environmental planning,\u201d the country\u2019s emissions were not likely to peak until 2035.As for renewable energy, Chinese officials have been trying in recent years to encourage development of alternatives to coal, including hydroelectric power, wind and solar energy and nuclear power.Mr. Li, the Greenpeace researcher, said Mr. Xi\u2019s 20-percent goal was ambitious. He said the country would need to add 800 to 1,000 gigawatts of power generation capacity from renewable sources over the next 15 years to meet the goal \u2014 a remarkable figure, given that the country now has a total of just 1,250 gigawatts of capacity from all sources, most of it coal-fueled.At the end of 2013, China got 9.8 percent of its energy from sources not linked to fossil fuels, and the government intends to reach 15 percent by 2020.\u201cTwenty percent does sound fairly robust,\u201d said Jake Schmidt, director of the international program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group in New York. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about 20 percent of a huge economy being based on noncarbon-dioxide-emissions sources. That\u2019s significant.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Familiar Anger Begins to Boil Again in Mexico ", "Date": "2014-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The fate of 43 college students missing and presumed killed and burned to ashes in a mass abduction in September has bred ire and indignation in many corners of Mexico.Spectators held up posters with the faces of the students at a soccer match last week between Mexico and the Netherlands.Thousands of demonstrators, mostly teachers and students and young sympathizers, have poured into the streets of Mexico City and have blocked major intercity highways, while setting fires that damaged the door to the national palace in Mexico City and regional political party offices and the state congress building in Guerrero, where the students attended school.For the past week, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto was in China on a trade mission, even as the instability troubled the international business community he has aggressively courted. The question that awaited his return on Saturday night was: What now? Will the case prompt Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto to throw his weight behind efforts to address corruption, impunity and the rule of law with the same vigor he applied to his bold economic policies?That meeting gave rise to an underfunded office to address the needs of victims of violence but little else.Andrew Selee, a Mexico scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington, said isolated areas like Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and Monterrey received more attention after mass killings, resulting in some drops in crime. But politicians have been unable to carry out effective anticorruption measures and a broad retooling of institutions.\u201cPoliticians of all parties have a great opportunity to make transparency and fighting corruption a banner that they all want to march behind, but it is an open question if that will happen,\u201d Mr. Selee said. \u201cHistorically, there is a lot of tolerance for corruption in all the parties; no one wants to offend an ally or friend. But the political class risks losing more credibility with citizens if they don\u2019t come out clearly to do something.\u201dA general tolerance for corruption may explain the muted reaction from opposition parties to revelations about a private $7 million house Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s wife is buying on credit from a company whose owner won large government construction contracts from Mexico State when Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was its governor.The owner of the house also has a company that was a partner in a Chinese-led consortium for a bullet-train contract Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto abruptly canceled before his trip, bowing to complaints that the bidding process was not transparent.\u201cOne of the consequences of this scandal is it undermines the legitimacy of the government right at a moment that requires strength and credibility,\u201d said Luis Carlos Ugalde, director of Integralia, a political consulting firm, and the former president of Mexico\u2019s election commission.The street protests, largely organized by students and teachers\u2019 unions, may be written off as more of the same, with violent anarchist groups in the mix, but the public venting is spreading to some normally quiet sectors like the members of the Roman Catholic bishops conference and the chief justice of the Supreme Court, both of whom made statements last week calling for dialogue, transparency and concrete actions. \u201cWe think it is necessary to move from protests to proposals,\u201d the bishops conference said in a statement.Alfonso Z\u00e1rate, a political analyst, said: \u201cIt seems encouraging to me that the voices of complaint are multiplying. Corruption was seen for a long time as a lubricant that humanized power. This cynical view allowed it to avoid being seen as truly a cancer. The problem is it has metastasized and strikes all sectors.\u201dSo Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto returns home politically wounded and facing an angry citizenry demanding a bold response to corruption and impunity, as well as new warnings from financial analysts that the lawlessness could discourage the kind of investment he has been seeking.\u201cWe are asking, What do we expect from the most senior officials in government?\u201d said Juan Francisco Torres Landa, a leader of Mexico Unido Contra la Delincuencia (Mexicans United Against Crime), an anti-crime civic group that has organized marches in the past but is not doing so now. \u201cWe are beyond that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them to say, \u2018O.K., the people are not happy,\u2019 and then go on with their usual business. We want them to move into actual activity with specific results.\u201dWhile the political parties have joined together to speed through a host of changes to revamp the economy and educational system, addressing domestic security issues has been more difficult.The events in Iguala have discredited the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, known as the PRD, which is usually quick to condemn the corruption in Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s Institutional Revolutionary Party. Both the mayor of Iguala and the disgraced former governor of the state are PRD members.On the right, the National Action Party has its own burden in dealing with the role of its standard-bearer, Mr. Calder\u00f3n, in the drug war, as well as its share of corruption among current and former officials.\u201cThe political parties are paralyzed,\u201d said Ernesto L\u00f3pez Portillo, director of Insyde, a security think tank in Mexico City, who has long advocated better training and accountability for local and state police forces. \u201cSocial frustration has grown, and this is expressed peacefully for the most part, but political power has not transformed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin\u2019s Friend Profits in Purge of Schoolbooks", "Date": "2014-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPutin's WayMOSCOW \u2014 The purge began in late winter. One by one, hundreds of textbooks that Russian schoolchildren had relied upon for years were deemed unsuitable for use in the country\u2019s 43,000 schools. The reasons varied, but they shared a certain bureaucratic obstinacy.One publisher saw all of his company\u2019s English-language textbooks barred because he had failed to include their subtitles on the paperwork required for government approval. More than three dozen books that use a popular creative teaching style were dropped from a list of authorized titles because the publisher had submitted copies of supporting documents, rather than the originals.Then there was the case of the colorful math textbooks published by a decorated educator, Lyudmila G. Peterson, cashiered for using characters from popular foreign children\u2019s stories. Illustrating math problems with the likes of Snow White, Eeyore and Owl, in one expert\u2019s decisive opinion, was \u201chardly designed to instill a sense of patriotism\u201d in young Russian minds. By the time the school year began this fall, the number of approved textbooks for Russia\u2019s 14 million schoolchildren had been slashed by more than half. The summary winnowing by the Ministry of Education and Science upset lesson plans, threatened the livelihoods of nearly two-dozen small publishers and left principals, teachers and parents puzzled and angry. There was, however, one standout winner: A publishing house whose newly appointed chairman was a member of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s inner circle, Arkady R. Rotenberg, a judo sparring partner from Mr. Putin\u2019s St. Petersburg youth. The publisher, Enlightenment, survived the education ministry\u2019s culling almost untouched. \u201cI have never seen such a level of cynicism and chaos before,\u201d said Vladimir A. Peterson, who manages the publication of the math textbooks developed by his mother.The purge was the latest in a string of government maneuvers that have positioned Enlightenment, once the sole provider of school textbooks under Soviet rule, to dominate the textbook marketplace once again. Mr. Putin first directed that the state-owned company be sold into private hands, records show, in a deal that circumvented a requirement intended to ensure the highest prices for state assets. Then, having installed Mr. Rotenberg as chairman, Mr. Putin\u2019s government knocked out much of Enlightenment\u2019s competition.The remaking of Russia\u2019s textbook industry features a murky trail of transactions that dead-ends in the opaque offshore tax haven of Cyprus, and a cast of characters including a federal lawmaker from the party loyal to Mr. Putin and the software giant Microsoft, which recently signed an agreement with Enlightenment to help it provide Windows-based tablets to Russian schools. That deal came after Mr. Rotenberg, though not Enlightenment specifically, had been targeted along with other close Putin friends by international sanctions stemming from Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. Enlightenment\u2019s story also traces, in miniature, the arc of the Russian economy over the last quarter-century, from Soviet state ownership, to privatization, to what might be called the theater of state-sponsored private enterprise that flourishes today under Mr. Putin. In theory, market competition exists. In reality, the Kremlin and its functionaries have divvied up the nation\u2019s strategic industries among a small and malleable circle of allies. They command some of the nation\u2019s largest energy companies, control banks and much of the news media, and, increasingly, have a footprint in smaller sectors, like book publishing, that are nonetheless important to Mr. Putin\u2019s political control. \u201cThe country is now run by a few families, or clans, close to Putin,\u201d said one publisher, who like many others spoke only on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. \u201cThey used to focus on the very biggest businesses: oil, gas, big infrastructure projects, the banks. But now that they have eaten all the food in that cupboard, they are eating the mice, and the mice\u2019s food, going after smaller and smaller markets.\u201d A Soviet LegacyEnlightenment is a legacy of the Soviet era, when the Kremlin sought to ensure the ideologically correct education of the country\u2019s youth through absolute control of the nation\u2019s curriculum. The publisher was an arm of the Education Ministry \u2014 which also went by the name Prosveshcheniye, Russian for Enlightenment \u2014 and schools had no choice but to use its textbooks. The collapse of the Soviet Union freed the textbook industry, like publishing generally, from the state\u2019s ideology. Under President Boris N. Yeltsin, new publishers emerged, and schools could freely choose textbooks from a list approved by the government, based on expert opinions from the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Russian Academy of Education, certifying that the material was, among other criteria, factual and age appropriate. New textbooks \u2014 and new methods of teaching developed outside Russia \u2014 proliferated, creating diversity in what had been a rigid and rote educational system. In 2011, after years of resisting, the government announced that the state-owned Enlightenment would be put up for sale as part of Russia\u2019s privatization plan. Competition had cost Enlightenment its monopoly, but with about 30 percent of the market, it remained a plum prize. Russian law requires that state assets be auctioned off to the highest bidder, but a loophole allows the prime minister to issue a directive that effectively limits the competition to a select few. Mr. Putin, who had served two terms as president and would soon run for a third, held the post then, and for months industry rumors had been circulating that Enlightenment was about to be delivered into the hands of one of his oldest friends, Mr. Rotenberg.Eager to get in on the bidding for Enlightenment, textbook publishers hurriedly enlisted allies in the Russian Parliament to press for an open competition. They were right to be worried: Unbeknown to them, Mr. Putin had already signed a directive circumventing the open auction rule. The order, dated Sept. 27, 2011, designated Gazprombank to act as the government\u2019s agent in finding a qualified buyer for Enlightenment, for a price \u201cnot less than\u201d market value. The entire process \u2014 from valuation to sale \u2014 took a matter of weeks.\u201cIt happened very fast,\u201d the publisher who spoke on the condition of anonymity said, \u201cand one thing to know about Russia is that when the bureaucracy moves fast, there\u2019s usually someone moving behind them.\u201d The next thing anyone knew, the government announced in late December that Enlightenment had been sold to Olma Media Group, a publisher in Moscow specializing in fiction and art books. Records show Mr. Putin personally signed off on the sale. Olma was a small player, with less than 1.8 percent of the Russian book market, according to the Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communication. But it was politically connected. One of its co-owners was Oleg P. Tkach, a legislator in the upper house of Parliament and member of United Russia, the political party loyal to Mr. Putin. And its authors included Mr. Putin himself, who in 2004 co-wrote a textbook called \u201cLet\u2019s Learn Judo with Vladimir Putin,\u201d the royalties of which went to the black-belt Russian president.Russian anticorruption law prohibits members of Parliament, like Mr. Tkach, from directly engaging in business activity, much less business activity involving the acquisition of a state-owned company. Olma\u2019s general director, Dmitri N. Ivanov, said Mr. Tkach complied with that law by leaving the running of the company to others.Only two other publishers were allowed to bid for Enlightenment: a company called Eksmo and another called Drofa, which was subsequently purchased by Eksmo. The government did not disclose their bids, but maintained that the price Olma paid \u2014 $71.5 million \u2014 was actually higher than its appraised value. The facts, however, cast doubt on that appraisal. \u201cIt was very cheap,\u201d said one publisher who was shut out of the bidding. \u201cWe were all willing to pay more.\u201dEnlightenment\u2019s business has been steady, with about half its revenue coming from government contracts. In 2012, the year after the sale, its annual revenue was close to three times the purchase price, records show, with net profits of nearly $41 million. The company\u2019s annual report estimated it would earn nearly $57 million for 2013, meaning that profits over just two years would exceed the price Olma had paid. Mr. Ivanov said the company won the bid by offering the highest price. Justifying its profits since, he said: \u201cWe weren\u2019t exactly sitting on our feet. We were working so hard on the effectiveness of the company.\u201d He did, however, acknowledge that before acquiring Enlightenment, Olma Media Group was worth \u201ctens of millions of dollars,\u201d while today the merged company\u2019s value is in the \u201chundreds of millions.\u201d The sale price was hardly the only curious thing about the deal. Just weeks after Olma Media Group bought Enlightenment, it sold it, for an unknown price, to a company registered in Cyprus. Then, in a final circular twist, the Cyprus-based Enlightenment turned around and bought 99 percent of Olma Media Group. Virtually overnight, the true owners of Russia\u2019s largest textbook publisher had become impossible to trace. That is because the merged operation was now registered offshore in Cyprus, a popular tax haven that does not require companies to disclose their shareholders. It was at this point that Mr. Rotenberg, long rumored to be a beneficiary of the government\u2019s sale of Enlightenment, formally appeared on the scene. Records show that the initial financing that made the entire transaction possible \u2014 a $54.2 million loan \u2014 came from SMP Bank, which is controlled by Mr. Rotenberg and his brother, Boris. That loan was then refinanced with a $77.1 million line of credit from Gazprombank, the bank that had appraised and then auctioned off Enlightenment for several million dollars less just weeks before. Finally, on Oct. 31, 2013, nearly two years after the privatization, Mr. Rotenberg\u2019s role in Enlightenment became official: Following an internal shake-up, he joined the company\u2019s board as chairman. Mr. Ivanov refused to explain the decision to move the company offshore; he referred questions to Mr. Tkach and his partner, Vladimir I. Uzun, neither of whom responded to written questions or requests for an interview. The move, Mr. Ivanov maintained, had not affected the ownership of the company; the shares, he said, are held by an international fund in trust for the families of Mr. Tkach and Mr. Uzun. Mr. Rotenberg, he said, has no financial stake and receives no compensation. But last week, Mr. Rotenberg himself appeared to contradict Mr. Ivanov. As The New York Times was preparing to publish this article, he discussed his role in Enlightenment as part of an interview with the Russian news agency Interfax.\u201cFor me, this is a significant project, and in large part not financial, although it is business as well \u2014 there is profit there, there are dividends,\u201d Mr. Rotenberg said. \u201cThis should in fact be a decent business.\u201dA Sudden DirectiveThe directive came out of nowhere. Henceforth, the Ministry of Education and Science declared late last year, the only textbooks eligible for purchase by Russia\u2019s schools would be those that managed to meet stringent new federal guidelines. Publishers had to resubmit all the previously required expert reports qualifying their textbooks, plus three new ones prepared by groups authorized by the government to assess the books\u2019 \u201cethno-cultural\u201d value. What\u2019s more, the ministry would no longer simply rubber stamp experts\u2019 recommendations; it was forming an internal council to assess textbooks itself. The new requirements, argued the education minister, Dmitri V. Livanov, were needed to ensure quality. But Oleg N. Smolin, an opposition member of Parliament who chairs the education committee, wrote in a letter of protest that the goal was clearly to \u201cartificially decrease the number of textbooks.\u201dPublishers had limited time to gather the necessary opinions, and a number of smaller publishing houses simply could not comply. Still, many managed to meet the February deadline, and that was when \u201cthey started doing all these crazy things to knock out more,\u201d said one person knowledgeable about the industry. Aleksei V. Konobeyev, editor in chief of Titul Publishers, said he received a phone call informing him that all 20 of the books his company submitted had been barred. Titul publishes English-language textbooks, including a line for grades 2 to 11 titled \u201cEnjoy English.\u201d The series is the most popular in the country; according to the publisher, about 70 percent of students taking English use the books. Mr. Konobeyev knew that his company had submitted all the required expert opinions. So what, he asked, was the problem? The answer, he said in an interview, left him \u201cincredulous.\u201d First the ministry contended that Titul\u2019s submissions had been incomplete; then, when challenged, it declared that it had found a fatal \u201cdiscrepancy\u201d in the paperwork: Though the expert reports the company provided referred to the author and title of each textbook, the ministry stated that it could not be sure that the books submitted were in fact the ones reviewed \u2014 because the expert reports did not contain the subtitles from their inner pages.Another publisher, Fyodorov, was told by a ministry official that it could submit photocopies of its documents, only to learn that 38 of 42 textbooks had been knocked out because it had done just that. Titul filed a lawsuit challenging the exclusions, so far to no avail; Fyodorov filed a similar suit, but a court dismissed it, and now the company is in talks to be acquired. Other publishers, like Mr. Peterson and his mother, saw their textbooks disqualified as contrary to Russian values. Ms. Peterson had created the concept behind her textbooks in the heady years after the Soviet collapse. The cartoon characters she used to illustrate math problems came not only from the West, but also included Russian characters and symbols. One, Karlsson-on-the-Roof, was the creation of the Swedish author Astrid Lindgren, but the portly hero was the subject of a beloved animated film produced in the Soviet Union. Mr. Peterson said the rejections, the first in the company\u2019s history, were based entirely on the finding of only one of the nine reviewers. \u201cIf this expert was given a physics textbook, I am sure, she would see Newton\u2019s law and find it unpatriotic,\u201d he said. Enlightenment, for its part, emerged with only a handful of its books \u2014 6 percent \u2014 disqualified. It led the revamped list with 415 approved books; the runner-up, with 296, was its unsuccessful suitor, Eksmo. In the first seven months of the year, Russia\u2019s schools spent $187 million on textbooks. Enlightenment won 60 percent to 70 percent of those contracts, according to Mikhail Morozovsky, editor in chief of the trade journal Book Business, who based his estimate on an analysis of government procurement records. In addition, Enlightenment is now providing around 80 percent of all the textbooks that Russia is sending to schools in the newly annexed Crimea. \u201cIt\u2019s like what they say in \u2018Animal Farm,\u2019\u00a0\u201d one competitor said. \u201cAll animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\u201d Thousands ProtestChanges in curriculum are not to be taken lightly. Sticking with a single line of textbooks ensures that students build upon the skills they learn from year to year. Additionally, different textbooks employ different teaching styles. Enlightenment, for instance, publishes Soviet-style texts that emphasize rote memorization. The textbooks produced by Fyodorov use a more progressive teaching method called the Zankov system,\u00a0which is aimed at teaching children how to think. The Zankov textbooks are quite popular, and their exclusion prompted a rare public display of protest.The books\u2019 authors gathered more than 25,000 signatures and petitioned the education minister, Mr. Livanov. \u201cThousands of teachers and parents from all regions of the Russian Federation who want to choose for their children a path to individual and optimal development of characters share in our concern,\u201d they wrote. Yelena A. Ilinykh, a first-grade teacher in Moscow, is one. The very superiority of Fyodorov\u2019s textbooks is what led them to be barred, she said in an interview near her school, because they threatened the market share of its politically connected competitor. \u201cThis whole list is a political order for Moscow, which is representing the interests of one publisher: Enlightenment,\u201d she said.In a statement, the ministry defended its actions, saying the old list contained \u201coutdated textbooks whose quality was under question\u201d and was so large as to be unwieldy. \u201cIt was hard for teachers, parents and students to make a right and conscious choice,\u201d the statement said. In public remarks in March, Mr. Livanov said popularity was not a measure of quality. \u201cYou cannot say that because multiple schools use a textbook, then that means it is good,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people drink Coca-Cola, but that does not mean it is good for you.\u201dTatyana G. Mitugina, an English teacher from Bryansk, scoffed at that reasoning. In an online education forum, she protested the decision to exclude Titul\u2019s English-language books. \u201c\u00a0\u2018Enjoy English\u2019 does not have anything in common with Coca-Cola,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThese are amazing Russian textbooks, confirmed by practice.\u201dThe ministry, in an apparent concession to the public anger, gave schools a few years to phase out the books that did not make the list, but made clear that only students who had started to use them could continue. (Of course, many schools, mindful of the ministry\u2019s power and fearful of losing accreditation, immediately switched over anyway.)\u201cWe were told that all the schools will be undergoing inspections,\u201d Ms. Ilinykh, the teacher in Moscow, said. \u201cAnd if they find out that teachers are using textbooks not on the list for more than just continuing students, then the school could get funds cut or layoffs, or I don\u2019t even know what else.\u201d Mr. Konobeyev of Titul said the temporary reprieve simply underscored the arbitrariness of the government\u2019s decision.\u201cIf the books are not good enough, why are you allowing them to be used for the next five years, and if they are as good as our experts say and the teachers say, why are they not on the list?\u201d he asked. \u201cI find the whole thing Kafkaesque.\u201dProfit and IdeologyThere may be multiple motives behind the reshuffling of Russia\u2019s textbook industry. Given Mr. Rotenberg\u2019s involvement, and with Russia increasingly at odds with the West, some see it as a sign of Mr. Putin\u2019s drive to ensure the loyalty and patriotism of Russia\u2019s youth. \u201cWhen my future partners at Enlightenment started to tell me about what is happening here in the area of educational literature, when I found out that we have dozens of textbooks not only on history, but also on physics or mathematics, I realized that everything was not really great here,\u201d Mr. Rotenberg said in the Interfax interview. Now, the Kremlin appears to be going further. Last month, legislators introduced a bill to establish unified textbooks for all history, literature and Russian language classes \u2014 a proposal that has been debated for years but appears to have new life. \u201cThe bacchanalia of textbooks until now has been destroying our youth,\u201d said one of the lawmakers involved, Frants A. Klintsevich, according to a transcript of the hearing. Mr. Putin\u2019s critics see a corrupted system motivated as much by avarice as ideology. The government has in recent months come to the aid of Mr. Rotenberg, who was 14 when he first met Mr. Putin at a judo club in Leningrad and owns a palace outside Moscow that rivals Versailles in its opulence. After the Obama administration sanctioned SMP Bank \u2014 in which Mr. Rotenberg and his brother own a 76 percent stake \u2014 Russia\u2019s Central Bank gave it a 10-year, $3 billion loan with a below-market interest rate, ostensibly to take over another struggling lender. When Italy seized $40 million of property Mr. Rotenberg owns there through offshore companies, including a luxury hotel in Rome and two villas in Sardinia, the lower house of Parliament quickly passed legislation allowing citizens whose property had been seized to seek compensation from the government. Though the tycoon has said he does not plan to take advantage of it, the bill was immediately called \u201cthe Rotenberg law.\u201d Whatever Mr. Rotenberg\u2019s precise relationship to Enlightenment, his role as chairman offers the company the sort of protection \u2014 known as \u201ckrysha,\u201d or roof \u2014 that ensures a favored status in the bureaucracy. The publishing house is not only well positioned to take advantage of the unified textbook mandate, but also another new directive that mandates that all textbook publishers offer electronic versions of their books by January 2015.According to Mr. Konobeyev, smaller publishers like Titul are still waiting for the ministry\u2019s electronic textbook guidelines. Enlightenment, however, is ready to go, according to Mr. Ivanov. The agreement the publisher signed with Microsoft in late September, to share research and development on a Windows-based tablet that could be provided to schools across the country, should only \u201cstrengthen our position in the market,\u201d he said.The question for Microsoft, as with many American companies doing business in Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia, is whether the potential profits outweigh the risk. United States law forbids American companies from doing business with companies majority-owned or controlled by sanctioned people like Mr. Rotenberg. His presence on the board, the opacity of the ownership structure and other elements of the sale should make an American company reluctant to do business with Enlightenment, said Katrina Carroll, a lawyer at WilmerHale who until last year was a senior officer in the Treasury Department\u2019s office of terrorist financing and financial crimes. \u201cI\u2019d never advise a client of mine to go forward under these circumstances,\u201d she said. Last week, Microsoft decided to put off its plans, based on new information it had received from The Times. \u201cMicrosoft signed a nonbinding agreement to provide, free of charge, to Prosveshcheniye, the same type of technical assistance that we provide at no cost to thousands of schools and publishers worldwide,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cAlthough we conducted due diligence in both Russia and the U.S. \u2014 including consulting the U.S. government and engaging respected international law firms \u2014 and have not found evidence that Prosveshcheniye is subject to U.S. or E.U. sanctions, we\u2019ll follow up on the concerns by postponing work under the agreement and conducting an additional review.\u201d Masha Goncharova, Nikolay Khalip and Alexandra Odynova contributed reporting.Putin\u2019s Way: Articles in this series are examining how\nPresident Vladimir V.

{"Headline": "How the G.O.P. Can Court the Working Class", "Date": "2014-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical CalculusA defining feature of Republican economic policy for decades has been its benefits for the well off. The stated goals of that policy have been to shrink government and lift economic growth, but the main method has been cutting taxes much more for high-income families than others. At the same time, the party has opposed an expansion of health insurance for low- and middle-income families, increases in the minimum wage and college financial aid and extensions of jobless benefits.The country\u2019s voting patterns largely reflect these stances, despite all the talk about the conservative white working class or affluent liberal elites. Democrats handily won voters with family incomes below $50,000 in this year\u2019s midterm elections, and Republicans handily won those with incomes above $100,000. The same has been true in nearly every national election for the last two decades.One of the most intriguing questions heading into the 2016 presidential campaign is how serious Republicans are about trying to change this situation.The question for Republicans in 2016 is whether to leave their economic approach largely unchanged and hope they can win anyway \u2014 or to try something new. A payroll-tax cut would be one option. Another would be an income-tax cut focused on something other than the top marginal rate. Beyond taxes, the party could propose market-friendly ways to make college more affordable, such as changing accreditation rules, as Mr. Rubio favors.\u201cThe party that wins the next election,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, the longtime Republican consultant who was Mr. Romney\u2019s chief strategist, \u201cwill be the one that speaks best to how to help people economically.\u201dNo matter what, Democrats are sure to paint Republicans as the party of the rich. For one thing, Democrats will be able to point out that the middle class and poor depend on government programs, like Medicare and Social Security, funded by tax dollars.But it would be a mistake to dismiss the intra-Republican debate as mere theater. Yes, government programs tend to help middle- and low-income families more than the rich. On the other hand, many government programs don\u2019t work as well as they were meant to. There is certainly a coherent argument for letting the middle class and poor keep more of their income, rather than paying for inefficient government programs.An earlier version of this article was imprecise in saying that Mitt Romney did not propose tax cuts for the affluent in his 2012 campaign. Mr. Romney said he would both cut rates and eliminate tax breaks for the wealthy. Critics at the time questioned whether he could eliminate enough tax breaks to make up for the reduction in tax rates, pointing to the campaign\u2019s lack of detail.

{"Headline": "Pollution and Politics", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo it\u2019s the same old story. But why, exactly, does it always play this way? Of course, polluters will defend their right to pollute, but why can they count on Republican support? When and why did the Republican Party become the party of pollution?But that was then. Today\u2019s Republican Party is putting a conspiracy theorist who views climate science as a \u201cgigantic hoax\u201d in charge of the Senate\u2019s environment committee. And this isn\u2019t an isolated case. Pollution has become a deeply divisive partisan issue.So what explains this anti-environmental shift?One answer could be ideology. Textbook economics isn\u2019t anti-environment; it says that pollution should be limited, albeit in market-friendly ways when possible. But the modern conservative movement insists that government is always the problem, never the solution, which creates the will to believe that environmental problems are fake and environmental policy will tank the economy.The basic story of political polarization over the past few decades is that, as a wealthy minority has pulled away economically from the rest of the country, it has pulled one major party along with it. True, Democrats often cater to the interests of the 1 percent, but Republicans always do. Any policy that benefits lower- and middle-income Americans at the expense of the elite \u2014 like health reform, which guarantees insurance to all and pays for that guarantee in part with taxes on higher incomes \u2014 will face bitter Republican opposition.And environmental protection is, in part, a class issue, even if we don\u2019t usually think of it that way. Everyone breathes the same air, so the benefits of pollution control are more or less evenly spread across the population. But ownership of, say, stock in coal companies is concentrated in a few, wealthy hands. Even if the costs of pollution control are passed on in the form of higher prices, the rich are different from you and me. They spend a lot more money, and, therefore, bear a higher share of the costs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Obama Lost America", "Date": "2014-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe interesting question is why. You may recall that Mitt Romney built his entire 2012 campaign strategy around the assumption that a terrible economy would suffice to deny Barack Obama a second term.

{"Headline": "Applications by the Dozen, as Anxious Seniors Hedge College Bets ", "Date": "2014-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySix college applications once seemed like a lot. Submitting eight was a mark of great ambition. For a growing number of increasingly anxious high school seniors, figures like that now sound like just a starting point.Alexa Verola, a senior at Mahwah High School in northern New Jersey, drew up a list of some colleges where she would be happy majoring in anthropology and added more that would be good for photography or sound design: 18 in all. Then she applied to every last one of them.Eighteen is a lot, but good colleges are so hard to get into these days, Ms. Verola reasoned, and there will always be students with better board scores or higher grades. So after those 18 applications were in \u2014 most of them way ahead of schedule \u2014 she looked over the list and decided to add 11 more.\u201cMy guidance counselor thought it was a little too much,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was worried about me getting too stressed out about it. There are a lot of high school students who are really stressed out.\u201dWith college application season upon them, a lot of stressed-out high school students appear to be following the same path Ms. Verola did: Faced with an increasingly competitive landscape, they have begun applying to more colleges than anyone would previously have thought possible.For members of the class of 2015 who are looking at more competitive colleges, their overtaxed counselors say, 10 applications is now commonplace; 20 is taking on a familiar ring; even 30 is not beyond imagining. And why stop there?Brandon Kosatka, director of student services at the Thomas Jefferson School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Va., recently worked with a student who wanted a spot in a music conservatory program. To find it, she applied to 56 colleges. A spokeswoman for Naviance, an online tool that many high school students and their counselors use to keep track of applications, said one current user\u2019s \u201ccolleges I\u2019m applying to\u201d tab already included 60 institutions. Last year the record was 86, she said.A number of factors have contributed to this rapid escalation.But perhaps the most pressing factor has been plain old fear.\u201cEvery year the story is that college is harder to get into, so kids panic and think they have to apply to more places,\u201d said Jim Jump, academic dean and director of guidance at St. Christopher\u2019s School in Richmond, Va. The resulting surfeit of applications drives acceptance rates down even further, making the next year\u2019s high school seniors even more panicked.\u201cIt becomes a mania, almost,\u201d he said.With application fees running as high as $80, the scattershot approach can be costly. Last year Annie Fagerlee of Minnetonka, Minn., applied to 18 colleges. Some waived the fee, but in the end Ms. Fagerlee, now at DePaul University, estimated that it cost her family about $1,500 just to get the applications out the door. Still, college counselors say cost is rarely an inhibiting factor. What is $1,500, the reasoning goes, when these colleges might cost $50,000 a year?In the upper reaches of the applicant pool, however \u2014 especially in the kinds of upper-middle-class communities that can breed their own college neuroses \u2014 numbers can escalate rapidly.Some high schools set a limit of perhaps 10 colleges per student. Others allow application creep, either because they do not want to infringe on a family\u2019s decisions or because they have concluded that families will do what they want, regardless. But most college counselors agree on one point: Filing so many applications is a terrible idea.For one thing, counselors warn, quality and quantity work against each other. And the problems of scale only increase as decisions roll in. Five rejections are painful; 15 can be devastating. \u201cThe funny thing about 17-year-olds,\u201d said Lisa Sohmer, director of college counseling at the Garden School in Jackson Heights, Queens, \u201cis when you tell them that only 10 percent of students are accepted to school X, they never make the connection \u2014 even the math ones \u2014 that 90 percent are denied.\u201dBut the most compelling reason not to apply to dozens of colleges, counselors say, is that more applications do not necessarily mean better odds. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the lottery,\u201d said Michael Carter of St. Stephen\u2019s & St. Agnes School in Alexandria, Va.Ms. Sohmer said she had found that when students file 20 or more applications, \u201cthey\u2019ve loaded on lots of ultracompetitive schools, so their list becomes disproportionately top-heavy. Or they throw in lots of schools at the end where they\u2019re overqualified.\u201d A far better way to increase one\u2019s chances, she and many others agree, is to come up with a manageable but carefully selected list of schools and get serious about them.As for the colleges, they are generally eager for more applicants. In fact, many work hard to market themselves, with promotional mailings that begin well before senior year, because bigger numbers mean a higher position in the annual \u201cbest colleges\u201d rankings. But dealing with students who have applied to 25 other colleges can make it hard for admissions officers to manage their yield \u2014 the all-important percentage of accepted students who actually enroll \u2014 and that can hurt the college\u2019s position in those same rankings.As a result, many colleges have begun emphasizing \u201cdemonstrated interest\u201d \u2014 tiny but telling indications of how badly students want to attend. \u201cIf they\u2019re within a reasonable distance of the campus, did they visit?\u201d asks Patrick O\u2019Connor, associate dean of college counseling at the Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. \u201cDid they attend a college night and fill out a card? Have they contacted a rep to ask some legitimate questions?\u201dMarie Bigham, director of college counseling at the Greenhill School in Addison, Texas, said, \u201cYou can\u2019t be a competitive, strong applicant without demonstrating interest, and you can\u2019t do that at 25 schools.\u201dUltimately, a wide range of counselors say, all they can do is counsel against applying to dozens of schools and against college-admissions panic in general.\u201cThat\u2019s when the kids put their best foot forward,\u201d Mr. Kosatka said. \u201cThe kids who try to game the system just end up getting played in the end.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mr. Obama\u2019s Moment on Immigration", "Date": "2014-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialPresident Obama said on Wednesday that he would act on his own by the end of the year to \u201cimprove\u201d the immigration system, presumably by giving many \u2014 perhaps millions \u2014 of the country\u2019s unauthorized immigrants temporary protection from deportation and permission to work. He has said this before, only to back off in deference to election-year politics. Now the election is over, and the only thing to say to the president is: Do it. Take executive action. Make it big.He must not give in to calls to wait. Six fruitless years is time enough for anyone to realize that waiting for Congress to help fix immigration is delusional. Senator Mitch McConnell and Representative John Boehner have warned Mr. Obama that executive action would destroy any chance of future legislation. But Republicans have had many, many opportunities to move on immigration, and never have. They killed bipartisan reform in 2006 and 2007, and again this year. The party, whose hard-core members tried to stoke national panic at the border this summer, shrieking about migrant children, Ebola and the Islamic State, is not ready to be reasoned with. The arguments for protecting a broad swath of immigrants through executive action, meanwhile, are firmly on Mr. Obama\u2019s side.There is reason to worry that Mr. Obama\u2019s as-yet-unannounced plan for executive action will be too cautious, small and narrow. He has not said how big a group might qualify for protection. He should start with those who would have qualified for legalization under the bill that passed in the Senate in 2013 but died in the House.That bill, a serious attempt at a once-in-a-generation overhaul, would have given millions with clean records a shot at legalization if they paid fines and back taxes and went to the back of the citizenship line, among other things. Mr. Obama strongly endorsed the bill. His executive action should be just as broad. There will surely be intense debate when Mr. Obama draws the lines that decide who might qualify for protection. Some simple questions should be his guide: Do the people he could help have strong bonds to the United States? Does deporting them serve the national interest? If it doesn\u2019t, they should have a chance to stay. Advertisement"}

Fink, chief executive of the asset manager BlackRock; and Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England.Ms. Yellen appeared on a panel that included Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund; and Raghuram Rajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India.While highly academic, the sessions highlighted how little consensus there is among the experts about issues like the optimal level of inflation, the risks that may lurk in a world where interest rates are close to zero, and what central banks should be doing to help growth and prevent future crises.\u201cNothing works and we don\u2019t know why,\u201d said Jacob A. Frenkel, chairman of JPMorgan Chase International, attributing the sentiment to Albert Einstein.The session came a day after the European Central Bank made its strongest commitment yet to pump money into the eurozone to prevent deflation, a destructive decline in prices. The central bank indicated it would aim to increase the total value of its balance sheet \u2014 the sum of its gold, loans outstanding and other assets \u2014 by 1 trillion euros.Analysts say that commitment will eventually force the European Central Bank to buy government bonds on a large scale, as other central banks have done to stimulate their economies when official interest rates were as low as they could go.While Ms. Yellen was restrained in her comments on European Central Bank policy, Ms. Lagarde repeated calls for it to do more. \u201cAll levers should be used and all available policies should be implemented,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said, in a clear reference to the bank.Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at the German insurer Allianz, argued during a separate talk that the risk that stimulus measures would create inflation was not as great as the risk of doing nothing.\u201cThe trade-off is not between doing something now and inflation down the road,\u201d Mr. El-Erian said. \u201cThe trade-off is between doing something now and taking a high risk of financial instability later.\u201dWilliam C.

{"Headline": "Breaking Through With a Natural Product", "Date": "2014-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Amy de Castro stumbled into watchmaking in 2012 while working on a business school project. In less than two years, Ms. de Castro has built from scratch a business that has generated more than $235,000 in revenue since it was formally established in February 2013, selling watches assembled in Cape Town.Her venture illustrates both the opportunities available in the watch business in South Africa and the challenges on a continent with limited watchmaking resources. \u201cI knew nothing about watches,\u201d Ms. de Castro said in a telephone interview from Cape Town. \u201cI never wore a watch before because it did not suit my style.\u201d The project was born in an entrepreneurship course at the University of Cape Town. Ms. de Castro, then 22, and six classmates were working on a project that required them to come up with a product that was new to South Africa, was environmentally sustainable, aimed at a young market segment, and could be brought to market quickly. \u201cWe tossed out ideas like making bean-bag beds or charity bracelets, before we agreed to produce bamboo watches,\u201d Ms. de Castro said. \u201cWe wanted a functional object that people felt good about wearing.\u201dWithin weeks, the team developed the design for a wristwatch featuring a dial made with bamboo strips on a leather strap. With $4,000 in capital, they produced a prototype and placed an order for 500 watches with a Chinese factory that they found on the Internet. \u201cNo one on our team knew anything about watchmaking or distribution,\u201d Ms. de Castro said. \u201cWhen the prototype arrived, we showed it to other students on campus, and since everyone loved it, we went ahead with production.\u201d South Africa has no watchmaking industry, so Ms. de Castro and her team looked for most of the components abroad. The dials were made in China, the quartz movements in Japan. Only the leather straps were made locally in South Africa. The final product was marketed as \u201chandcrafted and assembled in South Africa.\u201dAfter graduation, Ms. de Castro bought out her classmates and registered the company locally as Bamboo Revolution. Determined to make it work, she traveled to China this year and made contact with another, smaller factory that was more responsive to her needs as a small customer.\u201cTo develop my business internationally, I had to understand the supply chain, protect my design and control quality standards,\u201d Ms. de Castro said. \u201cFor that, I needed to see the factory and establish a relationship.\u201d\u201cThere is opportunity in the current environment to create something new,\u201d Mr. de Quercize said. \u201cTo change the status quo and seize the opportunity, audacity is not a danger, it is the solution.\u201dThe challenges faced by Ms. de Castro are many, including cultural and historical hurdles, Wendy Luhabe, a South African businesswoman and a member of the Cartier Awards jury, said in an interview in Deauville. \u201cSouth African culture is not an entrepreneurial culture and people prefer to be employed in a company rather than start a business,\u201d said Ms. Luhabe, a globally recognized social entrepreneur known for her efforts to empower African women: \u201cHistorically, South African women have not been a participant in the economy,\u201d she added. \u201cBut things are changing.\u201dAccording to Ms. Luhabe, Ms. de Castro\u2019s project was selected among the finalists because she had successfully focused on a niche market to sell a natural product that could be sold using new technologies. \u201cStill, we questioned the economic sustainability of Ms. de Castro\u2019s business,\u201d Ms. Luhabe said. \u201cWe were unsure where she could take the business in five years and how she could protect her design.\u201dFew of the skills and resources needed to develop a watchmaking business exist in Africa. \u201cIt\u2019s our goal to move our production to South Africa but there are no resources available here right now,\u201d Ms. de Castro said. \u201cAs we grow, we will try to find ways to have the watch components made locally, but we are not there today.\u201d The African market for fine watches is limited, to say the least. According to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, while Switzerland exports 95 percent of its production to all continents, Africa accounts for only about 1 percent of those exports by value. In contrast, Asia absorbs 53 percent, Europe 31 percent and America 14 percent. Skilled watchmakers are also rare, although the Swiss watchmaking giant Swatch Group now operates a small training program in Johannesburg. The program recruits up to three candidates a year and enrolls them for two years in a watchmaking school that Swatch opened in 2008 in Malaysia \u2014 one of six international schools that it runs, mainly to strengthen its global network of watch repairers. Yet, despite the paucity of resources, Ms. de Castro said, she is determined to expand.

{"Headline": "In Moscow, a Financial District in Name Only", "Date": "2014-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetMoscow\u2019s financial district, known as Moscow City, has become a visible symbol of Russia\u2019s economic woes.MOSCOW \u2014 In the coveted corner office, a bearded man in sweatpants scrambled eggs at a kitchenette, all the while taking in the serene beauty of the city lights twinkling far below.In the conference room, or as the company prefers to call it, the \u201ccommon area,\u201d two other men lounged about playing video games on an Xbox. In place of cubicles, there are bunk beds.High Level Hostel, one of the newest tenants in the financial district here known as Moscow City, sits on prime real estate on the 43rd floor of a multimillion-dollar glass-and-steel tower. It is not a youth-hostel-themed work space, but an actual youth hostel \u2014 dirty socks and all.\u201cWe thought, \u2018why not open a hostel in a skyscraper?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Roman Drozdenko, the 25-year-old owner. \u201cNobody\u2019s done that before.\u201dThe tower, with its marble veneer foyer, banks of elevators and breathtaking views, was clearly built for lawyers, accountants or stock traders. But \u201cthere were no questions regarding our guests\u201d from the building management when he opened in September, Mr. Drozdenko said. \u201cIn fact, there were no questions at all.\u201dMoscow\u2019s skyscraper district, formally the Moscow International Business Center, reflects the broader problems in the Russian economy. The country, facing broad-ranging financial sanctions and largely dominated by state-run companies, simply has no need for vast office spaces for stock traders, auditors and bankers.\u201cRussians have a great tradition of building things they don\u2019t need,\u201d Sergei Petrov, an office worker in Naberezhnaya tower, said of the emptiness behind the glass facades, a veritable Potemkin Wall Street.Moscow City was envisioned as a hub of emerging market finance, a shiny skyscraper-dotted testament to Russia\u2019s growing international influence. For a time, the idea was not improbable: From 2000 to 2007, the Russian economy grew on average 7 percent a year. One tower, called Evolution, twists in a DNA-evoking double helix. The spires of Federation Towers resemble billowing sails, evoking Russia sailing into a capitalist future. Federation Tower East, when finished, will rise 95 stories to a height of 1,224 feet, surpassing its still mostly empty neighbor Mercury City Tower as the tallest building in Europe.Eight skyscrapers are finished, including the gold-tinted Mercury tower. Eight others are under construction, and two more are planned. The entire site is scheduled to be finished by 2018.But Russia\u2019s tanks are now getting more international attention than its banks, leaving Moscow City as a $12 billion reminder of the nation\u2019s economic woes.Western sanctions, for example, have taken aim at Russia\u2019s largest state financial institutions, Sberbank and VTB, which both own towers or floor space in Moscow City. The two banks now have a limited ability to issue debt on global markets, thus limiting their growth options.Sanctions by the United States and the European Union are expected to trim about 1 percentage point of growth from Russia\u2019s gross domestic product this year, and slightly more next year if they remain in place. Even without sanctions, problems have been stacking up. Rising inflation, falling oil prices, and a tumbling ruble have left Russia near recession.The government also accounts for an outsize proportion of the economy, leaving scant jobs for the grunt workers of private enterprise, the bankers, lawyers and traders for whom Moscow City was built. In Russia, 81 percent of the shares of the top 10 companies are owned by the same entity, the state, compared with 11 in Germany, according to a study by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development economists.Rather than turning to banks, Russia\u2019s largest company, the sanctioned state oil company Rosneft is now appealing directly to state funds for loans. And the Kremlin this year again delayed shifting pensions into the private sector, dealing another blow to financial sector jobs.\u201cSomebody had the idea that if you build a lot of skyscrapers in one spot you have an international financial center,\u201d Darrell Stanaford, a real estate analyst in Moscow with Romanov Dvor, said in an interview. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t work. You need other things, too.\u201dMoscow City, which has taken a direct hit from these policies, is now shifting tactics to fill the glut of premier office space.City, the management company for the development in the neighborhood, says financial services companies are no longer the majority of its new tenants. Of the new Russian occupants signing leases this year, 58 percent were nonfinancial companies as well as local small and midsize businesses, like High Level Hostel, according to the management company.New buildings are also being repurposed at the development stage. One low-rise will become a 6,000-seat movie theater.In finished towers, various nonfinancial ventures are renting space. One company sells Cambodian citizenship to Russians wanting a second passport. A culinary school and restaurant are opening.Many multinationals have rented space. IBM, General Electric, KPMG, General Motors, Hyundai, Energizer and Japan Tobacco International are all tenants, as is a major Russian investment bank, Renaissance Capital.Prices, too, are falling. Mr. Drozdenko, the hostel owner, said a real estate agent offered him the space for about $8,000 a month for 1,600 square feet, or about $5 a square foot.In Moscow City, office space currently averages $6.90 a square foot each month. That\u2019s below the average of $7.75 for high-grade office space elsewhere in the capital, according to Denis T. Sokolov, senior analyst and a partner at Cushman & Wakefield in Moscow.\u201cWe have to do this,\u201d Dmitry Granov, the director of City management, said in an interview of the effort to broaden the range of tenants, because of the dearth of financial sector jobs in Russia.\u201cIf before we were looking for international corporations, today we are looking for Russian companies, and small and medium businesses,\u201d he said. He said dropping rents would attract technology start-ups.City management company contested the vacancy estimate by Cushman & Wakefield. Cushman & Wakefield counts vacant sublease space in its total, while the management company does not. City says current vacancies are about 20 percent.Meshing the various constituencies is also creating challenges.\u201cThe cafes, amenities and dress code you need is different for clients of a youth hostel and for investment bankers,\u201d said Mr. Stanaford, the real estate analyst, of settling tenants like High Level Hostel in their high-level location. \u201cWhat image-conscious business is going to buy office space in the same skyscraper with a youth hostel?\u201dEmpire Tower, the skyscraper where High Level hostel sits, is still largely empty two years after opening. In the foyer, an oval marble sculpture echoes the oval motif of the 60-story tower, designed for a more professional clientele.Forty-three stories up, High Level Hostel opened in September with 24 beds, with prices starting at $25.50 in a six-person room, including a breakfast of toast, porridge or muesli. The hostel manager, Leonid L. Fedotov, 19, who goes by the nickname the Beard, recalled backpacking guests from Holland named Ron and Eve.\u201cIt was really cool because Ron and I played guitar in the evening,\u201d he said, as they gazed out at the twirling facade of Evolution Tower and the sea of lights of Moscow below.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Union Lowers Growth Forecasts as Business Confidence Sags", "Date": "2014-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGrowth is expected to be a meager 1.3 percent in the 28-member bloc this year, instead of the 1.6 percent predicted in the spring, said the European Commission, the union\u2019s executive arm. And the economy is not expected to get much better in 2015, when growth in Germany, the region\u2019s economic engine, is expected to grind down to about 1 percent.Unless there are additional signs of growth and job creation in the next five years, \u201cpeople could despair of the European project,\u201d Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said at a news conference on Tuesday.The recovery on the Continent continues to lag those in the United States and Britain. Over the next two years, annual growth in Britain is expected to be close to 3 percent, and the unemployment rate is projected to be 5.5 percent in 2016, according to the data released Tuesday. The unemployment rate in the European Union is not expected to fall below double digits, where it has been since 2012, until 2016.The gloomier outlook will most likely raise expectations for the European Central Bank to take additional steps to stimulate the economy, though economists said they did not expect policy makers to take action at a meeting on Thursday.The report on Tuesday did not take into account how the European economy might get a boost from a 300 billion euro, or $375 billion, plan to invest public and private money into infrastructure projects. Jean-Claude Juncker, who took office this month as president of the European Commission, has pledged to present that package before the end of the year.But how much of an effect that would have on lackluster growth remains to be seen. The spending program is unlikely to \u201cchange the whole world,\u201d Mr. Katainen said, but \u201cits contribution can be significant.\u201dThe lower forecasts, especially in the 18-nation euro area, where the commission cut its projection for growth this year to 0.8 percent from an earlier 1.2 percent, are a measure of how quickly optimism about a recovery has dissipated. France has failed to grow as hoped, and Italy struggles to make overhauls. There are also signs that the German economy is stalling.In one of the more drastic downgrades for 2015, the commission lowered Germany\u2019s forecast for growth by nearly a full percentage point to 1.1 percent.Among the problems facing European economies like Germany is the prospect of a \u201cnew cycle of sanctions and countersanctions\u201d related to the restrictions that the United States and the European Union imposed on Russia in retaliation for its role in the Ukraine crisis, and reciprocal moves by Moscow, European Union officials said.Those tensions \u201ccould pose a larger roadblock to European growth prospects than currently envisaged in the forecast,\u201d the officials said in a report accompanying the forecasts.The tensions might also \u201chave triggered a wait-and-see attitude among firms,\u201d the officials wrote in a section of the report that focused on Germany.Germany is expected to post growth of 1.3 percent this year, down from an earlier forecast of 1.8 percent. The French economy is expected to grow 0.3 percent this year, down from an earlier estimate of 1 percent.Italy appeared to stand out as a poor performer: Its economy was predicted to shrink 0.4 percent this year compared with a forecast in May for growth of 0.6 percent.The commission also expressed concerns about inflation, which it said would remain very low this year and would not come close to the target of just under 2 percent anytime soon. It projected an annual inflation rate of 1.6 percent in the European Union in 2016.\u201cWith confidence indicators declining since midyear and now back to where they were at the end of 2013, and hard data pointing to very weak activity for the rest of the year, it is becoming harder to see the dent in the recovery as the result of temporary factors only,\u201d officials wrote in their report.The commission said it expected growth rates to improve somewhat in 2015, rising to 1.5 percent in the European Union and to 1.1 percent in the eurozone.Even so, weaker-than-expected growth this year is likely to make it much harder for countries like France and Italy to achieve the bloc\u2019s mandated targets to keep budget deficits and government debt in check.France and Italy could face disciplinary action and steep fines if they fail to show that they are making sufficient effort to bring their economies in line with European budgetary rules. Mr. Katainen said those recommendations would be published by the end of this month.That prompted Mr. Katainen, the commission vice president, to call on member states to agree on the \u20ac300 billion spending plan to bolster demand.\u201cAccelerating investment is the linchpin of economic recovery,\u201d he said.Germany also \u201ccan play a significant role stimulating the euro area and E.U. economy\u201d by saving less and spending more, Mr. Katainen said.Advertisement"}

In 43 states, less than half the eligible population bothered to vote, and no state broke 60 percent.In the three largest states \u2014 California, Texas and New York \u2014 less than a third of the eligible population voted. New York\u2019s turnout was a shameful 28.8 percent, the fourth-lowest in the country, despite three statewide races (including the governor) and 27 House races.Republicans ran a single-theme campaign of pure opposition to President Obama, and Democrats were too afraid of the backlash to put forward plans to revive the economy or to point out significant achievements of the last six years. Neither party gave voters an affirmative reason to show up at the polls. The states with the biggest turnouts tended to have well-publicized and competitive races, but even competition was no guarantee that voters would show up. Georgia and North Carolina, which had two highly contested Senate races, did only slightly better than the national average for turnout. Some of that is because of regional differences; northern states generally have higher turnout than southern states, as they did this year, because voting tends to correlate with education and income levels.Showing up at the polls is the best way to counter the oversized influence of wealthy special interests, who dominate politics as never before. But to encourage participation, politicians need to stop suppressing the vote, make the process of voting as easy as possible, and run campaigns that stand for something.Advertisement"}

Their mini-marketplaces and ersatz economies are just as hard to predict as their real-world counterparts. Anyone who has suffered family fallout over an evening of Monopoly, or lost sleep over a Fantasy Football roster, knows this all too well.Now look at what the Internet has wrought. Over the last decade, massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) like World of Warcraft have broken down the barriers between millions of players around the world; they\u2019ve also created strange new occupations such as gold farmers \u2014 menial workers, mostly in the developing world, paid a pittance to gather in-game items for wealthier players.Is this fair? What can be done about it? Cory Doctorow and Jen Wang ask these questions in their brief but layered graphic novel \u201cIn Real Life.\u201dAt first, Doctorow and Wang seem to be spinning a tale of female empowerment. An Arizona teenager named Anda Bridge, inspired by a school visit from an older gamer named Liza the Organizer, joins Liza\u2019s all-woman gamer group within Coarsegold Online, a fictional MMORPG with upward of 10 million players.The group, Clan Fahrenheit, only accepts girls who play as female avatars \u2014 a rare occurrence in an online realm where girls are always on their guard against unsavory elements, Liza tells us.Although Doctorow wrote \u201cAnda\u2019s Game,\u201d the short story that forms the basis for \u201cIn Real Life,\u201d in 2004, this is a timely tale to tell. A controversy known as GamerGate erupted this summer and rages on, sparked by a campaign of online harassment against a female developer whose games dealt with social issues. Questions of misogyny in MMORPGs are more pressing than ever.But Clan Fahrenheit and its girl-\u00adpowered mission become strangely incidental to this story \u2014 or at least, Doctorow and Wang suggest that groups of proudly female players are just as likely to be corrupted by the game as their male counterparts. Liza disappears from the narrative, and Anda is offered an in-game assignment for real-world money: Shadowy clients want the girls to wipe out the avatars of those loathed gold farmers.Anda agrees, and in the book\u2019s most disturbing scene, finds the gold farmers to be harmless, weaponless pixie-like creatures with wide eyes, clinging to each other in terror. Obeying orders, she slaughters them anyway.The cartoonish style in which Wang draws the scenes spares us the blood, but there\u2019s no escaping the consequences of the virtual killing \u2014 especially when Anda befriends a gold farmer named Raymond, who is actually a 16-year-old working a night shift at a gold-farming operation in Shenzen, China. Raymond is sick and has no access to health care. Anda tries to help him \u2014 with disastrous results at home, at school, in Clan Fahrenheit and in Shenzen.Ultimately, Doctorow and Wang want us to consider what it means to be part of groups that hate other groups, and how technology and persistence can help us overcome such barriers. They\u2019ve shoehorned rather too much into the story for this to be entirely effective. But \u201cIn Real Life\u201d is a powerful narrative nonetheless, and it\u2019s easy to imagine many young gamers \u2014 not to mention many young gamers\u2019 parents \u2014 moved to consider the consequences and limitless potential of the worlds they helped create.IN REAL LIFEBy Cory DoctorowIllustrated by Jen Wang175 pp. First Second. $17.99.

{"Headline": "Call to Congress: End Loophole for Tax on Elite", "Date": "2014-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseNow that Republicans control both houses of Congress, they need to show they can accomplish something, and President Obama has just two years to burnish his legacy. So the search is on for bipartisan consensus.I have two suggestions: \u201ctax reform\u201d and \u201ccarried interest.\u201dIs there anyone who truly believes the current individual and corporate tax systems are efficient and fair and promote growth?\u201cIt\u2019s an outrageous loophole,\u201d Daniel Shaviro, a specialist in tax policy and professor at New York University Law School, said of the tax code\u2019s treatment of carried interest. \u201cNo reputable person will say otherwise unless they\u2019re getting paid.\u201dCarried interest is the share of any profits that partners in hedge funds, private equity firms and venture capital funds receive as compensation, on top of management fees. A common compensation formula is for managers to get 2 percent of the amount under management, in addition to 20 percent of any gains, which is carried interest. Under current tax law, carried interest is treated as a capital gain, subject to the top 20 percent capital gain tax rate plus a 3.8 percent surcharge to help pay for the Affordable Care Act, rather than as ordinary income that is subject to a top marginal tax rate of 39.6 percent.But carried interest has always seemed much more like ordinary income to most people who have considered the issue. Carried interest is compensation for the services that managers provide, like identifying, analyzing, making and managing the partnership\u2019s investments. There\u2019s no requirement they contribute capital to receive the carried interest. The fact that the ultimate amount of compensation may not be known for years is no different from the kind of compensation received by many people who still have to pay ordinary income tax rates.What\u2019s at stake here, besides basic fairness, is billions of dollars in potential tax revenue. The Obama administration estimates that ending the break would generate an additional $15 billion over 10 years. Others put the number much higher. Victor Fleischer, a tax expert, law professor at the University of San Diego and a contributor to DealBook in The New York Times, estimates the number at $50 billion.Greg Mankiw, the Harvard professor and economist who advised the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, told me flatly this week, \u201cMuch carried interest income is really compensation for labor services and should be treated as such.\u201dPresident Obama has called for closing the carried interest loophole in every budget proposal, including this year\u2019s, and legislation has been repeatedly introduced to treat carried interest like ordinary income. While Republicans in Congress (and some prominent Democrats) have consistently blocked these efforts, usually on grounds that they\u2019re opposed to any tax increase, few have actually defended the provision.Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, in his tax reform proposal, proposed the elimination of loopholes to lower the overall tax rate, a so-called revenue-neutral approach that\u2019s consistent with the Republican\u2019s pledge not to raise taxes. While Mr. Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee and Mr. Romney\u2019s vice-presidential running mate, hasn\u2019t said exactly which loopholes need to be plugged, it\u2019s hard to imagine that any meaningful rate reduction could be achieved without changing the treatment of carried interest.This week, I spoke to Mr. Camp, who is cautiously optimistic that tax reform could be one of the signature achievements of the next Congress. \u201cThe leaders of both parties have been talking about what we can do, and every list has tax reform on it,\u201d he said. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of member interest in this because tax reform is one of the ways we can drive the economy and make people\u2019s lives better. That\u2019s what this election was about.\u201dThe congressman said he explicitly mentioned carried interest in his proposal, even though he knew it would set off opposition, because \u201cthis needs to be on the table.\u201d He added: \u201cWe need to debate it and we need to do something about it. That\u2019s why I put it in there.\u201d He said many Republican members of Congress have privately told him they agree, and \u201ceven people in the industry agree we need reform, though they won\u2019t say that publicly.\" He can afford to be more outspoken, since he didn\u2019t run for re-election and will retire at the end of this congressional term.Mr. Camp called on the Treasury to come forward with detailed proposals. \u201cA lot of work has already been done on this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know the president\u2019s overall framework, but we don\u2019t have the details. Our plan is out there and it\u2019s very detailed. There\u2019s a lot we can negotiate. Let\u2019s look for policies that will spur growth and are good for the country.\u201dProfessor Fleischer said he believed that tax reform, and specifically, treating carried interest like ordinary income, \u201cstill has a real chance in Congress.\u201d Though the beneficiaries of the carried interest loophole tend to be big political donors, \u201cthere\u2019s no grass-roots support for the favorable treatment of carried interest,\u201d he said. \u201cThe story of income inequality in the United States is driven by the top 1 percent of the 1 percent,\u201d he said, \"and these are the people who are benefiting from carried interest. They\u2019re hedge fund managers on Wall Street, not the Bill Gateses and Mark Zuckerbergs of the world, who you want people to emulate. So you can imagine the left wing of the Democratic Party and the right wing of the Republican Party coming together on this, as an issue of Main Street versus Wall Street.\u201dProfessor Shaviro said he was pessimistic about the chances for change, but he, too, thought tax reform and elimination of the carried interest loophole could be popular across party lines. \u201cGiven that it\u2019s the superrich who benefit, you can imagine how symbolic this could be in the hands of a skilled orator,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

This highlights that not only is the intensity of terrorism increasing, its breadth is increasing as well.\u201d\u201cTerrorism is both highly concentrated as well as a globally distributed phenomenon,\u201d it added. But the report noted that only 5 percent of fatalities ascribed to terrorism had occurred in the 34-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which includes some of the world\u2019s wealthiest, industrialized economies.The report seemed to indicate that, for four years beginning in 2007, efforts to confront terrorism had resulted in \u201cmodest decreases.\u201d But in 2011, the year a Navy SEAL team killed Osama bin Laden at his hide-out in Pakistan, and when Syria\u2019s civil war began, the number of terrorism-related deaths began to rise sharply.The impact of the turmoil in Syria has spread across the region, strengthening Islamist groups opposed to the government of President Bashar al-Assad, including the Qaeda affiliate Al Nusra Front and the Islamic State.The report tallied fatalities to the end of 2013 and did not therefore reflect the rise in killings since Islamic State forces in June spilled from Syria into Iraq with the intention of creating an Islamic caliphate, provoking an American-led air campaign.The rise of the Islamic State has also been marked by an increase in the number of foreign jihadis \u2014 many from Western nations \u2014 joining its ranks. In its report on Tuesday, the Institute for Economics and Peace did not refer specifically to foreign combatants but said the Islamic State campaign was \u201cunderpinned by greater territorial ambitions in the Levant,\u201d magnifying \u201cthe risk of further destabilization in the Middle East region.\u201dThe latest evidence of the role of foreigners emerged on Monday when a Briton and a Frenchman were tentatively identified among a group of executioners seen in video clips announcing Mr. Kassig\u2019s death.On Tuesday, however, The Times of London reported that an expert\u2019s analysis showed that the Briton had not been among the uniformed militants shown in the images. Initially, a British father had said he believed his son, Nasser Muthana, had been one of the bearded men standing over a row of kneeling Syrian captives.But The Times quoted the father, Ahmed Muthana, as retracting his earlier remarks. \u201cI looked at the lineup and I didn\u2019t recognize my son. One of them looked like him but the eyes and nose are different,\u201d he was quoted as saying.On Monday, Yvette Cooper, the Labour spokeswoman on home affairs in Britain, accused the government of \u201ccompletely\u201d failing to manage terrorism suspects lured by the Islamic State.Speaking in Parliament, she said that a 26-year-old man from North London whose passport had been confiscated by the authorities was able to board a truck, leave the country and acquire fake travel documents in Belgium that enabled him to travel to Syria.On Tuesday, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain scheduled a closed-door meeting of the Cobra committee, a group of the most senior officials dealing with national security.Advertisement"}

Nevertheless, Germany has yet to join eight other European Union countries, including France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, in adopting quotas for women on corporate boards.Ms. Merkel said a bill requiring that women make up at least 30 percent of the nonexecutive members of each supervisory board, beginning in 2016, will be introduced in Parliament on Dec. 11, where it is virtually assured of passage. The law would cover about 100 companies.Collectively, women now account for 22 percent of nonexecutive positions on the boards of the 30 companies listed in Germany\u2019s DAX stock market index.If companies fail to meet the requirement, vacant posts will stay empty until women are found to fill them, said Manuela Schwesig, the family affairs minister and a Social Democrat. \u201cThat is a very tough sanction,\u201d Ms. Schwesig said, adding that fines are not as effective because companies can easily absorb them. \u201cI am sure that in the end no chair will remain vacant, because there are enough women who are qualified to do exactly these important jobs.\u201dMs. Schwesig came under attack on Tuesday from Volker Kauder, leader of the parliamentary faction of Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats and their Bavarian partners, who told the news media: \u201cThe families minister should stop whining and get on with implementing the coalition agreement.\u201dSigmar Gabriel, Germany\u2019s vice chancellor and a Social Democrat, shot back, \u201cIf the bill touches a nerve with men then it is the men who have a problem.\u201dYasmin Fahimi, general secretary of the Social Democrats, said Mr. Kauder \u201cused unspeakable macho language.\u201dWomen are still absent from some areas of the German economy, especially big business, despite concerted efforts by leading companies like Deutsche Telekom to promote them. The belief that women should worry about children, cooking and church still holds sway, particularly if families can afford to live on one salary. In western Germany, many schools are in session until lunchtime, when children return home, making it hard for mothers to work. In the formerly Communist east, kindergartens and child care in general are more likely to be provided by the state.Ms. Schwesig told the Deutschlandfunk radio station on Wednesday that the new law \u201cis an important step for equal rights because it will introduce a culture shift in the work world.\u201dHeiko Maas, the minister of justice and a Social Democrat, expressed confidence that women would now join German boards. \u201cThe story that there are not enough women can really only be told to people who have remained spiritually stuck in the last century,\u201d he said on ZDF television.While the United States has avoided mandating diversity quotas for executive boards, there is general acceptance that women, including mothers, often have to work. In Britain, companies are urged to ensure board diversity but there is no mandate to do so.Norway was the first European country to impose quotas, and France mandates that 20 percent of nonexecutive director positions go to women, rising to 40 percent by 2017.The share of women on the boards of the 40 companies in France\u2019s CAC 40 stock index more than doubled to 29.7 in October 2013, from 12.3 percent three years earlier. The 28-member European Union is aiming for 40 percent female nonexecutive board membership by 2020.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Those Artsy Early Birds Flew Away ", "Date": "2014-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is Paris in the \u201920s and that guy down the block is Picasso,\u201d Mr. Snitzer said at the time. Yet by 2009, Perrotin had ceased regular exhibitions in Miami, turning off the lights completely the following year. Several other leading galleries that opened in the wake of Art Basel\u2019s 2002 arrival have also shut down, while many of the city\u2019s most promising younger artists have decamped to New York and Los Angeles in search of greener career pastures. Some blame rising rents that have scattered a once-cohesive art community, while others point to a dearth of local collectors and visiting Basel-ites interested in owning their work. Without that bigger pool of buyers, they say, there\u2019s no way to sustain artists amid the continued expansion of the art scene.Yet despite awards and commissions, he felt stuck. \u201cAll the collectors there who were going to support me had already bought my work,\u201d said Mr. Rodriguez, known for prankish projects that include burying himself up to his neck on a museum\u2019s front lawn. \u201cI had tapped into every well I could, and it just wasn\u2019t enough.\u201dBut now that he\u2019s in Los Angeles, he said, advertising agencies and Silicon Valley clients who once ignored him are lining up. This winter, he will get $50,000 from a company behind a new travel app to drive cross-country and \u201cvirtually\u201d write his name across America. \u201cI\u2019ve made more money in the last three years in Los Angeles than in the previous 10 in Miami,\u201d he said. Mr. Snitzer pointed to his own ledger: only 30 percent of his sales are to Miamians. That number dips to 15 percent for more expensive pieces, in the mid five figures. \u201cIf Art Basel had to depend on local sales,\u201d he said, \u201cthey never would have stayed.\u201d The buying power represented by Art Basel Miami Beach should be obvious. After all, money continues to pour into the art economy, with more than $2 billion exchanging hands in New York\u2019s November auctions alone. The Miami Beach fair remains one of the art world\u2019s most conspicuous showcases, drawing more than 75,000 attendees in 2013, organizers said. The fair itself is only one part of Miami Art Week, which now includes two dozen satellite fairs hoping to pull in the moneyed spillover, as well as a dizzying array of brunches, dinners and luxury-steeped parties. \u201cThen there are some people who come just for the parties,\u201d she added with a laugh, \u201cand the hell with the art.\u201dWith all this background noise, the only sure way for local artists to reach serious collectors would seem to be at the main fair, inside Miami Beach\u2019s convention center. But of the 267 vetted galleries there this year, only two are from Miami, the same number as in 2013, and down from the peak of five in 2004. Mr. Snitzer has borne the brunt of local criticism over this situation: He is the sole Florida member of the fair\u2019s selection committee (a shifting body of 10 to 12 gallerists from New York to Berlin), and the only Miami gallerist to have exhibited in the fair since its inception; some rival dealers have accused him of boxing them out. He bristled at the accusation, insisting it was simply a matter of maintaining an international level of quality and competition. He added wryly that for all his supposed influence, his own gallery still hasn\u2019t passed muster with the selection committee of Art Basel\u2019s flagship fair held every June in Switzerland. Mr. Snitzer\u2019s advice to rejected Miami galleries? Apply to one of the many satellite fairs in Miami. \u201cThey all make money,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying the only place I can go to college is Harvard.\u201dEmerson Dorsch is bypassing the fairs altogether this year, concentrating on a sprawling installation back at its gallery in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami, featuring the local artists Hugo Montoya and Brandon Opalka.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do something different than cramming our ideas into a 10-by-20-foot booth,\u201d Ms. Emerson-Dorsch said. \u201cThe best investment you can make as a gallery is in your real estate.\u201d This isn\u2019t just a question of aesthetics. The same art-powered gentrification at play from Williamsburg in Brooklyn to the Mission District in San Francisco has hit Wynwood with a vengeance. In an all-too-familiar exodus, many of the galleries and artist studios that once defined Wynwood as Miami\u2019s art neighborhood have moved out, unable to afford the soaring rents. Unlike Emerson Dorsch, a pioneer in the area, few had bought their buildings.But Mrs. Schneiderman wanted a deed, certain that sweetheart leases wouldn\u2019t last. Last month, capitalizing on Lincoln Road\u2019s overhaul into a premiere retail destination, the ArtCenter sold its first building for $88 million. Even after spending part of the profit on a new studio complex in a much cheaper neighborhood, the ArtCenter will still have an endowment larger than any other museum or visual arts group in Miami, providing an enviable long-term measure of security. The rest of Miami\u2019s art scene has hardly been shy in telling the ArtCenter\u2019s board members exactly how \u2014 and in what new neighborhood \u2014 they should be spending their windfall. These behind-closed-doors conversations have been tense, with some suggesting ArtCenter jettison its artist-driven, studio-focused mission in favor of a much grander vision.\u201cToo many people are obsessed with chasing the next hippest, newest thing,\u201d said Kristen Thiele, an ArtCenter board member as well as a former resident artist there. Ms. Thiele cited the core ideas first laid out by Mrs. Schneiderman: Artists need cheap studio space, the ability to sell their work \u2014 out of those same studios, if necessary \u2014 and, not least, \u201cthe genuine sense of community that comes from being surrounded by your fellow artists with trained eyes.\u201dThere\u2019s nothing especially revolutionary about Mrs. Schneiderman\u2019s thinking. Still, for the Miami painter John Sanchez, it\u2019s been more than he could have ever hoped for. Originally represented by Emerson Dorsch, he felt his rain-slicked urban landscapes were falling out of step with that gallery\u2019s turn toward an art-theory laden program. \u201cI\u2019m a realist painter,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to paint everyday moments as beautifully as I can. It\u2019s not rocket science.\u201d By contrast, at the ArtCenter, just by dint of being on a heavily trafficked street, he said, \u201cI got a vast amount of exposure to people from everywhere, not just those in the know.\u201d He\u2019s since picked up both sales and fresh brushwork techniques. Having found a formula for survival as an artist, he\u2019s hoping to move into the ArtCenter\u2019s remaining Lincoln Road building.\u201cI want to be like mold,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI want to stay.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I remember roasted turkeys and hams, homemade stuffing and cranberry sauce, collard greens and candied yams, pecan and pumpkin pies, and my joyful mother in the center of it all.She carried that spirit into weekday meals, too, cooking Cornish hens and rice pilaf, or eggplant parmigiana and garlic bread, or Bahamian specialties like fried fish and plantains. Having a working mother who was happy in the kitchen seemed completely natural when I was in middle school on Staten Island. I never imagined that I would be any different.But these days, I must confess, dinnertime sometimes fills me with dread. Don\u2019t get me wrong; I\u2019ve cooked some wonderful holiday meals for my husband and our two boys. I have been creative \u2014 sometimes \u2014 during the workweek, too.Maybe you know the feeling? The struggle to find the time, energy and money to regularly prepare fresh, healthy, home-cooked meals frames the working lives of many parents in New York City and beyond.The sociologists, who conducted in-depth interviews with 150 mothers, understand that everyone wants Americans to live healthier lives. But they argued that the home-cooking message ignores the time pressures, financial constraints and feeding challenges faced by working parents, particularly in an unsettled economy when many people are working multiple jobs with long and unpredictable hours.\u201cSuggesting that we return to the kitchen en masse will do little more than increase the burden so many women already bear,\u201d the sociologists wrote.Some parents are embracing that message, turning away from processed foods and fast foods.Karen Roos, an environmental educator and mother of three, who grew up a few blocks from me on Staten Island and still lives there, did just that a couple of years ago. No more supermarket roasted chickens, no more chicken nuggets, no more McDonald\u2019s.\u201cIt\u2019s not even a thought any more to consider eating that,\u201d said Ms. Roos, who cooks most nights. Kelly Ann Harris, a lawyer who lives in Maplewood, N.J., said she loved the idea of cooking regularly for her 6-year-old daughter, but simply could not find the time. \u201cHow the heck am I going to work full time, food shop, cook, do laundry, interact with my child and actually sleep?\u201d she asked.But for many families, that\u2019s simply not an option.\u201cFirst lady Obama has a full staff to prepare her meals,\u201d said Lashauna Brown, a single mother in Harlem who works as a case manager for a nonprofit agency. \u201cAs long my child is not starving or being neglected, who cares how he is fed.\u201dThis is not an easy subject. For some of us, it stirs up feelings of guilt and shame when we consider the gap between the parents we are and the parents we wish we could be.I strive to cook more, just like my mother, who worked as a teacher, school administrator and superintendent. I also strive to be kinder to myself about my limitations. So on Thanksgiving Day, you\u2019ll find my family shuttling from my in-laws in the Bronx to the place where I feel most at home during this holiday season: at my parents\u2019 table, on Staten Island.I won\u2019t be feeling guilty. Several months ago, my 7-year-old son brought home a card he had written for me in school that began, \u201cI love my mom because she is such a good cooker.\u201dSometimes what we do just might be enough.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Food Safety and Worker Safety Are Inextricably Linked", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:Forward-thinking companies like Costco Wholesale and Bon App\u00e9tit Management have joined forces with growers, farmworker unions and consumer groups to develop a new certification program that incentivizes workers in the produce industry to make food safety a priority at the point of harvest.This multi-stakeholder strategy is good for consumers, companies and workers alike, and could well be applied to the other high-risk sectors of the food economy that Mr. Gersen and Mr. Sachs identify. The writer is director of the Equitable Food Initiative at Oxfam America. To the Editor:Jacob E. Gersen and Benjamin I. Sachs make a compelling case for stronger worker protections in food production and service industries, but they perpetuate the idea that workers are responsible for much of the burden of food-borne illness in the United States.Workers are part of a chain of pathogen transmission that begins on farms (both crop and livestock); moves into slaughter and processing plants where little is done to reduce pathogen carriage on animals, carcasses and products; and then moves finally to wholesale and consumer markets. During this process, after the so-called hazard control point, workers are exposed to these pathogens as they make our food.Research by us and others demonstrates that worker safety and food safety are inextricably related. The fragmentation of authority among the Agriculture Department, the Food and Drug Administration and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, along with recent regulatory changes in oversight, obscure the real origins of these risks as well as opportunities to control them.

They will repeal health care reform. They will roll back new regulations on banks and Wall Street. They will stop the Obama administration\u2019s plans to curb coal emissions and reform immigration and invest in education.Mr. McConnell was assisted in this goal by the president\u2019s own second-term stumbles \u2014 most notably the disastrous rollout of the Affordable Care Act last year, an indecisive foreign policy, and revelations of domestic surveillance and improper veterans care. Republicans were also able to exploit nativist fears about immigrant children crossing at the southern border and some initial troubles in responding to the first domestic cases of Ebola.In some races, missteps by the Democrats helped Republicans. In Iowa, Representative Bruce Braley may have cost himself the race by making a belittling comment about farmers. In Kentucky, Alison Lundergan Grimes didn\u2019t establish a reputation for candor when she refused to discuss her previous votes for president.Virtually all Democratic candidates distanced themselves from Mr. Obama and refused to make the case that there has been substantial progress on jobs and economic growth under this administration. But Republicans also had little to say about reviving the economy, and their idea of creating jobs seems to be limited to building the Keystone XL oil pipeline, cutting taxes further and crying \u201crepeal Obamacare\u201d at every opportunity.In theory, full control of Congress might give Republicans an incentive to reach compromise with Mr. Obama because they will need to show that they can govern rather than obstruct. They might, for example, be able to find agreement on a free-trade agreement with Pacific nations. But their caucuses in the Senate and the House will be more conservative than before, and many winning candidates will feel obliged to live up to their promises of obstruction.

{"Headline": "Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller, Released by North Korea, Are Back on U.S. Soil", "Date": "2014-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 North Korea released two Americans who had been accused of trying to subvert the secretive state, after the director of national intelligence for the United States flew to the country on a secret mission and left on Saturday with the men aboard his aircraft.The plane carrying the Americans \u2014 Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller \u2014 and the national intelligence director, James R. Clapper Jr., landed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, Wash., about 9:15 p.m. Pacific time on Saturday.Mr. Bae walked off the plane and into the embrace of relatives on the tarmac. Mr. Miller, his head shaved, sprinted down the steps into the arms of his parents, who were waiting for him at the bottom.Securing the releases was an unusual role for Mr. Clapper, the nation\u2019s most senior intelligence official, whose job is to coordinate policy and operations among the nation\u2019s 16 spy agencies. Gruff, blunt-speaking and seen by many in the Obama administration as a throwback to the Cold War, the retired general is an unlikely diplomat but, in the words of one American official, \u201cperfect for the North Koreans.\u201dMr. Bae, 46, had been held for two years after he was detained on charges of using a Christian evangelical organization, Youth with a Mission, to preach against the North Korean government and planning a \u201creligious coup d'\u00e9tat.\u201d After a brief trial, he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor on a farm, raising concerns about his fragile health.Mr. Miller, 25, entered North Korea seven months ago and reportedly tore up his visa, and by some accounts sought asylum. He was charged with unruly behavior, and North Korean officials suspected he was trying to get inside one of the country\u2019s feared prison camps, to write about it later.Together with the release last month of Jeffrey E. Fowle, who had been held for six months, the decision to let the two Americans go is the latest evidence that Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s unpredictable and untested young leader, is trying his first approaches to the Obama administration since taking power. Officials would not say whether Mr. Clapper traveled with a letter from President Obama \u2014 which would be a usual approach \u2014 but a senior administration official said he \u201cwas there to listen,\u201d and to \u201creiterate our views.\u201dMr. Obama said Saturday that \u201cwe\u2019re very grateful for their safe return,\u201d and praised Mr. Clapper for successfully completing what he called \u201ca challenging mission.\u201dIn fact, the specter of Mr. Clapper\u2019s flying into the last stronghold of hard-line communist dictatorship may be the director\u2019s best chance to revise a national image that was bruised when he was asked, in an open congressional hearing, whether intelligence officials collected data about ordinary Americans. \u201cNo sir,\u201d he responded. \u201cNot wittingly.\u201dMonths later the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, made clear that, in the most charitable interpretation, Mr. Clapper had issued a misleading statement to protect classified programs; he later conceded in a letter that \u201cmy response was clearly erroneous.\u201dThe administration issued almost no details of the trip to North Korea, saying communications from Pyongyang were so scant that they did not immediately know what had taken place in the discussion. It was also not clear whether Mr. Clapper had spoken directly with Mr. Kim or had seen other North Korean leaders; Mr. Kim disappeared from public view this summer with what now appears to have been a painful leg ailment.Mr. Clapper rarely announces his schedule and can travel with little notice. But last week he canceled, at the last moment, a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. He left shortly after that on his trip to the North.Sending high-level emissaries to the North is a long tradition; in Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, former President Bill Clinton went to secure the release of two American journalists who had been seized on a trip along the Chinese border with the North. But Mr. Clinton\u2019s trip led to no fundamental change in relations, which have been in a deep freeze since the North conducted a nuclear weapons test, its second, in May 2009, just months into Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency. One of Mr. Obama\u2019s top Asia aides, Jeffrey A. Bader, said then that the test made everyone in the White House \u201cNorth Korea hawks.\u201dMr. Obama has not attempted the kind of broad engagement that he has pursued so vigorously with Iran, responding to the North\u2019s provocations by pursuing a policy of freezing the country out of the international economy, in hopes the regime will eventually implode.But with the Iran nuclear negotiations approaching a major deadline, and the possibility of a new dialogue to test whether Mr. Kim\u2019s advances are sincere, Mr. Obama has a chance to make some headway with two countries that have posed both nuclear and human rights challenges to the United States and its allies.The president leaves on Sunday for China, North Korea\u2019s last protector. Presumably the subject of how to deal with Mr. Kim, about whom Chinese leaders have expressed suspicion and disdain, will come up in meetings with President Xi Jinping.Mr. Bae and Mr. Miller\u2019s plane touched down Saturday night, backlit by a nearly full moon dimmed by fast-moving clouds. Mr. Bae emerged first, and was swarmed by about a dozen relatives and friends. He paused for hugs then continued inside, out of sight of the row of news cameras lined up about 100 yards away. After a few minutes, Mr. Miller came out, greeted by a smaller welcoming committee.At a news conference, Mr. Bae thanked the Obama administration, officials in North Korea and everyone who prayed for him and his family while he was detained. \u201cI just want to say thank you all for supporting me and lifting me up at the same time that I was not forgetting the people of North Korea,\u201d he said.Speaking of his ordeal, he said, \u201cI learned a lot. I grew a lot. I lost a lot of weight, in a good way.\u201d Some people in the room chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m standing strong because of you,\u201d he added. Mr. Miller did not appear.Mr. Miller, of Bakersfield, Calif., had seemed a bit lost in the interviews he had been allowed to conduct for American television from the North. He went through a brief trial this fall; photos released by the North showed him with eyes downcast, and flanked by uniformed security officials.He was accused of entering North Korea with the \u201cambition\u201d to deliberately violate North Korean law so he could experience life in a North Korean prison and become a firsthand witness about the human rights conditions in the North, The Associated Press and The Choson Sinbo, a South Korean paper, reported at the time of the trial.That may have touched a nerve. In recent weeks a top North Korean diplomat, Jang il-Hun, met in New York with a group of Americans to argue that a United Nations report documenting the North\u2019s extensive prison camp system was based on fabrications.That report described \u201cwidespread, systematic and gross\u201d violations, including enslavement, torture, rape and executions in the prison camps.The ambassador seemed concerned that Mr. Kim could face charges at the International Criminal Court for human rights violations, and he said the North had only \u201cordinary prisons,\u201d like those in the United States. \u201cIn my country we don\u2019t even know the term \u2018political prisoners,' \u201d said Mr. Jang, a 32-year veteran of the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs.South Korea seized upon the release of the Americans to urge North Korea to free a South Korean missionary held there. In May, North Korea sentenced Kim Jong-uk, a Baptist missionary, to life in a labor camp for allegedly trying to build underground churches in the North.Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea, Ashley Southall from New York, and Stacey Solie from Joint Base Lewis-McChord.Advertisement"}

That is even in critical posts like the Defense and Interior Ministries, responsible for running the war effort, and the Economy and Finance Ministries, which must deal with a catastrophic budget shortfall and a deepening economic crisis.\u201cBoth sides have supporters expecting to receive a share of the power, and both sides are negotiating to maximize their position,\u201d said a senior Afghan official familiar with the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential. No breakthrough was in sight, the official said.They agreed on an equitable allocation of cabinet choices and other government positions, but the details of who would fill the jobs were left until inauguration \u2014 and those talks are now dragging on.\u201cBusinessmen are worried that the disagreement on a new government will continue until the end of the national unity government\u2019s term,\u201d said Hajji Najeebullah Akhtary, who until recently was the president of the Moneychangers Union in Kabul.Some Afghans see the spectator-friendly activity by their government executives at least in part as a distraction from the impasse. \u201cWith the bottleneck, the government has no real activities to perform, and by visiting bomb sites and other minor stuff they\u2019re trying to make it look like they\u2019re busy doing something,\u201d said Waheed, 26, an inventory manager for a charitable agency here who goes by just one name.\u201cSince all the ministers and governors are acting employees, none of them are taking their responsibilities seriously anymore, and the country is going through a very hard time,\u201d said Hajji Janan, a former council member from Wardak Province.Still, even those who are critical see positives to the one-upmanship at the top, given that the usual complaint against the Afghan government is that it has been unresponsive to everyday Afghans.\u201cThe election created competition between them, and now they are competing to prove who is more proactive and has got more popular support,\u201d Waheed said.At the United Nations aid drive, Mark Bowden, the agency\u2019s humanitarian coordinator in Afghanistan, was appreciative. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had such a stellar cast from the government side attending this event,\u201d he said. The United Nations is trying to get foreign donors to contribute toward its $405 million goal for aid to refugees, disaster victims and malnourished Afghans.Last week, Mr. Dostum publicly donated blood for the military and made sure 300 of his guards and followers did so also. (Mr. Ghani donated a month earlier.)And after years of rarely, if ever, meeting journalists, Mr. Dostum on Monday gathered a group of them in honor of the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists. He spoke about how he supported women\u2019s rights and a free press, and even announced plans to start a fund with his own money to provide for needy or ailing journalists.But he added that journalists who desecrated religion would get no mercy. \u201cI will strangle such a person myself,\u201d he said.Jawad Sukhanyar and Ahmad Shakib contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emissions Loophole Stays Open in E.U.", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe decision, at a summit meeting of European leaders on climate and energy policy, followed warnings by industry lobby groups that manufacturers, threatened with having to pay more for emitting carbon dioxide in Europe and under pressure from global competition, would shift their most polluting operations elsewhere \u2014 an avoidance strategy known as carbon leakage.Safeguarding against carbon leakage, according to industry lobbyists, is necessary not only to protect jobs and investments, but also to avoid transferring greenhouse gas emissions to countries with environmental regulations that are more lax.\u201cExisting measures will continue after 2020 to prevent the risk of carbon leakage due to climate policy,\u201d said a statement issued Oct. 24, after the meeting.The measures referred to are contained in a so-called carbon leakage list of vulnerable industrial sectors that allows many manufacturers a broad exemption from paying costs imposed by the European Trading System for carbon emission permits, introduced in 2005.The system, which applies to industries responsible for about 45 percent of European carbon emissions, sets emission allowances for them \u2014 some doled out free every year and some that must be paid for if needed \u2014 that are reduced over time. Light polluters can sell their allowances and heavy polluters must buy them \u2014 a carrot-and-stick method of cutting emissions that raises production costs for heavy polluters.Yet, evidence suggests that carbon leakage concerns may be overblown and that too many European polluters are getting what amounts to unnecessary carbon mitigation immunity under the leakage list.\u201cThe list you have now is very unfocused and very broad,\u201d Andrei Marcu, head of the Carbon Market Forum in the Center for European Policy Studies, a policy research institute in Brussels, said in an interview last month.Including smelters, cement producers, miners and glass makers, sectors on the list are responsible for about a fifth of the Continent\u2019s total emissions.Their emission allowances will be capped and gradually reduced, but they will pay very little of the costs attached to carbon abatement.\u201cI\u2019m not against giving away, but if you give everything away all the time you lose credibility,\u201d Hans Bolscher, an associate partner in Ecorys, a consulting firm based in the Netherlands, said in an interview. Mr. Bolscher led a study of the available carbon leakage evidence for the European Commission last year.Meanwhile, the free emission allowances of sectors of the economy that are not open to global competition and can thus pass costs on more easily to their customers \u2014 power suppliers for example, and intra-Europe airlines \u2014 will be cut 37.5 percent by 2020, and will be cut further through 2030.The result has been to treat some polluters, like cement makers, more leniently than others and to distort Europe\u2019s carbon market. An overabundance of allowances, and a lack of buyers for them \u2014 the result of economic weakness and the leakage list exemptions \u2014 \u201crisks undermining the efficacy of the carbon market and reducing investment incentives for low-carbon technologies, possibly delaying relevant innovations and making mitigation more expensive in the longer term,\u201d said Ricardo Mel\u00e9ndez, chief executive of the International Center for Trade and Sustainable Development, a non-profit organization in Geneva.Although industry has lobbied hard to defend the leakage protection that they say is indispensable if they are to remain competitive in global markets, climate change policies \u201care a minor factor\u201d in relocations or foreign investment decisions, Mr. Bolscher said.Investments abroad happen \u201cmostly as a result of shifting markets,\u201d he said. Other factors include labor costs, proximity to markets and raw materials, and the growth potential of foreign markets.The draft assessment, leaked in September, called for \u201cmore targeted support to sectors deemed to be at risk of carbon leakage\u201d and urged the need for a \u201cgood balance between competitiveness and emission reduction incentives.\u201dStill, important as it may be, the reduction in demand for carbon allowances resulting from the leakage list is only part of a larger structural problem, both critics and supporters of the European trading system say.The system was designed to deliver a gradual reduction in allowances but not to handle economic shocks. While the supply of carbon credits is fixed by an annual allocation process, demand for them fluctuates with the economy.Demand slumped after the 2008 recession, with emissions from industries subjected to the trading system plummeting more than 10 percent. At the same time, internationally sourced carbon credits from other emission reduction programs poured into the European market. As a result, a glut of 2.1 billion carbon credits has accumulated.In a still stagnant economy, emissions have continued to fall, and with them demand for allowances. After a 3 percent decrease in 2013, emissions this year are projected to drop perhaps another 4.4 percent, according to Sandbag, an environmental activist group that campaigns for reform of the trading system.In 2008, before the recession, carbon allowances on the European market traded as high as 30 euros, or about $46, per allowance. But after the recession struck, the price collapsed, falling below \u20ac3 in early 2013. It now hovers around \u20ac6 and most forecasts point to only a modest rise, to about \u20ac10 before 2020.Unless prices rise significantly, the European carbon trading system is \u201cgoing to exist as a low tax for a large number of players, giving a weak incentive to abate, but it won\u2019t drive innovation and efficiency and new policies will be needed,\u201d said Bryony Worthington, Baroness Worthington, the founder of Sandbag and a life member of the British upper house of Parliament.While carbon prices and the leakage list are not directly linked, cutting the free allocation of allowances is critical to fixing the trading system, some experts say. About half of all allocations will remain free through 2020, including those on the carbon leakage list.The European Union argues that it is addressing oversupply in the market through other means. The European Commission this year started temporarily withholding 900 million allowances, covering half a year\u2019s worth of European emissions, until the end of the decade to prop up carbon prices \u2014 a move that has so far had little effect on the market.The commission has also proposed setting aside millions of surplus allowances in 2021 into a so-called market stability reserve but no decision on that is likely until next year.Some experts argue meanwhile that the market\u2019s problems and leakage are separate issues. \u201cCarbon leakage is not about carbon prices today,\u201d Mr. Marcu said. \u201cIn reality it\u2019s about investments that are based on 30-year periods.\u201dThe leakage list will be reviewed again in 2019 and changes to the inclusion criteria are already under consideration.But few expect significant tightening in the leakage list criteria, in part because Europe\u2019s weak economic recovery is still holding down emissions anyway, making the issue moot in the short term, and partly because much uncertainty remains over the global commitment to fighting climate change.The protection for industry afforded by the list, European leaders said in last month\u2019s statement, will be extended through 2030, \u201cas long as no comparable efforts are undertaken in other major economies.\u201dFor all that, Europe still needs to fix its carbon market, through reforms of the list or otherwise, environmental and sustainability campaigners say.\u201cClearly something needs to be done, or we might as well ditch any pretense that the E.T.S. is capable of driving positive change in Europe\u2019s journey to decarbonize its economy,\u201d Baroness Worthington wrote in a report published in October, referring to the European Trading System.\u201cWe continue to work with uncertainty on global action, but at the end of the day, we are trying to deal with a global problem and there needs to be a fix,\u201d said Mr. Melendez, of the International Center for Trade and Sustainable Development.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Liberal Treasury Nominee\u2019s Wall St. Prowess May Be a Vulnerability", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet in his Wall Street provenance, Mr. Weiss, President Obama\u2019s nominee to be under secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance, has given the left an unlikely rallying cry to press for a more aggressively liberal economic policy agenda.It is not Mr. Weiss\u2019s politics that are in question. It is his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201cI have voted for people who have extensive Wall Street experience,\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. She is rallying the opposition to Mr. Weiss, the head of investment banking at Lazard, a storied but relatively small firm. But, she said, \u201cthe Antonio Weiss nomination is a mistake, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m fighting back.\u201dThe formal confirmation process, while not likely to get underway until after the new Congress convenes next year, has become an unexpected proxy war between the liberal and moderate wings of the Democratic Party. Its outcome will say a lot about the party\u2019s direction as it regroups for the 2016 presidential campaign, in which Hillary Clinton will be under pressure to discard some of her ties to Wall Street. Mr. Weiss\u2019s assets are worth between $54 million and $203 million, according to his financial disclosure. In addition to his Manhattan apartment, he owns a 200-year-old, eight-bedroom farmhouse in Connecticut and property in the Dominican Republic valued at up to $1 million.\u201cThe American people are profoundly disappointed with the fraud they read about every day coming from Wall Street,\u201d said Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who is considering running for president as a Democrat to encourage the party to move to the left. \u201cThey are disgusted that instead of investing in the American economy, they are busy trying to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, and the American people want people in the Treasury Department who are prepared to hold Wall Street accountable.\u201dSupporters of Mr. Weiss, both inside and outside the Obama administration, see the brewing fight as no less consequential. Wall Street executives lend the Treasury Department real-world expertise to understand how policy proposals might be gamed by the banks and investment houses they are aimed at.If the Elizabeth Warren wing of the party can bring Mr. Weiss down, they say, prominent financiers may no longer play a significant role in Democratic administrations, which have turned to them since the Clinton years to bolster their business bona fides.\u201cIf the rules post-financial crisis were that the one place you shouldn\u2019t go for help is the private sector, particularly the financial sector, that would be a pretty dangerous thing,\u201d a senior Treasury official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Gene B. Sperling, a former senior economic policy maker in the Obama and Clinton White Houses, said: \u201cHe has a good progressive heart. He has hardheaded practical business experience.\u201d Mr. Weiss declined to comment for this article, citing his pending confirmation hearings.No deal is causing more trouble for him than Burger King\u2019s \u201cinversion\u201d merger with Tim Hortons, which came just as the Treasury was proposing new rules to stop American companies from reincorporating as foreign entities not subject to United States taxes. Lazard itself gave up its United States citizenship in 2005 to reincorporate in Bermuda, using a loophole that the Bush administration later closed to deter copycats.\u201cOn the policy on whether or not companies should move overseas to avoid U.S. taxation when there\u2019s not a core business reason for the move, that\u2019s something we think is wrong,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s something he thinks is wrong.\u201dMr. Weiss\u2019s defenders in the administration say the Burger King deal was not really an inversion, in which a large American company adopts a foreign headquarters in name only. But it still sticks in Democratic craws. Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Senate\u2019s second-ranking Democrat, cited his work on such deals when he announced his opposition to Mr. Weiss\u2019s confirmation.Beyond Lazard, there is Mr. Weiss himself. To defenders like Ms. Tanden, his years in Europe made him acutely aware of the perils of wage stagnation and the obstacles to upward mobility. He grew up in New York, in a distinctly middle-class family. Both of his parents were teachers. He attended Yale and Harvard Business School, while also apprenticing under George Plimpton, the editor of The Paris Review.Where supporters see brio, detractors see a fat cat. Last week, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president Richard L. Trumka sent a letter to Lazard\u2019s compensation committee chairman, Philip A. Laskawy, via the company\u2019s Bermuda affiliate, questioning his decision to speed the vesting of equity income to ease Mr. Weiss\u2019s transition to public service. If he is confirmed as the under secretary, Mr. Weiss will receive $6 million to $30 million in stock that would normally accrue to him in 2017 and $3 million in interest income, according to the Project on Government Oversight.But beyond that is the Warren wing\u2019s belief that Democrats must realign their economic policies with the interests of working-class voters, particularly white men without college degrees, who have flocked to the Republican Party in recent years. The Democrats\u2019 attention should be focused on raising the minimum wage, funding infrastructure investments financed by higher taxes on the rich and, Ms. Warren adds, a new push to divide the big banks from their nonbanking activities.\u201cWe have got to be willing to make the government work for America\u2019s families,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cThat\u2019s the start of everything we do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Remember the Sand Creek Massacre", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorOn Nov. 29, 1864, as Union armies fought through Virginia and Georgia, Col. John Chivington led some 700 cavalry troops in an unprovoked attack on peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho villagers at Sand Creek in Colorado. They murdered nearly 200 women, children and older men.After news of the massacre spread, Evans and Chivington were forced to resign from their appointments. But neither faced criminal charges, and the government refused to compensate the victims or their families in any way. Indeed, Sand Creek was just one part of a campaign to take the Cheyenne\u2019s once vast land holdings across the region. A territory that had hardly any white communities in 1850 had, by 1870, lost many Indians, who were pushed violently off the Great Plains by white settlers and the federal government.These and other campaigns amounted to what is today called ethnic cleansing: an attempted eradication and dispossession of an entire indigenous population. Many scholars suggest that such violence conforms to other 20th-century categories of analysis, like settler colonial genocide and crimes against humanity.Sand Creek, Bear River and the Long Walk remain important parts of the Civil War and of American history. But in our popular narrative, the Civil War obscures such campaigns against American Indians. In fact, the war made such violence possible: The paltry Union Army of 1858, before its wartime expansion, could not have attacked, let alone removed, the fortified Navajo communities in the Four Corners, while Southern secession gave a powerful impetus to expand American territory westward. Territorial leaders like Evans were given more resources and power to negotiate with, and fight against, powerful Western tribes like the Shoshone, Cheyenne, Lakota and Comanche. The violence of this time was fueled partly by the lust for power by civilian and military leaders desperate to obtain glory and wartime recognition.Expansion continued after the war, powered by a revived American economy but also by a new spirit of national purpose, a sense that America, having suffered in the war, now had the right to conquer more peoples and territories.The United States has yet to fully recognize the violent destruction wrought against indigenous peoples by the Civil War and the Union Army. Connor and Evans have cities, monuments and plaques in their honor, as well as two universities and even Colorado\u2019s Mount Evans, home to the highest paved road in North America.Saturday\u2019s 150th anniversary will be commemorated many ways: The National Park Service\u2019s Sand Creek Massacre Historic Site, the descendant Cheyenne and Arapaho communities, other Native American community members and their non-Native supporters will commemorate the massacre. An annual memorial run will trace the route of Chivington\u2019s troops from Sand Creek to Denver, where an evening vigil will be held Dec. 2.The University of Denver and Northwestern are also reckoning with this legacy, creating committees that have recognized Evans\u2019s culpability. Like many academic institutions, both are deliberating how to expand Native American studies and student service programs. Yet the near-absence of Native American faculty members, administrators and courses reflects their continued failure to take more than partial steps.While the government has made efforts to recognize individual atrocities, it has a long way to go toward recognizing how deeply the decades-long campaign of eradication ran, let alone recognizing how, in the face of such violence, Native American nations and their cultures have survived. Few Americans know of the violence of this time, let alone the subsequent violation of Indian treaties, of reservation boundaries and of Indian families by government actions, including the half-century of forced removal of Indian children to boarding schools.One symbolic but necessary first step would be a National Day of Indigenous Remembrance and Survival, perhaps on Nov. 29, the anniversary of Sand Creek. Another would be commemorative memorials, not only in Denver and Evanston but in Washington, too. We commemorate \u201cdiscovery\u201d and \u201cexpansion\u201d with Columbus Day and the Gateway arch, but nowhere is there national recognition of the people who suffered from those \u201cachievements\u201d \u2014 and have survived amid continuing cycles of colonialism.An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the American Indian leader Black Kettle was killed in the Sand Creek Massacre. He died at the Battle of Washita in Oklahoma in 1868.\u00a0An Op-Ed article last Friday attributed an erroneous distinction to the Union general Patrick Edward Connor and the Colorado governor John Evans, who were involved in massacres of American Indians in the 1860s. There is no state capital named for them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Compact That Wins Style Points, but Misses the Bull\u2019s-Eye ", "Date": "2014-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the WheelThe Toyota Corolla isn\u2019t much different from a Nissan Sentra that looks like a Volkswagen Jetta or a Chevy Cruze and might as well be a Hyundai Elantra. Compact car buyers are obsessed with value, dependability and economy. Style? Not so much.Into this sea of sameness, Dodge dropped its chic Dart sedan two years ago, and it has not made much of a splash. It\u2019s rakish and sleek with curves where much of the competition has creases, fancy LED taillights and an interior that\u2019s distractingly self-conscious. It\u2019s new enough to be based on a post-Chrysler-merger platform from Fiat \u2014 the same bones underpin the Alfa Romeo Giulietta that\u2019s not sold in the United States \u2014 but is built in a Belvidere, Ill., plant that has churned out Chrysler vehicles since 1965.The Dart is attractive and distinctive, but no one seems to care. For each one of the 7,202 Darts that Dodge sold in October, Honda sold 3.4 of its robotic Civics. Chevy, Ford, Honda, Hyundai and Toyota all have cars in this mass-market class that regularly sell at rates of 15,000 to 20,000 or more, month in and month out.Italian heritage or not, the front-drive Dart is mechanically similar to virtually all the cars in its class. The structure is a steel unitized body with MacPherson strut front and multilink independent rear suspension and a 4-cylinder engine mounted crosswise in the nose.In the base $17,490 SE, the engine is the aluminum 2-liter Tigershark with dual overhead cams and variable timing on its 16 valves to produce 160 horsepower on regular-grade fuel.A step up is the $20,990 Aero, with a turbocharged 1.4-liter MultiAir engine that also makes 160 horsepower, albeit while burning premium. With a few aerodynamic tricks like a shuttered grille and a weight-saving reduction in fuel capacity, the Aero achieves an E.P.A. rating of 41 m.p.g. on the highway when equipped with the standard 6-speed manual transmission.Beyond that are the mainstream $19,790 SXT and the almost-luxurious $23,990 Limited \u2014 and my test car, a sporty GT with a starting price of $22,190. All three use a 2.4-liter version of the Tigershark rated at 184 horsepower. While a 6-speed manual is standard with the bigger engine, the test car had the 6-speed automatic that most buyers choose.The well-equipped test car, a 2014 model, was $23,735. The GT is the only Dart riding on 18-inch wheels, whose five-spoke design mixes well with the blacked-out trim to give the car a bit of muscular presence. But let\u2019s not get carried away: This isn\u2019t a Challenger or a Viper. It is, however, a big improvement over previous wimpy small Dodges like the Omni, Shadow and misbegotten Caliber. This is particularly true at the GT\u2019s tail, where the \u201cracetrack\u201d taillamps that run around the rear are complemented by dual exhaust outlets.Matching the exterior\u2019s exuberance is an interior that features well-shaped front bucket seats. The dash itself has an illuminated red trim line that encircles the instrumentation and visually alludes to the taillights. The circular speedometer and tachometer exist alongside each other on a 7-inch digital display, making them easy to scan in default mode. And if default isn\u2019t your style, the display can be reconfigured. If that\u2019s not enough digital distraction, the UConnect control system operates from an 8.4-inch display of its own in the center of the dash.With sweet details like black-chrome air vents and red accents on the door panels, there\u2019s inspired design almost everywhere inside and outside the Dart GT.Where the car disappoints is the driving. There\u2019s no spirit, no exhaust note and no joy in the engine\u2019s operation. The automatic transmission shifts indifferently, the electric power steering never seems directly connected to the tires and the ride is stiff without the compensation of great road adhesion. It\u2019s just not fun, particularly in comparison with the more powerful and supple Volkswagen GTI and Ford Focus ST.In testing by Motor Trend magazine, a 2014 Dart GT much like the one I drove was clocked at a languid 8.7 seconds from 0 to 60 m.p.h. With the automatic, the GT is rated at 22 m.p.g. in the city and 31 on the highway. In mostly city traffic, I averaged 22.2 m.p.g.Luxury car buyers shopping in the six-figure ether can afford to put style ahead of practical considerations. But most compact car buyers can\u2019t afford to buy on style alone. They\u2019re stretching to buy these cars, and high-quality brands like Toyota and Honda offer reassurance, while the Koreans come with 10-year warranties. That\u2019s the competition for the Dart, which carries a five-year, 100,000-mile drivetrain warranty and three-year, 36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper coverage.In 1963-76, the original compact Dart, alongside its near-twin, the Plymouth Valiant, was the go-to car for high-value shoppers. That\u2019s why the Dart name has resonance today. But resonance only takes you so far, and this new Dart still has a way to go.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The October Jobs Report Is Boring, in a (Mostly) Good Way", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Labor MarketThere was nothing surprising about Friday morning\u2019s report on the state of the American job market. And that\u2019s (mostly) good news.The labor market \u2014 and the economy more generally \u2014 has gained momentum as 2014 has progressed, judging from the readings of the job market. The latest numbers do not point to any acceleration of the trend, but neither do they point to deceleration. Rather, they reinforce what we thought we knew, and can give a bit of solace to anyone who interpreted a burst of financial market volatility last month as a sign that the economy was heading for the rocks.There were 214,000 net jobs added to employers\u2019 payrolls in October, a bit below the previous couple of months (and analyst expectations), but comfortably within the range of what you might expect given the results of the last few months. Over the last three months, job growth has averaged 224,000. Six-month average? 235,000. Twelve months? 220,000. That\u2019s about as steady as these things get.And the trends in the unemployment rate are similar. Joblessness has fallen steadily since October 2009, when it peaked at 10 percent, at a rate just a bit slower than 1 percentage point a year. That trend continued apace, with the rate ticking down to 5.8 percent from 5.9 percent. Perhaps even more welcome is that a broader measure of unemployment \u2014 which also captures people who want full-time work but are working part-time and those who have given up looking for a job out of frustration \u2014 is coming down even faster, at 11.5 percent in October from 11.8 percent. Just a year ago it was 13.7 percent.As always, the big question on these unemployment numbers is whether they are changing for good reasons or bad ones. Are more people finding jobs, or are fewer people looking? Here, too, the October readings are generally favorable.In the government\u2019s survey of households, more people (683,000, to be precise) reported having a job. Fewer people (267,000) reported being unemployed. And fewer people (206,000) reported not being in the labor force at all (that is, neither having a job nor wanting one).All that was enough to push the ratio of the employed population up 0.2 percentage points to 59.2 percent, its highest level since July 2009. But it\u2019s worth putting that number in a slightly longer context. While it\u2019s welcome news that unemployment is falling for the right reasons, the gains so far are nowhere near enough to make up for the steep declines in the size of the labor force that happened from 2008 to 2010.The other important caveat in this report is that there is barely a hint of any meaningful rise in private-sector wages. The average hourly private-sector wage rose a mere 0.1 percent in October. The average length of the workweek ticked up \u2014 but that merely reversed a downward revision of September data.Over the past year, average hourly private-sector wages have risen 2 percent, about the same rate as in the last two years.Inflation is running at a bit under 2 percent (October data are not in yet), so that does most likely signal a small increase in the purchasing power of Americans. But despite a flurry of worry earlier in the year that wages were really starting to rise in a way that might lead to higher inflation, there\u2019s no evidence of that kind of acceleration in the data.Add it up, and this economy is what we thought it was: consistent, predictable, steady, with stronger growth in the number of people working than in what those workers are being paid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Flagging Exports Add to Germany\u2019s Economic Shift", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byASSLAR, Germany \u2014 Pfeiffer Vacuum is one of those companies most people have never heard of, but whose products help make the world go \u2032round.It is also the kind of company at the center of a question looming over Europe: Is the German export success story reaching its limits?Pfeiffer, based in this city of 13,600, about an hour\u2019s drive north of Frankfurt, makes pumps used to suck air or other gases from a chamber in order to create a vacuum. That seemingly innocuous technology has thousands of uses \u2014 like producing freeze-dried coffee, processing drug tests at athletic events, making semiconductors, and helping to create conditions as airless as outer space inside the Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator near Geneva.Pfeiffer exports about 70 percent of its pumps, and is emblematic of the thousands of other highly specialized, midsize German companies whose sales helped the rest of the eurozone soldier on through a financial and economic crisis now in its sixth year.But recent data are raising questions about whether Germany\u2019s export machine is wearing out. The country\u2019s output in the second quarter, the most recent reported, fell 0.2 percent from the previous quarter.Germany has the largest economy in Europe and what happens inside its borders reverberates around the Continent, if not the world.The slowing German economy is sure to be a topic when the European Central Bank governing council meets on Thursday to discuss whether it should take further steps to stimulate the eurozone economy. More action by the central bank, though, would be unpopular in Germany, despite sputtering growth. Germans fear that measures like large-scale purchases of government bonds \u2014 the move many economists are urging \u2014 would make them liable for debts in countries like Italy.Surveys show that optimism among many German exporters is flagging. In August, the most recent month for which data is available, exports fell 5.8 percent compared with July, in part because of a drop in sales to Russia. But a slowing of the economy in China, one of Germany\u2019s biggest markets, also played a role.The United States has been a bright spot for Pfeiffer and many other German companies. But increases in America have not been enough to compensate for declines in Asia and Europe. The German economy has also suffered because many companies, including industrial titans like Siemens, Volkswagen or BASF, have been building new factories in North America rather than at home, taking advantage of lower energy costs.\u201cThe world hasn\u2019t developed the way we expected,\u201d said Ulrich Ackermann, head of the foreign trade department of the German Engineering Association, an industry group that represents the export-oriented machinery industry. \u201cThe locomotive is not driving as fast.\u201dThe conventional wisdom is that the sharp export decline in August was an anomaly and that there could be a rebound when September numbers are published on Friday.But managers like Manfred Bender, the chief executive of Pfeiffer, remain wary. Asked last week about the outlook for sales, Mr. Bender flipped through the pages of an investor presentation until he landed at a chart.It showed how Pfeiffer\u2019s revenue rose 65 percent from 2009 to 2011, to 520 million euros, or $651 million, because of a surge in orders from the semiconductor and solar panel industries. By last year, though, sales had fallen back to \u20ac409 million because of a nasty shakeout in the solar industry.\u201cI\u2019m not pessimistic, but I\u2019m not too optimistic,\u201d Mr. Bender said on a tour of Pfeiffer\u2019s factory in Asslar, a facility as clean as a hospital.\u201cI don\u2019t see any source for a boom like that,\u201d he said, referring to the sales spike in 2011. \u201cBusiness will be O.K., but I don\u2019t see a driver for such a boom.\u201dIn its third-quarter report on Wednesday, Pfeiffer said sales slipped 1.6 percent to \u20ac98.3 million, compared with a year earlier, while profit fell 26 percent to \u20ac7.4 million.Germany, except for a mild downturn at the end of 2012, has been remarkably immune to the problems afflicting the rest of the eurozone. The German unemployment rate, at 5 percent in September, was the lowest in Europe, and less than half the eurozone rate of 11.5 percent.Even as Italy sank into recession and France stagnated, the German economy marched onward, only recently beginning to flag. Demand from Germany helped prevent the downturns in other countries from being even worse than they were.And much of the country\u2019s success was because of exporters like Pfeiffer, making precision products that serve niche markets and command high prices. Pfeiffer vacuum pumps, for example, sell for as much as \u20ac25,000, and even more for pumps made to order.For years, the rise of China and other emerging markets has been a boon for German companies. They supplied equipment for newly built factories and sold Mercedes, Audis and BMWs to millions of newly affluent customers. But now growth in China is slowing and having an effect on Germany.At the same time, there are also signs that German competitiveness is slipping. The country is often seen as a model for France and Italy because of the way it loosened barriers to hiring and firing, setting the stage for a plunge in unemployment.But Germany slipped a rung, to 14th place from 13th, in the most recent rankings by the World Bank on the ease of doing business. High taxes and lingering bureaucratic burdens, like lengthy procedures to register property sales, are seen as among the German drawbacks.Moreover, Germany\u2019s ranking as a place to start a new business fell to 114th from 103rd in the World Bank rankings, largely because of the amount of money that entrepreneurs are required to keep on deposit in order to win official approval to open shop.\u201cGerman export growth is at risk because of what\u2019s going on in China, Russia and other markets, but also because of competitiveness,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said on Wednesday in Frankfurt. \u201cWe have seen some erosion there.\u201dGerman exporters can take some comfort in the decline of the euro against the dollar, which reflects the stronger economy and higher official interest rates in the United States. At about 1.25 to the dollar on Wednesday, the euro has fallen 10 percent since May. That makes products priced in euros more affordable in global markets.While Pfeiffer customers tend to focus more on quality than price, Mr. Bender said, \u201cif one customer needs hundreds of pumps, price is an important factor, definitely.\u201dBut no one believes a weaker euro alone will be enough to revive Europe. More crucial is that German industrial companies remain one step ahead of ambitious competitors from China or other emerging economic powers.So far, Chinese companies do not seem to be threatening the highly specialized companies like Pfeiffer Vacuum. Mr. Bender said his main competitors were all in Europe or Japan.\u201cI don\u2019t see a Chinese start-up doing our technology,\u201d he said, because it requires considerable experience and expertise to produce. \u201cThere are very high barriers to entry.\u201dBut in other industries, Chinese companies have been trying to move from lower-cost mass markets into high-end products, threatening German exporters. One example is the Volvo Car Group, acquired in 2010 by Geely Holding, a Chinese carmaker. Volvo, based in Sweden, has provided a way for Geely to challenge the hold that German carmakers like Audi, BMW and Mercedes have on well-heeled Chinese buyers.There are signs the Geely strategy is working. China has become Volvo\u2019s fastest-growing market by far, with sales of almost 66,000 vehicles from January through October, a 36 percent increase from a year earlier. Geely has begun producing Volvos in China, though the most expensive models are still made in Sweden.One of the big questions confronting Germany is what other markets and products Chinese companies might start aiming for.\u201cChina is moving up the value chain, but Germany is still ahead,\u201d said Holger G\u00f6rg, a professor at Christian-Albrechts-University in Kiel, Germany, who has been studying that question.But, in what could be an ominous sign for the future, he added: \u201cThey also have a lot of highly skilled people. They are trying to generate new technology and move into the high end.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Threatens to Veto $440 Billion Tax Deal", "Date": "2014-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With negotiators nearing an accord on permanent tax breaks for businesses worth $440 billion over 10 years, President Obama rallied Democratic opposition on Tuesday and promised a veto.\u201cThe president would veto the proposed deal because it would provide permanent tax breaks to help well-connected corporations while neglecting working families,\u201d said Jennifer Friedman, a White House spokeswoman. The deal, negotiated by House Republicans and aides to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the outgoing majority leader, showed how much power has shifted since the Republican election victories this month. The negotiations fractured Democrats, and separated the Obama administration from Mr. Reid.But Mr. Obama\u2019s threat showed that he could still wield his authority as well. White House officials said the package, intended to avoid letting a host of politically popular tax breaks expire at the end of the year, is too heavily tilted toward corporations and will have deep repercussions for budget and tax negotiations far into the future.A veto would be the third and by far the most significant of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency. His threat sent negotiators back to the table to see if Republicans could add measures that would win liberal support, especially a permanently expanded child tax credit for the working poor.\u201cIt\u2019s somewhat ironic they\u2019re willing to just proceed here, unpaid for, leave the middle class behind and include a lot of things that I think wouldn\u2019t benefit our economy,\u201d said Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.Advocates of the deal in both parties said the emerging accord would lock in tax breaks that have been passed in short-term increments, year after year. Doing so would give businesses more certainty about making investments, they said, while extending tax benefits that already have broad bipartisan support. And Senate Democrats said they cut the best deal possible before next year\u2019s Republican takeover.But Mr. Obama and Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff, personally stepped in with a furious round of calling Tuesday afternoon to promise a veto. Shaun Donovan, the White House budget director, and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew also called lawmakers.Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said a veto would be sustained, even if the negotiated package were chock-full of tax breaks for constituents of Senate Democrats.Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, made several calls to key House Democrats to ensure the votes would be there in the House to sustain the president\u2019s veto.\u201cThe light of day has changed the way this agreement might look,\u201d Mr. Brown said. The standoff has set up a high-stakes game of chicken. Some 55 tax breaks for businesses and individuals expired last year, and if they are not revived retroactively by Dec. 31, taxpayers will not be able to claim them for the current tax year. Republicans say Congress might pass a one-year retroactive measure that would simply start the fight all over again in January, when they control the Senate and their numbers are fortified in the House. The emerging tax legislation would make permanent 10 provisions, including an expanded research and development tax credit, which businesses and the Obama administration have wanted to make permanent for years; a measure allowing small businesses to deduct virtually any investment; the deduction for state and local sales taxes; the American Opportunity Tax Credit for college costs; deductions for employer-provided mass transit; and four different breaks for corporate and charitable giving.Smaller measures already passed by the Senate Finance Committee, from tax breaks for car-racing tracks to benefits for racehorse owners, would be extended for one year and retroactively renewed for the current tax year.The tax credit for wind power, a Democratic priority, would phase out and end after 2017. Many conservatives oppose the wind credit as an unfair boost to an energy industry in competition with oil and gas.Left off were the two tax breaks valued most by liberal Democrats: a permanently expanded earned-income credit and a child tax credit for the working poor. Friday night, Republican negotiators announced they would exclude those measures as payback for the president\u2019s executive order on immigration, saying a surge of newly legalized workers would claim the credit, tax aides from both parties said.Republican aides involved in the negotiations reacted angrily to the White House\u2019s efforts to torpedo the talks. They noted that Mr. Obama had pushed for his own version of a permanent, expanded research and development credit as a boon to the economy and embraced a narrower proposal to let small businesses deduct the cost of investments. Now, they say, he is reversing himself rather than accept yes for an answer.The potential repercussions of the deal are broad. Republicans taking over the House and Senate budget committees have vowed to pass plans that bring the federal budget into balance in 10 years without raising taxes or cutting the defense budget. If the tax deal is passed, that will mean those budget plans will have to cut deeper into domestic spending. Republicans also have vowed to overhaul the tax code but with a reformed system that brings in the same amount of revenue. That revenue target would shrink by $440 billion over the next decade, a tiny share of overall spending but a big hole for lawmakers to fill if it meant raising taxes elsewhere or cutting spending for important constituencies. \u201cAn extender package that makes permanent expiring business provisions without addressing tax credits for working families is the wrong approach, at the expense of middle-class families,\u201d Mr. Lew, the Treasury secretary, said of the deal. \u201cAny deal on tax extenders must ensure that the economic benefits are broadly shared.\u201dDemocratic negotiators say they secured measures they might not be able to win next year. The American Opportunity Tax Credit was proposed by Mr. Obama and passed in the 2009 stimulus law. A permanent extension would give $97 billion in tax relief over 10 years to families of students in higher education.Tax incentives for charitable giving would total $16 billion over a decade. And Republicans tossed in provisions specifically aimed at winning Democratic votes, such as making permanent the deduction for employer-provided mass transit benefits. Keeping the deduction for state and local sales taxes had appeal to Mr. Reid, whose home state has no income tax.But the costs of the business tax breaks would make up two-thirds of the total value of the package, including the R.&D. tax credit\u2019s $156 billion and $73 billion to allow small businesses to deduct from their taxes all investments in new plants and equipment.White House officials blasted that provision as too broad, noting it could apply to law partners purchasing a new sport utility vehicle for their practice. In contrast, the wind power credit, which Democrats argue is still needed to keep renewable energy competitive with cheap fossil fuels, would lose 20 percent of its value in 2016 and 40 percent though much of 2017, vanishing entirely by the final three months of that year.Opposition to the emerging accord united the liberal wing of the Democratic Party with budget hawks who objected to its cost. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, denounced what she called horse trading that bid up the package\u2019s price tag.\u201cI know every special-interest group wants to protect its tax break, and members want to continue to dole out all the goodies,\u201d she said. \u201cBut hey, my kid wants a pony. It doesn\u2019t mean someone doesn\u2019t have to pay for it.\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Defeats Bill on Keystone XL Pipeline in Narrow Vote", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe vote represented a victory for the environmental movement, but the fight had taken on larger dimensions as a proxy war between Republicans, who argued that the project was vital for job creation, and President Obama, who had delayed a decision on building it.The political fallout, though, affected Ms. Landrieu more than the president, at least in the near term. She was able to persuade 14 Democrats to join all 45 Republicans to support the pipeline, but 40 Democrats and Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, combined to stop the legislation.Republicans vowed to bring back the Keystone bill as soon as they return in January, when they will hold the majority. Speaking on the Senate floor moments after the vote, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the incoming majority leader, said that he would immediately bring up a Keystone bill when the new Senate convenes.\u201cFor so many good reasons, we\u2019ll be back with this after the first of the year,\u201d said Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican who is poised to replace Ms. Landrieu as head of the Senate Energy Committee. \u201cAnd I believe that the momentum we\u2019ve gained means we\u2019ll see progress and see this bill passed.\u201dSpeaking after her bill was defeated, Ms. Landrieu \u2014 who stood ramrod straight with her hands clasped in front of her, watching over the vote in the center of the Senate floor \u2014 talked about fighting to pass the Keystone bill, but she very well could have been speaking of her own political future.\u201cI came here 18 years ago, fighting to get here, fighting to stay here, and I\u2019m going to fight for the people of my state until the day that I leave \u2014 I hope that will not be soon,\u201d Ms. Landrieu said. \u201cThere\u2019s only joy in the fight. Where I come from, we just never talk about quitting, and we don\u2019t talk about whining.\u201dBut despite cajoling and browbeating her colleagues during a private lunch \u2014 which one attendee described as \u201ccivilized but pretty contentious\u201d \u2014 Ms. Landrieu, who has so often bulldozed her way to success, was not able to produce that elusive final vote.At the lunch, Ms. Landrieu made an \u201cimpassioned plea\u201d that at moments verged on tears, according to a Democrat. Ms. Landrieu, according to the Democrat, focused part of her pitch on how the legislation would help her back home, though at one point she argued that Democrats should send the bill to Mr. Obama\u2019s desk because it would help him politically by giving him something to veto.Tuesday\u2019s vote exposed to public view some of the contours and rifts in the Democratic Party, where many senators feel they have too often bent over backward to accommodate Ms. Landrieu and protect her Senate seat \u2014 one of the last remaining Democratic seats in the South. They finally revolted, in what they said was a vote of principle against legislation they believe would harm the environment.Throughout her Senate career, Ms. Landrieu, a moderate who was known as the oil industry\u2019s best friend in the Democratic Party, has clashed with the liberal environmental wing of her party.Those lawmakers took to the floor Tuesday to express their opposition to the Keystone pipeline, even as they acknowledged the importance of those votes to Ms. Landrieu\u2019s political fate.Environmental advocates had spent the week lobbying Democrats to ensure they would oppose Ms. Landrieu\u2019s bill.NextGen Climate, the advocacy group founded by the California billionaire Thomas Steyer, who spent over $50 million of his own money to back pro-environment Democrats in 2014, also hit supporters with emails asking them to urge senators to vote against the pipeline measure.\u201cToday the U.S. Senate decided to stand on the right side of history,\u201d Mr. Steyer said in a statement after the vote. \u201cThis is a legacy-defining issue where one\u2019s position signifies whether they are standing up for or against the next generation on the issue of climate.\u201dThe House, which passed the same legislation on Friday, had voted multiple times already to approve the pipeline. But Tuesday was the first time this year that the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, had agreed to hold a vote on the bill, which he had feared could hurt the re-election chances of some of his more vulnerable members.Both Ms. Landrieu and her Republican opponent, Representative Bill Cassidy, were eager to take credit for supporting the Keystone bill back home, where their state\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on oil-industry jobs. Speaking on the floor, Republicans sought to cast the legislation as \u201cCongressman Cassidy\u2019s Keystone jobs bill,\u201d while Democrats described it as Ms. Landrieu\u2019s brainchild.Ms. Landrieu had hoped that forcing a vote on the Senate floor would help her show Louisiana voters that she is still fighting for them in Washington.Even if the Senate had passed the bill, Mr. Obama was not expected to sign it into law.But the events of this week suggest that the president may eventually approve the pipeline. White House advisers have repeatedly said that they do not intend to make a final decision until a Nebraska court issues a verdict on the route of the pipeline through that state. That decision is expected to come as soon as January, the same month that a Republican-majority Congress can be expected to send another Keystone bill to the president\u2019s desk \u2014 one that could be within a few votes of a veto-proof majority.People familiar with the president\u2019s thinking say that in 2015, he might use Keystone as a bargaining chip: He would offer Republicans approval of it in exchange for approval of one of his policies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paternity Leave: The Rewards and the Remaining Stigma", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFamily ManFive months after Todd Bedrick\u2019s daughter was born, he took some time off from his job as an accountant. The company he works for, Ernst & Young, offered paid paternity leave, and he decided to take six weeks \u2014 the maximum amount \u2014 when his wife, Sarah, went back to teaching. He learned how to lull the fitful baby to sleep on his chest and then to sit very still for an hour to avoid waking her. He developed an elaborate system for freezing and thawing his wife\u2019s pumped breast milk. And each day at lunchtime, he drove his daughter to the elementary school where Sarah teaches so she could nurse. When she came home at the end of the day, he handed over the baby and collapsed on the couch.\u201cThe best part was just forming the bond with her,\u201d said Mr. Bedrick, who lives in Portland, Ore., and went back to work in June. \u201cHad I not had that time with her, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d feel as close to her as I do today.\u201dSocial scientists who study families and work say that men like Mr. Bedrick, who take an early hands-on role in their children\u2019s lives, are likely to be more involved for years to come and that their children will be healthier. Even their wives could benefit, as women whose husbands take paternity leave have increased career earnings and have a decreased chance of depression in the nine months after childbirth. But researchers also have a more ominous message. Taking time off for family obligations, including paternity leave, could have long-term negative effects on a man\u2019s career \u2014 like lower pay or being passed over for promotions.In other words, Mr. Bedrick is facing the same calculus that women have for decades.Women\u2019s role in society and the economy has been transformed over the last half-century. Today, 70 percent of women with children at home are in the labor force, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But only recently have men\u2019s roles begun to change in significant ways.Even when there is a policy on the books, unwritten workplace norms can discourage men from taking leave. Whether or not they are eligible for paid leave, most men take only about a week, if they take any time at all. For working-class men, the chances of taking leave are even slimmer.The evolving roles of men and women could eventually change workplace culture, he and other social scientists say. If more women play the breadwinner role and more men ask for family-friendly policies, it could become hard for employers to treat them differently on the basis of gender roles.\u201cIf men are asking for more stuff, it can help make the workplace more kid-friendly,\u201d Mr. Coltrane said.The challenge, however, is not just persuading employers to offer paternity leave but also persuading men to take it.In certain corners of the economy, paternity leave, which is increasingly called partner or primary caregiver leave, is already the norm, partly because of some companies\u2019 efforts to accommodate same-sex and adoptive parents.Silicon Valley, which has led the way with corporate benefits and employs a disproportionate number of people in childbearing years, has noteworthy partner benefits, including 17 weeks of paid time off at Facebook and eight at Yahoo. In 2004, Ernst & Young, where Mr. Bedrick works as an audit manager, increased its paid paternity leave to six weeks from two for fathers who are primary caregivers (including same-sex parents and, as in his case, after mothers return to work). Three states \u2014 California, New Jersey and Rhode Island \u2014 have started programs requiring employers to give both parents paid parental leave, financed by disability money that comes out of payroll taxes.A lawyer in San Francisco worked at a large corporate law firm when his two children were born. Although the firm offered four weeks of paid leave to new fathers, a partner gave him a different message.\u201cOne of the partners in particular made the comment: \u2018How are you going to service your clients? What\u2019s your level of commitment to the firm?\u2019 \u201d said the lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve professional relationships.The lawyer did take the full leave, after discussing it with his clients. Another lawyer at the firm helped with immediate matters and the new father was available to clients by email when he was at home. That is common for men on partner leave. Half said they did some work and checked email while they were out, the Boston College study found.Ultimately, the lawyer said, the only repercussion was that his bonus was smaller because he had four fewer weeks of billable hours. He has since left the firm for another job.When men start diverging from the breadwinner role by taking time off or working fewer hours \u2014 or, as Mr. Coltrane puts it, \u201cbecome active-enough parents and begin looking like what we think of as mothers\u201d \u2014 they can be penalized.On a recent Saturday afternoon, Mr. Bedrick answered the door at his home on a cul-de-sac, carrying his daughter in one arm and dragging their huge golden retriever, Koby, with the other. A giant stuffed giraffe stood sentry at the top of the stairs. The baby, who was 9 months old, had just learned to crawl, so the Bedricks were beginning to baby-proof.\u201cI would say she does a ton more than me, just with breast-feeding alone,\u201d Mr. Bedrick said of his wife. Still, their division of labor is in many ways a modern one. Since Ms. Bedrick started teaching again this fall, he packs her breast pump bag in the morning and cleans the bottles and accessories in the evening. And recently, as they have been trying to wean the baby off nighttime feedings, he is the one to get out of bed and comfort her when she cries.\u201cI had that experience of doing anything I needed to do to get her to sleep,\u201d Mr. Bedrick said. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t had those six weeks, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that.\u201dSoon after the Bedricks found out that Sarah was pregnant, Todd was offered a job on a larger team at work. The couple had already decided that he would take leave to delay day care as long as possible.\u201cI just told them flat out, \u2018I\u2019d love to be a part of the team, but I just want to make sure you are aware in advance that I had that planned,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a heated discussion; it just got approved.\u201dEven at Ernst & Young, which encourages parental leave, it is unusual for men to take the full six weeks, as Mr. Bedrick did. His main concern was that he not lose any of his work responsibilities. He said that on the advice of an Ernst & Young coach, he discussed that fear with two of the partners on his new team. He came back to his same assignments.Ms. Bedrick said her husband\u2019s time as the primary caretaker was good for their relationship: \u201cOne day he was like: \u2018You know when I used to come home from work and the laundry wasn\u2019t done and dinner wasn\u2019t done and I said I totally understand? I didn\u2019t. I just said that. Now I really get it.\u2019 \u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s good for him to see it\u2019s a lot of work. You\u2019re not just relaxing.\u201dNo matter how much a couple plans to share the workload, the first few weeks of a baby\u2019s life reshape everything. If the mother is breast-feeding, she already has primary responsibility for the child, and months of solo diaper-changing and baby-soothing duty during maternity leave set lifelong patterns.\u201cPart of the rationale for paternity leave is if men are able to be very involved early on in the care of their children, they\u2019re going to be more involved ever after, and it will translate to more equal sharing and equal roles,\u201d said Ms. Waldfogel, the professor of social work. Though men who want to be more involved fathers are probably more likely to take leave in the first place, she found that even after controlling for fathers\u2019 commitment levels, those who took significant leaves were more likely to do hands-on child care later.In her study with Ms. Nepomnyaschy, which analyzed 10,000 children in the United States, they found that fathers who took two or more weeks of leave were significantly more likely to do tasks like diapering, feeding, dressing and bathing later on. Fathers who took less than two weeks, however, were often no more likely to be involved than those who took none at all.The biggest beneficiaries of all this diaper-changing by fathers, perhaps, are mothers.\u201cWhen men are committing to do tag-team parenting and they\u2019re willing to sacrifice some of their wage potential,\u201d Mr. Coltrane said, \u201cit\u2019s very helpful for the women and also for the long-term wages of the family.\u201d\u201cWhen I tell people I\u2019m on a four-month leave, the initial response is typically surprise that my company offers such a generous benefit,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s typically followed by surprise that I\u2019m actually taking it \u2014 why would I want to subject myself to that torture (from parents), why would I want to sit around and do nothing for four months (from nonparents), or why would I want to do what is surely a career-limiting move.\u201dThe post, meant for his friends, would soon circulate. He heard from people around the world, and he still hears about it from other men at Facebook.\u201cA lot of guys at the company reach out to me,\u201d said Mr. Stocky, who manages 150 people. \u201cI\u2019ve kind of become a model or a template \u2014 like, \u2018This is O.K.; taking four months off is totally cool.\u2019 \u201dMost of them, he said, start by asking how they can make their leave the least disruptive at work. He tells them to prioritize what\u2019s best for their families instead. \u201cThey\u2019re so worried about the image it will have,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Unplug and don\u2019t email anyone.\u2019 \u201dNow that he is back, Mr. Stocky, 36, and his wife, Avni Shah, a vice president at Google, divide day care drop-offs and pickups at the beginning of each week. She does the laundry and cooks for their daughter, who is now 2; he does baths, swim classes and \u201call the ordering on Amazon Mom, which I love the name of.\u201dWorkplace culture may be both the most important and the hardest thing to change to encourage paternity leave. Facebook and other companies have pushed people to accept leave-taking. Senior management prominently taking leave \u2014 and talking about it, as Mr. Stocky has \u2014 is essential, people who study the issue say.Lori Goler, Facebook\u2019s vice president for human resources, said that when a parent-to-be comes by to discuss leave, she refers to it as \u201cthe four-month leave\u201d as an encouragement to take all the time offered. Also, executives, including Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, deliberately say people are on parental leave as opposed to saying they are \u201cout of the office.\u201dEven so, not all fathers at Facebook take the full four months allotted to them. Though the time has been increasing, they now take more than two months, on average. A majority of women take the full four months of maternity leave.At Ernst & Young, about 95 percent of employees who have babies take some amount of time. But 90 percent of new fathers at the firm still take only two to three weeks, not six. Most mothers get three months, and nearly all take the entire time. Men have increased their amount of leave slightly over the last few years, but the company is trying to increase it even more, said Maryella Gockel, flexibility leader at EY.Alison Hooker, chief talent development officer at EY, said: \u201cWe make sure anyone in a senior role makes sure they talk about their families. That tone really influences younger men to take a two-week or three-week paternity session and gets people to six weeks over time.\u201dThey tell a story about Mark Weinberger, the chief executive of EY, going to an important meeting in China. He was asked publicly whether he would be attending the official post-meeting dinner. He responded that he would miss it because he had to get back to the United States in time to take his daughter to her driving test.Ernst & Young also started a confidential coaching program for parents in 2012.

{"Headline": "Lawmakers Look for Ways to Provide Relief for Rising Cost of Generic Drugs", "Date": "2014-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith the prices for some common generic medicines soaring over the past 18 months, state and federal lawmakers are trying to find relief for patients struggling to pay.On Thursday, a Senate panel convened to investigate price increases for generic drugs. Separately, Senators Amy Klobuchar and John McCain will revive stalled legislation to allow some prescription imports from Canada. And Maine is testing out a hotly contested new law that allows its residents to buy drugs from overseas, flouting United States policy.One half of generic medicines went up in price between last summer and this summer; about 10 percent more than doubled in cost in that time, with some common medicines rising by over 500 percent, new data released in connection with a Congressional hearing found. These include thyroid replacement hormone, the antibiotic doxycycline, the heart pill digoxin and the asthma pill albuterol.\u201cGenerics have played an important role in making medicine affordable for millions of people,\u201d said Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging, who held this week\u2019s hearing with Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland. \u201cI worry that we\u2019re seeing the end of that now,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis should be highlighted and remedied.\u201dBecause the United States does not regulate drug pricing or negotiate prices nationally like other countries, generic medicines have long been a safety valve for American patients, allowing them to obtain needed medicines at lower costs. Brand name medicines are granted patent protection for a number of years after they enter the market. Historically, after the patent expires, generic copies have entered the fray, bringing prices down, often sharply. But that pattern is changing, researchers and policy makers say.For example, a 90-day supply of the generic heart medicine digoxin sells for $187 in New York; the branded version, Lanoxin, sells for $24.30 in Canada. A month\u2019s supply of a generic steroid to treat inflammatory bowel disease sells for $1,625 in the United States, while the branded version sells for $155.70 in Canada. A three-month supply of the generic cholesterol lowering drug pravastatin costs $230 in this country, but $31.50 for the branded drug Pravachol in Canada.Senator Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, said the time was right for legislation as drug costs have risen, while salaries have not. \u201cThe economy has stabilized but it\u2019s really hard for the middle class to get by, and this is a glaring example of where we are so out of line with other countries,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cOne solution is to let some competition in from over the border.\u201dThere are many reasons that generic prices may fluctuate. The price of a key ingredient may increase markedly, or competition may decrease as manufacturers leave a market, leading to price rises.Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a pharmaceutical economist at the University of Minnesota, spoke of the current \u201cWild, Wild West of drug pricing,\u201d adding, \u201cI believe in markets, but this market is broken; it\u2019s failing.\u201dHe noted that for generics, \u201cthe trend is going up rather than down, as we\u2019d expect, and not just 2 or 5 percent but by hundreds or even thousands of percent.\u201d Brand-name medicines have increased in price as well, by an average of 12.9 percent in 2013, he said.The idea of allowing Americans to import drugs from Canada or other developed countries is strongly opposed by the powerful United States pharmaceutical industry. Importation even for personal use is generally illegal under Food and Drug Administration regulations. Such medicines may be impounded at the border, although the law is rarely enforced.With the federal government slow to come to the table on the issue, some states have been taking matters into their own hands. Last fall, a new law in Maine began allowing residents to mail order prescription medicines from licensed pharmacies in Canada, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.Mainers had long been traveling over the border to get cheaper medicines, said Troy D. Jackson, a state senator who sponsored the bill. \u201cThey were organizing bus trips because the price difference was so extreme.\u201d The city of Portland and some state employees were able to use their insurance to order Canadian medicine.\u201cWe\u2019d used it for eight years without a problem,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. \u201cIt was convenient, and there wasn\u2019t one safety issue.\u201d But the practice was deemed illegal in 2012, prompting the new law, which essentially licenses select pharmacies in other English-speaking countries to operate in Maine.Since then, the company has been subpoenaed by the Connecticut attorney general and by the Department of Justice seeking information about its interactions with competitors in setting prices. The company contends it acted legally, though Mr. Bedrosian has boasted at shareholder meeting that his company has record profits thanks to its opportunistic pricing.He told the congressional committee that he could not come to the hearing because he would be at an investors meeting in Europe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Accord Relies on Environmental Policies Now in Place ", "Date": "2014-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor all the pronouncements about the United States and China reaching a historic climate pact, the agreement they announced Wednesday does not signal a seismic shift in policies by either nation, experts said.The United States and China should both be able to meet the stated goals by aggressively pursuing policies that are largely in place, these analysts said. For the United States, those include the Obama administration\u2019s proposal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coal plants, which would go into effect in 2017. Experts said that in practice it should be possible to wring more emissions cuts from that and other climate-related measures without adding to costs.\u201cWe think that the tools are there to meet this target,\u201d said David Doniger, director of the climate program at the Natural Resources Defense Council.Politics, of course, may get in the way \u2014 Republicans in Congress vowed to fight the power plant proposal even before it was introduced in June, and some, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who is set to become the majority leader next year, have already sharply criticized the China pact.Policy analysts said a changing energy mix for China, including a buildup of renewable energy sources and nuclear power, had been in the works for some time. \u201cWhat China is pledging to do here is not a lot different from what China\u2019s policies are on a track to deliver,\u201d said David G. Victor, who studies climate policy at the University of California at San Diego.Wang Yi, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, said experts in China had reached a consensus that the 2030 date was achievable for its targets, and that 2025 would be a more ambitious goal.The agreement, announced during President Obama\u2019s visit with President Xi Jinping in Beijing, calls for the United States to reduce carbon emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. That represents a significant acceleration in the rate of reduction from the president\u2019s earlier pledge to cut emissions 17 percent by 2020.For its part, China has agreed to pursue policies that will lead the country to its peak in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, or earlier if possible, and to increase the proportion of renewables in its energy mix to about 20 percent by then.Last year\u2019s historic agreement includes a new goal for U.S. carbon emissions and a commitment by China to curb its emissions and rely more heavily on renewable and nuclear sources of energy.Beyond the reductions, they said, the deal is important for what it shows the rest of the world, particularly other large carbon emitters like India and Russia, in advance of a meeting in Paris next year to negotiate a new climate treaty.\u201cIt shows that the two big dogs in the room are taking the issue seriously,\u201d said Kevin Kennedy of the World Resources Institute, a think tank. \u201cIt provides a real opportunity for the start of what could become a race to the top.\u201dBut it remains unclear whether that will happen. In India, the world\u2019s third-largest carbon polluter, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has signaled that it will not announce a reduction target for emissions cuts. India has long maintained that it should not be required to commit to such goals.\u201cI doubt the Indian government is going to change anything at this time,\u201d said Rajendra M. Abhyankar, a former Indian ambassador to the European Union and a professor of public diplomacy at Indiana University\u2019s School of Public and Environmental Affairs. \u201cThe action by China might create a notional pressure, but I doubt it will be a great pressure.\u201dStill, the new agreement has given a fresh jolt of optimism to the Paris negotiations, where the American and Chinese targets are expected to be the focus. Nearly two decades ago, the world\u2019s first climate change treaty, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, failed to stop the rise of carbon emissions in large part because of a standoff between China and the United States.Under the new pact, the United States would roughly double the current rate of emissions reductions from 2020 to 2025, to close to 3 percent per year on average. A White House statement said that target was \u201cgrounded in intensive analysis of cost-effective carbon pollution reductions achievable under existing law.\u201dThe administration was short on specifics, but Mr. Doniger said one reason reductions might accelerate might simply be momentum \u2014 measures that are already in place will have more impact over time.The Environmental Protection Agency, for example, has already issued vehicle emissions standards that become tighter through 2025. \u201cThe improvement ramps up, and that\u2019s already done,\u201d Mr. Doniger added.Similarly, he said, measures to curb leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from oil and gas production, which the Obama administration is considering, should have increasing effect as that industry grows over time. \u201cIf you have sensible leakage controls, you get a very big reduction,\u201d he said.As for the administration\u2019s proposal to reduce power plant emissions, called the Clean Power Plan, Mr. Doniger said, some of the calculations were based on cost estimates that were out of date. With more accurate figures, particularly for the cost of renewable energy and energy efficiency improvements, he said, more emissions reductions will be possible under the plan without raising costs.Mr. Kennedy of the World Resources Institute said the United States\u2019s commitment to increasing the rate of emissions reductions was an important part of the agreement. \u201cIn some ways, it\u2019s not where we end up in 2025,\u201d he said, \u201cbut whether at that point we are increasing the rate of decline in emissions or flattening out.\u201dIn China, people involved in the internal debates said the seeds of the announcement on Wednesday could be found in public anger over rising levels of smog. To address the problem, Chinese leaders have turned their attention to cutting the country\u2019s reliance on coal, a main pillar of the economy but also a major source of pollution.That led to discussions about how weaning Chinese industries off coal would not just clean the air, but would also permit China to make global commitments in the battle against climate change, the insiders said.Jake Schmidt, director of the international program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the work to reduce emissions had already begun in China, with coal-consumption peak targets in populous areas, and heavy investment in clean energy technology and deployment. \u201cAs China takes the next steps, it\u2019s got a solid foundation on which to build,\u201d he said.And Mr. Xi will not face the kind of political pushback that Mr. Obama does in the United States. \u201cThey have their own challenges, but effectively, the minute that President Xi Jinping made the announcement, it became the law of the land.\u201dHal Harvey, who runs a policy research group called Energy Innovation in San Francisco and has spent weeks in China this year working on the emissions problem, said that even though the policies already in place or previously announced would take the countries a long way toward meeting their targets, they nevertheless were significant.\u201cIn effect, it ratifies stuff that\u2019s underway,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I still think it\u2019s important. The Chinese take international announcements very seriously, and this has now set a tone for the entire government of what they\u2019re going to do.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the likelihood that the emissions targets of the climate pact between the United States and China will be met misstated, in some editions, the title of India\u2019s leader, Narendra Modi. He is prime minister, not president. And a chart with the article referred incorrectly in some editions to the United States\u2019 carbon emissions. It has much higher emissions per capita than China \u2014 not the highest emissions per capita worldwide, a distinction held by Qatar.Edward Wong, Coral Davenport and Justin Gillis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Economy, and Voters\u2019 Perception of It, Are Two Very Different Things", "Date": "2014-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPartisanshipIf you\u2019re scratching your head trying to figure this out, you\u2019re not alone. The only way this can be true is if something is mucking up the relationship between the actual economy and people\u2019s judgments about the economy. And that\u2019s exactly what is happening.To understand how opinions about the economy and the actual economy might affect vote decisions in different ways, I looked for patterns of association between the real economy (growth) and election outcomes (seats in midterm years and vote share in presidential years) over the period from 1948 to 2012.The correlation between growth in gross domestic product in the first six months of a presidential election year and two-party vote share for president is 0.64, and it\u2019s even higher for another common objective economic indicator, real disposable income. But in midterm elections over the same period, the correlation between G.D.P. growth and the number of seats the president\u2019s party gains or loses in the Senate is 0.03. In other words, there is a strong relationship between the nation\u2019s growth rate and presidential vote share, but no relationship between the nation\u2019s growth rate and Senate (or House) seat loss in midterm years.Apparently, the objective state of the economy comes to bear on people\u2019s choice for president in a way that it does not in their choice of representative or senator.It turns out that what\u2019s mucking up the relationship between the actual economy and people\u2019s opinions about it is partisanship.Partisanship functions as a lens through which perceptions of the state of the nation\u2019s economy are filtered. If you\u2019re in the incumbent president\u2019s party, your lenses are more likely to be rose-colored, and if you\u2019re not, your lenses tend to be very dark \u2014 regardless of how the economy is actually performing! People answer survey questions about the economy as if they are being asked about their party identification. For some reason, asking people to \u201cthink back over the last year\u201d and tell us whether they think \u201cthe economy has gotten better, stayed the same, or gotten worse,\u201d actually activates their party identification in a way that perhaps even they don\u2019t appreciate.Despite this pattern of partisan conditioning, voters nonetheless manage to bring the actual state of the nation\u2019s economy to bear on choices in the voting booth, but only in presidential election years. In midterm elections, the economy matters only through attitudes constructed through the lens of party identification \u2014 and remotely, through presidential approval.The next time you think you\u2019re judging an objective reality, stop and ask yourself whether your partisan lenses are on \u2014 or off.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In France, New Review of 35-Hour Workweek", "Date": "2014-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 On a recent weekday, Ahlem Saifi caught a 5 a.m. M\u00e9tro to get to her job as a passengers\u2019 assistant at Orly Airport, where she often works 44 hours a week \u2014 well over France\u2019s official 35-hour workweek.That afternoon, she took a quick lunch break then headed to her second job, as a sales manager at the French hypermarket Carrefour, ending her day at 9 p.m.\u201cFrance has a reputation for having lazy workers,\u201d said Ms. Saifi, 26. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never worked just 35 hours. That would be like resting on my laurels.\u201dMore than a decade after it was introduced, the 35-hour workweek still projects an image of France as being one of the most laid-back places in the world to work. In most of the rest of the eurozone, the 40-hour workweek is standard.But in reality, France\u2019s 35-hour week has become largely symbolic, as employees across the country pull longer hours and work more intensely, with productivity per hour about 13 percent higher than the eurozone average. And a welter of loopholes lets many French employers outmaneuver the law.All told, French workers put in an average of 39.5 hours a week, just under the eurozone average of 40.9 hours a week, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Now, a fight has broken out within President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s Socialist government over whether to officially end the nominal 35-hour workweek as a way to overcome France\u2019s economic malaise.Breaking a taboo, Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron has begun to openly question whether the measure \u2014 which was passed in 2000 by a Socialist government to encourage job creation \u2014 still serves the country\u2019s needs.Tensions rose sharply after Der Spiegel, the German news weekly, reported on Sunday that a German-French action plan, prepared for Mr. Macron and his German counterpart, Sigmar Gabriel, would call for overhauling the 35-hour week. After a storm of protest, French officials this week sought to calm fears that a major change was underway.The report, which is to be made public on Thursday, \u201cdoes not call into question\u201d the current workweek, they said, although the government does see room for more flexibility within the framework of the law.Last week, Mr. Macron, an economic centrist, told Parliament that the 35-hour rule had for too long painted France as \u201ca country which no longer wanted to work,\u201d sending a negative signal to foreign companies wanting to invest here. Given France\u2019s economic challenges, Mr. Macron said, the 35 hours \u201cshould no longer be put on a pedestal.\u201dHis remarks provoked an immediate backlash within his Socialist Party and among trade union officials, who accused the government of threatening to tear down a totem of the French state that many still cherish.Any effort to weaken the 35-hour standard \u201cwill not be implemented here in France,\u201d warned Bruno Le Roux, the president of the Socialist Party.For wage earners like Ms. Saifi, political resistance to change seems out of touch with economic reality. \u201cWe should really be encouraging people to work more if they want to \u2014 not the opposite,\u201d she said.The law has not improved an unemployment rate that, at 10.2 percent, hovers near a high. Nor does it address a deeper challenge in the French workplace: the rising use of part-time contracts, which employers increasingly use to avoid the risk of paying costly overtime.Ms. Saifi has a pretax base salary of around 13.45 euros, or $17, an hour from Groupe 3S, which provides passenger services at the airport. She gets \u20ac10.78 an hour at Carrefour, which is better than France\u2019s \u20ac9.53 minimum hourly wage.Ms. Saifi would rather work full-time at Carrefour, where she is replacing a worker on leave. But so far she has been able to obtain only a part-time contract. Meanwhile, the 35-hour workweek rules \u2014 despite the loopholes \u2014 require her airport employer, Groupe 3S, to cap her maximum working time at 44 hours a week, limiting her earnings there.\u201cThe 35 hours was an intellectual and economic mistake,\u201d said Dominique Mo\u00efsi, a senior adviser at the French Institute for International Affairs, an influential research group. \u201cFor Mr. Macron to say that he can touch that Holy Grail is very antagonistic to the French left. But it is a way of telling the outside world and the rest of Europe, we should reform France.\u201dMr. Macron insisted that he did not want to dismantle the law, which requires employers to provide paid rest days and overtime pay of 25 to 50 percent of a worker\u2019s hourly salary for time worked beyond 35 hours. Others who have dared to suggest returning France to the previous official workweek of 39 hours, including former President Nicolas Sarkozy and the current prime minister, Manuel Valls, were promptly shouted down.Instead, Mr. Macron is pushing for new legislation to let companies negotiate their own wage and work-time agreements with unions internally, rather than relying on sectorwide accords negotiated between employers associations and unions.As it is, previous governments have already pushed through a raft of measures to weaken the law, which does not apply to white collar workers or senior executives, but caps the official workweek for government employees and workers like Ms. Saifi.Various loopholes have increased the amount of extra hours that employees can work before overtime pay kicks in. And the government pays billions of euros a year in subsidies to help companies offset overtime costs. Analysts question whether the 35-hour week has brought economic benefits \u2014 or merely bureaucratic burdens.Companies were expected to recruit more employees to compensate for the reduced hours for any one worker. While the French statistics agency Insee estimates that 300,000 to 350,000 jobs were created shortly after the law was passed, economists said that the pace of jobs creation had not been maintained. And critics say the rule is a reason that France\u2019s unemployment rate is more than double Germany\u2019s rate of 5 percent.Myriam Bello is one of nearly 4.5 million workers in France unable to find jobs with at least 35 hours a week.\u201cIt\u2019s not nearly enough, especially when you see that people in other countries work more hours than us,\u201d said Ms. Bello, 22, who has a 30-hour-a-week contract at a New Look clothing store just outside Paris. \u201cIf you need to rent an apartment, and the agencies ask that you earn three times the monthly rent just to sign a contract, it\u2019s impossible.\u201d\u201cTo this day,\u201d Ms. Bello added, \u201cI cannot find a 35-hour-a-week contract.\u201dAbolishing the law would require a wholesale review of the exemptions and subsidies now in place, said Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Roubaud, the president of the C.G.P.M.E., France\u2019s main employers\u2019 association for small and medium-size businesses, leading to \u201cmajor difficulties.\u201dFor the moment, his association is resigned to keeping the 35-hour workweek in place \u2014 as long as Mr. Macron follows through on his promise to provide employers with more flexibility.\u201cOnly in France,\u201d he said, \u201cwould you find something this complicated.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a former French president. He is Nicolas Sarkozy, not Nicholas. The article also misstated the abbreviation for France\u2019s main employers\u2019 association for small and medium-size businesses. It is C.G.P.M.E., not C.P.G.M.E.An earlier version of this article transposed the given and family names of a woman who works as a passengers\u2019 assistant at Orly Airport and as a sales manager at Carrefour.

{"Headline": "Good News on Energy", "Date": "2014-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 WHEN the world\u2019s two largest polluters join in establishing new goals for reducing emissions of climate-disrupting gases, criticism and skepticism are predictable. And there was plenty following the recent agreement between the United States and China to do just that.Critics warned of a \u201cwar on coal,\u201d regulatory overreach and the surrender of American interests to Chinese duplicity. Skeptics wondered whether the goals were even feasible.In fact, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than one-quarter over the next decade, as the United States has agreed to do, is simply another step in a transition to cleaner energy that has been underway for decades.We also found that economic growth decisively outpaced any increases in energy use over recent decades, as America found smarter ways to use energy (like the LED, which uses one-fifth as much electricity as Edison\u2019s original light bulb). Improvements in energy efficiency over the last 40 years have done more to meet growth in America\u2019s energy needs than the combined contributions of oil, coal, natural gas and nuclear power.The efficiency trend shows up vividly in recent data on electricity consumption. Since 2000, growth in electricity use has dropped well below growth in the population, through both recessions and recoveries, despite a flood of new consumer electronics and other plug-ins.Moreover, oil consumption by vehicles, homes and businesses is down more than 12 percent from its 2005 peak, despite a slight increase in 2013. Lower petroleum use is an important contributor to recent reductions in pump prices and declining reliance on foreign suppliers.There is also good news on renewable energy. By last year, wind was providing more than 4 percent of America\u2019s electricity generation. Solar is surging, too, although it still produces less than 1 percent of the total. For the first time, total hydropower generation (once the dominant source of renewable power) was overtaken over a 12-month period beginning in June 2013 by the combined contributions of other renewable energy sources, primarily wind, solar and geothermal. More than one-eighth of our electricity supply is now in the \u201crenewable\u201d category, which is growing faster than any other.These trends put the country in a strong position to meet carbon dioxide emissions standards proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce pollution from power plants. These standards would cut emissions by 30 percent compared with 2005 levels.The E.P.A.'s proposal would encourage states to push for energy efficiency improvements across the economy to reduce power plant generation. Because optimizing energy use is cheaper than making more electricity, the E.P.A. projects that electric bills will drop.Clean energy progress goes hand in hand with economic health, and America\u2019s success in linking them is encouraging efforts worldwide to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. That is why the deal between China and the United States should be understood as a way to advance both national and international interests. Achieving the pollution reductions involves expanding proven ways to deliver more affordable and reliable energy services. China is now the world\u2019s largest renewable energy investor, and its energy productivity improvements have outstripped America\u2019s in recent years.Avoiding climate disruption will require reductions far in excess of what China and the United States have proposed. The transition to a clean energy economy needs to reach zero emissions.But we don\u2019t need to change course, or kill jobs, or wage war on anybody or anything.Advertisement"}

Mr. Aiken, who was a special-education teacher before \u201cIdol\u201d made him famous, insisted he had nothing to do with shaping the Obama economy.David Rouzer, a Republican and former state senator, won the race for the state\u2019s Seventh Congressional District, becoming the first Republican congressman to represent that district since Reconstruction. The Seventh District was the last part of the state not to be represented by a Republican in Congress in modern times.Mr. Rouzer won an open seat, after Representative Mike McIntyre, a nine-term Democrat, decided to retire. Mr. McIntyre has been one of many conservative Democrats to represent the district, which stretches from the southern suburbs of Raleigh to the South Carolina border.Mr. Rouzer narrowly lost to Mr. McIntyre in 2012. Mr. Rouzer had more name recognition and campaign funds than his Democratic opponent, Jonathan Barfield Jr., a real estate agent and member of the New Hanover County Board of Commissioners. Many Democrats hoped Mr. Barfield would emerge victorious if the Libertarian candidate, J. Wesley Casteen, a lawyer and certified public accountant, siphoned away enough votes from Mr. Rouzer.North Carolina voters narrowly approved a Constitutional amendment that would give many criminal defendants the choice of whether they want to be tried by a judge or a jury. Only criminal defendants facing the death penalty will be unable to choose the type of trial.North Carolina had been the only state that does not let defendants waive their right to a jury trial, according to a study by the University of North Carolina School of Government. The study said the amendment would save money and time when defendants chose a bench trial, meaning a trial by a judge only. Some argued, however, that the amendment would give judges too much power and that the judge might tilt in favor of certain defendants.Most states also require the consent of the prosecutor before permitting a bench trial. The new amendment requires permission from the judge and defendant, but from not the prosecutor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Sea Change in Greece?", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorATHENS \u2014 I have been coming to Greece two or three times a year for more than 40 years and served as The Times\u2019s correspondent in Athens from 1977 to 1980. Over those decades I watched succeeding Greek governments get into a vicious cycle that sent the national debt soaring higher than Mount Olympus and threatened to unravel the entire European Union. Every time elections approached, the party in power would add thousands of new hires to public payrolls, raise salaries and pensions, and increase benefits. When some ministers would try to cut back even a little after elections, hordes of angry demonstrators would besiege the Parliament or block highways and ports until the politicians caved in and withdrew or watered down their meager reforms.But over the past two years Greece seems to have undergone a profound sea change. The coalition government led by Prime Minister Antonis Samaras of the New Democracy party has passed some of the most severe austerity measures in the country\u2019s postwar history, slashing public spending, cutting wages and pensions almost in half, imposing bruising taxes, and reducing the purchasing power of Greeks by more than 30 percent. Surprisingly, all these afflictions have been accepted with considerable equanimity. There have been demonstrations, to be sure, including a national strike this Thursday, but they have been feeble and fleeting. Greek voters seized the opportunity to show their anger in last May\u2019s election for the European Parliament when they gave the most votes to the radical left party Syriza and the neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn came in third, but that did not move the government to soften its policies.What has brought about such forbearance in a people Thucydides described as \u201cborn into the world to take no rest themselves and to give none to others\u201d?One reason is the grudging recognition that if the government did not accept the harsh terms imposed by the country\u2019s main lenders \u2014 the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank \u2014 there would be no funds to pay them any salaries or pensions at all.A second, and perhaps key, reason is that the strict economic policies of the government have begun to bear fruit and better days now seem possible. Greece recorded a primary budget surplus of 2.28 million euros for the first half of 2014, compared with 2.5 million euros at the same time in 2013. Unemployment has started to inch lower, to 25.9 percent in August from an all-year high of 28 percent, recorded in November 2013, though it remains the highest in Europe. Greece has experienced a tourist boom, attracting 17.9 million international visitors last year, and income from it has fueled the economy. And the country\u2019s credit rating has improved steadily. Last August, Moody\u2019s raised it two notches, to Caa1 from Caa3, citing the \u201cgovernment\u2019s progress in fiscal consolidation,\u201d and later Standard and Poor\u2019s raised its rating from B- to B. Most important, the economy grew by 1.7 percent in the third quarter, in comparison with the third quarter of 2013, the first growth in six years \u2014 which prompted Mr. Samaras to declare: \u201cThis was the fastest growth in the quarter in the whole eurozone. Greece is back!\u201d Do the resolve of the Greek government and the stoicism of the Greek people show that a new political maturity has descended upon the country? For now it seems so, but the abyss is looming into view once again as the country moves inexorably toward another crisis next February, when the Parliament must assemble a 60 percent majority to elect a new president for the country. The ruling conservative-Socialist coalition has only 155 votes, and if it fails to muster another 25 from smaller parties and independents then new national elections will have to be held. And there\u2019s the rub. Current polls, reflecting popular frustration with the government\u2019s austerity measures, show Syriza, the main opposition party, ahead by 3.6 points over New Democracy. But Mr. Samaras, a 63-year-old veteran politician and Harvard M.B.A., is still rated best choice for prime minister over the Syriza leader, Alexis Tsipras, a 40-year-old civil engineer and admirer of Che, Mao and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. What all this means is that no party is likely to win enough votes to form a new government and that a prolonged struggle would ensue to patch together another coalition. The last time that happened, in 2012, it triggered an outflow of more than \u20ac23 billion in deposits. Greek banks were unable to respond to the withdrawals, and planeloads of euros were flown in from the European Central Bank to avoid a bank run.With the prospect that the next elections might be won by Syriza, financial experts believe that a run three to four times greater than 2012 is likely. While the \u20ac23 billion shortfall in that year was covered by the E.C.B., today a much weaker eurozone would hardly be in a position to transfer over \u20ac100 billion to Greece if another huge run were to occur.In this scenario, the vacuum of currency would bring Greece to technical bankruptcy. The hard-won gains of the past two years would vanish. Access to loans would disappear. The faltering economy would come to a standstill, and the only recourse for Greece would be to return to the drachma, a disastrous move for a country that imports much of the goods it consumes.So a lot more is riding on the selection of a president next February than who will be the new head of state. If the members of Parliament make a choice and avoid premature elections, a new sense of responsibility in the country may have a chance to take root and lead the Greek people to a promising future. If they don\u2019t, the recent hardships Greeks have faced will pale in comparison with the troubles ahead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brown to Start 4th California Term With Pledge for Fiscal Restraint ", "Date": "2014-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, 40 years after he was first elected governor of California, Mr. Brown, 76, will begin what will almost certainly be his last term in public office, and the question will be what he intends to do with his power. In an interview Wednesday, he emphasized the importance of fiscal restraint, which has long been one of his biggest points of pride, and which he seems to want to turn into his permanent legacy for California: After years in which the state lurched from one budget crisis to another, Mr. Brown and the Legislature have managed to pass a succession of on-time balanced budgets.The money and political capital Mr. Brown spent during the election was devoted almost entirely to the two ballot propositions, both of which passed. One, meant to prevent huge state deficits, will establish a \u201crainy day fund\u201d for unanticipated expenses; the other, aimed at the state\u2019s severe and lingering drought, called for a $7.5 billion bond for water projects. Both measures will impose changes that may be felt for generations.Trying to hold back his fellow Democrats from spending more freely could be one of the key challenges of Mr. Brown\u2019s fourth term. As the state has slowly but steadily built back reserves, Democratic leaders in both houses have pushed to increase spending on social service programs, even as they said they supported Mr. Brown\u2019s instinct of restraint. One important example of the pressures legislators are likely to face came Thursday, as Janet Napolitano, president of the University of California system, said she would propose raising tuition 5 percent annually for the next five years unless the system received more money from the state.Despite the dominance of Democrats here, there were signs of renewed Republican energy in this week\u2019s elections as the Democrats lost their two-thirds supermajorities in both the State Assembly and Senate. While Republicans have seen registration numbers fall to record lows, Democratic incumbents lost to Republican candidates in a handful of races for the Legislature, and Republicans may also pick up as many as four seats in Congress.Jim Brulte, the chairman of the State Republican Party, said he viewed the legislative gains as an important sign that the party was rebuilding itself.\u201cWe basically had been a party in decline for 30 years, but last night we beat incumbents in the Legislature, something that had not happened since 1994,\u201d Mr. Brulte said Wednesday. \u201cThe notion that the Republican wave stops at our border was simply not the case.\u201dBudgets and legislation require only a simple majority vote in the Legislature, but two-thirds approval is necessary to raise taxes, something the governor does not appear eager to do.Still, Mr. Brown could once again turn to voters to ask for a tax increase or some sort of overhaul of state taxes, which rely heavily on capital gains receipts. He has suggested he could use some of the millions left over in his re-election war chest to promote ballot initiatives.\u201cThere is a sense of getting things done here, and we have a consensus around that,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cCalifornia was viewed by everybody as a failed state just five years ago; there was a specter of the state floundering. But now we\u2019re back on an even keel, and that gives a more positive mood in the electorate here.\u201dMr. Brown has long relished holding up California \u2014 and himself \u2014 as an example to Democrats across the country, rarely more so than after this election.\u201cWe\u2019re not caught up in the backbiting of Washington,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re more remote from internecine warfare from the parties.\u201dAlso on Tuesday, Californians approved a ballot measure that will significantly change the way crimes are punished, turning several lower-level nonviolent felonies into misdemeanors that require brief stays in jail, not state prison time. They also turned aside a measure that would have allowed the state insurance commissioner to stop health insurance rate increases deemed excessive.\u201cWe\u2019re back to where we were in the mid-2000s, when the rest of country is veering to the right,\u201d said Bruce Cain, a professor of political science at Stanford University. \u201cWe\u2019re going to forge our own path and not worry very much about whether it\u2019s consistent with what Washington is doing.\u201dAnd even as Mr. Brown enters what most people expect will be the twilight of his career, he has so far refused to acknowledge anything of the sort. \u201cIt would be depressing to think in those terms,\u201d he said. \u201cMy grandmother lived to be 96. I see a wide field up ahead.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the value of a\u00a0bond for water projects in California. It is\u00a0$7.5 billion, not million.\u00a0videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Can Community Colleges Get a Piece of the Billions That Donors Give to Higher Education?", "Date": "2014-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDegrees and DifficultyOccupying four buildings overlooking the elevated tracks for the No. 7 train in Long Island City, Queens, LaGuardia serves 50,000 students annually, many of them immigrants and more than two-thirds coming from families that earn $25,000 a year or less. One of the first things you notice when you visit is the number of students pushing strollers or carrying babies. At the gala, Ms. Stamm was introduced by a woman whose story was dramatic in its particulars but familiar in its deprivations. Cast out of her house by drug-addicted parents, she had a son at 16, endured dialysis and a kidney transplant and was able to remain at LaGuardia \u2014 and eventually transfer to Smith \u2014 only because of a scholarship the foundation had provided. In recognition of the evening, Ms. Stamm\u2019s husband, Arthur Stamm, made a gift of $100,000. At the time, it was the largest gift the college had received from a single donor in its 42-year history.Since January alone, by contrast, Duke University, which educates 14,850 students on its 8,709-acre campus, has received gifts and pledges of $1 million or more on the average of every six or seven weeks. In those gifts alone, the university has already raised about $49 million this year. And yet, according to the latest ranking, its endowment of close to $6 billion in 2012 did not earn it a place among the country\u2019s 10 richest schools, a list led by Harvard, Princeton and Yale.When Gail O. Mellow became the president of LaGuardia 13 years ago, there was no mechanism in place for raising private money. \u201cBecause of who we are and who we serve, the likelihood of one of our students becoming Bill Gates or the C.E.O. of G.E. is, I\u2019m not going to say zero, but much, much smaller than if you were at Williams,\u201d Dr. Mellow said recently. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a tradition of giving to colleges in our communities, even though these colleges are so hugely important to their local economies\u201d \u2014 referring to the labor force they supply. The chief impediments to fund-raising at community colleges are the most obvious ones: There is no base of well-off alumni from which to draw, and no accompanying reserve of pride that might be exploited. Community colleges are places of departure rather than arrival. A gilded education begets more privilege, and privilege itself has had a long tradition of expression in munificent reciprocal giving. At community colleges, there exists not a legacy culture but whatever might be considered its opposite, given that the ambition of anyone who makes it through the system successfully is to send a child somewhere far beyond it. When students from a community college ascend to the affluent classes, they tend to feel a stronger affinity to the institutions that eventually graduate them than to the places where, often, they had no option but to begin. The larger and more profound challenge is the marketing of the mission itself \u2014 the entirely worthy but unglamorous cause of moving poor young adults, many of whom have been inadequately educated, up to the ranks of middle-income earners. How to sell this vision to the broader world?The plight of community colleges has not captured the interest of the wealthy donor class, where the narrative of the young child plucked from poverty and channeled through a system that will get him to Princeton and repackage him in the image of his benefactors has proved to be so mythically compelling. In 2012, more than twice as much money \u2014 $297 million \u2014 was awarded to charter schools from the country\u2019s largest foundations as was given to community colleges, even though two-year colleges educate nearly four times as many students.\u201cWhen I talk about community college to my friends, I see a blank look on their faces,\u201d one of LaGuardia\u2019s major donors, Lisa Selz, said. \u201cIt is so removed from the experience of so many people who don\u2019t see that success can mean becoming a physician\u2019s assistant.\u201d LaGuardia gets 69 percent of its revenue from government support, most coming from the state and the city; 18 percent comes from student tuition, which is largely paid for by federal and state grants. Over the past few post-recession years, as state and local governments have faced fiscal challenges, financing for community colleges has been reduced. A recent analysis by the Center for American Progress, an education think tank, shows community colleges in 45 states have experienced a decrease in funding, some losing as much as 30 percent of their budgets, at a moment when enrollments have grown. At the country\u2019s wealthiest colleges and universities, a gift like the one the Stamms made might be unremarkable. Among friends of LaGuardia, Dr. Mellow became known for sending handwritten notes to people who had made $500 contributions, because for a long while those were considered so significant. Any philanthropic involvement with a school like LaGuardia is essentially its own reward. There are few vanities to be indulged, no antiquities centers to be named. \u201cThere\u2019s no social cachet to LaGuardia,\u201d Ms. Selz said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s the sense that our kids are too old and that if they haven\u2019t been salvaged already, well, then it\u2019s too late.\u201dAmong two-year colleges, Clark College in Washington State, founded in 1933, has the largest endowment. But its more than $47 million puts it 676th in the ranking of college endowments nationally. The average endowment of private four-year college is approximately $230 million, or 50 times the $4.6 million that is the average for community colleges.Although the majority of LaGuardia\u2019s full-time students receive financial aid, the average award of $4,555 a year can merely cover tuition, not the thousands of dollars in additional expenses \u2014 $7,000 to $12,000 annually, the school calculates \u2014 that students face to live in New York City.There is a kind of farm-to-table dimension to the way the development office works. \u201cIt is very typical for kids to walk in and say that they\u2019re going to drop out of school because they can\u2019t afford a MetroCard,\u201d Susan Lyddon, LaGuardia\u2019s development and marketing director, said recently. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen every once in a while; it happens all the time.\u201d Ms. Lyddon, who wears cat\u2019s-eye glasses and has a crimson streak in her hair, which is to say that she resembles a development executive in almost no other place, came to LaGuardia six years ago, having run a preschool in Indonesia.There is a saying in philanthropic circles that the most effective way to raise money is to ask for it, but at LaGuardia, where attitudes of entitlement are distinctly absent among both students and administrators, the reflex has not been easily felt. The executive staff totals 21 people. Dr. Mellow, herself a community-college graduate, lives not in an expansive residence in which to fund-raise, a standard benefit of college presidents, but in an 1,100-square-foot Chelsea apartment. On many charitable boards, there is the expectation that members will give $20,000 or $25,000 or $50,000 a year. When the LaGuardia foundation\u2019s board was first put together 10 years ago, Dr. Mellow said, members were told only that the college \u201choped\u201d they would make personal contributions. \u201cThat\u2019s what it was!\u201d he said, with residual incredulity. \u201cI thought, \u2018What? We really have to put some gas on this thing.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe email had been meant for Dr. Mellow\u2019s friends and family, but somehow had ended up in Ms. Stamm\u2019s inbox. Assuming that the message had been rerouted by someone else, Dr. Mellow said, \u201c\u00a0\u2018So how did you get to me?\u2019\u00a0\u201d she recounted recently. \u201cMarilyn said, \u2018No it was the email you sent me,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Dr. Mellow continued. \u201cShe pulled out her phone and showed me the email, and it was the email I thought I had only sent to family and friends. It had not been forwarded. I never heard of her, or she of me.\u201dIt was the kind of surreal intervention the school needed. One of Ms. Stamm\u2019s most lasting contributions to LaGuardia was to introduce her friend Ms. Selz to the college. For 20 years, Ms. Selz has helped run the foundation that she and her husband, the financier Bernard Selz, established to support educational, cultural and other causes. In one sense a late bloomer, having married and had children in her 40s, Ms. Selz, immediately drawn to the LaGuardia students she met, began helping the school financially, strategically and more intimately, meeting with students to advise and assist them.This year Ms. Selz and her husband made a $1 million donation to the college, contingent on LaGuardia\u2019s raising $500,000, which it succeeded in doing. Ms. Selz has introduced friends to LaGuardia with inconsistent results. One friend who found herself instantly moved was Karen Dubinsky, whom Ms. Selz had known for years on the Upper East Side. A former actress, Ms. Dubinsky had an M.B.A. from Columbia and a long career in consulting. Not long ago, after earning another master\u2019s in medieval studies and with a child in college, she had been thinking about teaching at a prep school. But visiting LaGuardia compelled her to volunteer, and that volunteering led Dr. Mellow to hire her in June to devise new development strategies. It has been Ms. Dubinsky\u2019s mission to forge a closer union between the school and the wider world of moneyed New York, not merely as a means of cultivating a donor base \u2014 one invested both emotionally and financially \u2014 but as a way to expose students, someday perhaps donors themselves, to the kinds of experiences and possibilities and habits from which they have been excluded. \u201cOur students are afraid of rich people,\u201d Ms. Dubinsky said over lunch recently. \u201cAnd then they meet with them and sit down with them and say, \u2018O.K. they\u2019re fine.\u2019\u00a0\u201dOne of Ms. Dubinsky\u2019s innovations was to form with a few others the President\u2019s Society, a weekly convocation of some of LaGuardia\u2019s hardest-working students with a rotating cast of business and other professional people. At a graduation of the society\u2019s second class at the Century Club in the spring, I met Enes Malik Akdemir, who had come to the United States by himself from Istanbul in 2010 at the age of 18, moved into a Turkish dormitory in Queens, learned English fluently and was on his way to completing his associate\u2019s degree. He expects to graduate next month and hopes to go on to a bachelor\u2019s degree and become a pilot and then an airline executive. At LaGuardia, Mr. Akdemir has worked part time in the development office and taken to fund-raising for the college independently, getting a donation of $350 from his favorite Turkish restaurant, Mangal Kabob, a few minutes away on Queens Boulevard. In a gesture of appreciation, he organized a dinner there two weeks ago and invited a small group of scholarship students, Dr. Mellow, the Selzes and Ms. Dubinsky. The next day, he followed up with a note to Ms. Selz, who had picked up the tab. \u201cI hope you and Mr. Selz enjoyed the Turkish hospitality as well as the cuisine,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI would love to go back again with you one day.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of powerful programs out there, and what they require is not an insignificant amount of money,\u201d Dr. Mellow said. What would she do if she had it? \u201cWhat I\u2019d want to do in general is provide what I know works,\u201d she said. \u201cOne thing I know that works is great teaching. A teacher connecting and really understanding these students\u2019 lives is the gold standard. \u201cThe second piece would be to dramatically increase advisers \u2014 advisers are both adults that I would employ and peers,\u201d she continued. \u201cPeers who would tell a student who got a C and wanted to drop out, \u2018No, no, you have to stay!\u2019 I\u2019d want to stabilize the students\u2019 home lives. I\u2019d want to make sure they had child care, that they knew how to pay the rent, that they weren\u2019t working 80 hours a week and going to school.\u201d In the meantime, LaGuardia has devised some of its own solutions. One of them is called the Pushy Moms Club. Observing her friends uptown, Ms. Dubinsky realized that many had children who now required less of their time, but the mothers themselves were still running on surplus energy from years of meeting the obligations that the obsessive culture of modern parenting imposes. At LaGuardia there were many students with absent parents, so she paired up the women and the students, to get through the complicated process of college transfer admissions. One friend, Joyce Siegel, met with a young woman who aspires to be a gynecologist. She was having a hard time wading through schools with good pre-med programs. \u201cJoyce walked her over to the Barnes & Noble, where they got a Barron\u2019s guide and started to make a list of schools that fit her criteria,\u201d Ms. Dubinsky said. \u201cEvery family of a child in private school in New York owns at least four college guides.\u201d Across sectors of education and social service, philanthropy cannot replace the impact of considered government investment. But it can alter individual lives in unforeseeable ways. At Mr. Akdemir\u2019s dinner two weeks ago, a Chinese student, Yifei Shen, who had recently completed his coursework at LaGuardia and enrolled at the School of General Studies at Columbia, was seated next to Mr. Selz. Mr. Shen talked about the way his $4,000 LaGuardia scholarship helped him. Before receiving the money, he said, every day at 3 p.m. he would start thinking about a hamburger. But he knew that if he ate a hamburger at that moment he would not have money later, if he found himself hungry again. The anxiety and constant dialogue in his head about whether or not to succumb were exhausting all of his mental energy, he said. Afterward, he ate when he wanted.A picture caption in some editions last Sunday with an article about the fund-raising challenges faced by LaGuardia Community College reversed the identities of two of the three women shown on campus who are major supporters of the school. Karen Dubinsky was in the center and Marilyn Skony Stamm was at the right.

But most Americans would not be able to give a clear answer \u2014 which helps explain why the party took such a drubbing last week.The Democratic Party\u2019s short-term plan to help the middle class just isn\u2019t very clear. Some of the policies that Democrats favor, such as broader access to good education, take years to pay off. Others, like reducing medical costs or building new roads, have an indirect, unnoticed effect on middle-class incomes.All the while, incomes keep stagnating, and nothing influences the national zeitgeist quite so much as income trends, for understandable reasons.What can Washington do? The answers are very different for the short term and the long. Over years and decades, nothing matters more than economic growth. The last period of strong income gains \u2014 the late 1990s \u2014 was also the last period of strong economic growth.Politicians often like to boast that they\u2019ve come up with bold ideas to solve economic problems and then package those ideas as new \u2014 a new deal, a new frontier, a new covenant. But most aren\u2019t really new. That\u2019s O.K., too. Truly new ideas don\u2019t come along very often in any field, including economics.So it goes with lifting middle-class incomes. The best hope for doing so, in the immediate future, is probably the oldest and most obvious play in the book: a tax cut.Any presidential candidate \u2014 from either party \u2014 who can claim the mantle of middle-class tax cutter is likely to benefit from it. For that matter, you could imagine Mr. Obama or reform-minded Republicans in Congress proposing such a tax cut sooner.The challenge for the next election will be coming up with a version of the minimum-wage increase that applies to the middle class as well.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Low Inflation Replaces Joblessness as Reason Fed Won\u2019t Raise Rates ", "Date": "2014-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe members of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee saw little reason to shift course at their most recent meeting in late October, according to an official account published Wednesday. Economic growth and job growth remain unusually steady, and Fed officials continued to predict both trends would continue.\u201cInflation hazard light trumps labor market dashboard,\u201d was the summary offered by Michael Feroli, chief United States economist for JPMorgan Chase. The Fed\u2019s account also made clear that policy makers were not particularly worried about signs of economic weakness in Europe and Asia, nor about recent market volatility.\u201cIt was observed that if foreign economic or financial conditions deteriorated further, U.S. economic growth over the medium term might be slower than currently expected,\u201d the account said. \u201cHowever, many participants saw the effects of recent developments on the domestic economy as likely to be quite limited.\u201dOfficials also viewed concerns about other economies as the main reason for jitters last month in financial markets. The account played down their significance, noting financial conditions \u201cremained highly accommodative,\u201d meaning borrowing costs had not increased in response. If the problems are restricted to Wall Street, the account suggested, the Fed is not likely to adjust its course.The Fed ended the expansion of its bond holdings at its October meeting, completing a plan announced well in advance because officials concluded the economy does not need as much stimulus.The Fed\u2019s post-meeting statement, however, said it still planned to hold short-term interest rates near zero for a \u201cconsiderable time.\u201d A number of Fed officials have endorsed the interpretation that the central bank is most likely to start raising short-term rates in mid-2015.The account, released after a standard three-week delay, said that a couple of officials wanted the Fed to signal that it may raise rates sooner, and a couple wanted the Fed to signal that it may wait longer. But a majority remained constant.Fed officials generally agree that labor market conditions are improving more quickly than they expected. Nonetheless, most officials still see evidence of considerable slack, including the unusually large number of part-time workers who say they cannot find full-time work.But the trend is clear: More people are finding jobs, and more people are quitting jobs to seek better opportunities.The unemployment rate, which fell to 5.8 percent in October, is getting closer to the level Fed officials regard as normal, 5.2 percent to 5.5 percent. If inflation were rising at a normal pace, it is unlikely the Fed would wait much longer to start raising rates.\u201cOver the next year, it will become more and more difficult to point to labor market performance as a rationale for a near-zero policy rate,\u201d James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said last week.But inflation is not rising at what the Fed calls a healthy pace. The annualized pace has been less than 2 percent for 29 months, according to the Fed\u2019s preferred measure, the Commerce Department\u2019s index of personal consumption expenditures.More worrisome for the Fed, investors and consumers appear to expect less inflation in coming years. The Fed focuses on measures of expectations because monetary policy acts gradually, so decisions reflect the Fed\u2019s best guess about future conditions.Measures of inflation expectations derived from asset prices have fallen sharply in recent months, but Fed officials note that such measures are prone to distortion by other factors, such as swings in market demand for government bonds.The minutes said that a couple of officials \u201cnoted that it was likely too early to draw conclusions,\u201d while others urged continued scrutiny. The account added that a downturn in expectations would be more worrisome if accompanied by slower growth.Since the meeting, two influential survey measures of inflation expectations also declined.Recent declines in energy prices are suppressing inflation in the near term. The account said most Fed officials continue to predict that inflation will gradually return to the preferred 2 percent annual pace. The Fed focuses on measures of inflation that exclude energy prices precisely because of such volatility.But the account said that a few officials \u201cexpressed concern that inflation might persist below the committee\u2019s objective for quite some time.\u201d One of those officials, Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, cited slow inflation in dissenting from the decision to end bond buying.Referring to the weakness in inflation expectations, Krishna Guha, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said, \u201cWe believe some firming is likely required before the Fed would contemplate raising rates.\u201d But Eric Green of TD Securities said economic growth would still dictate the Fed\u2019s timing.

{"Headline": "Face to Face With the Fed, Workers Ask for More Help ", "Date": "2014-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Jean Andre traveled from Queens to the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s stately headquarters here on Friday to tell the people who make monetary policy that he needs their help. He cannot find regular work on film and photo shoots. The jobs he does find pay less.The Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, agreed to meet with about 30 workers and activists, including Mr. Andre, in a gesture of concern for the plight of Americans searching for work and struggling to make a living.For one hour on Friday, the workers sat in the Fed\u2019s ornate conference room and told their stories to Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials, including three other members of the Fed\u2019s board of governors \u2014 Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman; Lael Brainard; and Jerome H. Powell \u2014 who listened and asked questions.\u201cThe Federal Reserve is too important of an institution to be insulated from the voices and perspectives of working families,\u201d said Ady Barkan, a lawyer with the Center for Popular Democracy, an advocacy group based in Brooklyn that orchestrated the meeting. \u201cWe think that the Fed needs to listen more and be more responsive, and we\u2019re very grateful for this first opportunity.\u201dThe meeting was closed to the media. The workers described what they said, and the Fed declined to comment, citing a policy of silence about private meetings.Mr. Barkan\u2019s group is campaigning for the Fed to continue its stimulus campaign, citing the high level of unemployment, particularly in minority communities, and the slow pace of wage growth as evidence the economy still needs help. The group argued the Fed could help to drive up wages by keeping interest rates low.Mr. Andre, 48, said two jobs were canceled this week. And instead of $400 a day for a print shoot, he said he now made $250 or $300.\u201cThey tell me if I don\u2019t take the job there\u2019s lots of other people willing to work,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what can I do? I have a family. I have to take it.\u201dJosh Bivens, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, said monetary policy would be \u201cthe single most important determinant of wage growth,\u201d and that he was glad to see workers recognize the Fed\u2019s importance.A conservative group, American Principles in Action, criticized the meeting as \u201chighly political\u201d and inappropriate. It said it would seek a similar meeting to share its view that the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign is damaging the economy.The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said Thursday that its president, Richard W. Fisher, would step down March 19. Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, plans to retire at the beginning of March.The Philadelphia Fed said shortly before the meeting on Friday that it had created an email address for inquiries about its presidential search process. It described the account, which will be maintained by the company conducting the search, Korn Ferry, as part of its commitment to conduct a \u201cbroad search.\u201d\u201cI expect the same thing from Dallas,\u201d said Connie Paredes, 42, who traveled to the meeting as a representative of the Texas Organizing Project, speaking at a rally outside the Fed before the group went inside. \u201cWe expect to be included in the process.\u201dOrganizers from Dallas and Philadelphia said they would press for similar meetings with the presidents and board of the local Fed banks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shops on Wheels, but the Goods Aren\u2019t Sold From the Trunk ", "Date": "2014-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySmall Business8 PhotosMost weekday mornings, Jessie Goldenberg can be found driving around the Flatiron district or Lower Manhattan searching for just the right parking space for her truck. And Black Friday will be no different, as competition for consumer dollars heats up for the holiday season. While there\u2019s no precise formula to finding a premier spot, Ms. Goldenberg said she has learned valuable lessons, including the importance of a corner spot. \u201cWe cannot park in the middle of a block because our entrance is through the back,\u201d she said.\u201cI had very briefly considered opening a brick-and-mortar,\u201d Ms. Goldenberg said. \u201cBut after working at a small boutique in Brooklyn and observing the overhead and seasonal cash flow, I knew it would be too much of a risk for me just starting out. Having the truck involved a lower total start-up cost and felt a lot less risky.\u201dOver the last 10 years, mobile businesses have been on the rise across the country as the economy faltered and aspiring entrepreneurs sought ways to operate businesses for less money.Matt Geller, a board member of the National Food Truck Association, said that the way food trucks created a natural gathering place for people when clustered together helped demonstrate that mobile was a viable option for selling all kinds of merchandise: flowers, music, art and especially clothing.Even though temperatures were plunging on Wednesday in New York, Ms. Goldenberg said her Nomad truck would be open for holiday shopping on Friday, and into the winter on a limited basis. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be out there no matter how cold it is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s Black Friday, so I\u2019m going to tough it out.\u201d It features young contemporary clothing with a California style, Ms. Steffe said, and she and Ms. Romo take their truck to events, private shopping parties and collaborative promotions like a monthly pop-up at the Los Angeles-Westwood W hotel, where guests are given promotional cards that include a small discount at the truck.Mobile boutiques also have a growing presence in New York, Nashville, Houston and the Washington area, according to the American Mobile Retail Association.\u201cThe future of mobile retail is going to be very diverse,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing way to reach people in a memorable form, and it\u2019s a sustainable business model.\u201dMs. Lewis said she had lower overhead expenses than most traditional stores and reached $100,000 in revenue in her first year.Average start-up costs for mobile boutiques, according to Ms. Steffe, who is a co-founder and president of the mobile retail association, generally run from $20,000 to $30,000, based on expenses for a used truck, interior and exterior upgrades and inventory. She said the average truck carried $2,000 to $3,000 a month in overhead costs, including gas and insurance.The success of mobile stores can produce resentment from bricks-and-mortar businesses that sometimes see mobile stores as competitors that are not necessarily required to comply with the same regulations traditional businesses face.While acknowledging the tension, Mike Gatti, senior vice president for member relations at the National Retail Federation, said bricks-and-mortar owners stood to gain from the rise of mobile retailing.\u201cIt creates another competitor,\u201d he said, \u201cbut what we\u2019re seeing is that a lot of them are buying into it now because they are seeing a benefit. For example, a customer might buy something in a truck and then walk into a brick-and-mortar location and find something that complements the purchase. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the big brands start doing it themselves. Because it\u2019s a great way to bring what you\u2019ve got in your store to a new neighborhood to test it in a new market.\u201dAs temperatures drop, weather is another challenge for truck owners. Last year, Ms. Goldenberg closed her truck during the winter, which allowed her to focus on branding and, in the spring, to introduce an e-commerce site that broadened her consumer base beyond New York City.\u201cI instantly learned that I have overlooked how much work goes into setting up a functioning online store,\u201d she said, adding that while it was too early to gauge the online store\u2019s success, she was working on increasing its inventory and improving the site.Regardless of the season, parking is always an issue. In Nashville, Ms. Franklin said she had success in the small shopping district of Hillsboro Village near other boutiques, adding that owners had welcomed her truck.\u201cI don\u2019t really park anywhere you need to feed the meter,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to park in a business parking lot or at an event. I will pay a fee to the business owners to park on their property.\u201dThe rules differ by city, and boutique owners are often subject to changing regulations, making it tricky for mobile businesses to move from one jurisdiction to another.In California, a bill sponsored by Rob Bonta, a Democratic state assemblyman, that was intended to standardize the process for licensing mobile retailers across the state passed the Legislature but was vetoed by Gov. Jerry Brown. The mobile retail association, Ms. Steffe said, would like to see more statewide legislation across the country to simplify and standardize regulations.Some owners, like Ms. Franklin, are finding a middle ground by having both a mobile truck and a bricks-and-mortar store \u2014 even if, for some, the truck is more of a marketing tool than a big component of sales. Of the two, Ms. Franklin said, the mobile boutique actually had higher start-up costs, with the truck costing $35,000 to get up and running in contrast to the $10,000 she invested in a microretail location, which she is planning to expand. But she said the monthly costs of the shop were much greater than those of the truck. \u201cHaving them is like the best of both worlds. When the truck can\u2019t go out, we still have a way to sell stuff,\u201d she said.She still considers the truck her main business, which she said earned almost double the profit of her bricks-and-mortar store. In terms of revenue, she said, \u201cWe are on track to make between $175,000 and $200,000 between both.\u201d Despite the challenges, Ms. Goldenberg said she simply enjoyed life on the road. \u201cI\u2019m putting every dime possible back into the business,\u201d she said. \u201cI took out loans and credit cards to get Nomad rolling, and while I\u2019m still paying those off, I\u2019m off to a pretty good start.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Premier Plans Tougher Stance as Anti-Immigration Sentiment Grows ", "Date": "2014-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a speech delivered in a factory in Staffordshire, in the English Midlands, Mr. Cameron said that if re-elected, he would move to stop immigrants from the European Union from claiming welfare assistance, including social housing and child benefits, in their first four years in Britain.In trying to sound tough on immigration, Mr. Cameron hoped to blunt intense criticism from within his own Conservative Party and from the anti-Europe, anti-immigration U.K. Independence Party, which has threatened his chances of remaining prime minister in the election set for May 7.Those critics seized on government figures released this week showing that net immigration over the year from June 2013 was 260,000, up from 182,000 over the same period the year before, despite pledges from Mr. Cameron to get it down to \u201ctens of thousands\u201d a year.On Friday, Mr. Cameron backed away from proposing an outright cap, or quota, on the number of immigrants Britain would accept from fellow nations of the European Union, which his European partners have made clear is unacceptable.But Mr. Cameron did say they should not be allowed to take advantage of government help for low-wage workers. He pledged to prevent immigrants from receiving child benefit payments if their children live outside Britain.Before they arrive, he said, they should have firm job offers, and if they do not find work within six months, they should leave.Citizens of any new member state of the European Union, he said, should not be allowed to work in Britain until the economies of their countries grow to become more similar to those of other members.Such measures would have to be negotiated with the bloc, however, and if Britain enacted such changes unilaterally, the rules would most likely be challenged in the European Court of Justice.Critics in the Conservative Party and the U.K. Independence Party argue that the best way to control immigration from Europe is for Britain to leave the bloc altogether, which Mr. Cameron says he does not want.He has already promised that if he remains prime minister, he will negotiate a \u201cnew deal\u201d for Britain with a skeptical European Union and then hold a referendum on membership in 2017.Mr. Cameron has tried not to set out too many specific commitments from his European counterparts, for if he does not succeed in securing them, he will be under increased pressure to push for a British exit from the bloc.Britain has proved an attractive place for Europeans, particularly from Italy and Spain, to find jobs while their home countries suffer from the effects of the financial crisis and from stagnant growth in the eurozone.The flexible British labor market has also drawn young people from newer members of the European Union, like Bulgaria, the Baltic countries and Romania.Mr. Cameron, having failed to convince European counterparts of the need to alter the principle of freedom of movement within the bloc, or that Britain needs to pull an emergency brake on European migration, has decided instead to make it less attractive for immigrants.Britain is not especially generous in its social benefits, but it is easier for new immigrants to qualify for them than in most European countries.Mr. Cameron said that immigration was a divisive topic all over Europe, and that overhauls would be good for the bloc as a whole. \u201cIt is contributing to a corrosion of trust in the European Union, and the rise of populist parties,\u201d he said.While negotiations would most likely be difficult, he said, \u201cI say to our friends in Europe: It\u2019s time we talked about this properly.\u201dHe promised once more to push for an overhaul of the European Union, saying that \u201cthis issue of free movement will be a key part of that negotiation.\u201d If successful, he said \u2014 without defining success \u2014 he would campaign to keep Britain in the bloc. While some of Mr. Cameron\u2019s critics in the Conservative Party have urged him to say that he would push for Britain to leave the union if negotiations failed, that is a step Mr. Cameron has not been willing to take so far.While the government can much more easily control immigration from outside the European Union, many arrivals from other regions are students who pay fees to British universities or are highly educated professionals whose talents are needed in the growing economy. Figures show that immigrants pay considerably more in taxes to Britain than they receive in benefits.But what upsets many Britons is the large number of low-skilled migrants coming to take low-paying jobs that many Britons will not fill. One recent controversy in Britain concerned a company that makes sandwiches early every morning for big grocery chains.The company, Greencore Group, was seeking Hungarians to work in its new facility because it could not find enough Britons willing to take such repetitive, low-paid jobs.Stephen Castle contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Texas, Beef Council Hopes to Rope In a Younger Crowd", "Date": "2014-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneSince then, public affection for beef \u2014 and traditional television \u2014 has waned, particularly among members of the so-called millennial generation, who are less inclined to eat meat and more likely to encounter advertising on phones and computer screens.In Texas, where cattle are almost as important to the state\u2019s image as its economy, beef producers are trying to grasp both horns of that dilemma. After a dinner of beef brisket on a warm fall evening in north San Antonio, members of the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association sat back and listened to Jason Bagley of the Texas Beef Council outline how the trade group is moving away from print, television and radio ads. (The Cattle Raisers Association is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)To attract young families, Mr. Bagley said, the Beef Council is turning to food and recipe apps, its website and tailored cooking events.\u201cTimes have changed from where we tried to reach everybody in a TV commercial or TV spot at night,\u201d Mr. Bagley explained, referring to the popular 1992 ad narrated by the actor Robert Mitchum. It is critical, Mr. Bagley told ranchers, to broadcast the industry message in ways that might seem invisible to them, tailored to the more informed palates of younger eaters, who tend to dine out more often and want healthier food options. \u201cThey want to know more about their food,\u201d Mr. Bagley said. Since 1985, livestock owners nationwide have paid a $1-a-head fee on every beef cow they sell to finance research and promotion efforts like the 1990s ad campaign.Last month, Texas started its own version of the program when it began collecting an extra statewide $1-a-head fee. Projected to raise $7.2 million in its first year, the fee will pay for beef research and promotion efforts in Texas, like those being developed by the Beef Council.The group uses custom-made promotions for younger consumers, said Linda Bebee, the council\u2019s vice president for domestic marketing. Because millennials lack \u201ccooking confidence,\u201d the council targets them with how-to events like \u201cGirls Gone Grilling\u201d \u2014 where young women are invited to beef-centric grilling demonstrations \u2014 and online videos. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of confidence in their cooking skills utilizing beef,\u201d said Russell Woodward, the council\u2019s senior marketing manager. \u201cOne of the focuses is to put the information out there how to grill beef, also how it fits in the everyday.\u201d \u201cOnce you get them to be a consumer, eating, you expect that to continue the rest of their life,\u201d he said. (Texas A&M is a corporate sponsor of The Tribune.)And trends indicate that beef producers are wise to cultivate future customers.The Texas cattle inventory has dropped by more than 22 percent since 2011, mostly because grazing land has been lost to drought and suburban development. Three years ago, more than five million female cows in Texas were bearing calves. Today, that number is about 3.9 million, Dr. Banta said. Rising prices, more health-conscious consumers and the rise of efforts like Meatless Mondays, aimed at convincing people that paring down on meat is good for them and the planet, have dampened consumption. Americans eat the equivalent of about 54 pounds of beef a person each year, down from 65 pounds a year in 2007. Beef production is down, and prices are higher for the beef making it to auction, said David Anderson, a livestock economist with the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service. (The extension service is a corporate sponsor of The Tribune.)Dr. Anderson believes demand for beef is up and shows no sign of wavering. \u201cI think you have the situation where consumption is declining, but demand is actually growing,\u201d Dr. Anderson said. He points to the raft of specialized burger, barbecue and steak restaurants popping up not only in Texas, but nationally. While that may seem counterintuitive, Dr. Anderson said calculating beef consumption is tricky. The number is based more on production of beef cattle than the actual number of steaks and hamburgers purchased. For younger consumers, gone are the Fred Flintstone rib eye slabs that were common in the 1970s. Instead, there are artisan and leaner cuts from cows fed grass, not just when growing up, but all the way through auction and up to slaughter.\u201cI think the valuable part of meat is you don\u2019t eat it all the time, and it\u2019s something that should be regarded as a special moment,\u201d said Julia Poplawsky, 26, whom the Beef Council will not have to win over. Growing up in Boerne, Tex., Ms. Poplawsky raised pigs as a member of the 4-H. Today, she is the head butcher at Dai Due, a popular east Austin eatery that features a butcher shop out front. A few months ago, she approached her boss, Jesse Griffiths, the owner of Dai Due, with the idea of $10, six-ounce steaks every Tuesday for a weekly \u201cladies\u2019 night\u201d promotion. Since then, it has taken off. \u201cWe have a lot of younger women in the restaurant,\u201d Mr. Griffiths said. The cuts, as well as the restaurant\u2019s contrast to the typical \u201ccigars and leather chairs\u201d atmosphere of a steakhouse, have made it a winning formula, he said. Many of the diners are young families and singles, the desired demographic the Beef Council is looking for. \u201cI think casual fine dining has become trendy among my generation,\u201d Ms. Poplawsky said. As for the health concerns, Ms. Poplawsky says customers should look for beef in healthier, less fatty cuts. Susan Levin, a registered dietitian with the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a nutrition advocacy group, finds the increased push by the Beef Council troublesome. \u201cNo. Beef is not healthy for you. There\u2019s plenty of research to show that red meat products are associated with a host of chronic diseases,\u201d she said, adding that using more rancher-financed checkoff dollars is part of the industry\u2019s endless cycle to keep itself in business. Jeanne Freeland-Graves, a nutrition professor at the University of Texas at Austin, disagreed. She said there is good in beef, particularly the nutrients iron and zinc. (U.T.-Austin is a corporate sponsor of The Tribune.)\u201cIn the old days, it was cut with a big slab of fat on the outside. That has changed,\u201d Dr. Freeland-Graves said. \u201cI think it\u2019s had a bad rap.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Faded Vacationland, Gambling\u2019s Promise Falls Short", "Date": "2014-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Buy-InMOUNT POCONO, Pa. \u2014 In 2006, when plans were set to transform the crumbling Mount Airy Lodge here into a casino resort, the predictions about the onetime honeymooners\u2019 getaway were as gaudy as its famous old heart-shaped bathtubs.Once fully completed, the new complex would have 400 luxury hotel rooms and thousands of slot machines, pour hundreds of millions of dollars of spending into the area, flood state and local government with tax revenue and create 1,500 jobs in a region that was struggling to chart its economic future. And children\u2019s and educational groups would be showered with donations from a new charity funded by a healthy portion of gamblers\u2019 losses.The reality has been far less rosy. Seven years after opening, the Mount Airy Casino Resort has fewer than half of the hotel rooms envisioned by developers, and a third of the slot machines promised in news releases. It has generated about half of the slot revenue forecast by Pennsylvania officials, and little economic spillover has occurred outside the resort. Expansion plans have long since been shelved. The much-heralded charitable foundation has raised a grand total of $1, federal filings show.Those funds have not been distributed.As New York State officials prepare to announce up to four new casinos, the case of Mount Airy \u2014 once advertised as \u201cYour host with the most in the Poconos\u201d \u2014 offers a cautionary lesson for residents and elected leaders in another faded postwar vacationland desperate to reinvent itself: the Catskill Mountains. The Catskills were once home to 500 hotels and scores of bungalow colonies, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and legislators have talked up gambling as a path back to prosperity.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any casino in America that didn\u2019t say they were going to have more of an impact than it did,\u201d said Robert Uguccioni, who retired in 2007 after 40 years as executive director of the Pocono Mountains Vacation Bureau. \u201cAny sane person could see that it was overblown.\u201dYet each of the three proposals for Catskill casinos \u2014 in or around the borscht belt destinations of Ellenville, Kiamesha Lake and Monticello \u2014 is on the scale of what was envisioned for Mount Airy: hundreds of hotel rooms, thousands of slot machines, dozens of blackjack tables. Myriad dining and entertainment options, championship golf courses, zip lines, water parks. Acres of parking for the anticipated hordes of visitors.The promises sound equally grandiose: oceans of revenue and taxes, and thousands of new jobs \u2014 enough to give a depleted community a sharply different outlook.The Catskills, however, are likely to face many of the same challenges the Poconos had to confront: optimistic revenue projections for semirural locations; ferocious and fast-evolving competition in a market where the novelty of new casinos often fades fast; and a dissonance between resort gambling and traditional family-friendly attractions.William N. Thompson, an emeritus professor of public administration at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas who has studied American gambling for decades, said there was quite likely little overlap between the region\u2019s traditional tourists and a casino\u2019s ordinary customer base.\u201cYou have to think: What do people go to these resorts for? And it\u2019s not to sit at a slot machine,\u201d Mr. Thompson said, pointing to outdoor Catskill pastimes like swimming, hiking and children\u2019s summer camps. \u201cIt\u2019s just a whole entertainment thing that doesn\u2019t say \u2018gambling.\u2019\u00a0\u201dWith nearly 1,000 casinos in 39 states, consumers now view them as more of an everyday local option, like movie multiplexes, bowling alleys or nightclubs, than a novelty requiring a special trip, the way the Catskills and Poconos represented idyllic summers or romantic excursions in the popular imagination, industry experts and boosters say.But there is also little, if any, hard evidence, Mr. Thompson said, that a single casino can give a lasting lift to its surrounding area. Furthermore, he argued, the Pennsylvania and New York model of spreading casinos out may be counterproductive. \u201cThis idea of \u2018Our county gets one, your county gets one,\u2019 it\u2019s so self-defeating,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. He said density, like that found in Las Vegas, was the secret to the industry\u2019s success. \u201cWe\u2019re a concentration of entertainment and social offerings,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then gambling is on top of it.\u201d A regional revival was what officials in the four-county Poconos area had in mind when a local businessman, Louis DeNaples, won a casino license there in late 2006.The Mount Airy Lodge had once been the Poconos\u2019 biggest and busiest resort, with headliners like Bob Hope, Tom Jones and Tony Bennett. But much like the Catskills, the Poconos lost ground as Caribbean vacations and cruises became widely affordable. By the end of 2001, the Mount Airy and another popular resort, Buck Hill Falls Inn, had closed.Mr. DeNaples, a bank chairman whose holdings included two landfills, opened the rebuilt resort in October 2007 with some 2,500 slot machines. It faced fierce competition. A year earlier, the Pocono Downs racetrack had opened a slot-machine parlor in Wilkes-Barre, about 30 miles to the northwest. Then in 2009, the Sands Casino Resort opened in Bethlehem, 35 miles to the south. There was also a racetrack casino 50 miles away in Monticello, N.Y.In 2006, Pennsylvania projected that the Mount Airy site would generate $269 million per year in revenue from slot machines alone. It has never come close. Slot revenue peaked in 2008 at $176 million and fell last year to $143 million. Table games were added in 2010 and total gambling revenue reached $190 million in 2012 but fell 3 percent to $183 million last year. The company was hobbled by a $271 million debt but managed to refinance in 2012, as Mr. DeNaples personally absorbed $106 million of the casino\u2019s old loans.Mount Airy had another challenge when Mr. DeNaples faced perjury charges relating to suspected ties to organized crime figures. He later avoided prosecution after turning over the resort to his daughter.Executives at the Mount Airy Casino and Resort declined to be interviewed for this article. State officials defend the casino\u2019s performance, saying it created 1,220 full- and part-time jobs and resurrected a blighted property. \u201cThe Mount Airy location was chosen to help bring people back to the Poconos,\u201d Douglas Harbach, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, said. \u201cAnd they have.\u201dAs to the state\u2019s inflated early projections, Mr. Harbach blamed a lack of data in 2006 about casinos in the Northeast. Now, there is no shortage of data \u2014 or of new competition from other casinos hungry for gamblers\u2019 losses.Here in the borough of Mount Pocono, the road leading to Mount Airy is dotted with empty storefronts and forlorn-looking T-shirt shops. Despite the jobs the project created at the casino itself, residents look back on their seven years of life with the casino as more like an arranged marriage than a true romance.\u201cIt\u2019s a wash,\u201d Mayor Frederick T. Courtright of Mount Pocono said.The casino actually is in Paradise Township, an adjacent municipality in Monroe County. It and other neighboring counties have received around $7 million a year under a revenue-sharing formula imposed by the state. Paradise receives about $1.2 million a year, about half the township\u2019s annual budget, according to officials. That goes largely to property tax abatement, but it is not a princely sum: For a house worth $100,000, the savings is about $50 per year.But Mr. Courtright said the town had incurred added costs from the casino \u2014 about two miles from his downtown office on State Highway 611, the borough\u2019s main route \u2014 for additional road maintenance and from a rise in vehicle accidents.And businesses outside the Mount Airy have enjoyed little overflow, said Karen Struckle, owner of the Casino Theatre, a child-friendly burger restaurant with a pint-size movie hall.\u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt us in any way, but on the other hand, when they were discussing it, people were saying, \u2018It\u2019s going to bring traffic, and it\u2019s going to be good for the town,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see that.\u201dMr. Courtright said casino patrons often simply stayed, and spent, at the resort, not in town. While it is hard to isolate the effects of the casino on the local economy, there are few indications that Monroe County is booming.Census data show median household income remained stagnant \u2014 even declining slightly \u2014 between 2007, when the casino opened, and last year. Likewise, the unemployment rate rose to 6.6 percent this fall, from 5.2 percent in December 2007.The mayor says the casino certainly may have helped offset the brutal effects of the recent recession, at least for lower-pay, lower-skill employees like dealers and croupiers. \u201cI think most of the higher paying jobs were people that came in from elsewhere, and took those jobs and started living in the community,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201dBut Vincent April, who runs a family-owned knickknack shop on Route 611 and credits his mother and father with inventing the \u201cWe Honeymooned in the Poconos\u201d T-shirt, was more skeptical of the impact.\u201cForget about it,\u201d said Mr. April, who also serves as the president of the Mount Pocono Association, a local business group. \u201cGeezers like me, 50-year-old men, they take their girlfriend or their mistress over there, and they\u2019re done. They don\u2019t come here.\u201dNot everyone on Mount Pocono\u2019s main strip is ambivalent about the casino, however.James Diamond, a.k.a. the Goldfather, buys and sells jewelry on Route 611. He says he does not gamble himself \u2014 he is a born-again Christian \u2014 but is thankful for any and all jobs the casino has brought to the area. He also said he had done business with gamblers looking for cash for gold chains, jewelry and other valuables. One man asked to sell his deceased father\u2019s golden dentures. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m going to go down and play it for Dad,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Diamond recalled.Officials say they are unaware of any increases in crime, prostitution or addiction related to the casino. On a Friday night in late summer, most of the activity on the resort property seemed fairly innocuous. The Thunder From Down Under, a male strip show, performed in one club. Downstairs, a younger but generally well-behaved crowd danced at a weekly pool party.The chief attraction was undeniably the casino, where players and onlookers crowded around craps, blackjack and roulette tables. Many said they were from the region, rather than having traveled long distances.Mike and Laura Apaliski drove from Archbald, Pa., about 30 miles north, simply because the casino had offered them $75 in free chips as part of a loyalty program. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something to do in this area,\u201d Mr. Apaliski, who had just won nearly $400 on slots, said. \u201cBut we\u2019re going home tonight.\u201dThe Buy-In: Articles in this series are examining\nthe ramifications of New York\nState\u2019s embrace of casino gambling.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Art, Investing in Genius", "Date": "2014-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseThe lofty sums stunned even longtime art market watchers. \u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal,\u201d said Michael Moses, a founder of the Mei Moses Fine Art Index, a widely followed measure of art prices, and a retired professor at the New York University Stern School of Business. \u201cAt the Christie\u2019s postmodern and contemporary sale, the average compound return was 20 percent annualized. That\u2019s amazing.\u201dFor better or worse, fine art is now firmly planted alongside equities, bonds, commodities and real estate as an asset class. Financial terms like \u201ccompounded rates of return\u201d have elbowed their way into the traditional vocabulary of connoisseurship even as art\u2019s old guard has trouble with the word \u201csell.\u201d (\u201cDeacquisition\u201d is preferred.)This month\u2019s record sales left some dealers and collectors talking about irrational exuberance and a potential bubble, especially in the soaring contemporary-art market. But Evan Beard, who leads Deloitte\u2019s art and finance practice in the United States, said he didn\u2019t agree. \u201cIf you were seeing second-rate works selling for huge values, then you\u2019d say there\u2019s dumb money out there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the works selling for these high multiples are important works that art historians have deemed innovative and have had influence. People want to own original works of genius.\u201dMr. Moses said that it was hard to describe the art market as exuberant, when overall returns \u2014 about 3.5 percent annually \u2014 have barely outpaced inflation and have trailed equities and, in recent years, even fixed income. He noted that it was contemporary and postwar works that had shown the biggest gains. \u201cThe single most surprising change in the art market is the relative increase in the value of recent art,\u201d said David Galenson, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago who has done groundbreaking research into valuations in the art market. While some art historians, curators and dealers bemoan the emergence of fine art as just another economic asset class, \u201cart and money have always been joined by an umbilical cord of gold,\u201d Professor Galenson said. \u201cThe Renaissance ideal has gone the way of the dodo bird. I say, Get over it. Steven Cohen doesn\u2019t make any pretense of being an art history major. Maybe he\u2019s the Andy Warhol of collectors.\u201dIn a recent survey of art professionals by Deloitte, 76 percent said collectors viewed art, at least in part, as an investment \u2014 up from 53 percent two years ago. And 72 percent said their clients\u2019 primary reason for buying art was related to the \u201csocial and networking scene\u201d and the status associated with buying art, compared with 59 percent in 2012.Given the money involved, it probably shouldn\u2019t be surprising that bankers are treating art like any other asset class, which, in turn, is helping drive up prices and create a more liquid market. More banks are lending against art as collateral. Some are even starting to create collateralized debt obligations with art as the underlying asset \u2014 much as bankers packaged subprime mortgages before the financial crisis.John Arena, senior credit executive for fine art at U.S. Trust, said the bank had a long track record in art lending and had billions outstanding in loans guaranteed by art. \u201cContemporary and postwar art is the driving force,\u201d he said. \u201cThe trajectory has gotten steeper, and the loan requests have gotten much higher. In contemporary art, you\u2019re dealing with a younger generation of collectors, who are comfortable with the economic aspects of their art. They\u2019re leveraging it and using it to take advantage of other investment opportunities, while still being able to enjoy it and keep it on their walls.\u201dHe said U.S. Trust would lend up to 50 percent of a work\u2019s appraised value but that it wasn\u2019t packaging the loans into C.D.O.s. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people are doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it scares me. That\u2019s not our game.\u201d The soaring prices are being driven by market forces rather than any aesthetic or artistic awakening, Professor Galenson said. \u201cAesthetics have nothing to do with it.\u201d What does matter, Professor Galenson\u2019s research suggests, is innovation by the artist. \u201cIt\u2019s really incredibly simple,\u201d he said. \u201cValuable paintings are innovative. Valuable artists are innovators. C\u00e9zanne did his most influential work at the very end of his career, Picasso at the very beginning, when he invented Cubism. Nineteen sixty-two is when Warhol started using mechanical reproductions and photography and reinvented modern art. His works from the 1960s are the very most expensive. Those from the 1980s are much less.\u201dMr. Beard, of Deloitte, said he found Professor Galenson\u2019s research persuasive. \u201cThat you saw the \u2018Triple Elvis\u2019 sell for so much has nothing to do with its aesthetic value or coolness or hipness and everything to do with the fact that historians agree that Warhol with this work influenced art history,\u201d he said.In this respect, the auction catalog may be more important to a work\u2019s value than the art itself. Monet\u2019s portrait of Alice Hosched\u00e9 may be very beautiful, but its sales price of $33.8 million represents a compounded rate of return of just 5.4 percent since its last sale, according to Mr. Moses. And for Impressionist and modern works as a whole, the average was only 3.9 percent.By comparison, consider the work of the Japanese artist Kazuo Shiraga, who died in 2008 after becoming a Buddhist monk. Mr. Shiraga is hardly a household name, and he didn\u2019t figure in the headlines from this month\u2019s sales. But his \u201cBB56\u201d sold for $4.9 million, which represents the single best compounded rate of return \u2014 53 percent \u2014 of any work sold this month, according to Mr. Moses\u2019 calculations. (The work last sold at auction in 2008 for a little over $300,000.)The description of the work from Christie\u2019s catalog hits all of Professor Galenson\u2019s benchmarks. It\u2019s innovative: \u201cPainted directly with the artist\u2019s feet as he suspended himself above the canvas from a rope hanging from the ceiling, the painting represents a unity of the central tenets of postwar abstraction with performance art.\u201dAnd it\u2019s from the most influential period of the artist\u2019s work: \u201cPainted in 1961, \u2018BB56\u2019 dates from a highly significant time for the artist,\u201d the catalog description says, adding that 1962 \u201cwas the year in which Shiraga was given his first solo show outside Japan, at the Galerie Stadler in Paris, where this painting was exhibited.\u201dThat it may look, to some, like a child\u2019s finger painting is irrelevant. \u201cA lot of contemporary art is aggressively ugly,\u201d Professor Galenson said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter in terms of its value.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Shuffling down the aisle, she looks more like a Peruvian llama than anything human. She grunts and buckles.She must have heard the announcement that the flight was full and the plea that everyone not bring too much aboard, because those words blared every 45 seconds. But there\u2019s no selective hearing loss like that of the airline passenger. She reaches her row, predictably discovers that there\u2019s insufficient space under the seat in front of hers and proceeds to colonize the space under the seat in front of yours. You arrive to find that what little legroom you\u2019d counted on is gone. She pretends not to see that you\u2019re glaring at her.A tiff has erupted in Row 18. The man in Seat C has used the overhead for his jacket, which is lovingly folded there, and is protesting any and all attempts to move it. He has miles. He has status. That\u2019s why he was invited to board the aircraft earlier than almost everybody else, and he\u2019s hellbent on milking that privilege for all that it\u2019s worth.I\u2019m not describing a flight that I just took. Among my Thanksgiving blessings was an avoidance of the unfriendly skies. I\u2019m describing every other flight that I\u2019ve taken over the last year. I\u2019m describing a flight that many Americans surely suffered through this weekend.And I\u2019m doing it not simply to rue the horrors of air travel these days, which have been rued aplenty. I\u2019m doing it because there are few better showcases of Americans\u2019 worst impulses, circa 2014, than a 757 bound from New York to Los Angeles or from Sacramento to St. Louis. It\u2019s a mile-high mirror of our talent for pettiness, our tendency toward selfishness, our disconnection from one another and our increasing demarcation of castes. It\u2019s a microcosm at 30,000 to 45,000 feet.Most of the passengers start out in a bad mood, because there\u2019s no good way to get to the airport. The thrifty, efficient rail links that exist in many Asian and European cities remain uncommon in the United States, a reflection of our arrogant and damnable inattention to infrastructure. Even in recent years, during an economic downturn that cried out for the kinds of big projects that create jobs, we made only meager investments. Our airports and the roads and nonexistent tracks around them show it.Kroft noted that there was \u201cstill no consensus on how to solve the problem,\u201d which had grown more severe because of \u201cpolitical paralysis in Washington.\u201dOne of the impediments to consensus is manifest on a plane: There\u2019s little sense of a common good, no rules that everybody follows so that nobody gets a raw deal. Instead there\u2019s an ethic of every passenger for himself or herself. The existence of, and market for, the Knee Defender, that device that prohibits the person in front of you from reclining, says it all.Courtesy is dead. The plane is its graveyard. There\u2019s a scrum at the gate and then another scrum in the aisle that defy any of the airline\u2019s attempts at an orderly boarding process. There\u2019s no restraint in the person who keeps smacking the back of your chair; no apology from the parent whose child keeps kicking it; no awareness that certain foods, unwrapped in a tight space, turn one traveler\u2019s lunch into every traveler\u2019s olfactory reality.And nobody really communicates. Conversation between strangers becomes rarer as gadgets get better, enabling everyone to hunker down with his or her own music and own movies and own video games, to shrink the world to the dimensions of a smartphone\u2019s or tablet\u2019s screen, to disappear into a personalized bubble of ceaseless entertainment and scant enlightenment.In the clouds as on land, the rich get richer, social mobility wanes and people are funneled ever more ruthlessly into gradations of privilege: those in sections with names like \u201ceconomy comfort\u201d; those eligible for the exit row; those who get to board in the first, second or third waves; those consigned to later stages and middle seats.Some blot out all of this sorting with Candy Crush. Some seethe. Too many of us lose sight of more than the earth. We forget that simply being up in the air is an experience that others seldom if ever get. If there\u2019s one thing in even shorter supply than legroom, it\u2019s empathy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Dengue Fever Scourge", "Date": "2014-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialWhile the world\u2019s attention has been focused on Ebola, dengue hemorrhagic fever, an incurable viral disease, has become a pandemic, sickening up to 100 million people a year and killing more than 22,000. It is a leading cause of hospitalization and death among children in some Asian and Latin American countries. Transmitted by mosquitoes whose range is increasing in part because of global warming, the disease is present in more than 100 countries, including in southern Europe and in the United States. A vaccine to protect against dengue is set to become available next year, with more in the pipeline. The French pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur announced on Nov. 3 that a vaccine it has developed performed effectively during the last phase of clinical trials and now awaits regulatory approval. The Japanese drug company Takeda also has a dengue vaccine in the final stages of development. Clinical trials are underway as well for a vaccine being developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, and Singapore University hopes to begin clinical trials for a dengue vaccine in 2016.There are potentially big profits to be made from a dengue vaccine in the fast-growing economies of Asia and Latin America. Sanofi Pasteur, which spent more than 1.3 billion euros, or $1.7 billion, developing its vaccine, could reap \u20ac1 billion a year in profits from sales that are expected to take off briskly as soon as the vaccine hits the market. To Sanofi\u2019s and Takeda\u2019s credit, both say they plan a tiered pricing approach to keep the vaccine within the reach of the many poor people who need it.Brazil has begun a pilot program releasing genetically modified male mosquitoes with a gene that kills their offspring. It is also releasing mosquitoes inoculated with bacteria that block the virus\u2019s development. It is too early to tell whether these new techniques will help. Meanwhile, governments and community health workers must continue efforts to educate people about precautions to take against dengue-infected mosquitoes, like eliminating standing water and improving sanitation in crowded urban centers. In our interconnected and warming world, the pharmaceutical industry will have to focus more effort on diseases that initially affect the poor but then threaten the entire population. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Benefits for Veterans From the World of Travel", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the RoadI AM an occasionally cranky Vietnam veteran who regrets having been a little churlish recently when a cashier in an airport shop asked me if I cared to make a donation to \u201csupport our troops.\u201dIn many airport shops, travelers routinely encounter these solicitations, and I\u2019d long been rankled by the troubling inherent suggestion that we somehow neglect our military people in war zones, to the point that they require charity.In September, the group sent out its 50,000th care package since it was registered in 2009, said Ms. Smith, one of the founders. There are bigger charitable groups raising money for such packages, among them Operation Gratitude, which sends more than 150,000 packages a year to deployed troops, as well as to needy military families and veterans.Paradies, a company that operates more than 550 stores in 75 airports and hotels in North America, has a program called Treat Our Troops, in which customers can donate items \u201csuch as snacks, beverages and toiletries as well as reading materials and electronics,\u201d said Michael Pietryka, the director of marketing. Various United Service Organizations centers then help with distribution, he said.But America\u2019s Moms for Soldiers claims to be unique because it sends packages only to service members in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere in combat zones who, the group determines through working with chaplains and unit commanders, don\u2019t have much home support.\u201cWe attempt to get our care packages in the hands of those \u2014 I call them kids but a lot of them are older than kids, and one was even a brigadier general \u2014 who don\u2019t get mail from home,\u201d said Ms. Smith, who has a son in the military.\u201cMail call\u201d no longer resembles those war-movie scenes where soldiers tumble happily out of barracks to get letters and packages from home. \u201cI could give you a hundred scenarios where some troops are not getting any mail or packages at all,\u201d Ms. Smith said, adding:\u201cSome of these kids came out of foster care and gravitated to the military. Some junior-level enlisted people have three children back home and their families don\u2019t have the money. It costs a lot to send a care package \u2014 $14 for the postage alone, and then more for what you put in it.\u201dThere\u2019s another factor. For many troops, shopping isn\u2019t what it used to be in Afghanistan or Iraq. As we draw down combat forces, we have shut hundreds of operating bases and camps, some with Walmart-size military post exchange stores. In late 2011, for example, the sprawling Camp Adder, 200 miles southeast of Baghdad, which once accommodated 12,000 troops, had been mostly dismantled and resembled merely \u201ca fortified truck stop,\u201d one report said.There many legitimate (and, alas, a few not-so-legitimate), charities and programs for active-duty military personnel and needy veterans. There are also lots of commercial promotions aimed more broadly at the roughly 20 million veterans in the United States.\u201cI was intrigued when I got the email offering,\u201d said Charles Connor, a retired Navy captain. \u201cSo I started to cruise through the various steps of registering, and on about the third page that\u2019s when you get the bad news that you have to pay to get this lousy 5 percent discount. The tone-deafness of this was breathtaking.\u201dBut United says the program is popular. \u201cThe feedback has been generally good,\u201d said Rahsaan Johnson, a spokesman.

Initially, those forces were understood by the population to exist for its defense. During the second intifada in 2002, Palestinian security forces confronted the Israeli Army using their light weapons. Israel responded by largely destroying the Palestinian Authority\u2019s security infrastructure.These policies backfire. Palestinian forces lose the trust of local communities when they are seen as enforcing the illegal occupation and the losses of land and rights that go along with it. With no prospect of a just peace on the horizon, a subcontracted Palestinian jailer is little better than an Israeli jailer, and may even be more psychologically humiliating.Palestinians under Israeli occupation need a police force to maintain internal law and order, but one that is accountable to the people themselves, not to Israel or the donor community. There is no question that fundamental internal reform is needed, but the stalled reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, which briefly bore fruit in their jointly agreed Palestinian Authority government, makes it difficult to imagine this happening anytime soon.The international donor group, however, need not wait. Donors should recognize that reforming the authority\u2019s security forces is a nonstarter in the context of prolonged military occupation.Some Israeli politicians may be content to see an unreformed Palestinian Authority continue to be discredited as long as this obstructs any peace settlement that would end Israel\u2019s occupation.

The restaurant called El Sol King Pollo, with its tripe tacos and menudo, across Main Street from the Paisley Patch Boutique, with its gingham backpacks and monogrammed gifts for children.The wave of Latinos hit this small North Alabama town in the 1990s. Many were undocumented immigrants willing to kill and cut fowl on the lines of the region\u2019s plentiful chicken plants. Eventually Albertville, a city of 21,000, settled into its new reality, whether people liked it or not. And many have not.\u201cIt\u2019s been contentious at times, because it\u2019s brought a lot of the unknown,\u201d said Elizabeth Summers, managing editor of The Sand Mountain Reporter, a local paper. \u201cAnd people don\u2019t deal well with the unknown.\u201dLike those in cities and towns across the country, people in Albertville Friday were trying to make sense of what will change and what will not after President Obama announced his executive action extending protections from deportation to millions of undocumented immigrants. For the group of early-bird regulars having breakfast at the local McDonald\u2019s, the news was expected and unwelcome. Joey Hartline, a local contractor, called Mr. Obama\u2019s action an act of \u201cdomestic terrorism.\u201d\u201cHe needs to be arrested and tried for treason,\u201d he said.The plan would grant as many as five million unauthorized immigrants temporary reprieve from deportation and provide many of them with authorization to work in the U.S.Others are already daring to hope. A few hours later at El Sol King Pollo \u2014 just before a lunch rush that would see the restaurant fill to capacity with white customers \u2014 Maria Garcia, a waitress, said that she hoped that Mr. Obama\u2019s action would change her neighbors\u2019 opinions about people like her.\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t like us because we\u2019re illegal,\u201d said Ms. Garcia, 29. \u201cBut now we can emerge from the shadows, we can go into the streets without fear.\u201dWhite people, she said, often say that people like her do not pay taxes. No more.\u201cNow we will pay like any other person,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s going to change this place a lot.\u201dThe most important element of Mr. Obama\u2019s action, announced Thursday night, will give temporary protection to immigrants like Ms. Garcia, who have lived in the country for five years, and whose children are United States citizens or lawful permanent residents (they must also prove that they have not committed serious crimes). For the Latinos of Albertville, it marks a dramatic turnaround from 2011, when state legislators passed one of the nation\u2019s toughest laws targeting illegal immigrants.The goal, a sponsor said at the time, was to \u201cmake their lives difficult and they will deport themselves.\u201d In Albertville, many Latino families vanished.But the federal courts eventually rolled back many aspects of the law, and soon the immigrants were back, it seemed, in full force. Those unable to lay low enough found themselves paying steep fines for driving without a license. Or worse.\u201cIt has been the saddest thing for so many people who were here, and in every other way following the laws,\u201d said Alejandro Silvestre, 36, a Guatemalan-born father of three and an owner of a strip-mall cellphone shop. \u201cBut they got grabbed and sent back to Guatemala or Mexico and their families stayed here. Sometimes their kids were raised by others. For me, thank God, that has never happened. But one is always thinking of that.\u201dMr. Silvestre is among those who are hoping their lives will be transformed by Mr. Obama\u2019s action. On Thursday evening, just before the president\u2019s speech, he imagined the places in the United States he may soon visit without fear of being deported. \u201cThis is a great country,\u201d he said, \u201cbut what does it matter if we are unable to travel and enjoy it?\u201dOther Hispanics were more skeptical. \u201cPura mentira\u201d \u2014 pure lies, said Jos\u00e9 Perez, 37, a construction worker from Oaxaca, Mexico, on Thursday night. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be nice words. I doubt it\u2019s going to change anything.\u201dThe next morning, Gabriela Watson, an immigration attorney in downtown Albertville, said her phone had been ringing off the hook with clients who wanted to know when and how to apply. She was telling them to gather their tax records, their children\u2019s report cards, and other documents they could use to prove they had been here for five years.\u201cThis new thing gives them hope,\u201d she said. But many whites said they felt stung by what they see as an audacious and unconstitutional move by a president that they never much cared for in the first place. Some worried that the action would trigger a new wave of illegal immigrants. Terry Chandler, a retired insurance agent, was sitting in the McDonald\u2019s Friday morning with Mr. Hartline and a group of white and mostly older men. A number of them said they were proud and respectful of the immigrants who elected to go through the legal and time-tested process of naturalization. But Mr. Obama\u2019s action, they said, felt like a cheat. Mr. Chandler said that the undocumented immigrants had been stressing the local health and school systems here without paying their way. It pained him that they were now being rewarded. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong,\u201d piped in Julian Campbell, 80. \u201cWhat about the people who come here and done it right?\u201dElsewhere, opposition to the order was more visceral.\u201cWell, hell yeah, a big majority of them\u2019s dirty,\u201d said Kyle Davis, a former state trooper, perched on a folding chair in an auto supply shop. He was asked what effect the action might have on Albertville. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to get any better,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty simple.\u201dBut others had a more complex view. \u201cI\u2019m mixed about it,\u201d said Jeff Richards, 50, a project manager at Carmon Construction. Mr. Richards said that he had a good friend who was undocumented, and a hard worker. \u201cI\u2019d probably have him in a supervisory role if he were legal, but I can\u2019t,\u201d he said. Mr. Richards did not know if his friend would be eligible to stay in the country under Mr. Obama\u2019s plan. But he said he wondered whether there were enough jobs to support all of the immigrants who will now enter the legitimate job market.It was one reason to worry. But Alvaro Jaramillo on Friday only wanted to talk about the reasons to hope.A 50-year-old waiter from nearby Guntersville, Ala., he figures he will be covered under the new amnesty. Once he knows he is shielded from deportation, he said, he plans to apply for a small-business loan and open his own restaurant. \u201cPeople will see it will be good for the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will allow us to enter normal life along with them. And the economy will grow.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Builds Financial Ties to Neighbors", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China unveiled a series of measures on Monday aimed at strengthening financial ties with neighboring nations \u2014 and potentially weakening Asia\u2019s ties to the United States. The moves underscore China\u2019s rising economic clout, as it competes more aggressively for trade deals and investment dollars. On Monday, South Korea and China, already its largest trading partner, struck a broad agreement, removing tariffs on 90 percent of goods. Top officials from Australia, which trades more with China than with the United States, are on the verge of a similar deal.In that vein, China\u2019s central bank unexpectedly pushed up the heavily controlled value of the country\u2019s currency, the renminbi, on Monday morning in the sharpest single-day move in more than four years; the change makes goods from other countries more competitive in the Chinese market. And Chinese securities regulators announced on the same day that they would begin allowing investors in Shanghai and Hong Kong to trade on each other\u2019s stock markets on Nov. 17, a step that could strengthen both cities\u2019 roles as financial centers in Asia.President Obama did announce on Tuesday morning that the United States had reached a bilateral understanding with China on eliminating tariffs for a wide range of information technology products, including video game consoles, computer software, medical equipment, GPS devices and next-generation semiconductors. China and the United States will now try to persuade other countries to accept the same terms so as to broaden their understanding into a global pact under the auspices of the World Trade Organization in Geneva.While the United States still exports many high-technology goods, China is the world\u2019s dominant exporter overall of electronics and has much to gain from an elimination of tariffs as well. Asian neighbors like Taiwan, South Korea and Japan increasingly find themselves supplying China\u2019s huge electronics industry, deepening their economic dependence on decisions made in Beijing.While many of China\u2019s neighbors are watching cautiously, their concerns are relatively muted at this point. President Ma Ying-jeou of Taiwan said in an interview last month that China was now the largest trading partner for 17 of its 23 neighbors. He added: \u201cThe present situation warrants our attention but does not call for excessive anxiety.\u201dThe situation is more complex for the United States. Beijing\u2019s ever-bolder trade and currency initiatives coincide with an increasingly harsh atmosphere for many foreign investors. Dozens of multinational companies have been raided this year and accused of misconduct, including monopolistic behavior, price collusion and bribery. Multinationals have argued that while they do not condone misbehavior, many transgressions are common in the Chinese economy and less often punished when domestic businesses, especially state-owned enterprises, do the same thing.Still, the timing of Chinese currency move, just as President Obama arrived in Beijing, represents an olive branch of sorts to both the United States and Asian leaders. For years, the United States has pressed for Beijing to allow a stronger renminbi. China has emerged as the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after the United States. And a stronger renminbi would help the exports of other economies in the Asia-Pacific region. The renminbi strengthened on Monday after the People\u2019s Bank of China raised its morning fix of the currency\u2019s value by 0.37 percent, to 6.1377 renminbi to the dollar. It was the largest single-day increase in the currency\u2019s value since June 22, 2010, when the renminbi jumped 0.43 percent after the government scrapped an informal peg to the dollar that had been put in place during the global financial crisis.\u201cIt\u2019s a giveaway at APEC, in the sense that China wants good relations moneywise with other APEC members,\u201d said Li Kui-wai, an economist at the City University of Hong Kong. \u201cIn the long run, it\u2019s not much \u2014 it\u2019s a gesture, they can give away a bit to please other APEC members.\u201dThe unexpected increase comes after China announced on Saturday a near-record trade surplus for October of $45.4 billion. That trade surplus gives China\u2019s economic policy makers the political cover they may need in dealing with likely objections from the country\u2019s powerful and politically influential export sector.Chinese exporters have long lobbied for a weak currency to make their products more competitive in foreign markets, warning that a stronger renminbi could lead to job losses at export factories. \u201cIf this appreciation in the renminbi continues, it will certainly have a negative impact on our business,\u201d said Abby Lin, a sales executive at the Zhejiang Cobo Technology Development Company, a maker of shower stalls in Huzhou, China.Beyond China\u2019s willingness to liberalize its markets, the various moves reflect a practical need on the part of the government. With the trade surplus continuing to bring a torrent of dollars into the country, China\u2019s leaders have been looking for a more productive approach than continuing to have the central bank buy huge sums of dollars and add them to its reserves through currency intervention. That strategy for blocking appreciation of the renminbi has antagonized China\u2019s neighbors and prompted a cautious search for ways to allow more imports through trade agreements and more foreign investment.\u201cThe government\u2019s decision to pursue more channels for capital to go out reflects the need to increase the amount of outflows,\u201d said Julia Wang, an economist at HSBC.Along with hashing out deals with top trading partners, China announced on Sunday a $40 billion Silk Road fund to invest in infrastructure and natural resources development in neighboring countries. Beijing is also trying to rally support for its vision of a trade agreement that would encompass all of Asia and the Pacific. China has been vague on the details of a broader pact, saying that an initial study should be done over the next two years. But most economists expect that a Chinese-led deal would be much more modest in terms of letting each country continue to protect some industries from imports.Shane Gunther, a head of equities at UBS, said it would give investors access to a market in China that is worth $3.9 trillion. \u201cThe launch of the H.K.-Shanghai Connect program is a milestone in the evolution of China\u2019s financial sector and the opening of its capital markets,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea; Michelle Innis from Sydney, Australia; and Hilda Wang from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

In its heyday, it was the biggest gold strike in the world, financing ornate hotels, halls and civic structures. Within a century the mines were depleted and the economy shrank, but recently the town of 85,000 has emerged as a cultural escape for Melburnians as a new wave of entrepreneurs and institutions has adapted the historic Victorian storefronts and grand bank buildings to new uses. The former jail is set to reopen as the 1,000-seat Ulumbarra Theater in 2015, but weekenders will already find renewal aplenty.Housing a strong collection of Australian and European art from the 19th century forward, the Bendigo Art Gallery added a wing for exhibition and storage this spring. The museum is credited with sparking new life in Bendigo by landing high-quality touring shows. From Dec. 12 through March 1, it will reprise and expand on an exhibition of the Sydney-born contemporary painter Ben Quilty that appeared at London\u2019s Saatchi Gallery earlier this year.The husband and wife chefs Nick and Sonia Anthony worked in London and Singapore before returning to his hometown to open the farm-to-table Masons of Bendigo in a former glass factory.

Dannel P. Malloy four years ago. Mr. Lester\u2019s quiet shop, struggling under the weight of rising taxes and a burdensome accreditation process for his barber-training academy, attests to the fact that not much has changed.\u201cThe governor is doing what he can,\u201d said Mr. Lester, a Democrat like Mr. Malloy. \u201cBut as a businessman I\u2019m thinking about myself first, and taxes are something that I hate. I built this place from a clipper and an outliner. I don\u2019t want to give anything to the government.\u201dDays before the polls open in an election that Thomas C. Foley, Mr. Malloy\u2019s Republican challenger, has cast as a referendum on the incumbent, voters across the state are struggling to reconcile themselves to their downsized prospects. For public employees who once sought a raise, or storekeepers hoping for a bump in demand, merely getting by in a stalled economy evokes a mixture of gratitude and resentment.In dozens of interviews outside bodegas and golf courses alike last week, many residents still bristled over Mr. Malloy\u2019s decisions early in his term to raise taxes and to coax concessions from unions.Others have come to view the same choices with grudging admiration, relieved that a governor finally made the hard choices required to keep the state afloat.Support for Mr. Malloy was often accompanied by a shrug and backhanded praise. Ron Brennan, an 86-year-old salesman at Deep River Hardware Company, near a bucolic bend in the Connecticut River, said approvingly of the governor: \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s destroyed anything.\u201dThe store\u2019s owner, Art Davies, countered that in his zeal to woo large corporations, Mr. Malloy had let middle-class business owners flounder. \u201cThey want to take care of the big guys,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in the meantime, they\u2019re dragging everybody else down.\u201dOn Sunday, Mr. Foley, a former private-equity executive, rolled through western Connecticut on what he called a \u201cnew direction tour,\u201d promising to pay for planned tax cuts by cutting health care costs and what he called \u201ccorporate welfare.\u201dThe same day, Mr. Malloy enjoyed a visit from President Obama, who told nearly 2,000 rambunctious supporters at a high school gym in Bridgeport that Mr. Malloy had \u201cmade the tough calls.\u201d\u201cAnd while it has not always been easy and it\u2019s not always been without sacrifice,\u201d Mr. Obama added, \u201cthere is progress here in Connecticut to be proud of.\u201dThe campaign \u2014 a rematch of the 2010 Malloy-Foley contest \u2014 has not been easy for voters, either: It has muddled party allegiances and exposed divisions among families and friends.Carl Hinebaugh, 54, a Republican from Waterford, echoed one of Mr. Foley\u2019s slogans when he said he was considering retiring to Panama to escape the cost of living. But he said a dropping unemployment rate and disgust at Mr. Foley\u2019s harsh handling of unions during his private-equity career had moved him solidly to Mr. Malloy\u2019s side.Arguing with a few Republican friends at a coffee shop in Groton, he said, \u201cCome on, if you\u2019re a realist, you can\u2019t help raising taxes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not saying Malloy is the best guy in the world, but I think Foley is the Antichrist,\u201d he continued. \u201cMalloy stepped up to the plate when the shooting happened in Newtown.\u201dThe strict gun-control bill that Mr. Malloy signed in 2013 has also alienated some working-class voters in eastern Connecticut. Paul Planchon, 31, a welder at General Dynamics Electric Boat in Groton, said hunters had been unfairly punished by the new rules, which banned many assault-style weapons and large ammunition magazines and introduced background checks.\u201cI want to like Malloy,\u201d he said, but referring to the gun-control law: \u201cI think it\u2019s abusing citizens more than stopping actual criminals.\u201dEven in industries enjoying job gains that have been trumpeted by Mr. Malloy, some workers were skeptical of his approach. While Mr. Malloy offered some companies huge subsidies, they said, he had forgotten how expensive it was for smaller businesses to hire new workers.Jim Burns, a product manager at an aviation parts business in Bloomfield, said the costs of hiring a full-time welder were so high that he planned to ask a neighbor for part-time help. While Mr. Malloy has often cited increased jet-engine orders at Pratt & Whitney, Mr. Burns said such growth was a cyclical response to global aerospace-industry trends.\u201cAt least Foley\u2019s talking about change,\u201d he said.For the state\u2019s union laborers, change has taken various forms during Mr. Malloy\u2019s tenure. Jay Valentin, a program director at the state\u2019s Blue Hills substance abuse center in Hartford, was looking forward to a raise until Mr. Malloy negotiated $1.6 billion in union concessions in 2011, forcing workers to accept fixed wages.\u201cI was affected, but not as hard as I could have been,\u201d said Mr. Valentin, 56, of Meriden. \u201cI got to keep my job.\u201d And Mr. Malloy\u2019s conciliatory approach helped. \u201cHe apologized. He talked to people about it,\u201d Mr. Valentin added.People at the other end of the economic spectrum said they felt pushed out of the state by its onerous estate and income taxes.Bill Loftus, 56, an investor in Westport, said Mr. Malloy\u2019s decision to raise taxes would only compel more retirees to flee to Florida.Still, his enthusiasm for Mr. Foley was muted. \u201cI guess I\u2019m voting for him,\u201d Mr. Loftus said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not really sure why I\u2019m doing it.\u201d\u201cI feel more anti-Foley than pro-Malloy,\u201d he said.On Nancy Kalal\u2019s farm in East Lyme last week, ladybugs buzzed outside her kitchen while she surveyed her cattle. As employees of Pfizer have been laid off, she said, she has watched customers who used to buy beef disappear.Mr. Malloy\u2019s tough stance during labor negotiations in 2011 convinced her that he wanted unions to share the burden.\u201cAt least he\u2019s thinking outside the box,\u201d said Ms. Kalal, 61, a Republican. \u201cI worked my little tush off for years. Unions need to give more.\u201dBack in Hartford, Mr. Lester tried to coax customers inside his barbershop with a discount timed to the part of the month when benefit checks start to run low.He described how Mr. Foley\u2019s business expertise had made him think about crossing party lines. But he worried aloud that Mr. Foley\u2019s pledge to cut taxes could exacerbate the problems of underserved urban communities.\u201cI cry about taxes all the time, but I like to look at the totality of the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIs the tax increase necessary to keep the state running?\u201dKristin Hussey contributed reporting from Brookfield, Conn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": " Jobs Data Show Steady Gains, but Stagnant Wages Temper Optimism ", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Labor Department estimated that employers added 214,000 jobs in October, and the official unemployment rate dropped to 5.8 percent, down sharply from 7.2 percent a year ago. The increase in payrolls \u2014 combined with a revision that added 31,000 jobs to previous reports from August and September \u2014 put the average monthly job gain for the last six months at about 235,000. That pace, several analysts said, indicated that the economy was gathering momentum.But the report also found that wages were rising only slightly faster than the rate of inflation, fueling the debate over just how strong the labor market really is. Over the last 12 months, wages are up just 2 percent, which helps explain much of the disconnect between increasingly cheery assessments from many economists and the public\u2019s continuing discontent.\u201cWe are adding jobs, but it is still a wageless recovery,\u201d Elise Gould, an economist with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said, adding that average hourly earnings rose only 0.1 percent in October after no gain in September. \u201cThe economy may be growing, but not enough for workers to feel the effects in their paychecks.\u201dMany economists nonetheless found plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the future.The number of people walking away from the labor market has halted, while the average number of hours worked ticked up. And a survey of households, though generally considered less reliable than figures gathered from employers, found that more than 683,000 people had been hired into a new job last month. \u201cLabor force participation actually rose\u201d to 62.8 percent, said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company, who noted that the drop in unemployment was not simply a result of people dropping out of the work force. A broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged job seekers or those stuck with only part-time work dropped to 11.5 percent, down more than 2 percentage points from the seasonally adjusted figure from a year ago.The headway on jobs can be seen as validation of the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to end its bond-buying campaign last month, while the lack of wage growth is likely to add caution to the Fed\u2019s considerations over when to raise interest rates next year.\u201cI\u2019m not thinking we\u2019re behind the curve,\u201d Loretta J. Mester, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CNBC on Friday, meaning that the latest jobs numbers had not convinced her that the Fed should move more quickly.Some analysts counseled patience on the wage front, predicting that the strengthening job market would soon translate into tangible increases. \u201cWe think this is a very strong report,\u201d said Michael Gapen, an economist at Barclays. \u201cWe will see wage gains going forward. They just didn\u2019t show up in this report.\u201dOctober Jobs data show solid employment growth.Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics, said the Labor Department\u2019s figures might not reveal all the progress that has been made. \u201cThe employment cost index is a much more comprehensive measure of wage growth, on which the Fed has traditionally put more weight,\u201d he noted, concluding that \u201cit shows a very clear acceleration in wage growth\u201d over the last six months. Perhaps, but as Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez pointed out, what people care about is their weekly paycheck. \u201cWages are what matter to living standards,\u201d he said.Mr. Perez noted that workers had benefited from few of the gains in productivity in recent decades. \u201cSweat equity isn\u2019t translating into financial equity, even while the C.E.O.s of those companies are reaping dramatic rewards,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the angst and frustration that I see across this country.\u201dWhile the recovery from the recession is in its sixth year, stagnant wages and the wide gap between the rewards for those at the top of the income ladder and for ordinary workers have left many people disenchanted with their economic prospects.Election Day exit polls found that 78 percent of those surveyed were very or somewhat worried about the future of the economy, while two-thirds said they believed the economy was getting worse.\u201cIt may seem counterintuitive that wages and salaries are growing the slowest in industries where jobs are growing the fastest,\u201d LaVaughn M. Henry noted in an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\u2019s Cincinnati Branch, \u201cbut it actually is not.\u201d Because many of the new jobs in the leisure, hospitality and retail industries require little training or credentials, he explained, there is little pressure to raise wages.Low-paying leisure and hospitality jobs accounted for nearly one in eight new jobs created in the past year, economists at IHS Global Insight noted, while many of the newly reported hires were teenagers. There were also racial disparities in the job gains, with whites experiencing an unemployment rate of 4.8 percent compared with 10.9 percent for blacks and 6.8 percent for Hispanics.The persistent problem of long-term unemployment showed no signs of improvement this month, with 2.9 million people out of work for 27 weeks or more. This group accounts for about a third of those without jobs.Even the gloomiest assessments, however, acknowledged that no matter how tepid one might think the recovery is, the United States is still far outpacing Europe. Six years after a debt crisis hit the continent, unemployment in the European Union has edged down only slightly to 11.5 percent from a peak of 12 percent last year. It is nowhere near returning to precrisis levels of around 7 percent.There are other signs of the American economy\u2019s strength. Over the last 12 months, according to a report released on Wednesday, the number of bankruptcy cases filed in federal courts dropped 13 percent to 963,739, the lowest since the 2007 fiscal year. And consumers, encouraged by falling gasoline prices, are more upbeat about job prospects than at any time in the last six years.Steve Roesner, president and chief operating officer of Quatro Composites in Iowa, which produces structures for manufacturers in the aerospace industry, said he hired 100 new workers this year, bringing the company\u2019s total staff to 220.

{"Headline": "Putin Plays Hardball", "Date": "2014-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis week marks the fifth anniversary of Sergei Magnitsky\u2019s death in a Russian prison. He was 37 years old, a member of the emerging middle class who worked as a lawyer for a man named Bill Browder, the leader of the largest Russia-only investment firm in the world. Browder\u2019s company, Hermitage Capital Management, started with $25 million during the Wild West-era of early Russian capitalism and had $4.5 billion in assets by the early 2000s.Over time, Browder became an activist investor of sorts, exposing corruption in Russian companies and trying to make Russian capitalism more transparent. In doing so, he thought, he could both steer Russian companies a little closer to the Western model while also making money for his firm.Browder pleaded with Magnitsky to flee the country, as his other lawyers had done. But Magnitsky insisted on investigating \u2014 and speaking out about \u2014 the fraud that had taken place. For his troubles, he was imprisoned in 2008. By summer of 2009, he had developed pancreatitis, which went untreated despite his pleas. He died that November. Browder says that when he learned of Magnitsky\u2019s death, it was \u201cthe worst news I had ever received in my life.\u201dEver since, Browder has worked to find ways to extract some justice on Magnitsky\u2019s behalf. Well before the current Western sanctions on Russia, for instance, Browder pushed for travel and financial sanctions to be imposed on the Russian officials who were involved in Magnitsky\u2019s imprisonment. In December 2012, Congress passed a bill that did just that, called the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act. Browder continues to push for similar laws in various European countries.In July 2013, Russia put both Magnitsky and Browder on trial. The two men were accused of tax evasion going back to 2001 \u2014 despite the fact that the statute of limitation in Russia for tax evasion is 10 years. It was the first posthumous trial in Russia\u2019s history. The judge in the case was among those who were on the U.S. sanctions list. To the surprise of no one, Magnitsky and Browder were both convicted, one posthumously and the other in absentia.There is another thing the Putin government has been doing to get back at Browder. It has made repeated attempts to have him put on Interpol\u2019s \u201cRed Notice\u201d list \u2014 which is a kind of international wanted-poster for fugitives. The idea is that when a person on the list is arrested in one country, he or she would be handed over to the country where he or she is wanted.The first attempt came in May 2013. Browder succeeded in pushing it back. The second attempt came two months later \u2014 soon after Browder\u2019s nine-year sentence by a Moscow court. Again, Interpol declined to issue a Red Notice on Browder. This past winter, a Russian delegation visited Interpol headquarters in Lyon, France, to press its case. Thanks to last year\u2019s trial, Russia could now say that Browder had been convicted of a crime.Sure enough, Interpol \u2014 which, just two weeks ago, installed a new secretary general, a German lawyer named J\u00fcrgen Stock \u2014 has agreed to once again entertain the idea of labeling Browder a fugitive from Russian justice. It is scheduled to make its decision later this week.You would think that Putin\u2019s government has enough to worry about these days, between the crisis in Ukraine, Western sanctions, and the fall in the price of oil, which could push the Russian economy into recession. But, apparently, there is always time to attack Bill Browder. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe Takes Aim at Deals Created to Escape Taxes", "Date": "2014-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 American companies have plowed more money into the Netherlands than any other country in the world \u2014 for five years running.It is the latest case to focus on favorable and often secretive tax arrangements between big multinationals and tax authorities \u2014 deals struck between Apple and Ireland, and Amazon and Fiat with Luxembourg. European authorities have also asked countries about arrangements made with a number of other companies, including Microsoft.But regulators, if they even make a truly determined effort, face an uphill battle in changing the system.Companies, for one, are doing their best to minimize the fallout.Peter Cussons, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in London, said any funds \u201cin principle should be eligible for U.S. foreign tax credit relief, subject to the usual rules.\u201dIn some ways, authorities are performing a futile task: As officials move to close certain loopholes, others are likely to pop up in their place.Last month, Ireland said it would phase out a loophole that Apple helped pioneer and is currently used by many other companies, known as the Double Irish. The maneuver allows companies to pay royalties from one Irish subsidiary to a second subsidiary incorporated in Ireland and domiciled in another country with low or no corporate tax. The strategy is often paired with a Netherlands subsidiary and known as Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich.But Ireland\u2019s move seems intended to cushion the blow for multinationals. Not only will there be a long phase-out period, but the country is setting up a so-called patent box.\u201cThe Irish are under pressure, not only from this legal action and bad publicity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the same in other countries.\u201dForeign investment figures offer something of a road map to tax sheltering.Consider that 15.5 percent of American foreign direct investment goes to the Netherlands, and four-fifths of that goes into Dutch holding companies. Companies like Starbucks often have a number of subsidiaries with varying structures in the Netherlands, in Starbucks\u2019s case with names like Rain City and Emerald City.To put that in perspective, Luxembourg has a population of just over 500,000 people. Germany and France have a combined population of 146 million people.Companies defend their tax practices.Apple has said, \u201cOur success in Europe and around the world is the result of hard work and innovation by our employees, not any special arrangements with the government.\u201d Amazon has said that it received no special treatment. Fiat said it stood by the \u201clegitimacy\u201d of its tax practices. Starbucks said that it had never \u201csought unfair tax incentives\u201d and complied with all relevant rules.\u201cToday you have avenues not to pay your taxes. It\u2019s not even a game or sophisticated,\u201d said Pascal Saint-Amans, the director of the Center for Tax Policy and Administration at the economic development organization. \u201cThe international tax system is outdated, and we\u2019re just bringing it up to date.\u201dMany experts are skeptical about how much this can achieve. The economic development organization\u2019s recommendations would need the approval of national governments, all with their own interests and goals.Will other countries take any steps on their own?Not the Netherlands. \u201cUnilateral measures may actually increase mismatches and other differences between systems, instead of removing them,\u201d the finance ministry said in a statement. The Luxembourg government recently submitted legislation to make its tax rulings more transparent. Mr. Juncker said last week that addressing corporate tax avoidance \u201ccan\u2019t be a Luxembourgish answer \u2014 it has to be a European answer.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding Takers for Lonely Leftovers in a Culinary Nook of the Sharing Economy", "Date": "2014-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBerlin JournalBERLIN \u2014 Fresh from a bracing workout at the gym, Anton Kaiser gazed hungrily into a refrigerator, considering arugula, pineapple jam, salted butter and two bags of green grapes before reaching for a white bread roll, baked that morning. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten all day,\u201d he said, \u201cso it\u2019s great.\u201dPerhaps best of all, it was free, available in the middle of a graffitied courtyard in the Kreuzberg district of Berlin. Like the rest of the offerings in this so-called food sharing refrigerator, Mr. Kaiser\u2019s bread roll would, under normal circumstances, have gone straight into the trash.\u201cSometimes people go on vacation, and they realize they have a refrigerator full of food they can\u2019t finish,\u201d said Valentin Thurn, 51, who was a founder of the site, which now has 55,000 regular users. \u201cOr they have a party, and there\u2019s too much food left over afterward.\u201dA filmmaker and journalist, Mr. Thurn had not planned to start a food revolution, or even a sharing website. But while shooting a segment about Dumpster-diving, he was shocked by what he encountered. \u201cThe feeling I had, when I saw the great amount of edible food in the bins, was anger,\u201d he said.The idea to share food online came up soon after. \u201cI\u2019m a filmmaker,\u201d Mr. Thurn said. \u201cBut people on our team said to me: \u2018They are sharing everything on the Internet. Why don\u2019t we share food?\u2019\u00a0\u201dFor safety, Mr. Thurn and his team established a few basic rules. Nothing with a \u201csell by\u201d date can be shared; no fresh meat or fish is allowed; prepared food is fine, but salads that have been left out all day in the sun are not. As a rule of thumb, people should share food that they would want to eat themselves.Under German laws regulating food distribution, sharing food between individuals is allowed. But the food sharing refrigerators and shelves operate for the most part under the radar. While there have been problems with members being rude or greedy, Mr. Thurn said, so far no one has complained of getting sick.City officials in Berlin, which has 12 such sites, did shut one down last year because no group or person was overseeing it and documenting where the food came from, to ensure that it was safe, as required by law.Working directly with organic grocers, bakeries and other stores, food savers head out in teams to pick up food, whether slightly wilted parsnips, blemished grapefruit or overripe avocados, just before the rejects end up in the trash.\u201cIt really gives you a sense of the value of food,\u201d said Lilo Brisslinger of Berlin, one of an estimated 9,000 food savers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. To qualify as a food saver, Ms. Brisslinger, 26, who holds a master\u2019s degree in Islamic studies, had to take a quiz. Punctuality is one of the main requirements, so prospective savers are tested on what to do in case of vacations or forgetting a pickup appointment. (\u201cOur goal is 100 percent reliability,\u201d Mr. Fellmer said. \u201cOtherwise store managers feel like, \u2018Aha, those hippies again.\u2019\u00a0\u201d)At least once a week, Ms. Brisslinger collects everything from lentil soups to bakery sweets from a small organic shop near her apartment. What she cannot eat she leaves in a food sharing corner at a nearby tea store, or gives to people asking for money on trains.Two neighbors, other single women in their 20s, always gladly accept the extras. \u201cI feel I can make people happy,\u201d Ms. Brisslinger said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a lot of work, just some time to go to the shop.\u201dGeorg Kaiser, 47, chief executive of Bio Company, a chain of slick organic markets that are among the 1,000 German stores working with the food savers, said he welcomed the opportunity to reduce his company\u2019s waste. \u201cFor me, personally, it\u2019s a question of respect for people and the earth,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it\u2019s not sellable, it\u2019s still good food.\u201dIn the past year, food savers and sharers kept about 1,000 tons of food from the trash, organizers said. \u201cOf course, if you look nationwide, this is nothing,\u201d Mr. Thurn said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t consider food sharing the solution. What\u2019s more important than the rescued kilos is to change the way people think.\u201d\u201cWe are used to eating and buying what we want, exactly when we want it,\u201d she said. \u201cI grew up in East Berlin, and in East Germany, you didn\u2019t really have much. But we still managed to eat nice things.\u201d\u201cAll of these supermarket carrots, they\u2019re like soldiers in their plastic bags,\u201d said Lea Brumsack, one of the cafe\u2019s owners. \u201cWhat people buy, it\u2019s not natural.

{"Headline": "The Factory to the World Needs a Hand", "Date": "2014-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Global TrendsBANGKOK \u2014 It\u2019s a measure of the glum global economic outlook these days that even in the fastest growing region in the world, the developing economies of East Asia, there is pessimism and widespread anxiety.For more than a decade China and its neighbors in Southeast Asia seemed to live by a tacit agreement: Trade more, play down disputes and enjoy the rising wealth.Some of the region\u2019s malaise is self-inflicted. The once surging economy of Thailand is projected to grow at just 1.5 percent this year, mainly because of its political crisis. Its neighbor Malaysia, rich in oil and gas deposits, is struggling with some of the highest consumer debt levels in Asia and is planning to introduce highly unpopular sales taxes in an attempt to compensate for sagging government revenue.Asia, known as the factory to the world, still depends heavily on the health of the wider world.\u201cIf you look across the world, I think you\u2019d rather be in East Asia than anywhere else at this point,\u201d said Sudhir Shetty, the chief economist for East Asia and the Pacific at the World Bank. \u201cBut if the rest of the world isn\u2019t growing, who is going to buy all the stuff that you produce?\u201dThe World Bank projects China will grow 7.4 percent this year and southeast Asian countries an average of 4.5 percent. Economic data out of China are mixed, but there are signs of a possible accelerated slowdown. Land sales in cities have declined more than 60 percent over the past year.Nouriel Roubini, the New York University economist, compares the global economy to an aircraft running on only one engine. The United States is the only economy \u201cfunctioning properly,\u201d he said in a recent column.\u201cSo the question is whether and for how long the global economy can remain aloft on a single engine,\u201d he wrote.More than ever, Southeast Asia\u2019s fate is intertwined with China. At the beginning of the century the United States was Southeast Asia\u2019s largest trade partner, but today it is China.Observers lament the resuscitation of major power rivalries in the region, with countries maneuvering and creating alliances to counter China\u2019s weight.Port calls by United States warships are scrutinized as the calculated moves of a chess match. And security concerns now top the agenda of many diplomatic visits, including the trip in October by the Vietnamese prime minister to India, where the purchase of four naval patrol vessels was announced.\u201cThe picture does not look good,\u201d said Kasit Piromya, a former Thai foreign minister. \u201cOver the past 10 and 20 years we were concentrating on the economic side. Suddenly over the past few years China claims that it owns the South China Sea.\u201dOverlapping claims have existed for years, but there was a relative hiatus of tension from the late 1990s through the first decade of this century. In 2011, tensions escalated when Vietnam accused China of cutting seismic cables attached to a vessel exploring for oil and gas. Since then China has conducted naval exercises near the shores of southeast Asian countries, sealed off access to a shoal off the coast of the Philippines, and, earlier this year, towed oil rigs into waters also claimed by Vietnam.Mistrust toward China runs high in Southeast Asia.\u201cI think nationalism in China has overcome the concept of internationalism,\u201d Mr. Kasit said at a meeting of regional security analysts this month. \u201cThat is a cause for concern.\u201dWith the United States entangled in Middle Eastern wars for nearly a decade, China\u2019s neighbors have beckoned Washington to get more involved in Asia.\u201cCountries like the Philippines and Vietnam, which were somewhat standoffish in their ties with the United States, have moved quite quickly toward the U.S.,\u201d said Murray Hiebert, an expert on Southeast Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.Chinese analysts seek to paint a brighter picture, one of a continued peaceful rise that is respectful of its neighbors.\u201cThere is always an impression that is confusing some people,\u201d said Yang Yi, the secretary general of the China Institute of International Studies, the research body of China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \u201cThey are wondering if China has made any adjustment to its policy toward neighboring countries.\u201dSpeaking at the meeting of security analysts in Bangkok, Mr. Yang conceded that the South China Sea disputes were \u201cvery sensitive\u201d and \u201ca headache.\u201d But he added, \u201cChina will continue to adhere to the path of peaceful development and the principle of mutual benefit and cooperation.\u201dTeng Jianqun, a former Chinese naval officer who previously served in the South China Sea and who is now also with the China Institute of International Studies, rejects the notion that China is being more aggressive. He bridles at the suggestion that President Xi Jinping is using nationalism to maintain control at a time of uncertain economic prospects.\u201cI don\u2019t think our top leaders need nationalism to mobilize support,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a misperception for the outside world.\u201dThitinan Pongsudhirak, the director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, says China and Southeast Asia \u201care talking past each other.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t have a common starting point and there are very different interpretations of facts on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous. There is a lot of mistrust.\u201dOne striking example of a factual disagreement is James Shoal, or Zengmu Ansha in Chinese, which is about 60 miles off the coast of Borneo and more than 930 miles from China\u2019s Hainan Island. China claims it as sovereign territory and it forms part of the country\u2019s \u201cnine-dash line,\u201d which delineates Chinese claims to the South China Sea.Bill Hayton, the author of The South China Sea, a book released this year that tracks the territorial disputes, says the problem with China\u2019s claim is that James Shoal is not a territory \u2014 it\u2019s a coral reef 22 meters below the surface of the sea. Mr. Hayton says it was mistranslated or mislabeled a reef by Chinese cartographers.The \u201cweight of nationalist sentiment\u201d prevents Beijing \u201cfrom making a sensible retreat from this nonsensical position,\u201d Mr. Hayton wrote.The territorial disputes are a \u201cmarker of the future,\u201d he said in an interview.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything inevitable about a war. But there is a risk of something leaping from being a petty dispute over a coral reef into one that involves bigger powers,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why everyone is so nervous.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the name of a port city in eastern China.

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the GardenST. PAUL \u2014 Two years ago, Elizabeth Millard discovered a way to put fresh produce into car food. No, she\u2019s not the one who smuggled shredded lettuce into the Doritos Cheesy Gordita Crunch-Fiery, a 490-calorie, zero-noun snack from Taco Bell. Rather, Ms. Millard, a sustainable farmer outside the Twin Cities, did something even more unlikely: she grew a crop of microgreens on the passenger-side floor mat of her 2005 VW Beetle convertible.\u201cWe were shuttling our box of seeds back and forth from our rented greenhouse space to our house,\u201d she said the other day. \u201cAnd I tripped and they fell all over the place.\u201d Cress, mustards, a little purple mizuna.Ms. Millard added: \u201cBeing frustrated and lazy, I decided I would clean them up some time in my lifetime. Which means never.\u201dIt rained the next day. Ms. Millard, now 46, and Karla Pankow, her partner in life and in their C.S.A. business, called Bossy Acres, tracked mud into the car. After that, the June sun busted loose and they threw down the top. I think you can see where this is going.\u201cAbout five days after the incident, I came out to my car in the morning and there was a beautiful flush carpet of microgreens on the passenger side,\u201d Ms. Millard said. \u201cIt looked like a Chia Pet.\u201dThe accident fed the philosophy behind her new book \u201cIndoor Kitchen Gardening: Turn Your Home Into a Year-Round Vegetable Garden\u201d (Cool Springs Press). This is a how-to guide that describes Ms. Millard\u2019s experiments raising crops \u2014 sun-loving outdoor plants like herbs, carrots, radishes, potatoes and tomatoes \u2014 in her Minneapolis bungalow.I, for one, have daydreamed about owning a conservatory: a bright, climate-controlled growing space with windows, supplemental lights and a handy watering source. And here was Ms. Millard to tell me that I already possessed such a space, and it was called my condo.You don\u2019t have to be a plant whisperer to enjoy success in this endeavor. Although, occasionally, you do have to be the bee. In a quest for bug-less indoor pollination, Ms. Millard stimulated the tomato\u2019s reproductive parts with her electric toothbrush. (Talk about forbidden fruit.) But what she discovered, and what the book illustrates, is that it\u2019s possible and even easy to cultivate shoots, greens and the odd root crop with almost no special equipment.The VW microgreens did not become the stuff of a piquant salad. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine the carpet of your car is a food-safe environment,\u201d Ms. Millard said. (What vinaigrette goes with road salt?) Instead, it became a proof of concept. \u201cThe lesson is: Don\u2019t worry about it so much,\u201d Ms. Millard said of her indoor garden. \u201cIf the conditions are right, it will happen.\u201dIn many ways, the gardening conditions in the northland are best suited to ornamental berries, red-barked shrubs and alcoholism. The professional eschatologists (known elsewhere as meteorologists) were predicting scattered frosts for the night after Ms. Millard paid me a house call. It was early September.The parsley and sage in my backyard could hang on until Thanksgiving. But if I didn\u2019t bring the basil inside now, I wouldn\u2019t see it again until May or June.While I was outside, I noticed a volunteer tomato seedling and a stray mint. What would be the harm in digging them up and converting them into house pets? (Ms. Millard recommends converting the garage or a three-season porch into a kind of halfway house where the plants can get acclimated.)I asked Ms. Millard about what may still be growing at her house across town. But she had moved out soon after finishing a draft of the book. While she and Ms. Pankow shopped for farmland of their own, they were dwelling in a downscale version of that VW Microgreen: a 25-year-old Coachman fifth-wheel camper they bought from friends for $2,000. The quarters were homey; a previous owner had gone through the effort of painting the wallpaper.\u201cIt\u2019s surprisingly spacious,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a New York apartment.\u201dExcept, presumably, in New York it would have cost $2.65 million in an all-cash transaction and another $1 million for a parking spot.\u2022Ms. Millard has good news for the yardless metropolitan. Much of the equipment you need for indoor kitchen gardening is already in the kitchen. Sprouts should grow in a Mason jar with a screen lid for air and drainage. Soak the seeds (Ms. Millard likes the flavor of broccoli). Then, after a day or two, turn the jar upside down and wait.Are the white filaments edible food or some type of brassica thrush? Ms. Millard was noncommittal. \u201cI will sprout things if people ask me to,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have not been a huge fan.\u201dFarther down in the cupboards, pie plates or baking sheets make satisfactory planters to grow microgreens or shoots. At the start, plastic wrap can keep the seeds humid. You may even have the shoot seeds in the bulk bin: say, dried peas, raw sunflower seeds or untreated popcorn.Germination isn\u2019t a sign of spoilage; it\u2019s the goal here. Ms. Millard recommends soaking the seeds for a day or two beforehand, changing the water now and again. \u201cIf you leave them longer than that, they\u2019ll give off a really vile smell,\u201d she said, \u201clike burning moldy feet.\u201d At this point, you\u2019re not raising food but developing a biological weapons program.The easiest indoor gardening projects look a lot like seed-starting. You don\u2019t need much dirt: an inch and a half for sprouts, and maybe half an inch for microgreens (a regular lettuce mix, harvested early). \u201cYou can do that on a paper towel,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to grow into their fullest expression of what they could be.\u201d But then, who among us hasn\u2019t thought about their own dirt nap and harbored the same self-doubt?Ms. Millard had dragged a full bag of vermiculite as big as a pillowcase up the three flights of stairs. This, of course, was a bit of a sight gag: the white filler looks like Styrofoam and weighs no more. The idea was to mix it with a bagged organic compost she likes, called Cowsmo. But any indoor potting mix with a little fertilizer would do.\u201cYou want something that drains really well,\u201d Ms. Millard said. \u201cDirt from your garden is too dense.\u201d As a no-pesticide farmer, she welcomed the chance for a clean start. There\u2019s a book to be written about how to breed common garden bugs in the house, but let\u2019s leave that to the newspaper\u2019s entomology expert.Ms. Millard totes a stack of 20-inch black plastic planting flats almost everywhere she goes, the same way a real estate agent seems to bleed a trail of lawn signs. Get the ones with the bottom watering slits and the translucent lids. They are a masterful piece of industrial design, they cost about $1.50 each and they look just like garbage.A Pyrex casserole dish makes a smarter display. \u201cIt may help with the drainage to put a low layer of gravel in the bottom,\u201d Ms. Millard said, prepping the planter. A few handfuls of soil mix flew into the trays. She was no more delicate with the pea seeds and the popcorn kernels, scattering a single layer over the surface. Being housebound, they wouldn\u2019t need a coat of dirt on top.You\u2019ll want to sow at the kind of density you would see in front of the stage at Bonnaroo. Once the sprouts come up, Ms. Millard said, \u201cyou could have someone crowd surf without falling in.\u201dAt this point, Ms. Millard mentioned a piece of look-for-it-in-the-basement gear: a box fan. A little airflow helps ward off disease and stiffens a plant\u2019s resolve.My summer corn crop in the yard had been a mixed success. By that I mean it was a success for the squirrels that stripped the stalks clean and a total failure for me, who waited 80 days and got nothing.\u201cDepending on your conditions in here, after about two weeks you should be able to harvest them,\u201d Ms. Millard said. \u201cCut them like you\u2019re giving them the worst haircut in the world.\u201dI said, \u201cI think I\u2019ve given someone that haircut.\u201dMs. Millard said, \u201cI think I\u2019ve had that haircut.\u201d\u2022What about lights? This is the question that every lay agronomist seems to ask, Ms. Millard said. It\u2019s as if she has proposed a suspect workaround: school without homework, say, or an affair without text messaging (I mean, sex).Ms. Millard dutifully runs through the options in the book. A window with southern exposure will get you somewhere. But the plant will need to be close to the pane, where conditions may be drafty. Incandescent bulbs give off more heat than light. Ms. Millard doesn\u2019t spend too much time on specialty lighting systems: HID, LED or plasma. This kind of expertise and budget are the province of the marijuana cultivator. We have a lot to learn from them.Ultimately, Ms. Millard recommends cheap shop lights, with full-spectrum bulbs (t5 or t8) and reflective hoods. The adjustable fixtures are better still: You can start them a couple of inches above the newly sprouted seeds and raise them as your plants grow.We\u2019d moved on to planting herbs and root crops. Untreated potatoes from the farmers\u2019 market would turn into suitable plants. Just wait for the eyes to form. Ms. Millard suggested putting five or six in a 15-gallon pot. \u201cThey should get some light during the day,\u201d she said. But, \u201cpotatoes do well with the whole benign-neglect situation.\u201d They\u2019re like children that way.Rounded carrots and radishes wouldn\u2019t outgrow their Procrustean beds. She mentioned French baby carrots (\u201ccarefully bred in France!\u201d) and a favorite radish called Parisienne, which had the soul of a carrot. Alas, indoors, they would grow about as fast as the European economy. \u201cCarrots take forever,\u201d Ms. Millard said. \u201cAbout two months, if you\u2019re lucky.\u201dIn the end, she harvested maybe 10 carrots \u2014 not the kind of bounty to run through a juicer. \u201cWhen you spend that much time and love,\u201d she said, \u201cyou slice them up and eat them raw like carpaccio.\u201dShe wouldn\u2019t blame anyone who concluded that indoor kitchen gardening is impractical. \u201cThere\u2019s something of the hobbyist to it,\u201d she said.Before I forget, then, here\u2019s a reminder. In New York City, the outdoor planting date for carrots is only 150 days away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lights and Celebration Where a Wall Divided Berlin ", "Date": "2014-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWithin two or three days, though, reality hit. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t close the wall again,\u201d recalled Mr. Ebert, who helped to organize celebrations here this weekend for the anniversary of the wall\u2019s demise. \u201cVery quickly it was normal.\u201dTwenty-five years later, it is so normal that many residents of this increasingly cosmopolitan European capital can hardly relate to life in the heavily militarized, divided city of the days before Nov. 9, 1989. Moritz van D\u00fclmen, director of Kulturprojekte Berlin, the organizer of the anniversary event, estimates that roughly half of today\u2019s residents never had direct experiences with the 96-mile barrier.Now, slick, modern buildings trace the wall\u2019s footprint. A section of what was known as \u201cdeath strip\u201d \u2014 a sliver of heavily mined land lined by watch towers \u2014 is now a park known for its Sunday flea market and open-air karaoke.\u201cIn the beginning, it was a real fight to get people to understand how important it is, to remember how horrible it really was in the German Democratic Republic,\u201d said Mr. Ebert, who runs an archive devoted to materials from the former East German opposition. \u201cWhat happened around the wall is not normal.\u201dTo remind Berliners and others of the night when the Communist authorities effectively made it possible for East Germans to travel, Berlin organizers lined more than eight miles of the inner-city border with an installation of 8,000 illuminated balloons \u2014 biodegradable for this environmentally conscious country.The balloons, each bearing a message of hope or congratulations, were released Sunday to the cheers of thousands. The project was the visual highlight of a multitude of events and gestures celebrating the anniversary, including guided tours, the unveiling of a memorial to the tragedies wrought by the wall and a debate with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader, now 83, whose shift toward democracy helped make the wall\u2019s collapse possible. Other events on Sunday included a speech by Chancellor Angela Merkel, church services and concerts featuring works by Bach and Beethoven. The \u201cLichtgrenze,\u201d or Border of Light, installation was meant to evoke the brutal division of the past. At the same time, its use of modern materials and techniques symbolized how much the city and the world around it have changed in a quarter-century.Many of the balloons\u2019 messages honored the role played by tens of thousands of East Germans in creating the conditions for the wall to be torn down.\u201cWe wanted people to be able to participate, for it effectively to come from the people, as it did back then,\u201d said Mr. van D\u00fclmen, who organized the event with Mr. Ebert of the Robert Havemann Gesellschaft archives. \u201cBack then it was the people who freed themselves.\u201dOn the night of Nov. 9, 1989, officials suddenly announced that East Germans would be allowed to travel, and crowds turned out by the tens of thousands demanding the opening of a checkpoint at Berlin\u2019s Bornholmer Street. The border guards let them through, unhindered.In the past few years, a city that its mayor, Klaus Wowereit, described in 2004 as \u201cpoor, but sexy,\u201d has grown into its role as the seat of government of Europe\u2019s largest economy, a center of vibrant technology and creative sectors. More than 45,000 new jobs were created last year, drawing nearly the same number of new residents to this city of 3.5 million.Because Berlin has so many newcomers and residents born since unification, organizers said it was important to provide a vivid reminder of what it meant to live in a city and country where families were kept apart under threat of death.\u201cSo many things have changed,\u201d said Christopher Bauder, 41, a lighting designer based in Berlin, who conceived the balloon installation with his brother, Marc. \u201cThere\u2019s buildings where the wall was. The scars are slowly growing over, but I think it\u2019s good from time to time to tear it open just a little bit and take a peek at what it might have been like to live in this city back then.\u201dStill, said Mr. Bauder, \u201cIt\u2019s really hard sometimes to find where it actually goes.\u201d The installation will, at least temporarily, jar memories.\u201cThe wall was heavy, was big, was dark,\u201d Mr. Bauder said. \u201cWe wanted to contrast it with something ephemeral, light and potentially beautiful.\u201dAlison Smale contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Faces Protests in Chicago That Immigration Plan Is Too Meager", "Date": "2014-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 It was supposed to be a triumphant homecoming for President Obama, and a chance to cast his executive action on immigration as the latest chapter in America\u2019s history of welcoming foreigners.But the president was forced Tuesday to pare down a speech aimed at selling his immigration plan by protesters who repeatedly interrupted him to demand even more relief.\u201cI understand why you might have yelled at me a month ago,\u201d Mr. Obama told three women in the audience who stood up to shout slogans of \u201cNot one more!\u201d \u201cStop deportations!\u201d and \u201cThere is no justice!\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make much sense to yell at me right now,\u201d he said.Chicago was expected to provide a friendly backdrop for Mr. Obama\u2019s message: Foreign-born residents make up about 21 percent of the city\u2019s population, according to census figures.\u201cWe\u2019re not a nation that kicks out strivers and dreamers who want to earn their piece of the American dream,\u201d he said at the Copernicus Center, a Polish cultural center on the Northwest Side. \u201cWe are a nation that fundamentally is strong, is special, is exceptional because we find ways to welcome people.\u201dThe speech was part of a multifaceted campaign to build public backing for his executive action. Mr. Obama contended that the new policies would help Americans across the board.\u201cImmigrants are good for the economy \u2014 we keep on hearing that they\u2019re bad,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThe actions we\u2019re taking will grow our economy for everybody.\u201dMr. Obama adopted a more defensive tone when the protesters\u2019 interruptions continued, even after he repeatedly told them, \u201cI\u2019ve heard you,\u201d and implored them to sit down and listen. The president then appeared to confirm Republican accusations that he was effectively rewriting the law.He acknowledged that \u201cthere have been significant numbers of deportations\u201d during his tenure. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cwhat you\u2019re not paying attention to is the fact that I just took an action to change the law.\u201dThe president is bracing for a push by congressional Republicans to block all or part of the immigration initiative by choking off financing. Although public opinion polls show that Americans are broadly supportive of an immigration overhaul, Mr. Obama faces a challenge in persuading them that his unilateral action is justified and in their best interest.To that end, Mr. Obama on Tuesday highlighted the economic benefits of his plan. Senior White House officials have estimated that the five million or so immigrants affected by Mr. Obama\u2019s administrative action would add $90 billion to the American economy in the coming decade.\u201cThere would be no impact in the quantity of jobs for people born in the United States, but there would be an improvement in the quality of jobs,\u201d said Jason Furman, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.Critics contend that immigrant workers would create additional competition for unemployed Americans and those at the lowest end of the wage scale.Mr. Furman said American history told a different story, citing studies of California\u2019s economy in the 1980s and \u201990s, when large numbers of immigrants were granted legal status, and in Miami in 1980, when 130,000 Cubans arrived in what is known as the Mariel boatlift.Most of those affected by Mr. Obama\u2019s action are people who are already in the United States and working, Mr. Furman said.\u201cThis would put them in a better position where their employers couldn\u2019t exploit them, couldn\u2019t use them to bargain down the wages of Americans that already are here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat spills over to wage gains for everyone.\u201dBefore his speech, the president met with local business and community leaders of Polish, Mexican, Irish, Chinese and Nigerian descent.The White House also worked to illustrate the breadth of support for Mr. Obama\u2019s action, releasing a letter he received from Enda Kenny, Ireland\u2019s prime minister, that expressed \u201cwarm appreciation\u201d for the immigration moves.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Week That Shook the Fed", "Date": "2014-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameThe Federal Reserve Board prefers to operate in a shroud of secrecy, and its officials really don\u2019t like having to answer to anybody.Asking such questions is an about-face for the Fed, whose officials have long maintained that it is the most sophisticated and enlightened of financial regulators. And given that the Fed received extensive new regulatory powers under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, it is troubling indeed that it may not be certain that its bank examiners have what they need to do their jobs.The Fed announcement looks an awful lot like damage control. It came late Thursday afternoon, directly after one Senate hearing that was critical of Fed practices and before another on Friday. It also came after a bill proposed by Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, that would change the way the head of the most powerful of the 12 district banks \u2014 the Federal Reserve Bank of New York \u2014 is appointed. Currently, the president of the New York Fed is selected by its so-called public board members \u2014 those not affiliated with financial institutions.Senator Reed\u2019s proposal would give the president of the United States, with Senate approval, responsibility for naming the president of the New York Fed.Clearly, last week was not a good one for the Fed. But it was a good week for anyone interested in understanding how this secretive institution works. Or doesn\u2019t.\u201cThe Federal Reserve\u2019s failure to resolve key issues related to bank involvement with physical commodities has weakened longstanding American barriers against the mixing of banking and commerce,\u201d the report concluded, \u201cas well as longstanding safeguards protecting the U.S. financial system and economy against undue risk.\u201dThe Senate Banking Committee, meanwhile, heard testimony on Friday about the New York Fed and whether it was unduly influenced by the banks it is supposed to oversee \u2014 a phenomenon known as \u201cregulatory capture.\u201dSenator Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat who oversaw those hearings, said in an interview that he was concerned about regulatory capture at the Fed because it could imperil bank examiners\u2019 ability to monitor the safety and soundness of major financial institutions. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the Fed historically has cared way more about monetary policy than they do about supervision,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re shining a light on what they\u2019re doing and their inadequacies.\u201dMs. Segarra\u2019s damaging account is clearly driving the Fed\u2019s internal investigation into whether \u201cdivergent views\u201d can be heard at the institution.Increasing scrutiny of the Fed, and the New York Fed in particular, is absolutely justified, given the immense powers they enjoy. Lest we forget, it was the New York Fed, under Timothy F. Geithner, that let Citibank increase its risky assets in the years leading up to the crisis. And it was the same New York Fed that seemed more interested in bailing out the big-bank trading partners of the American International Group than in rescuing the insurer itself.With the Fed under the microscope, now is also a good time to question some of its secrecy around bank examinations. The Fed\u2019s examiners are supposed to monitor bank practices, looking for outsize risks or other problems. They are based inside banks and are bound by confidentiality rules. This secrecy protects the banks, but it disadvantages investors who try to understand the banks\u2019 financial standing.The heightened bank disclosures are required as part of the Fed\u2019s safety-and-soundness mission as specified under Dodd-Frank. But because the Fed is interested in the well-being of individual banks and not in the S.E.C. goals of investor protection and market efficiency, a conflict is emerging, Professor Hu said.The problem for investors, in his view, is that while they can rely on S.E.C. disclosures of bank operations, they get much less from the detailed submissions provided to the Fed.\u201cWe have two systems of disclosure, and one is not directed to investors and transparency,\u201d he said in an interview last week. \u201cWith the Fed, you really do have regulators wanting to protect banks and willing to sacrifice investors to do so.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s disclosure system, of course, is intended to minimize risks to the economy posed by financial institutions. Obviously, the Fed has no interest in disclosing information about a bank that might cause a run by investors or depositors.Still, investors would benefit from greater disclosures by the Fed, Professor Hu said. The Fed, for example, reveals only final results of its \u201cstress tests\u201d that measure banks\u2019 health. \u201cRight now the Fed does not disclose the precise mathematical models it uses in the stress tests,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we required it to disclose those models, you would facilitate cross-bank comparisons in a way you can\u2019t do right now. You\u2019d also create incentives for the banks to disclose more about their own models.\u201dThere is another benefit to increasing transparency at the Fed. It could be a singularly powerful force against regulatory capture.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Upcycling Coins, Plastic Bags and Keys for Social Change", "Date": "2014-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 When high inflation hit the Lebanese economy in 2007, two designers turned their country\u2019s weakened currency into gold.The designers, Joanne Hayek and Tatiana Fayad, who were university students at the time, started making jewelry from depreciated coins as a \u201cspontaneous hobby,\u201d they said. They then turned it into a business.Since their casual foray into designing accessories, the Beirut-based pair has used the concept of upcycling \u2014 reusing discarded or low-value material to create a higher-quality product \u2014 to turn their line, Vanina, into an international brand with a social message.Vanina\u2019s latest and most opulent collection, Still Life, gives used, nonbiodegradable plastic bags a major upgrade in a collaboration with Swarovski.The nature-inspired geometric designs feature blossoming necklaces and earrings with Swarovski crystals as their centerpieces. The jewelry is produced with a mix of high-tech design and low-tech traditional craftsmanship.Ms. Hayek, who studied architecture, uses 3-D modeling software to calculate the number of plastic bags needed to conform to a crystal\u2019s size and shape and the form that the piece will take. The jewelry is then hand stitched at the designers\u2019 atelier near Beirut.The designers, who named their brand Vanina after a 1970s pop song in French, said in an interview in Paris that they drew inspiration from the history of Beirut, as complicated as that history can sometimes seem.\u201cBeirut is inspiring in two ways for us,\u201d Ms. Hayek said. \u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s full of energy and beauty. At the same time, there are so many issues we force ourselves not to see, but they are still there.\u201dMs. Fayad and Ms. Hayek met when they were 14. They had always known that they wanted to work together when they were older, Ms. Fayad said, but weren\u2019t sure how.Although neither had plans to plunge into fashion, the industry was a natural fit for Ms. Fayad, whose mother owns a shop in Beirut. She grew up accompanying her mother to showrooms, and took an interest in the whole process of fashion, from design to commerce.When the young women decided to convert their jewelry-making pastime into jobs \u2014 while they were still in university \u2014 it was a simple transition, said Ms. Fayad, who studied marketing. \u201cWe were learning so much in our studies, and directly applying it right there with the brand,\u201d she said.The success of their first collection, made with the depreciated coins \u2014 and still Vanina\u2019s best seller \u2014 inspired them to continue coupling design with social activism.\u201cEveryone had a jar of those coins at home. There was an emotional attachment to the lira,\u201d Ms. Hayek said, using an alternate name for the Lebanese pound. \u201cWe realized that fashion can deal with different areas of society and could be more than just dressing you up. It was a tool in our hand.\u201dThe designers have used that tool to extend their brand\u2019s social platform, touching on issues as far-ranging as environmental consciousness and war.Vanina\u2019s Unlocked collection, made from gems and recycled keys, is \u201can invitation to keep doors open,\u201d Ms. Hayek said, adding that the message is applicable to both politics and personal situations.For their Cease-Fire collection, the designers teamed up with the nongovernmental organization Permanent Peace Movement, which works to reduce the spread of small arms. A portion of the proceeds from the line are given to the NGO.Stems made to look like matchsticks, with rainbow-colored tips and assembled in a fanlike shape on a gold chain, form a Cleopatra-collar necklace. Their Grenade Earrings are made of a cluster of stones with an arc of shortened stems. Naturally, each piece comes in a branded matchbox.Fadi Abi Allam, the executive director of Permanent Peace Movement, said that this kind of collaboration between NGOs and private companies was rare in the region. While the line has not raised a large amount for the organization, Mr. Abi Allam said its message was important.\u201cThe terminology \u2018cease-fire\u2019 means a lot: It\u2019s the first step towards peace in a war,\u201d Mr. Abi Allam said. \u201cLet\u2019s make the value of Cease-Fire itself not the money, but the awareness. The value is the same as $1 million for me.\u201dWith Vanina retail points in Dubai, New York, Paris and Tokyo, among other cities, Ms. Hayek and Ms. Fayad have made their collection grow into a budding global brand without outside investment, they say.\u201cWe\u2019ve learned to take small steps while keeping big values in mind,\u201d Ms. Hayek said. \u201cWe want to reach scalability with traceability.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Change: Questions for Colleges ", "Date": "2014-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetters To the Editor:Evan J. Mandery brings welcome attention to continuing efforts by students and faculty at more than 400 colleges to press their administrations to divest from fossil-fuel energy companies. In many cases, however, he does not go far enough in calling out the flawed logic of the arguments against divestment by the university presidents he cites.Arguments like the one put forward by Bruce Shepard, the president of Western Washington University \u2014 that divestment would \u201chave no material effect on climate change\u201d \u2014 miss the point. Divestment is largely a symbolic exercise, and widespread action by many universities would send a powerful message to the public and other investors about the problematic ethics of such investments.Most troubling of all is the claim by Drew Gilpin Faust, the president of Harvard University, that it is inconsistent for universities to boycott an industry when they rely extensively on its products and services. According to that logic, the United States should have never discontinued the practice of slavery.Students, faculty and the broader public must continue to expose and challenge these weak arguments against divestment and encourage universities to divest and commit more of their considerable financial resources to reducing their reliance on fossil fuels. The writer is a master\u2019s candidate in global environmental politics at American University.\u00a0To the Editor:In a struggling economy, phasing out lower cost energy sources without relatively cost-competitive alternatives is cutting off your nose to spite your face.To make this transition doable for financially strapped voters requires government-financed, Manhattan Project-like development of affordable alternatives that will minimize the economic disruption of this transition.To the Editor:Evan J. Mandery is right that \u201cclimate change is our era\u2019s defining challenge,\u201d but the entire issue of fossil fuel divestment should not be the main debate. Whether a university is invested in fossil fuel or not is not the important question.The real question is if that university has a plant-based dining hall, or at the very least, does it support Meatless Mondays and other initiatives intended to lessen our consumption of animal products.Methane and nitrous oxide are far more powerful greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide, and the No. 1 source of such gases is the billions of chickens, turkeys, pigs and cows raised for food.As president of the Vegetarian/Vegan Society at Brown University, a group that tries to raise awareness of such benefits of a plant-based diet, I have found that it is much easier to get college students to rally for their school\u2019s divestment from coal than it is to get them to take personal initiative.The looming danger of climate change can be either greatly lessened or greatly worsened depending on the amount of meat and dairy on our plates. University presidents can take the lead in this effort; it would be a big step in the right direction.To the Editor:Evan J. Mandery promotes the theory that if you sell or refuse to own energy stocks, you will somehow \u201csave\u201d the climate. But smart investors will be able to buy good stocks more cheaply and benefit from the dividends they pay.I agree with Drew Gilpin Faust, the president of Harvard: Boycotting companies that provide us with products that permit us our comfortable lives is \u201ca troubling inconsistency.\u201dUnless a micro-size nuclear engine that can power an airplane or a car is in our future, we will be using fossil fuels, liquid and solid, for the lifetime of all of us.To the Editor:The voices of college students, faculty and administrators need to be heard in the discussion of whether or not university endowments divest from fossil fuel, but another powerful force in moving universities to more ethical investing would be alumni. After all, alumni contribute millions of dollars every year to university foundations.What would happen if we notified our schools that we are cutting our donations this year by the same percentage as represented by their investment in fossil fuel companies?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Job Growth, but No Raises ", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe economy added 214,000 jobs last month, in line with its performance over the past year. Consistent growth is certainly better than backsliding, but growth is still too slow: At the current pace, it will take until March 2018 for employment to return to its pre-recession level of health. Wages have barely kept up with inflation for several years running, and there are no economic or political forces to push them up. Working people can make more when employers bump up hours, which in October averaged a post-recession high of 34.6 hours a week. Workers also will see their paychecks go further as gas prices fall. But they are not getting ahead in any real sense. None of this was inevitable. When the private sector is unable or unwilling to create good jobs at good pay, government is supposed to use stimulus to spur employment. It is also the job of government to enact and enforce polices like robust minimum wages and legal protections for union organizing. But the 2009 stimulus, too small to begin with, was offset by federal spending cuts beginning in 2011, while job-enhancing policies have gone nowhere, in large part because of Republican opposition. Other forces that undermine broad prosperity bear examination. Trade with nations that manipulate their currency, exploit workers and damage the environment to gain unfair advantages costs Americans jobs. An outsized financial sector feeds bubbles and busts that devastate employment. Republican leaders have identified new trade deals and less financial regulation as priorities, but a heedless push on those fronts ignores the negative job-related consequences. The economy is not working for those who rely on paychecks to make a living, which is to say, almost everyone. Steady gains in the October jobs report, while welcome, do not change that basic fact. Nor will policies currently on the horizon. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. and Allies Extend Iran Nuclear Talks by 7 Months", "Date": "2014-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe failure to agree even on the framework for a comprehensive deal, after extended high-level diplomacy over an issue that was arguably President Obama\u2019s top foreign policy priority, had to be a disappointment for the administration.Late Monday night Mr. Kerry\u2019s negotiating partner, Mohammad Javad Zarif, was equally upbeat in a session with the news media, saying with a broad smile that he was optimistic that in the next few months a solution would be found. \u201cWe don\u2019t need seven months,\u201d he said.But in what seemed to be a warning to those in Congress looking for Iran to end all its nuclear activities, he added, \u201cIf you are looking for a zero sum game in nuclear negotiations, you are doomed to failure.\u201dIn agreeing to extend the existing interim agreement, Iran assured itself of a continuation of the sanctions relief that had brought it $700 million a month in money that had been frozen abroad \u2014 something that might well add to the threat of new sanctions from the newly elected Republican Congress.Frustrations were visible on both sides, however. American officials said they remained hopeful that a deal could still be worked out. But they worried that Iran\u2019s negotiating team, and Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, who came to office on the promise of obtaining a nuclear deal, did not seem to have the latitude to make the political decisions necessary \u2014 and they could not see how that would change.Mr. Rouhani, for his part, went on national television with a mixed message of reassurance and defiance, telling Iranians that eventually there would be a deal that ended sanctions, but also casting the outcome in a victory narrative, saying \u201cthe centrifuges are spinning and will never stop.\u201dBut a fundamental problem remained: Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has yet to signal that he is prepared to make the kind of far-reaching cuts in Iran\u2019s enrichment ability that Washington has demanded to seal an accord. And it is unclear that his view will change before a March 1 deadline for reaching a political agreement, the first phase in the seven-month extension.\u201cIs it possible in the end we won\u2019t reach an agreement?\u201d Mr. Kerry said in a news conference hours before the deadline on Monday night. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\u201cThese talks are not going to get easier just because we extend them,\u201d Mr. Kerry acknowledged. \u201cThey are tough, they\u2019ve been tough, and they are going to stay tough.\u201dOfficials said little about the new approaches they were exploring with Iran, other than to indicate that \u201cexperts\u201d \u2014 presumably at the Energy Department\u2019s national laboratories \u2014 would be studying them to see if they, in combination with other steps, would result in at least a year\u2019s warning if Iran raced for a weapon. That is the standard the United States has set.The steps could involve a combination of Iranian commitments to ship some of its nuclear stockpile to Russia, efforts to disconnect some of the country\u2019s centrifuges in ways that would take considerable time to reverse, and limits on output that could be verified by international inspectors. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of moving parts,\u201d said one European diplomat involved in the discussions, \u201cand the question is what it adds up to.\u201dMr. Zarif said late Monday that the new ideas did not represent a proposal by either side but rather, \u201cWe have a compilation of ideas that each side has given the other.\u201d He said he would not violate the secrecy of the negotiating room and, like Mr. Kerry, argued that leaks emerging from the discussions \u2014 and there have been many in the talks, involving six different nations \u2014 make it far harder to reach a deal.Mr. Kerry went out of his way to compliment the lead Iranian negotiator, Mr. Zarif, who American officials have described as a creative diplomat who is forced to navigate Iran\u2019s treacherous politics and is uncertain how far the country\u2019s supreme leader will let him go. He and Mr. Rouhani came to power promising an end to sanctions that have reduced Iran\u2019s oil revenue by roughly 60 percent, crashed its currency and made overseas financial transactions almost impossible.But Mr. Zarif was also arguing, to the end here, that the sanctions must be lifted permanently and almost immediately, rather than being removed step by step as President Obama has insisted. When Mr. Obama publicly rejected the immediate approach in an interview broadcast Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d it seemed to drive home that an accord was impossible.For both Mr. Rouhani and Mr. Obama, the next seven months may be difficult to manage. Opponents of concessions of any kind have been gaining strength in both countries.Mr. Rouhani has been facing significant opposition to his agenda, and Mr. Zarif was clearly, in the words of one American official, \u201con a very tight leash\u201d in the last days of the negotiation. He indicated, in private, that he had not been able to win much support for any formulation that would have required Iran to dismantle centrifuges or take other visible steps toward meeting American demands.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.Mr. Obama, for his part, will no longer be able to rely on Democratic leaders in the Senate to bottle up legislation that would require new sanctions. \u201cI don\u2019t think Congress is going to sit still,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who has been highly critical of the effort. \u201cThere is a fear the administration is being played for time, and there will be a desire to express that in some form of a sanctions bill.\u201dMr. Kerry declined to indicate if President Obama would veto such an effort, saying he was talking to his former colleagues in Congress. But his negotiating team is already arguing for time for the negotiations to play out. It contends that Iran has far less ability now than it did a year ago, before the interim accord, called the \u201cJoint Plan of Action,\u201d required it to blend down its most potent nuclear fuel \u2014 closest to bomb grade \u2014 and to halt the installation of new centrifuges.Opponents looking at the same set of facts argued that a year later Iran has as much ability as ever to stage a \u201cbreakout,\u201d the production of one bomb\u2019s worth of fuel.For many of those opponents \u2014 in Iran, in Congress, in Israel and in the Arab states \u2014 the result was a relief. The extension had not even been announced when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel celebrated it as the least-bad outcome.\u201cNo deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d he said to the BBC, hours after speaking with Mr. Kerry by phone. \u201cThe right deal that is needed is to dismantle Iran\u2019s capacity to make atomic bombs and only then dismantle the sanctions. Since that\u2019s not in the offing, this result is better, a lot better.\u201dIn Iran, the calculus is more complex. With oil prices dropping, the economic damage done by the sanctions is being amplified. But those supporting Mr. Rouhani insisted that the extension did not mean failure, and some argued that extra time worked in Iran\u2019s favor.Saeed Laylaz, an economist connected to the government, argued that Mr. Rouhani was managing the country more efficiently than his fiery predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\u201cWith prudence and wisdom we can run the country, and at least we are now assured of $700 million income each month, which we can inject into the economy,\u201d Mr. Laylaz said. That is the amount Iran will receive in additional sanctions relief.Those who have been critical of the government\u2019s outreach to what they see as its archenemy, the United States, also welcomed the outcome, saying it showed that the negotiators had been under the control of the supreme leader, and that Iran had lost nothing \u2014 because its nuclear infrastructure remained intact.The negotiations are to resume next month. The location for the talks has yet to be announced, but in the long dance to the failed deadline they have been held in Muscat, Oman; Geneva; and here in Vienna.Thomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Financial Pressures Ease on Students, Studies Say", "Date": "2014-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter years of steep increases in college prices and student debt, turning both into major economic and public policy concerns, the real costs of college and student borrowing have leveled off, according to three studies being released on Thursday.The authors said they could not tell whether the changes marked the start of a shift toward better news on the economics of higher education or just a temporary pause in more worrisome trends. And they cautioned that costs and debt remained near their all-time peaks, dauntingly high for many students, and would for the foreseeable future.At four-year state colleges, declining state aid contributed to tuition doubling between 2001 and 2013, to an average approaching $9,000 for in-state students. But those schools have come under tremendous political pressure to limit price increases, leading to tuition freezes in places like the University of California and the University of Texas, and states have restored some of the support they cut during the severe recession that began at the end of 2008.Average net prices \u2014 what people really pay, after accounting for grants from colleges and the government \u2014 at four-year public colleges actually dropped in 2013-14, the College Board found, and are expected to rise slightly this year. The report projects net tuition and fees of about $3,000 this year, down about 4 percent, after inflation, from two years ago; with room and board, the average net price is expected to top $12,800, up just 1 percent from two years ago.Community college net prices have been dropping for several years. At private nonprofit colleges, despite fast-rising sticker prices, average net prices, adjusted for inflation, have held relatively steady for a dozen years. This year, they are projected at more than $12,000 for tuition and fees, and more than $23,000 with room and board.\u201cIt\u2019s significant that for a couple of years now, we\u2019re more or less flat, but we should not breathe too big a sigh of relief,\u201d said Sandy Baum, a co-author of the report, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and a research professor at the George Washington University Graduate School of Human Development. \u201cThe next time the economy crashes, we may see another decline in state support for public institutions, and rising net prices.\u201dThe institute reported that 69 percent of those graduates had student debt, compared with 68 percent the year before, while the College Board reported that the figure was static, at 60 percent. The institute put the average debt for those borrowers at $28,400, all but unchanged after inflation, and the College Board estimated it at $27,300, up about 1 percent, inflation-adjusted.The estimates give an incomplete picture, because for-profit colleges, where students borrow more, often do not participate in the surveys, and the figures exclude dropouts. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about what\u2019s driving it, and we really need better data,\u201d said Lauren Asher, president of Ticas. \u201cIt may be that families have more resources than they did a couple of years ago, so some of them are borrowing less,\u201d adding, \u201cAffordability is no less a concern now than it was last year or the year before.\u201d Analyzing data from lenders, primarily the federal government, the College Board reported that the amount borrowed each year by the average student had dropped slightly since 2011. Total undergraduate borrowing, the board concluded, was $71.4 billion last year, down 14 percent, after inflation, over three years. The decline was driven partly by falling enrollment, especially at for-profit colleges.Advertisement"}

In the coming months, Mrs. Clinton has a less hectic schedule, with a limited number of speeches and events, related to her charitable work. The Arkansas reunion will be one of her most public, and raucous, commitments.There are, after all, worse ways for Mrs. Clinton to ease into the long presidential campaign cycle than amid hundreds of friends and several days of talking up the robust economy and airbrushing the scandals of the 1990s.The program, titled, \u201cThe Work Continues: Celebrating 10 Years of the Clinton Presidential Center,\u201d will focus on Mr. Clinton\u2019s legacy, but the theme gives a nod to the future that will not be lost on the Clinton friends from around the country who plan to attend.\u201cOne of the great things about the Clintons is that they integrate all the people in their lives,\u201d said Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist who worked on the 1992 campaign. \u201cBut to be a Clintonite is to focus on the future,\u201d he added. \u201cSo, in addition to reminiscing about the old days, we\u2019ll talk about the days to come.\u201dAmong those expected to attend are former White House advisers like Cheryl D. Mills and Erskine B. Bowles, along with the celebrities Kevin Spacey, Barbra Streisand and Morgan Freeman. Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a close friend and longtime fund-raiser to the Clintons, is also scheduled to attend.\u201cThere are a lot of emails flying around: \u2018Are you going?\u2019 \u2018Who\u2019s going?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Michael Waldman, Mr. Clinton\u2019s director of speechwriting from 1995 to 1999. \u201cIt\u2019s like a high school reunion. I\u2019m doing situps.\u201dThe 94 rooms at the grand Capital Hotel, with its wood-paneled bar and famous pimento cheese sandwiches, have been booked for months. And attendees are planning to go back to all their old 1992 campaign haunts, like Doe\u2019s Eat Place, known for its steaks and tamales.\u201cThe Clinton library is exciting, but Doe\u2019s is really exciting,\u201d Mr. Waldman said.Richard Socarides, a White House adviser to Mr. Clinton, has not been to Little Rock since the center\u2019s inauguration. \u201cIt marked the end of the first Clinton presidency, which we\u2019re returning to celebrate,\u201d he said. But he added, \u201cLet\u2019s be real here. Most of us hope this marks the beginning of the campaign for the next.\u201dWhile all of the 13 presidential libraries across the country highlight their subjects\u2019 accomplishments and gloss over the setbacks, critics have said the Clinton museum, which is owned by the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation and jointly run with the National Archives and Records Administration, has a particularly laudatory feel.Built on a once-desolate stretch of abandoned warehouses in downtown Little Rock that a local journalist dubbed \u201cMurky Bottoms,\u201d the Clinton Center has had more than 3.3 million visitors and has brought more than $2.5 billion in economic development to the area. The downtown district is now lined with restaurants, bars, shops and apartment buildings.\u201cIt\u2019s exceeded the expectations of the guy who walked around here in 1997, looked around this abandoned warehouse district and thought \u2018Where do I start?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said James L. Rutherford, who led the project and is now dean of the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service, which is part of the Clinton Center.Mr. Clinton had such an active role in the establishment of his library that the exhibit designer Ralph Appelbaum called him \u201cour curator in chief and even our art director at times.\u201d The former president wanted the edifice to resemble the library at Trinity College in Dublin, though locals have said (affectionately) that the building looks more like a mobile home perched over the Arkansas River.Stephanie S. Streett, the executive director of the library and former director of scheduling in the White House, made an extra effort to encourage guests to attend the anniversary festivities, which officially span 10 days with discussions and events all over town, including a requisite screening of the 1993 documentary \u201cThe War Room\u201d about the Clinton-Gore campaign.The Arkansas Travelers, a cohort of locals who traveled the country to campaign for Mr. Clinton in 1992, will join out-of-town supporters and are not shy about pledging their support again in 2016, though several said they would enlist their grandchildren to do the traveling this time.The nostalgia for the 1990s that will be on display in Little Rock may not be as valuable on the campaign trail in 2016. Many of the midterm candidates the Clintons campaigned for this year were defeated. Arkansas delivered particular disappointments to Mr. Clinton, who campaigned frequently for the incumbent Democrat, Senator Mark Pryor, who lost to Representative Tom Cotton by 17 percentage points.Still, advisers said fondness for the Clinton years, particularly among the white working-class voters who have long identified with Mr. Clinton\u2019s Southern roots and centrist politics, can only help should Mrs. Clinton run. During the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, when her rivals accused her of relying too heavily on her husband\u2019s record, Mrs. Clinton would often respond: \u201cI always wonder what part of the 1990s they didn\u2019t like: the peace or the prosperity?\u201dDespite speculation about 2016, the official lineup for the weekend will be focused on the Clinton Center, the work of the Clinton Foundation and Mr. Clinton\u2019s legacy. \u201cThere will be more nostalgia and talk of the good old days\u201d than of what\u2019s next, said Thomas F. McLarty III, a White House chief of staff to Mr. Clinton. \u201cHe\u2019ll have created 28 million new jobs rather than 22 million by the time the weekend\u2019s over.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Its Grip on Oil Weakening, OPEC Will Meet on Prices ", "Date": "2014-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt its meeting on Thursday in Vienna, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the group of 12 oil producing nations, is under pressure to at least announce modest cuts in an effort to shore up the markets. But any cuts would be modest and would probably do little to prop up oil prices, assuming the countries even stick to an agreement.Asian and European economies are slowing, which has cut demand. And supply is booming, with shale drilling in the United States adding as much as a million barrels a day this year.OPEC\u2019s cuts, provided the member nations come to an agreement, are likely to amount to only a million barrels a day. At that level, they are not likely to make an appreciable difference in a market that produces more than 90 million barrels daily.If anything, a move by OPEC would only complicate the economic calculus for its member nations, by reducing their revenues. Venezuela, Nigeria and Iran have come to rely on oil money to pay for social programs vital to their stability.\u201cOPEC has been caught by surprise by the market,\u201d said Badr H. Jafar, president of Crescent Petroleum, an oil and gas company based in the United Arab Emirates. \u201cThis may be the meeting where they try to regain control.\u201dFounded more than a half century ago, OPEC wrenched supremacy over the oil market from the giant multinational energy companies and used its production heft to drive prices. Some Arab members of OPEC staged an oil embargo against the United States and other countries that supported Israel during the war in 1973, a move that increased prices.In the 1980s, an oil glut emerged as new production came onto the market from Britain, Norway, Alaska and elsewhere. Saudi Arabia slashed production sharply to try to balance the markets. When other producers failed to follow, the Saudis ramped up output, contributing to a price collapse.Unity among OPEC members has been sporadic ever since, and the group\u2019s options at the moment are not appealing.If it does cut production significantly and higher prices result, shale drillers in the United States will have an incentive to invest more and increase output. That would only further crowd out OPEC production from world markets.A long period of low prices might eventually curb shale oil production. But it is far from clear just how bad it would have to become to affect output in the United States.Even with the recent weakness, American production continues to soar. The Bakken and Eagle Ford shale fields of North Dakota and Texas \u2014 two principal drivers of the country\u2019s energy renaissance \u2014 increased output by 90,000 barrels a day in October, up 3.4 percent from the previous month, according to Bentek Energy, a consulting firm.Low prices also crimp OPEC countries.Some countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have built up an estimated $2 trillion in rainy-day funds and could withstand a long period of low prices. Others, like Venezuela and Iran, would feel the squeeze. The two countries have called for reductions in supplies, although neither is in the economic position to cut production by itself.Officials in Saudi Arabia have been largely quiet of late, which is further unnerving markets. Saudi Arabia is the linchpin of the cartel. And analysts say the Saudis and OPEC may be struggling to devise a coordinated strategy to prop up the markets.\u201cOPEC is watching and not acting because there is literally very little it can do,\u201d says Sadad al-Husseini, a former executive vice president for exploration and production at Saudi Aramco, the national oil company.OPEC has made difficult decisions before. In 2008, the organization agreed to 4.2 million barrels per day in cuts to stem falling prices during the global financial crisis. It worked, with oil bottoming out around $37 a barrel before steadily recovering.This time, however, analysts say the organization looks more divided.\u201cOPEC is split: The majority don\u2019t like the current price levels, the minority don\u2019t mind,\u201d said Kamel al-Harami, former president of Kuwait Petroleum International, a state oil company.Three Persian Gulf producers in the minority view, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, account for about half of the organization\u2019s output. They are only moderately hurt by the low prices, and may even be helped in the long run if investment in competing high-cost oil fields in Canada and the United States dries up. All three countries are rivals of Iran, which is more vulnerable to lower prices.But sanctions, internal strife and political turmoil have curbed output in Iran and Venezuela, and left production in Libya unreliable. Fereidun Fesharaki, chairman of the market research firm FGE, estimates that as much as 3.5 million barrels per day, more than 10 percent of OPEC\u2019s output, may be off the market for such reasons.\u201cYou have been eating my lunch,\u201d is the general sentiment expressed by such members to their more fortunate brethren, he said.Energy analysts say that OPEC\u2019s biggest problem is the shale oil revolution in the United States. Railroad tracks connecting North Dakota oil fields to the East Coast have bolstered domestic supplies, forcing Nigerian producers and others in Africa to export more oil to China and the rest of Asia. Saudi Arabia, in turn, has lowered prices to protect its share of the Asian markets.Adding to the difficulties, OPEC has been operating without quotas since the end of 2011, when it agreed to a group production target instead of individual country ceilings. Reimposing quotas might be a long and fraught exercise since targets have political and economic significance in each country.\u201cThe group has headed toward Vienna with the aim and hope of achieving some form of cuts but the timing and extent of the cut remains up in the air,\u201d says Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a London-based market research firm.Analysts say that without quotas, any cuts may end up being meaningless. But it may be particularly difficult for the Saudis to persuade other OPEC members to agree to share in the cuts, as the country is likely to insist.\u201cThe Saudis have not forgotten the searing experience of the 1980s,\u201d when the country cut production on its own and lost significant share, said Bhushan Bahree, a longtime analyst of OPEC who is now at the market research firm IHS. \u201cThey do not want a repeat.\u201dStanley Reed reported from London and Clifford Krauss from Houston.

{"Headline": "Anger Upstate Over Power Plan for New York City", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRHINEBECK, N.Y. \u2014 Residents of the rolling landscape in much of the Hudson Valley have long lived with high-voltage electric transmission lines and the giant columns of hulking steel towers that look as though they were assembled out of a child\u2019s Erector set. The lines have cut corridors through the countryside since at least the 1930s.But now New York State wants to add new lines and towers to relieve congestion and costs during heat waves, provoking furor among residents who fear that far taller towers would spoil their pastoral views and that any plan for wider corridors would cost some residents their homes or make them harder to sell.Seven counties and 25 towns in the Hudson Valley would be affected. (A fourth proposal, with a different route, was regarded as providing too little power.) The three companies proposed to build new towers as tall as 185 feet, about double the heights of most of the existing towers and higher than the tree line.Some feared the plans would hurt a regional economy heavily dependent on tourism.Residents like Alan Kulick, 67, a contractor, and his wife, Ingrid, 57, a consultant to nonprofits, believe that if the state approves widened corridors, they will almost certainly lose their house in Rhinebeck, where they have lived for 25 years, to eminent domain. They have been trying to turn a house addition and an old barn into a bed-and-breakfast to tide them through their retirement, but do not know whether to proceed. The uncertainty, they said, is keeping them up at night.\u201cThis was an American dream,\u201d Ms. Kulick said. \u201cAlan and I literally built this house. We used salvaged lumber, salvaged stones. We touched every inch \u2014 not a lot of people can say that. We built it without a mortgage so no one could take it away from us. So now do we put more money in it if we\u2019re going to lose it and lose the physical effort we put in?\u201d\u201cThe P.S.C. strongly encourages community and public participation in these proceedings,\u201d said James Denn, a spokesman for the commission.On Oct. 18, 200 people filled the Churchtown firehouse in Claverack, where Will Yandik, the town\u2019s deputy supervisor, ridiculed the project\u2019s rationale, drawing laughter with this punch line: \u201cNew York City does not have an energy problem. What we have is a case of inefficient air-conditioners in Brooklyn.\u201dGidon Eshel, a geophysicist at Bard College, offered a detailed presentation to argue that new transmission lines will not be needed for years to come, possibly not until 2040. He contended that while the population is slowly rising and temperatures are warming, peak loads have not been rising significantly, largely because of more efficient air-conditioners. And a lighter-using demographic \u2014 New York City dwellers ages 20 to 45 \u2014 will make up a larger proportion of all users in coming decades, he said. \u201cThey have never once demonstrated that there is a need,\u201d Mr. Eshel said in an interview.Daniel P. Duthie, a lawyer advising the coalition, pointed out that as of Sept. 20, the state had plans to add a total of 9,500 megawatts, much more than the 1,000 the commission said is needed to eliminate the bottleneck. Marion Mathison, a coalition leader who would lose 160 feet of the woods that now block the transmission towers from her patio view, is concerned about the loss of property values unless the commission puts limits on what can be built. She is a board member of the 2,300-person town of Milan (pronounced MY-lin), which is bisected by lines that abut 110 property parcels.\u201cWe don\u2019t want our residents to be in limbo for five or six years,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Climate Deal With China, Obama May Set 2016 Theme", "Date": "2014-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama\u2019s landmark agreement with China to cut greenhouse gas pollution is a bet by the president and Democrats that on the issue of climate change, American voters are far ahead of Washington\u2019s warring factions and that the environment will be a winning cause in the 2016 presidential campaign.A variety of polls show that a majority of American voters now believe that climate change is occurring, are worried about it, and support candidates who back policies to stop it. In particular, polls show that majorities of Hispanics, young people and unmarried women \u2014 the voters who were central to Mr. Obama\u2019s victories in 2008 and 2012 \u2014 support candidates who back climate change policy. But Republicans are betting that despite the polls, they can make the case that regulations to cut greenhouse pollution will result in the loss of jobs and hurt the economy.\u201cThis announcement is yet another sign that the president intends to double-down on his job-crushing policies no matter how devastating the impact for America\u2019s heartland and the country as a whole,\u201d said Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the soon-to-be majority leader, was no less critical. \u201cThis unrealistic plan, that the president would dump on his successor, would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs,\u201d he said in a statement. Mr. McConnell\u2019s remarks were a hint of a line of attack Republicans are certain to use on Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is expected to run for president in 2016. The architect of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change plan is none other than his senior counselor, John D. Podesta, who is likely to leave the White House next year to work as the chairman of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. Last year\u2019s historic agreement includes a new goal for U.S. carbon emissions and a commitment by China to curb its emissions and rely more heavily on renewable and nuclear sources of energy.The climate plan that Mr. Podesta has drafted for Mr. Obama is expected to serve as a blueprint for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s climate change policy, should she run. Since the deal Mr. Obama made with China calls for the United States to cut its planet-warming carbon pollution by as much as 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, he has effectively placed the obligation on his successor to meet that goal.That dynamic sets up climate change as a potentially explosive issue on the 2016 campaign trail, which may pit Mrs. Clinton against a field of Republican candidates who question and deny the science that human activity causes global warming. A number of prospective Republican presidential candidates have already attacked what they say is Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cwar on coal.\u201d Mr. Obama has muscled through his climate change agenda almost entirely with executive authority, bypassing a Congress that has repeatedly refused to enact sweeping new climate change laws. In addition to the agreement with China announced Wednesday in Beijing, Mr. Obama has used the 1970 Clean Air Act to issue ambitious Environmental Protection Agency regulations intended to cut pollution from vehicle tailpipes and power-plant smokestacks. Mr. Podesta, a political veteran who was also President Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff, devised the 2025 targets to ensure that they could be reached without new action from a future Congress. Abandoning them would require the next president to overturn them. From the Republican point of view, a Democratic candidate who might instead issue still more environmental regulations would be a ripe target for 2016. \u201cThey\u2019re giving Republicans fertile ground for attack,\u201d said Mike Murphy, a longtime Republican strategist. \u201cOverregulation is clearly a job killer and jobs and the economy and middle-class wages are going to be a huge issue in the 2016 presidential. And it does seem like an inside job, with Podesta setting up Hillary\u2019s position. Politically, they\u2019re going to put themselves in a weak position on this.\u201d As evidence, Republican strategists point to their recent wave of victories in this year\u2019s midterm elections, when they campaigned aggressively against Mr. Obama\u2019s E.P.A. regulations.But Democrats are increasingly emboldened by polls showing that in national elections, candidates who push climate change policies will win support from voters. According to a 2013 poll by Stanford University, 73 percent of Americans believe that the earth has been warming over the past 100 years, while 81 percent of Americans think global warming poses a serious problem in the United States. In addition, 81 percent think the federal government should limit the amount of greenhouse gases that American businesses can emit. Twenty-one percent of Americans think producing electricity from coal is a good idea, while 91 percent of Americans think making electricity from sunlight is a good idea.A 2014 poll by the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, meanwhile, found that majorities of women, minorities and young people support candidates who strongly endorse climate action. That poll found that 65 percent of Hispanics, 53 percent of blacks and 53 percent of unmarried women support candidates who back climate change action. It found that 44 percent of people in their 20s favor candidates who support climate change action, compared with 17 percent who oppose climate action.\u201cThese groups were hugely important in the 2008 and 2012 elections,\u201d said Anthony A. Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale project. \u201cAnd they will be more important in 2016, because they are starting to make up a greater portion of the electorate.\u201dMrs. Clinton has not laid out a specific climate change policy that she might pursue as president, but she has enthusiastically supported efforts to reduce carbon pollution \u2014 including Mr. Obama\u2019s regulations. At a September conference on clean energy in Nevada she called climate change \u201cthe most consequential, urgent, sweeping collection of challenges we face as a nation and a world,\u201d and said that Mr. Obama\u2019s E.P.A. regulations put the United States in \u201ca strong position\u201d in international negotiations. Democrats also believe that Wednesday\u2019s announcement weakens at least one crucial Republican argument against climate action. For years, Republicans have argued that the United States should not take unilateral action on climate change because it would hamstring the economy while China, the world\u2019s largest carbon polluter, failed to act. But the agreement with China undercuts that argument. For Republicans, the issue of climate change, like immigration and same-sex marriage, is one that potential candidates and their advisers are starting to grapple with as they try to carve a path to the presidency, while winning support from a new generation of more diverse voters. Republicans who seek to win their presidential nomination will have to win support from their conservative base \u2014 white and older voters, who, polls show, are less likely to believe that climate change is a problem. More important, Republicans do not want to be targeted by conservative outside groups like Americans for Prosperity, the political advocacy group funded by the libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch. Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, has said that his group intends to aggressively attack any Republican candidate in the 2016 primaries who endorses carbon regulations.But some Republican strategists worry that the position on climate change that could help win them their party\u2019s nomination could hurt them in a general election, particularly in a contest with a larger number of young and minority voters.Ashley Parker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economy Elects Presidents. Presidents Elect Congress.", "Date": "2014-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMidterm CalculusBut while the nation\u2019s economy is a strong shaper of presidential election outcomes, the president himself is the shaper of congressional outcomes. In years when we are electing a president along with a Congress, the newly elected president\u2019s party typically picks up seats in both the House and the Senate. You can think of this as hopping on the party bandwagon \u2014 some candidates in the president\u2019s party get swept into office on the winning presidential candidate\u2019s coattails just because they are in the right party at the right time.But in the nonpresidential election years, that same president\u2019s party typically loses seats in both chambers of Congress. On average, over the last 80 years, the president\u2019s party has lost 27 seats in the House and four seats in the Senate in midterm election years.What bandwagons beget, time takes away.These patterns, along with the stunning advantage bestowed upon incumbent members of Congress \u2014 more than 90 percent of incumbents who run are re-elected in both chambers \u2014 are the fundamental conditions that shape midterm elections. The economy is not part of this structure.Instead of rewarding or punishing the incumbent president for his handling of the nation\u2019s economy, in midterm years voters address the president more directly \u2014 by penalizing his party members, on average, but also by calibrating that punishment based on how the president is doing his job. Average approval ratings of the way the president is \u201chandling the job\u201d explain more of the variation in seat loss than the economic indicators.And it appears as if the approval rating is made up of more things than just the economy. Where voters jump on the winning bandwagon in the presidential election years, they put a finger in the wind to measure the political atmosphere in the midterms. The happier people are with how things are going generally, the less likely they are to punish members of the president\u2019s party.Midterm vote choices are by and large driven by different fundamental or structural conditions than presidential elections, namely incumbency and the surge and decline of presidential-party fortunes between on- and off-presidential election years.Given the last several decades, we\u2019d expect, on average, a loss of four seats in the Senate this year. If what happens is close to that number, the upshot should not be a doomsday story for the president and his party, but instead, a tale of doing about as well as average.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S.-India Agreement on Stockpiles of Food Revives a Trade Deal", "Date": "2014-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 India and the United States reached an agreement on Thursday over food stockpiles, removing a major obstacle to a global trade deal that has been stalled for months.Proponents of the deal argue that it would add $1 trillion to the global economy and create 21 million jobs. Critics, though, have noted that it would require a substantial investment from developing countries to upgrade their ports and borders.But talks on the trade package reached an impasse in July when India said it would veto the global trade deal unless a dispute over its food security program was resolved. Since then, India has faced resistance from other member countries for stalling a critical agreement.Michael B. Froman, the United States trade representative, said that President Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India had discussed the issue during Mr. Modi\u2019s visit to Washington in September in light of the \u201cmounting crisis of confidence\u201d facing the W.T.O. after the trade deal was derailed. \u201cIn recent days, officials of both governments worked intensively and reached an agreement that should give new momentum to multilateral efforts at the W.T.O.,\u201d Mr. Froman said in a statement.India views the stockpiling as core to its food security and its efforts to feed millions of its impoverished citizens.The Indian government buys food, including grain, from its farmers and stockpiles it for a public distribution system, where it is sold at government-run stores at subsidized prices. The food subsidy program, which has often been criticized as ineffective, is available to 75 percent of India\u2019s rural population and 50 percent of the urban population, according the National Food Security Act introduced last year.W.T.O. rules say that subsidizing more than 10 percent of the grain produced for food in a country distorts the market for trade. But India wants to do away with that cap. Countries including the United States and Pakistan have expressed fears that India was accumulating too much grain and that it might eventually release the surplus on the world market, lowering prices for other producers.In Bali, W.T.O. members had agreed to a temporary solution in which developing countries would not be penalized for breaching their subsidy levels until a permanent solution was found by 2017. But Indian officials were concerned that deadline would leave them open to legal challenges after that date and that talks on the issue had been sidelined.India and the United States have now clarified a \u201cpeace clause.\u201d They agreed that the clause would protect member countries from being legally challenged under W.T.O. agreements until a permanent solution is found on the stockpiling issue, whenever that happens. A timeline for negotiations on stockpiling was also set, giving assurances that the issue would be dealt with promptly.\u201cIndia and the United States have resolved their differences on public stockholding of food,\u201d Nirmala Sitharaman, India\u2019s commerce minister, said on Thursday at a news conference in New Delhi. The move, she said, paves the way for India to ratify the global trade deal.\u201cThis breakthrough represents a significant step in efforts to get the Bali package and the multilateral trading system back on track,\u201d Roberto Azev\u00eado, the director general of the W.T.O., said in a statement. \u201cIt will now be important to consult with all W.T.O. members so that we can collectively resolve the current impasse as quickly as possible. Implementation of all aspects of the Bali package would be a major boost to the W.T.O., enhancing our ability to deliver beneficial outcomes to all our members.\u201dAnalysts said the agreement with the United States would improve India\u2019s negotiating position at the G-20 meeting and in other global talks. \u201cIt is a move ahead both for multilateralism at the W.T.O. and for India, which was being viewed as obstructionist,\u201d said Rajrishi Singhal, a senior geoeconomics fellow at Gateway House, a foreign policy research group in Mumbai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Vigilante Fight Against Boko Haram", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLong before the Islamist militant group Boko Haram kidnapped nearly 300 schoolgirls from Chibok in April, Abba Aji Kalli watched his country descend into madness. Kalli lives in Maiduguri, a city of more than one million and the capital of Borno State, just 80 miles from Chibok, in Nigeria\u2019s impoverished northeast. For months before the girls were taken, refugees flooded into Maiduguri, fleeing almost-daily Boko Haram raids on nearby villages. The militants arrived on motorcycles and Toyota Hilux trucks, sometimes in the middle of the night, sometimes in broad daylight, destroying homes and businesses and killing villagers. By May, a month after the kidnappings, the rebels were coming closer, striking surrounding villages and towns. Maiduguri could only be next.Kalli was trying to stay calm, but he couldn\u2019t keep the anxiety and paranoia at bay. Recently, the stress had become so intense that he was hospitalized for eight days. Why was the military not protecting his people? He had grown tired of asking the question. Kalli, a wiry, energetic man of 50 with an affable manner, worked as a government auditor. He was also a unit commander in the Civilian Joint Task Force, a thousands-strong vigilante battalion that was formed in June 2013 to combat Boko Haram. The Civilian J.T.F., as it is known, is made up of volunteers \u2014 professionals, civil servants, students and traders \u2014 and arms itself with machetes, locally sourced guns and homemade weapons. Kalli led a unit of 8,000.Just after the girls were kidnapped, Kalli and his volunteers, whom he affectionately calls his \u201cboys\u201d \u2014 they call him \u201cElder\u201d \u2014 arranged to meet local soldiers in Alagarno, a village near the expansive Sambisa Forest, where Boko Haram had set up camps and the girls were thought to be held. But the military\u2019s promised aircraft never arrived, he said. Kalli was angry but not altogether surprised. It wasn\u2019t unusual for the military to fail to keep its promises. The government\u2019s ineffectiveness in fighting Boko Haram was why he joined the Civilian J.T.F. in the first place.Since the insurgency began in 2009, the military\u2019s response has been both slow and inadequate. Residents report seeing soldiers running away during confrontations with Boko Haram. Soldiers say they do not have enough equipment \u2014 they often appear to lack protective gear \u2014 and do not get paid on time, if at all. Recently, a military tribunal sentenced 12 soldiers to death for attempted murder and mutiny; they had shot at their commanding officer after a convoy of their fellow soldiers was ambushed by Boko Haram. The governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima, angered federal government officials this year when he remarked that Boko Haram outmatched troops in the northeast in both weaponry and motivation. John Campbell, a senior fellow for Africa policy studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former United States ambassador to Nigeria, makes a similar point: \u201cWe are talking about a body that is relatively weak,\u201d he says, one that \u201chas been starved of training and resources for a very long time.\u201dIn the absence of an effective military response, the job of combating Boko Haram has fallen to the Civilian J.T.F. \u201cWe are responsible for fighting them,\u201d Kalli said. Widely credited with pushing Boko Haram out of Maiduguri a year ago, the Civilian J.T.F. dispenses a summary justice. Much of Kalli\u2019s time was devoted to tracking down and turning over to government authorities the men and boys suspected of having joined Boko Haram.One Sunday in May, hours before I met up with him at a hotel in Maiduguri that is popular with the military and considered secure, his contact in Yola \u2014 the capital of neighboring Adamawa State, where Boko Haram has also waged attacks \u2014 called to say someone suspected of being a Boko Haram member was returning to his home in Maiduguri. Kalli guessed that the young man was coming to pick up supplies, perhaps weapons he had stashed somewhere. He gathered his boys and dispatched them to the suspect\u2019s house in one of the unit\u2019s blue pickup trucks.A few hours later, while Kalli and I sat talking in the hotel, his phone rang. As he listened, he became agitated, twitching with excitement. \u201cWe got one,\u201d he said, hanging up. His boys had captured the suspect. Kalli told me he had to go and rushed out of the hotel.Two days later, I visited Kalli at one of his two homes, a modest bungalow. The power was out, and his third and youngest wife lay on the floor with their three children, fanning them as they napped. I joined Kalli on the couch as he pulled up the cellphone video he shot of the Yola suspect. It showed a young man in black athletic shorts and a red T-shirt, surrounded by men shouting questions at him. The suspect, Mohammed Umar, who could not have been much older than 20, looked dazed. \u201cHe confessed that he was a member of Boko Haram and that they have been hiding AK-47s in one house,\u201d Kalli said gleefully. \u201cWe asked him to take us to the house. At the first house, we went in and dug but didn\u2019t find anything. He took us to three houses. At the third house, we found two AK-47 magazines.\u201dWhen it was over, Kalli and his men, who\u2019d been joined by another Civilian J.T.F. commander, handed Umar over to the authorities. \u201cHe ran away from Maiduguri when we started chasing Boko Haram last year,\u201d Kalli explained. \u201cMost of them fled. Even now, many of them are living in Lagos, many of them are living in Abuja, many of them are living in Kano.\u201d During his first operation in June 2013, Kalli and his boys captured 10 suspects with AK-47s. All were turned over to the military and detained. More recently, in April, he and his boys apprehended nearly 40 people suspected of being Boko Haram members in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital, 500 miles away. With each mission, Kalli and his unit have become more efficient at rooting out sympathizers. This time, he boasted, the entire operation \u2014 from finding Umar to searching the houses to handing him over to Nigerian security forces \u2014 took less than 35 minutes.Then Boko Haram began its onslaught against his hometown. Once an ancient center of Islamic teaching and trade, Maiduguri is now a city of sandbagged bunkers and security checkpoints. The attacks were sporadic but chilling. In June 2011, Boko Haram bombed a beer garden; last December, it orchestrated bombings near the airport and on a military air base. Boko Haram attacked civilians seemingly at random. Kalli\u2019s brother was assassinated in his own home in 2011. \u201cIt really hurt me,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut we were handicapped, we couldn\u2019t do anything. We were even afraid to report it to the military or authorities, because if you report it, a few days later Boko Haram will just come and kill you.\u201d This was not the Nigeria he knew.Men of Kalli\u2019s generation were among the last to benefit from the country\u2019s post-independence, oil-driven economic expansion. In the 1960s and \u201970s, a high-school graduate could easily find a good job. The Nigerian naira was on par with the British pound. Nigeria was so wealthy, in fact, that it almost didn\u2019t matter that billions of dollars were lost to graft. But deep social and economic rifts existed just below the surface. Pieced together in 1914 and controlled by the British until its independence in 1960, Nigeria was loosely divided along religious lines, with a mostly Muslim, ethnically diverse north and an equally diverse, predominantly Christian south. Under British rule, the north was governed via local emirs, which did not interfere with the region\u2019s Muslim identity, while the south was more directly controlled by the British. The south eventually developed an economy centered on oil; the north remained largely agrarian. Because Christian missionaries were concentrated in the south, southerners also had access to Western education. Today, these regional differences persist: Literacy rates are significantly higher in the south than in the north, while poverty is more entrenched in the north than in the south.After independence, a succession of military governments held the two regions together, suppressing ethnic and religious differences and quelling dissent. Civilian rule returned in 1999, renewing hopes of a more equitable society. Instead, says Max Siollun, a Nigerian writer and historian, \u201c1999 came and went, soldiers left and were replaced by civilians, but nothing changed. The government was still corrupt, poverty was still rife and economic opportunities and jobs were still scarce.\u201d Radical Islamic groups, Siollun says, filled this moral vacuum, as they often had in Nigeria.In 2009, after the police opened fire on several Boko Haram members at a funeral procession in Maiduguri, shooting 17, the group bombed and set fire to government buildings. The police and the military battled the insurgents for days; more than 800 people were killed, most in extrajudicial killings by the military, and thousands of people were forced to abandon their homes. Yusuf was arrested and died in police custody. In response, Boko Haram staged an uprising. Under a newly appointed leader, Abubakar Shekau, the group burned down schools and police stations; blew up cellphone towers, markets, churches and mosques; and killed scores of students and teachers throughout central and northern Nigeria. Boko Haram has since massacred thousands of Nigerians and abducted hundreds more. In February, the group savagely murdered almost 60 schoolboys; some were burned alive. This year, Boko Haram set off three explosions in the country\u2019s capital, underscoring that not even the federal government was safe from attack. In April, the group took the schoolgirls from Chibok. It still holds at least 200 of them captive.The Nigerian government\u2019s response to Boko Haram has been fraught from the beginning. President Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian southerner, has behaved as if the insurgency is a creation of northern Muslim leaders and thus their problem to solve. It took him more than three weeks to speak publicly about the abduction of the schoolgirls. His wife, Patience, provoked public outrage when she questioned whether the kidnapping had occurred, claiming it was all a ploy by her husband\u2019s opponents to embarrass him. (She later expressed concern over the missing schoolgirls.) Government critics charge that the military has been slow to respond to the threat posed by Boko Haram because officials are benefiting from the war in the north, siphoning money from the country\u2019s $6 billion security budget.Residents in the northeast have complained frequently of the army\u2019s indifference. But their grievances coalesced around the response to the kidnapping of the girls. Local officials in Chibok say the army was alerted to the possibility of an attack up to four hours before the girls were abducted, but military reinforcements never arrived. Since then, the military has been criticized for not doing enough to look for the girls. It claimed that it had broken up a Boko Haram cell that participated in the kidnapping and that it was on the verge of rescuing the girls, but they never materialized. The United States and other foreign powers have offered assistance, but finding the girls remains a formidable task. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, big challenge,\u201d says Stephen Schwartz, the director of Nigeria policy and operations at the State Department. \u201cIf it were up to the United States, we would have difficulty trying to rescue that number of girls over that big an area. It\u2019s a really high-stakes kind of effort. I give the Nigerians a lot of credit for having the forbearance to not try anything premature or reckless.\u201d (The military declined repeated requests for comment.)Meanwhile, Boko Haram continues to fund and arm itself through bank robberies, extortion, ransom demands, sieges on Nigerian armed forces and, some analysts say, help from affiliates of Al Qaeda. In part, Boko Haram can operate with impunity because much of the northeast remains inaccessible, with bad roads and poor phone reception. Large areas along Nigeria\u2019s borders with Cameroon, Chad and Niger are vulnerable to Boko Haram. \u201cThe northern land mass is just huge, and some parts of it are not very hospitable, so the government hasn\u2019t always penetrated into every nook and cranny,\u201d Siollun says. \u201cThose border areas have always been bandit country; it facilitated the emergence of groups like Boko Haram.\u201dDespite Boko Haram\u2019s increasing strength, the Nigerian government, says Campbell, the former ambassador, has not pursued a comprehensive anti-insurgency strategy. \u201cThe government has done very little to address the pervasive sense of alienation among people in the north,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to address the drivers of the insurgency, that takes time. My sense is implementation is very, very slow.\u201d Fatima Akilu, a director in Nigeria\u2019s Office of the National Security Adviser, told me that a deradicalization program is being created to promote sports, literature and the arts to secular and Islamic schools, and that the government is working on an economic-\u00addevelopment plan for the northeast. Akilu says officials also hope to devise \u201csafe passage\u201d for militants who wish to leave the group. She assured me that the Civilian J.T.F. was not a reaction to the military\u2019s failures but rather a natural response on the part of northeasterners to a common threat \u2014 a kind of citizens\u2019 brigade. \u201cIt was a spontaneous movement that began without any involvement from the state at all,\u201d she says. \u201cThese were youths who said, \u2018We no longer want you in our communities,\u2019 and they pushed them out. It is an initiative we support.\u201dWhen I first met Kalli at the hotel in Maiduguri, he was with three men who had been seized by Boko Haram. The group has turned to forcible recruitment as its violent tactics erode support among northerners. \u201cThey began to recruit by force, because they have moved so far from their core ideology,\u201d Akilu says. \u201cWhen Shekau descended into this indiscriminate slaughter, murdering people for no reason, a lot of people didn\u2019t understand what was going on and did not subscribe to the philosophy of the current leadership.\u201d Sometimes Boko Haram compels the boys and young men it captures to spy or fight for the group; sometimes it kills those it captures, a warning to anyone who would collaborate with government forces. The men with Kalli managed to escape. (This is not unheard of; Boko Haram does not always guard its captives carefully. Right after their abduction, some 50 of the Chibok schoolgirls also managed to get away. One of them, a 14-year-old named Rejoice Yaga, told me that the militants seemed confused and kept asking one another if they should take the girls or leave them.)Kalli had already debriefed the men, but he wanted me to hear their stories firsthand. The first man I spoke to, Ali Bukar, a tall 40-year-old whose face bears the distinctive scars of his Kanuri ethnic group, was abducted in May while farming outside his home in Konduga, a village in Borno State about 20 miles from Maiduguri. \u201cI had heard people talk about Boko Haram, but I had never seen them until the day they came and captured me,\u201d he said. His wife and children were inside the house, unaware that just a few yards away two gunmen were tying him up with rope. The militants placed Bukar between them on their motorcycle and drove off. He thought he was doomed. \u201cI asked them what kind of offense I committed, but they refused to talk to me.\u201dIt took less than an hour to reach the site where Boko Haram had set up camp. Several men, some in T-shirts, others in traditional dress, milled about. They threw him, still tied up, to one side. Over the next three days, the men debated whether to kill him, occasionally feeding him beans and discussing plans to attack Maiduguri. But his rope was loose, and one day after nightfall with his hands still tied behind his back, he escaped. He ran for nearly 12 hours through the bush to reach his village. When we met, his arms were still severely bruised, marked by puffy, raw lesions; he could barely raise them. \u201cI will never go back to that village,\u201d he said of his hometown, shaking his head slowly. He has since moved some relatives with him to Maiduguri.The second man Kalli introduced me to, Hamza Alhaji, was more fortunate. A prematurely graying 30-year-old who made his living collecting firewood in the forest outside Maiduguri, he was ambushed by Boko Haram militants while driving back to the city last spring and then unexpectedly abandoned when they retreated into the bush.As I spoke with Bukar and Alhaji, Kalli kept interrupting, eager to answer the questions himself; he knew their stories so well. For Kalli, the men were proof that Boko Haram must be stopped at all costs. How could anyone be safe when grown men were seized in the middle of the afternoon?Unlike Alhaji and Bukar, the third man with Kalli that day \u2014 Modu Jalomi, a 35-year-old who lives in Yajiwa, a town 45 miles outside Maiduguri \u2014 was used to seeing Boko Haram members near his home. \u201cI have seen them before,\u201d he said. \u201cI know some of their members.\u201d The militants occasionally passed through Yajiwa to buy food. At first, residents welcomed Boko Haram; as recently as last year, young men were voluntarily joining the militants. \u201cIt was their own wish, because of religion,\u201d Jalomi said. He could count 20 young men, most of them teenagers, who left. He pitied them now, he said, because the situation had changed. \u201cWhen people saw that what Boko Haram is doing is not the right thing, they started to run away,\u201d Jalomi said.As Jalomi lay in bed next to his wife one night, four men came into the house with AK-47s. One was his neighbor. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even hide their faces,\u201d Jalomi recalled. They took him on a motorcycle to the same area near Alagarno where they had taken Bukar and accused him of feeding information about them to the Civilian J.T.F. and the military. Jalomi was tied to a mango tree for 11 hours before he managed to break free. The militants shot at him as he fled. He now lives in Maiduguri and hasn\u2019t returned to his village since. \u201cThey have no support now,\u201d he said of Boko Haram.The Civilian J.T.F. works closely with Nigeria\u2019s Joint Task Force \u2014 the military, the police and other security forces \u2014 which has been accused of indiscriminate killings in the counterinsurgency. After a March attack by Boko Haram on Giwa Barracks, a military garrison, troops killed hundreds of people, most of whom were unarmed suspects held there. In Maiduguri, thousands of boys and men have been detained on little to no evidence. Some are taken to Giwa Barracks, from which reports of torture and extrajudicial killings regularly emerge. Others simply disappear; sometimes their bodies turn up at the city\u2019s morgues. In response, residents barricade streets with logs and tires to keep outsiders away. There are entire sections of the city that government officials are afraid to enter for fear of reprisal.In August, Amnesty International released footage showing what appear to be Nigerian soldiers and Civilian J.T.F. members near Maiduguri, cutting the throats of suspected Boko Haram members and then pushing them into an open grave. Amnesty International also says the vigilantes have made arbitrary arrests and engaged in torture and extrajudicial killings of suspects, both independently and with the military. \u201cFrom witnesses and victims and families of victims that we have talked to, there is an undeniable degree of frustration and concern and fear against the vigilante groups,\u201d Netsanet Belay, the Africa director of research and advocacy at Amnesty International, told me. \u201cWe are seeing the Civilian Joint Task Force increasingly engaged in serious, mass human-rights violations.\u201d Schwartz, the State Department\u2019s Nigeria director, says the United States has pressed and continues to press the Nigerian military on human rights \u2014 \u201cGiwa Barracks was a big issue of contention.\u201d The problem with vigilante groups like the Civilian J.T.F., he adds, is that they are essentially unaccountable. \u201cThey\u2019re not trained as a law-enforcement group, they\u2019re not underpinned by a law of the land,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t sanction or condone lawless actions of vigilante groups. I\u2019ve seen a number of these videos, and it\u2019s disturbing.\u201dGovernment officials in Borno State express few misgivings about the Civilian J.T.F. One official in the governor\u2019s office, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, told me that the Civilian J.T.F. was doing commendable work identifying and arresting Boko Haram members, and that any abuses committed were most likely the fault of the military on joint exercises. The state\u2019s governor, Shettima, describes the emergence of the Civilian J.T.F. as \u201calmost a divine intervention,\u201d though he acknowledges that \u201cone may not rule out some infractions from some overzealous members.\u201d The government, in conjunction with the military, he says, is working to rein in excesses through a training program, the Borno Youth Empowerment Scheme, which began in 2013 and provides a modest monthly stipend. The plan is to train at least 5,000 Civilian J.T.F. members by the end of this year; so far, 3,000 men have begun the program.Jacob Zenn, an analyst of African affairs at the Jamestown Foundation in Washington, argues that to survive, the Civilian J.T.F. has had to evolve from stick-wielding vigilantes to a more sophisticated group. \u201cIt\u2019s a catch-22, because if they remain lightly armed, they are at high risk of being massacred by heavily armed Boko Haram insurgents,\u201d Zenn says. \u201cBut if they are armed, they essentially become like soldiers.\u201d Once they assume their militarized roles, they may become what soldiers are in the region: both protection and threat.In his office, Kalli insisted that anyone who fears the Civilian J.T.F. must have a relationship with Boko Haram. \u201cAny good Samaritans will have to support the Civilian J.T.F., because we have done a lot to bring peace to this city,\u201d he said. If his neighbors refuse to understand that he is trying to help them, he will make them understand. Last year, he turned in his 18-year-old nephew, whom he believed to be a member of Boko Haram. He later watched the military execute him. Kalli expressed no remorse. \u201cI saw him with AK-47s, so that proves he\u2019s a Boko Haram member,\u201d he said. When the insurgency began in 2009, his nephew attended Boko Haram\u2019s sermons, and that year he ran away from Maiduguri. His family and neighbors suspected he had joined the group. \u201cI was the first person to see him when he came back to town,\u201d Kalli said. \u201cHe was part of my family, part of my blood. But I apprehended him and handed him over to security.\u201d He told his brother and sister-in-law that their son confessed to killing more than 30 people and even threatened to kill him. \u201cI asked him, \u2018Is this the way we brought you up?\u2019 \u201d Kalli recalled. \u201cYou know, the first thing before you start this job, you will take an oath. The oath is that you will not hide anybody, whether it\u2019s your friend or relative.\u201d Couldn\u2019t his nephew have been brainwashed? I asked. He was, after all, little more than a child. Kalli\u2019s face contorted into an expression somewhere between anger and disbelief, and his voice took on a hard edge. \u201cWhether he understood or he didn\u2019t understand, his mind was polluted,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe have no regret for anybody if you are a Boko Haram member, because we have suffered a lot at the hands of Boko Haram. We have lost so many people.\u201dA man from the Civilian Joint Task Force awaits treatment in a hospital in Maiduguri, Nigeria, after being shot by Boko Haram fighters.Several young men marched into Kalli\u2019s office, greeting him with reverence before sitting down to wait for their training stipends. Among them was Mohammed Musa, an electrical-engineering student at the University of Maiduguri who signed up with the Civilian J.T.F. last year. For many young men, joining the Civilian J.T.F. is a way of retaking power after so much has been lost \u2014 relatives, friends, a viable future. His parents are happy that he volunteers, but he recognizes that much of Maiduguri is wary of the civilian police. \u201cMany people fear us,\u201d he said with frustration. \u201cThey say, \u2018See this Civilian J.T.F., they\u2019re doing bad things.\u2019 They act as if we\u2019re useless or up to no good. They should be praying for us every day.\u201dKalli\u2019s son Lawan, a small-boned and polite 17-year-old in his last year of high school, entered his father\u2019s office and slid into a chair. He described how he inspects cars at checkpoints and carries a knife for protection. One charge leveled against the Civilian J.T.F. is that it recruits children. Human Rights Watch reports indicate that some vigilantes manning checkpoints in Maiduguri appear to be younger than 18. The watchdog group says witnesses have seen children working at checkpoints in Borno and Yobe States. \u201cIf you are not 18, you are not part of us \u2014 that is the truth,\u201d Kalli said. His son was different, he said; he wasn\u2019t allowed to use a gun. \u201cWe are not using any children. If we see any under-age ones on the streets, we arrest them and call their parents.\u201d I asked him about worries that the vigilantes could be committing abuses. He again became defensive. \u201cWe don\u2019t kill anybody. We hand them to the authorities. We have to protect ourselves, but we normally catch them alive.\u201d\u201cI was sitting in my office preparing paperwork for my boys who went for training when I received a call from one of my chairmen,\u201d Kalli said as he drove. \u201cHe told me that he\u2019d been told that some members of Boko Haram we were looking for were in town and that he\u2019d seen them at Ecobank. When we rushed there, they had already finished their transaction and left. I drove my boys to the car park and mounted a checkpoint. I left some of them there so that they can maybe trap them.\u201dHe put on the truck\u2019s siren and swerved through narrow spaces between lanes. As we sped through Civilian J.T.F. checkpoints, the young men at the barriers saluted him. \u201cWe are suspecting that they might enter the market to buy food items,\u201d he said of the Boko Haram members he was tracking. \u201cSo we have already put our members on alert. They sleep in the bush, come in to get money and food items and then go back. But we have our people watching them. If we see them, we will grab them.\u201dI asked him about the guns his crew was carrying. They looked like relics from the 19th century, short-barreled rifle-muskets with wooden grips. \u201cI personally told my boys to carry guns,\u201d he said. Residents donated money to help buy the weapons, he said; at first they had only cutlasses and sticks to fight militants armed with antiaircraft guns and rocket-propelled grenades. \u201cI bought these local guns you have been seeing and distributed them, because my area is the worst area.\u201d His zone, he pointed out, covers \u201cup to Sambisa\u201d and the outskirts of Maiduguri. \u201cAnything can come through us,\u201d he said. The siren blared louder.As we drove, Kalli returned to talking about the military: \u201cThey are not responding the way they should; that is the biggest problem we are facing. It is the fault of senior officers. If I were a soldier, I would not go in, because I wouldn\u2019t have enough equipment to fight the insurgents! I withdrew my men from Sambisa because I knew the authorities didn\u2019t want to finish this job.\u201dWe zigzagged through traffic to pick up medicine for Kalli\u2019s youngest daughter, who was gravely ill with the measles. His phone rang; the caller was reporting yet another attack on a village, demanding to know why Kalli and his men weren\u2019t there. When he hung up, he sighed, and his body slackened. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m tired of this thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe gave the security forces everything \u2014 information about the camps, where they are, and they\u2019re not doing anything.\u201d I asked him if he has given up on finding the girls. \u201cWe can\u2019t go up to Chibok again,\u201d he said.The path that Kalli and his unit took out of Maiduguri to Chibok in May is now a lonely one. When I traveled along the same road on a market day, only a few cars, trucks and minivan taxis hurtled past torched vehicles and the burned-out shells of schools and homes. Boys rode bikes with bows and arrows tucked under their arms. Commuters between the two towns were stopped at a series of checkpoints, some manned by the military and others by the Civilian J.T.F. The vigilantes were more disorganized but savvier. They casually waved machetes at drivers and demanded that they turn on their windshield wipers. Militants had been hiding weapons under car hoods, which prevented the wipers from working.I spoke with Kalli shortly after I left Maiduguri. He was in low spirits. His daughter with the measles had died, and he had taken a break from his Civilian J.T.F. duties. I asked him when he would rejoin his colleagues. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI need rest.\u201dIn July, a bomb blast in a Maiduguri market killed at least 20 people. This fall, Boko Haram occupied numerous northeastern towns, including Bama, only 45 miles from Maiduguri, and declared a caliphate. The government recently claimed to have struck a cease-fire with Boko Haram that would lead to the release of the remaining Chibok schoolgirls. But in October, the militants abducted 60 women and girls from Adamawa State and later at least 30 boys and girls from Borno State, casting doubt on the existence of a truce.Yet when I called Kalli recently, he spoke of the future as bright. He said the military was holding on to Maiduguri and had pushed Boko Haram out of other places. He was no longer doing much fieldwork. He was now an \u201cexecutive at the state level\u201d for the Civilian J.T.F., coordinating the sectors and managing their finances. He was also running for Senate. Kalli remained relentlessly upbeat. \u201cWe are 100 percent sure we will kill these insurgents,\u201d he told me. He seemed to believe it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Bourbon Producers Can Teach the Oil Industry ", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe UpshotThe market for crude oil is in veritable free fall. The price of a barrel has dropped 30 percent since June, and the ripples have only begun, with analysts warning of everything from bankruptcies of Texas oil fields to economic troubles in big oil-producing nations like Venezuela and Nigeria.If oil prices stay low or keep falling, it will be one of the most important trends shaping the world economy in 2015, which raises the question: Why is this happening? To answer that, it is useful to look at the market for another fluid that is stored in barrels, one that is less economically consequential but quite a bit more tasty: bourbon.As it turns out, oil producers from Dallas to Abu Dhabi could learn a few things from the Kentucky distilleries that turn out nectarlike whiskeys.What oil and bourbon have in common are the long time lags between investment in a new supply and availability of the finished product. With bourbon, that\u2019s because a distiller must keep the good stuff in barrels for seven, 10, or even 20 years before it\u2019s ready to drink. With oil, it\u2019s because investment in new drilling projects is a slow-moving affair, frequently involving years of complex engineering and construction before the crude starts to flow.The result for both is that supply is basically fixed in the short run. The amount of oil available in the near future is determined by investment decisions that oil producers made years ago. This creates big swings in prices over long time horizons that have broad effects on everything from the cars we drive to the politicians who win office.The current sell-off in oil, for example, has its roots in actions taken in the middle of the last decade. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, oil was cheap \u2014 under $20 a barrel at the end of 2001. Those low prices left oil producers with little incentive to invest in drilling. Global investment in new production was only about $200 billion in 2004, according to estimates by an energy research firm, I.H.S. Herold.But early this century, economic growth in emerging nations was stronger than oil producers had predicted, and the demand for energy soared. Years of underinvestment because of low prices started to become a problem. By 2008, the price of oil topped $140 a barrel, and investment approached $500 billion.Now, the world finds itself living under the opposite circumstances. The increase in exploration that began in the last decade is starting to pay off in a big way, including a boom in the United States. After reaching five million barrels of oil a day in 2008, domestic crude output was up to 7.5 million in 2013 and is still rising.Meanwhile, the gaudy growth rates in China and other emerging markets of the middle of the last decade have given way to slower expansion, and the giant economies of Europe, Japan and the United States have underperformed after years of crisis.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to see a synchronized global economic boom anytime soon,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of I.H.S. and author of \u201cThe Quest,\u201d a book about the global oil market. \u201cThese cycles of investment and lumpiness of new supplies coming on, and of market reactions and economic cycles, are all at work. What\u2019s the adjustment mechanism? It\u2019s price.\u201dBut the volatility of the last decade in the price of oil comes at a cost. Entirely different economic arrangements make sense when oil is $70 a barrel and when it is $140. People want to buy different cars; airlines fly different routes at different prices; investment in alternative energy sources becomes more or less viable; oil-producing countries can be flush or starving.In other words, these cycles in oil prices are drastic, and can have real consequences in making it harder for businesses and societies to make long-term decisions. It can work against the interests of the oil producers themselves; the higher prices get, the more consumers and businesses have incentive to invest in efficiency and alternative energy sources.Which brings us back to the bourbon market.But just as oil producers can\u2019t turn the spigot on new oil supplies overnight, the years that bourbon must spend in barrels have left producers behind the curve in keeping up with demand.In the oil market, a global commodity with countless buyers and sellers, price is the only adjustment mechanism. But bourbon makers are, in many cases, trying to avoid raising their prices much.\u201cWe\u2019ve been adamant about not raising our prices to our distributors much beyond the cost of goods and inflation,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThe reason for that is very simple. We\u2019re in this business for the long term. Just because bourbon is hot right now doesn\u2019t change our way of thinking to say let\u2019s take advantage of the situation.\u201dBut the bet the bourbon industry is making is that there is more money to be made in the long run by cultivating a new generation of bourbon drinkers among young adults, and by building loyalty among customers in all corners of the United States, and eventually the world.It\u2019s not quite what Economics 101 would tell you to do, but it may be the right recipe for eliminating the boom-and-bust cycle that has made the oil business so volatile.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Interests Look to Malaysia for Cheap Iron Ore, and Profits", "Date": "2014-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUKIT BESI, Malaysia \u2014 Giant mining equipment has stripped away the palm trees and other vegetation from a jungle bluff here with a Malay name that translates to \u201cIron Hill.\u201d Huge power shovels gouge long furrows down cliffs of fuchsia clay, scooping out the shiny black iron ore at their base.Its ambitions, though, are being undermined by the shifting global terrain: Iron ore sells for less and less these days.\u201cChina still needs a lot of steel for infrastructure, housing projects and rails,\u201d Li Yang, CAA\u2019s chairman and chief executive, yelled as ore-processing machinery clanked noisily nearby. \u201cThe only problem is the pricing.\u201dWith seemingly insatiable demand from China, the price of iron ore, along with many other commodities, soared for most of the past decade. China manufactures half the world\u2019s steel, which is made from iron and used for housing construction, rail lines, carmaking and more.The boom helped support the rapid growth of companies like CAA, as well as the economies of developing countries rich with resources. From Indonesia and Australia to Peru and Brazil, multinationals and Chinese companies embarked on large-scale, long-term investments in mines.The result is a double blow to natural resources companies and emerging markets, with few sectors hurt more than iron ore. Prices are down 48 percent since the start of the year, to $70 a metric ton, a five-year low.Even in the face of falling prices, producers show no signs of easing off, with low-cost industry giants leading the charge.Chinese companies, too, have been relentlessly expanding overseas. In Malaysia, the number of iron ore mines in operation has increased more than sevenfold since 2007, mainly from Chinese investment.As iron ore demand has fallen, mines like the one here in Bukit Besi have kept running partly by digging deep into the most iron-rich part of their seams, instead of developing them more evenly, mining the poor-quality ore with the good. That has kept a torrent of iron ore entering the market even as prices have plummeted.\u201cThey exacerbate the problem by everyone doing the most profitable part,\u201d said Bruce Diesen, a commodities specialist at Carnegie ASA, an Oslo-based asset management company.CAA Resources has been at the center of the push here, reopening Malaysia\u2019s most famous mine. Discovered in the jungles of eastern Peninsular Malaysia in 1916 by a Japanese geologist, Bukit Besi became one of the world\u2019s largest mines as it supplied the Japanese steel industry through World War II.The British seized the mine as war spoils after Japan\u2019s surrender and handed it over to a British company. The British mining company initially struggled with Communist insurgency attacks on its rail lines, including bombings that destroyed three train stations, but nonetheless became a big supplier of ore for Japan\u2019s postwar industrial revival.Then, in 1971, the mine closed because of what a historic marker here describes as bureaucracy and labor union troubles. The site sat idle for most of the next four decades.Learning from the mistakes of his predecessors, Mr. Li, the 27-year-old CAA chief and scion of a Chinese family that had grown wealthy in the mainland iron ore industry, immediately worked to build ties with local and national political leaders, as well as with Malaysian royalty.\u201cIf you\u2019ve got these two to support you, then you can do anything you want, because the natural resources are all controlled by them,\u201d Mr. Li said.Mr. Li, who owns 56 percent of CAA, said that he had paid for each of the ruling party politicians with indirect stakes in the mine to receive the royally granted title of \u201cdato,\u201d which roughly translates as \u201cthe honorable.\u201d It costs about $100,000 to arrange each royal grant, he said.To avoid potential labor issues, Mr. Li has largely imported workers, who are not unionized. CAA Resources brought in about 40 mining engineers, accountants and other professionals from China, and filled the rest of its work force with laborers from low-wage countries like Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam. The workers are on 12-hour shifts, up to seven days a week, and are paid based mostly on how much iron ore each shift can produce, Mr. Li said.Pacing across the jungle mine, Mr. Li described his recruitment pitch to potential hires. \u201cYou can save a lot of money, there is nothing to do here,\u201d he said, \u201cI say, \u2018Each of you will be a hero, you will take back 100 percent of your savings, your wife will be happier, your children will be happier.' \u201dHe has avoided filing an environmental-impact statement by erecting an eight-foot-high, blue corrugated-steel fence across the middle of the site with a gate, and calling it two mines, each less than 500 acres. Only mines over 500 acres require environmental approval.Now, CAA\u2019s biggest challenges are from outside forces.Transportation, too, is a costly proposition. Australian and Brazilian iron ore mines are connected by rail lines to deepwater ports that can handle some of the world\u2019s largest bulk freighters. That limits their shipping costs to China at around $8 a ton. By contrast, it costs $16 a ton to ship Malaysian iron ore to China because Malaysian ports are shallower \u2014 although a deeper port is scheduled to open by the end of next year.But CAA benefits from a home-field advantage of sorts.The Chinese steel industry \u2014 and the Chinese government, which guides purchasing policies \u2014 has been reluctant to rely exclusively on Australia and Brazil, given its past difficulties. In the years before the global financial crisis, such players sharply increased ore export prices.\u201cThere is a strategic imperative \u2014 China does not want to be solely dependent on Australia and Brazil,\u201d said Tim Huxley, chief executive of Wah Kwong Maritime Transport Holdings, a big Hong Kong shipping company active in carrying iron ore to China. \u201cThey\u2019ve done that before, and it cost them a lot of money.\u201dWith migrant workers, CAA\u2019s labor costs are tiny compared with those of mines elsewhere. The company has brought in Chinese mining equipment at less than half the cost of American or Japanese equipment \u2014 and has the connections with manufacturers to get broken parts fixed quickly.So Mr. Li insists that his company\u2019s Malaysian mines could still cover their costs and show a modest profit shipping ore back to China at prices close to $80 a ton.\u201cWe\u2019re still positive by this time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe open pit process has low costs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Vow to Fight E.P.A. and Approve Keystone Pipeline", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWashington MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 The new Republican Congress is headed for a clash with the White House over two ambitious Environmental Protection Agency regulations that are the heart of President Obama\u2019s climate change agenda. Senator Mitch McConnell, the next majority leader, has already vowed to fight the rules, which could curb planet-warming carbon pollution but ultimately shut down coal-fired power plants in his native Kentucky. Mr. McConnell and other Republicans are, in the meantime, stepping up their demands that the president approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline to carry petroleum from Canadian oil sands to refineries on the Gulf Coast.At this point, Republicans do not have the votes to repeal the E.P.A. regulations, which will have far more impact on curbing carbon emissions than stopping the pipeline, but they say they will use their new powers to delay, defund and otherwise undermine them. Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, a prominent skeptic of climate change and the presumed new chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, is expected to open investigations into the E.P.A., call for cuts in its funding and delay the regulations as long as possible. The Republicans\u2019 new majority in the Senate also increases their leverage in pushing Mr. Obama to approve the pipeline, although it is still unclear if he will do so.The White House vowed to fight back. \u201cWe know that there will be attempts to impede or scale back our actions,\u201d John D. Podesta, the senior White House counselor who is leading Mr. Obama\u2019s climate agenda, said in a statement on Monday. But he added, \u201cWe\u2019re confident we can prevail.\u201d For Mr. McConnell, fierce opposition to the E.P.A. regulations is more than just a political priority. Kentucky is one of the country\u2019s top coal producers, and coal generates over 90 percent of the state\u2019s electricity. His re-election campaign was driven by a promise to protect Kentucky from what Republicans called Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cwar on coal.\u201d \u201cI have heard from Kentuckians across the commonwealth about the pain being inflicted on them by E.P.A.\u2019s unilateral actions,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in a statement. \u201cI fully intend to do everything I can do to fight these onerous E.P.A. regulations.\u201dMr. Inhofe has gained headlines throughout his career for asserting that the science of human-caused climate change has been falsified. He is the author of \u201cThe Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future.\u201d But while Republicans may be able to muster enough of a majority to pass bills that would block or delay the climate rules, it is a near certainty that Mr. Obama would veto such legislation. And Mr. McConnell could not gather the two-thirds majority in the Senate necessary to override a presidential veto.Still, both Mr. McConnell and Mr. Inhofe are seasoned veterans of congressional procedure, willing and able to deploy a range of tactics designed to slow or hamstring the rules. Mr. McConnell signaled last week that he, too, wanted to cut the E.P.A.\u2019s budget to keep it from enforcing environmental regulations. Republicans might also include provisions that would repeal the E.P.A. regulations in crucial spending bills \u2014 a tactic that could force a standoff between Mr. Obama and Mr. McConnell over funding the government. Mr. Inhofe was also expected to use his environmental committee chairmanship to hold hearings grilling Gina McCarthy, the E.P.A. administrator. As chairman of the committee during the Bush administration, Mr. Inhofe did not hesitate to investigate the environmental policies of his own party. \u201cHe was willing to do aggressive oversight during the Bush administration,\u201d said Andrew Wheeler, a former chief of staff for Mr. Inhofe. \u201cThis time, it\u2019s going to be very aggressive.\u201d But some environmentalists said Mr. Inhofe\u2019s assault could backfire politically. \u201cIf the Republican Party doubles down on this brand of climate denial, it will go very badly for them,\u201d said David Doniger, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group.Republicans also planned to use their majority to enact legislation requiring the president to approve the Keystone pipeline. Republicans and the oil industry have issued angry calls for construction of the pipeline, which they see as a crucial conduit for oil. Environmentalists have campaigned against the project, which they see as a symbol of environmental degradation. Mr. Obama has delayed a decision on the project for years, as the State Department conducted numerous reviews of its impact on the nation\u2019s environment, economy and national security.The State Department is now awaiting a decision by a Nebraska court on the route of the pipeline before any decision is made. If Republicans send a Keystone bill to Mr. Obama before the Nebraska verdict, the president is likely to veto it. But people familiar with the president\u2019s thinking say that when it comes to climate change policy, Mr. Obama sees the E.P.A. regulations as the centerpiece of his environmental agenda and the Keystone pipeline as a sideline issue. Asked about the project at a news conference last week, Mr. Obama said, \u201cI\u2019m going to let that process play out.\u201d Then he added, \u201cAnd I\u2019m just going to gather up the facts.\u201dRepublicans were likely to add a Keystone-approval provision to key spending bills, again daring Mr. Obama to veto such a measure. Mr. Obama appeared willing to veto such measures to protect the climate change rules, which could have an impact on the nation\u2019s energy economy for the coming decades. But he may not be willing to do so for the pipeline, a single piece of infrastructure.\u201cI think there is probably a deal to be had on Keystone,\u201d said David Goldwyn, who led the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Energy Resources in Mr. Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cIf Republicans attach Keystone to a budget bill, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s so principally opposed to it that he would veto it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Town That Thrived on Logging Is Looking for a Second Growth ", "Date": "2014-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySWEET HOME, Ore. \u2014 The great forest just east of town beckoned to Dan Rice when he was a young man, as it had to his father and grandfather before him, both proud loggers in a time that now survives mostly in black-and-white photos and in the talk of old men. He and his brothers kept the family log-trucking business going, he said, hauling to mills now mostly automated, partly in obligation to the legacy.His wife, Cindy, by contrast, fixed her gaze on consequences, and the pattern of poverty and desperation that was left behind as mill and timber jobs blinked out. He holds fast to things that echo from the community\u2019s founding in the 1850s, when the first Rices arrived from Tennessee; she directs the Sweet Home Emergency Ministries food bank, a vivid marker of need going forward.A half-century ago, when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the tenets of the Great Society into law, Sweet Home, in a little valley in west-central Oregon, would have been among the last places that a do-gooder would worry about. Now, as in too many places around the country, the old jobs are long gone, the food bank has a more secure future than remaining industrial jobs, and the town is full of people looking for second or third acts without much of a script to guide them.Older residents still remember what Sweet Home once looked like at 3 a.m., when loggers would gather on downtown street corners to pick and choose, like haughty freelance knights, what work crew they might join for that day in the woods or, as locals call it, \u201cthe brush.\u201d Employers competed for the best, and they paid wages that could support a family.Then it all unraveled, or perhaps, depending on one\u2019s point of view, it was all saved. Maybe both, foresters and residents said. Candalynn Johnson, 20, at her home in Sweet Home, Ore., a town that has suffered from a decline in the logging industry. Ms. Johnson attends community college and helps support her family by working at a taco shop. Some logging families like the Rices stayed on, but many more moved away, chasing hope or fleeing calamity. An influx of retirees and commuters partly filled the gap, colonizing areas around Foster Lake, a few miles from downtown, with their new white-trimmed townhouses. But falling rents and real estate prices also drew a wave of low-income residents. Neither demographic led to much job growth in this town of about 9,000 people.The patchwork that resulted \u2014 some people with money, many people without and few ways to earn a wage \u2014 now defines much of rural Oregon. His mother, Cindy, 54, a lean, muscled woman, believes Sweet Home\u2019s answer is still out there in the natural world that she throws herself into nearly every day, pounding out restless energy on her bike in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains.\u201cWe still have wonderful resources out here \u2014 wonderful natural beauty,\u201d she said, gesturing out the door to the green hills that hug the Santiam River. \u201cBut here in town the need just keeps growing.\u201dRepurposed real estate defines downtown Sweet Home in ways a biologist might appreciate, with ancestral forms from the prosperous years peering out from beneath the faded or altered facades. The department stores and shops that once lined the gracious low-rise main drag with their rain-shelter awnings were retooled for lower-rent uses in pawn and pizza, hair care and gun repair. The Chevron station, closed for a decade on a prime corner, reopened as a Goodwill donation center, the gas pump islands still marking time like forgotten sentries.At the food bank, which was a men\u2019s clothing store in better days, a carefully structured formality dictates the rhythm. The mostly female clients (husbands, partners or fathers, if they are around, tend to wait outside, in wounded pride or for other reasons) are ushered down the aisles of donated food. They push a cart containing a box while a volunteer runs through a set of questions and picks up each chosen item from the shelf. Nobody comes in and grabs.How many children are at home, and what are their ages? Brown rice or white? Canned peas or corn?The strict rules of order are in sharp contrast to the wildly diverse families who come through the door \u2014 so varied in their dreams and despairs, ambitions, choices and luck, but all united in a way, too, in making up their futures on the fly.Marshal and Noelle Ahl \u2014 he is 33 and she 36 \u2014\u00a0both lost their jobs in the recession in the suburbs of Portland; they came to Sweet Home this year with the dream of building a self-sustaining life outside the cash economy. They bought a 43-year-old house for $90,000 with no money down, using a federal loan program aimed at helping low-income people buy property in rural places. On their quarter-acre plot, they plan to make a garden big enough to survive on, and have already mapped out where the fruit trees will go, and the cabbage for the homemade sauerkraut that Mr. Ahl said he could never get enough of. A food-bank stop, for them and their four children, is a stopgap until things grow and the goats and chickens start earning their keep.Debbie and Jacob Manuel worked in the home repair world \u2014 he was a plumber; she was a plumbing dispatcher \u2014 and they came here after a work injury and a job loss. Bob Sele, 79, came from Minnesota in the early 1950s with his father, to work in the mills. He now volunteers, delivering food boxes for people who cannot make it in. Planning an EscapeCandalynn Johnson, a 20-year-old with wild, naturally curly hair and serious plans, plots escape.\u201cIf you want something badly enough you can get it,\u201d she said, the words tumbling out in machine-gun cadence. It is a pattern of intense energy that she said comes from the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder that kept her from sitting still in childhood.Ms. Johnson\u2019s family moved here from Bullhead City, Ariz., when she was 11. Her father, Charles, had worked as a waiter in the casinos in Laughlin, Nev., near their home. But the tip money in his pocket kept disappearing, he said, falling back into the gaming tables and machines he walked by day after day. As a self-described \u201caddictive personality,\u201d he knew he had to get away.So, like so many other Western migrants dating back to Sweet Home\u2019s founding, the Johnsons pulled up stakes and added their own family chemistry to the town\u2019s. Their economic struggle persisted, as did the debilitating migraines that have plagued Mr. Johnson since his youth and have kept him from working, but so did kind of a steely resolve.Ms. Johnson is now in her second year of community college, paid for through financial aid and a minimum-wage job at Sweet Home Taco Time. She is aiming for a political science degree from Oregon State University, with a focus on international relations. Mr. Johnson \u2014 who dropped out of high school but got his high school equivalency diploma here in Oregon \u2014 has gone back to school at age 47, as has his wife, Karie, 45. She holds no illusion of anything coming easily or for free. The trailer park neighborhoods that are all she has known here, especially her family\u2019s first place, with its leaky roof and roaches, taught her that much.\u201cLife is supposed to be hard; it\u2019s supposed to be difficult,\u201d she said.But because her energies can sometimes run so kinetically fast, she also finds a kind of comfort in the codified system of the taco shop, where a bean-and-beef burrito is always the same.\u201cI need a routine to stay structured,\u201d she said on a recent afternoon behind the counter, her hair cinched back tightly in a bun for health regulations, black apron and Taco Time visor firmly in place. She plopped an exact, specified mound of refried beans on a tortilla, not looking up as she spoke. \u201cThis works for me now.\u201dNew Potential in ForestThe old, blue-collar economy might be gone, but the glorious swath of nature, 1.7 million acres of Willamette National Forest, is still here \u2014 the trees growing mightier by the year in a place where climate is conducive to giants with trunks the size of dinner tables. And the potential of that forest, as a retooled engine of economic growth, gnaws at Craig Martin day and night.The forest was Sweet Home\u2019s past, but geography and climate dictate that it will also be the future, said Mr. Martin, the city manager, who graduated from high school here, the son of a firefighter. He and others working on what is called the Sweet Home Project \u2014 a consortium of academics, and local, state and federal representatives \u2014 said the question was how to tap the riches of those lands in a new way. \u201cThis community has gone through a grieving process of accepting that it\u2019s never going to be the way it was,\u201d Mr. Martin said. \u201cBut that\u2019s also the key step to moving forward.\u201dThe Sweet Home Project\u2019s goals are both large and small. It is working on a community trail network that could better connect Sweet Home and the national forest to draw more hikers and cyclists. There are hopes for development of skilled manufacturing, in making things like windows, doors or other specialty products. The United States Forest Service, looking for ways to keep the forests relevant and revenue-producing, has collaborated, with the district ranger, Cindy Glick, taking a seat alongside Mr. Martin on the Sweet Home project.Turnarounds have happened in the West, in up-from-the-ashes towns like Telluride, Colo., which went from hard-rock mining to hard-core poverty to ski-mountain riches, and Bend, Ore., another timber town just 100 miles east of Sweet Home, which found reinvention as a mecca for tourism and second homes.But what path to choose, when to leap, what to pay forward in hopes of it coming back around \u2014 those are the questions of a town\u2019s, or a family\u2019s second act. Stay rooted or move with the best opportunity? It is an American dilemma as old as the frontier, but when so much feels uncharted in the economy, that doesn\u2019t make things feel easier on the lower rungs of the ladder.In the trailer, it seems, no one is quite where he or she wants to be. Mr. Johnson, sitting by an open door as fans moved the air around on a hot late-summer afternoon, said much of his life was shaped by the second-guessing of what might have been. Back in high school, he did well on his SATs, he said. College beckoned. But then his father, who had worked around the West in various jobs \u2014 from training racehorses to playing minor-league football \u2014 moved the family again, for a 14th time, to a 14th school. Filled with frustration and anger, he dropped out. It set a pattern that took decades, he said, to escape.Now he talks of moving his own family again, closer to the Oregon State University campus in Corvallis, and maybe even keeping everyone together despite Candalynn\u2019s talk of getting her own place.Rice family anchors are shifting, too. Ms. Rice is looking ahead, figuring that the food bank is one thing in town with a future. She had been awaiting word on a $14,000 state grant for a backup electricity generator \u2014 blackouts plague Sweet Home\u2019s electrical grid, imperiling stored food. The grant just came through, allowing her group and two other food banks in town to create a shared cold-storage space and take a step toward buying a new walk-in freezer.Dan Rice and his brothers, all nearing retirement age, have just about given up on the idea of being able to sell the trucking business, where about one in five employees are extended family members, and no one from a coming generation is interested.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t counsel anybody to invest in logging,\u201d he said. \u201cInvest in Google.\u201dCaught in Poverty: Articles in this series are examining\nAmerican hardship 50 years after the\nwar on poverty.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Eurozone Inflation Ticked Up in October, but Is Still Far Below Target", "Date": "2014-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Price pressures in the eurozone remain dangerously weak, official data showed on Friday, while a separate report showed continuing stagnation in the labor market.That was marginally up from the 0.3 percent recorded in September, but far below the level of just under 2 percent aimed at by the European Central Bank.The latest data add to the pressure on the central bank to take additional steps to stimulate the economy, particularly now that the distractions of reviewing the eurozone\u2019s biggest banks are behind it.The central bank this week disclosed its first purchases in a planned campaign to buy private sector assets. But the amount bought \u2014 1.7 billion euros\u2019, or $2.15 billion, worth \u2014 was considered minimal by analysts and propelled speculation that the central bank would soon be forced to take larger steps to bolster its balance sheet.In Russia, the central bank sought to defend the faltering ruble on Friday by raising its key interest rate 1.5 points, to 9.5 percent. Sanctions on Russian businesses imposed by the European Union and the United States in reaction to the Ukraine crisis have caused inflation in Russia to rise and sent the ruble to its lowest levels ever.In Europe, energy prices, down 1.8 percent from September, dragged the overall inflation rate lower. The so-called core inflation rate, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, came in at 0.7 percent, down from 0.8 percent in September.For the overall European Union of 28 countries, the jobless rate was 10.1 percent, also unchanged from August. Across Europe, about 24.5 million people were unemployed in August, including nearly five million youths, out of a working-age population of about 243 million people.Both the inflation and the labor market numbers were in line with market expectations. A struggling labor market and weak price pressures are symptoms of the same problem: insufficient demand.Businesses are not investing and hiring fast enough to restore growth because prospects remain uncertain, at best, and households are keeping a tight handle on spending for the same reason.Most economists believe that the eurozone economy contracted or stagnated in the three months from July through September, and the latest data will not change many opinions.Fear of falling prices is not limited to Europe. Officials in Japan, China and the United States are all closely watching the trend.This week, concerns about deflation led the Swedish central bank, the Riksbank, to cut its main interest rate target to zero from 0.25 percent. The Federal Reserve in Washington, which on Wednesday announced an end to its large-scale bond-buying program, said its main rate target would also remain near zero \u201cfor a considerable time.\u201dStill, \u201cit is clearly not impossible,\u201d the Goldman Sachs economists wrote, adding: \u201cThere is (and always has been) a point at which the macro data are bad enough to trigger sovereign Q.E.,\u201d especially if the long-term outlook for inflation moves lower.\u201cShould the outlook deteriorate enough to trigger sovereign Q.E.,\u201d they said, \u201cthe E.C.B. is likely to implement it aggressively.

{"Headline": "Pressure Mounts on F.C.C. Chief Over Net Neutrality Rules", "Date": "2014-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis quandary: trying to shape rules for an open Internet, or net neutrality, that would satisfy the millions of people who wrote the agency in support of strong regulation \u2014 and also would stand up in court and encourage web investment and innovation. The challenge only grew after Mr. Obama spoke out, adding a more potent political element to the debate. Since those remarks, say people who met with Mr. Wheeler this week, he has been testy, defensive and a bit angry that he might be seen as a political pawn instead of as the head of an independent agency who is exercising his own judgment.Mr. Wheeler has not yet decided on how to proceed, F.C.C. officials say. But as he tries to thread the needle of politics and public policy to safeguard the openness of the Internet, he must now also face down angry Republicans in Congress and a technology industry, generally supportive of the president, that is wary of any regulations stifling the expansion of the Internet.AT&T said it would pause its planned investments in high-speed fiber-optic broadband networks at least until the F.C.C. decides how it will regulate Internet service. \u201cWe can\u2019t go out and invest that kind of money deploying fiber to 100 cities not knowing under what rules those investments will be governed,\u201d Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, said at an investment conference in New York on Wednesday.According to the poll, 81 percent of those questioned said they opposed or strongly opposed paid prioritization. The poll, which has a margin of error of 3 percentage points, found Republicans and Democrats opposed to the practice in roughly equivalent proportions. But two months after he took office, a federal appeals court threw out the commission\u2019s Open Internet rules adopted in 2010 under the previous chairman, Julius Genachowski. Those rules imposed disclosure, antiblocking and antidiscrimination requirements on broadband providers. The court found that while the commission had \u201cgeneral authority to regulate in this arena,\u201d its rules treated broadband providers as common carriers \u2014 the equivalent of a utility \u2014 when it had previously classified broadband as exempt from that treatment.But Mr. Wheeler was leaning toward a lighter-touch approach for the relationship between consumers and their broadband companies when Mr. Obama made his statement, calling for the whole system to be reclassified under Title II.Shortly after Mr. Obama\u2019s call for stronger regulation, Mr. Wheeler held a previously scheduled meeting with Internet companies, including Google and Yahoo, and lawyers and trade groups representing them. At the meeting, Mr. Wheeler said that he had not yet made a decision on how to proceed, according to people at the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their relationship with the chairman. And he hinted, the people said, that the F.C.C. would need more time \u2014 months, at least \u2014 to gather adequate comment and write the rules in a manner that they could not be overturned in court.F.C.C. officials flatly denied that on Wednesday. \u201cThere was absolutely nothing he said that indicated that he was going to diverge from the president,\u201d said Gigi Sohn, who serves as special counsel for external affairs to Mr. Wheeler and who was at the meeting. \u201cWhat he said was all options are on the table.\u201dGreg Schneider, the national economy and business editor for The Post, said the paper made a small change to the article after publication, after hearing from the F.C.C. \u2014 making it more clear that Mr. Wheeler\u2019s position was a nuanced one before Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks. \u201cOtherwise, we stand by our reporting and stand by the story,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.Even President Obama conceded that a strict Title II approach would not by itself be sufficient because there are hundreds of rules applying to telephone service common carriers that would be inappropriate to apply to broadband, like, for example, rate regulation.In addition, even Title II does not ban paid prioritization completely. Rick Boucher, a former Democratic congressman from Virginia who now heads the Internet Innovation Alliance, a nonprofit group that opposes adoption of Title II, points out that some Internet applications, like Skype and videoconferencing applications, need to be prioritized; they quickly become unusable if they get caught in Internet traffic jams. Mr. Boucher says he believes the F.C.C. can accomplish those goals without Title II.Whatever decision Mr. Wheeler ends up reaching, the heat is increasing for him to make it quickly. Gene Kimmelman, president of Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group that supports Mr. Obama\u2019s prescription, said Wednesday that the commission has already spent months gathering opinions and data.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the F.C.C. to take immediate action to declare broadband a Title II service,\u201d Mr. Kimmelman said, \u201cand work quickly to resolve all open legal and analytical questions the commission believes deserve more attention.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Test for Premier, Italians Rally Against Plan to Relax Labor Rules ", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 In Naples, demonstrators blocked traffic. In Padua, Pisa and Milan, they clashed with the police. Here, they lobbed eggs at government buildings and climbed to the top of the Colosseum to unfurl a protest banner.While their grievances are many, much of what has propelled Italians into the streets by the tens of thousands in recent weeks is the mere hint of a change to labor laws that, among other things, would make it easier for businesses to get rid of workers.On Tuesday, after weeks of protests that have become an ever-clearer gauge of the obstacles confronting Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, lawmakers were already considering proposals to water down the plan.\u201cThe Jobs Act institutionalizes the continual precariousness we have been living in Italy,\u201d said Cristian Sica, 37, who works on a project-by-project basis for a ministry and joined a sit-in against the plan in front of Parliament last month.Workers\u2019 rights and protections should be broadened, not curtailed, he said, echoing a common refrain. \u201cWe are the precarious generation, in work, but above all in life,\u201d he added.He now faces pressure from various quarters to show he can deliver on his promises of change, not least from his eurozone partners, who are eager to see progress as Mr. Renzi seeks flexibility for Italy on budget limits set by Brussels.But in a country where the first article of the Constitution declares it a republic \u201cfounded on work,\u201d rolling back labor protections is not to be taken lightly. It is particularly telling that many of those opposing Mr. Renzi\u2019s plans are young people.They are deeply skeptical that the proposed change would in fact open jobs to them \u2014 so many other overhaul efforts before it have failed to do so. Instead, they are demanding the same guarantees that their parents have had, something it is not at all clear Italy can still afford.\u201cAll he\u2019s doing is destroying the rights of full-time workers without giving rights to people in precarious job situations,\u201d said Francesco Raparelli, 36, one of the coordinators of a nationwide strike last Friday by thousands of workers who hold temporary contracts.The prime minister argues that a change toward a looser labor market would benefit young people in particular, by creating jobs and getting Italy\u2019s economy moving again. Nearly 43 percent of those 15 to 24 are unemployed.He also says it would help solve the problem of what has become a two-tier work force in Italy. Solidly protected full-time workers \u2014 mostly older \u2014 are all but immovable and are still guaranteed ample pensions and retirement benefits.Behind them is a wave of mostly younger workers who subsist on temporary, usually low-paid contracts, with few or no benefits.Mr. Renzi is pushing for more flexible labor rules to make it easier to hire and fire workers, as a way to make entrepreneurs feel safer in taking on more full-time employees.The current workers\u2019 statute was written in 1970. Even though it was modified in 2012 to make it easier to get rid of employees with full-time contracts in firms with more than 15 people \u2014 for example, in the case of economic difficulty \u2014 Mr. Renzi argues that it is still too outdated.\u201cIt\u2019s like taking an iPhone and wondering, \u2018Where do I put in the phone token?\u2019\u00a0\u201d he told a recent gathering in Florence, in the typically homespun manner that has made him popular with millions of Italians eager for change.But the debate over labor flexibility has swamped other parts of Mr. Renzi\u2019s plan, which also includes gradual access to severance compensation, job training, simplified contracts and the extension of unemployment benefits to many who currently do not have any.\u201cAt the core of the Jobs Act is the idea of shifting protection from the job to the individual, and protecting the transitions,\u201d said Stefano Sacchi, a political scientist at the University of Milan, who helped draft the Jobs Act and is a consultant for the Labor Ministry.Critics of the new measures say they would further erode protections without doing much to create new jobs.\u201cIt\u2019s a design, in the face of this crisis, drafted by the real powers \u2014 banking and finance \u2014 which have decided to cancel the rights of workers and the freedom that were sanctioned by the conquests\u201d of 1970, said Giorgio Cremaschi, a former trade union leader.Others, including some economists and business leaders, say that making firing easier is \u201cnot the right recipe\u201d to spur Italy\u2019s economic recovery. Even business leaders who support Mr. Renzi\u2019s effort say stimulating the economy will require a much more multipronged approach.That would include reducing labor costs, overhauling a justice system in which lawsuits are mired for years and drastically simplifying bureaucracy for things like permits.\u201cYou have to start from the concept that it has to be feasible to do business here; that\u2019s where the change has to happen,\u201d said Marco Gay, the president of Confindustria, a national business lobby for young entrepreneurs.\u201cA business can go badly or can succeed, but you have to have the possibility to allow a company to be born,\u201d he said.Elisabetta Addis, an economics professor at the University of Sassari, said the fight over the labor law had become \u201cmore political than economic.\u201d Despite the turmoil on the streets and in Parliament, the effect would probably be negligible.\u201cThe debate over job reintegration will have no effect on the labor market at all,\u201d she said, \u201cSo there\u2019s no reason for Renzi to present it as leading to new jobs, nor for the unions to make it a point of honor.\u201d\u201cPeople aren\u2019t not hiring because of labor laws, but because there\u2019s no internal or external demand,\u201d she added. \u201cCompanies aren\u2019t selling, and if that doesn\u2019t change, it\u2019s going to be difficult for the economy to restart.\u201dIt also remains to be seen how the government would ultimately shape the changes. Until the rules are specified, there is no telling what the law\u2019s effect would be.\u201cLet\u2019s see how it is turned into law before we assess how it can impact the labor market,\u201d said Stefano Scarpetta, the director for employment, labor and social affairs at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.In the meantime, the protests are likely to continue. The Italian General Confederation of Labor, an especially combative union that brought an estimated one million people to a rally in Rome in late October, is now planning a general strike for Dec. 5.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Jonathan Gruber Controversy and Washington\u2019s Dirty Little Secret", "Date": "2014-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBeltway AccountingSuppose that Congress decides that everyone in America should have an iPhone. There are two ways it can do this:To an economist, these things are pretty much identical. To a politician, they are very different. The first is a big-spending government giveaway. The second is a tax cut. And in that distinction lies the heart of the firestorm around comments by one of the intellectual godfathers of President Obama\u2019s health reform law.But here\u2019s the dirty little secret: Mr. Gruber was exposing something sordid yet completely commonplace about how Congress makes policy of all types: Legislators frequently game policy to fit the sometimes arbitrary conventions by which the Congressional Budget Office evaluates laws and the public debates them.In the case of the Affordable Care Act, that meant structuring the law so that the money Americans must pay the Internal Revenue Service if they fail to obtain health insurance under the law\u2019s mandate is a penalty, not a tax. (The Supreme Court held that, though not a tax, the penalties were constitutional because they were an exercise of Congress\u2019s taxing authority, which is the kind of distinction only a lawyer could come up with). That\u2019s the reason the financial assistance the health law gives people to buy insurance is structured as a tax credit, not a direct payment, which would probably be simpler and more efficient.This kind of gamesmanship is very much a bipartisan affair. President George W. Bush\u2019s expansion of Medicare in 2003 was carefully designed so that its costs were backloaded, rising sharply just after its 10-year mark. Estimating costs in the 10-year window is an (arbitrary) convention for C.B.O. scoring of pending legislation. The design of the law made it seem less costly than it was expected to be over a longer time period.To economists, it doesn\u2019t matter whether our hypothetical iPhones are bought directly by the government or \u201cbought\u201d through tax cuts. It doesn\u2019t matter whether Obamacare\u2019s subsidies happen through a tax credit or a check in the mail. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the costs of Bush\u2019s Medicare expansion were projected over a 10-year time horizon or 15.In business school, they teach that there are two types of accounting. Financial accounting must follow the strict, and frequently arbitrary, rules of generally accepted accounting principles in preparing the financial statements released to investors. But a different approach, cost accounting, is for managers trying to understand the true economics of their business, such as whether a given business line is profitable. In cost accounting, the goal is less about following some set of rules to report to outsiders and more about understanding what is really in the company\u2019s best interest.Essentially, Congress is obsessed with the government equivalent of financial accounting standards (with the C.B.O. as the rule maker) instead of cost accounting. It structures the laws in ways that might not be very efficient but sound good on the stump. Mr. Gruber was, in an infelicitous way, expressing frustration with that state of affairs.Advertisement"}

Sometimes, either by choice or because of a layoff, young people need to take a step back and figure out how they fit into the new economy. Those who are nimble and can make career course corrections will have tremendous opportunities in the future, Ms. Pollak said. While the conventional wisdom is that employers like to see consistency, the ability to reinvent oneself is gaining currency as a sought-after talent. \u201cMoving from one career to another is all about listening, and if you are smart, it\u2019s about responding to what the marketplace wants and realigning accordingly,\u201d Ms. Domingue said. Although neither sex is impervious to these lulls, women may not raise as many eyebrows when they tell people they aren\u2019t working. \u201cThere is more cultural acceptance of women moving in and out of the work force,\u201d Ms. Pollak said. \u201cWe unfairly expect men to know where they are going.\u201d That seems to be true for my husband, to some degree. After one too many distressed onlookers responded to his news, I suggested that his career gap needed a rebranding. He wasn\u2019t in between jobs; he was a consultant, just like everyone else.

{"Headline": "Alibaba, Shrugging Off Slowdown in Chinese Economy, Reports Strong First Earnings", "Date": "2014-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPointing to a huge jump in the number of customers using Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce sites on smartphones and to strong increases in sales and profits, the company\u2019s executive vice chairman, Joseph C. Tsai, said in a news conference after the earnings announcement that the results provided a \u201cstrong foundation for future sustained growth.\u201dThe Jefferies analyst Cynthia Meng agreed, estimating that Alibaba would count half of China\u2019s 1.3 billion people as customers over the next decade, up from less than a quarter now. A large increase in the number of Chinese shopping online will help Alibaba overcome a slowdown in the growth of Chinese Internet users and moderating economic expansion, Ms. Meng said.Alibaba said that in the quarter ended Sept. 30, its net profit jumped to $1.1 billion, roughly in line with the $1.16 billion estimated by 22 analysts polled by Reuters, using figures derived from nonstandard accounting rules. Alibaba\u2019s revenue rose 54 percent, to $2.7 billion, better than the $2.6 billion estimate of 27 analysts polled by Reuters.Alibaba also reported net profit using generally accepted accounting principles of $494 million, a drop of 39 percent from the same period a year earlier. The company cited costs related to stock awards before its listing and acquisition-related expenses.Alibaba\u2019s chief financial officer, Maggie Wei Wu, said the company would not disclose guidance for its future earnings because it wanted to focus on the long term.The twin drivers of Alibaba\u2019s growth are its Taobao Marketplace and Tmall sites. Taobao, which facilitates the sale of goods from small merchants to consumers, is larger than Tmall, but analysts expect Tmall to eventually eclipse it as Chinese consumers become wealthier and buy products from larger brands. On Tmall, larger companies and multinationals set up their own stores to sell to the huge number of consumers who visit the site.Jonathan Lu, Alibaba\u2019s chief executive, said that another point of growth for the company would come from China\u2019s less developed and rural regions. He said that only 9 percent of China\u2019s still immense rural population used e-commerce.\u201cOur vision is to enable farmers to sell products to city people and globally,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, we encourage China\u2019s 600 million farmers to buy online from Taobao.\u201dAnalysts have been cheered by the quick growth in the percentage of Alibaba\u2019s transactions carried out on smartphones, though the company\u2019s smartphone presence will continue to be watched closely. Mr. Tsai, the executive vice chairman, said the company had 217 million monthly active users for its mobile e-commerce apps, up from 188 million in the quarter ended in June.The Forrester analyst Bryan Wang said that just as critical as growth for Alibaba would be controlling costs, which could balloon as the company works to integrate the more than a dozen partnerships it has forged in 2014 alone. Stock in the company closed on Tuesday at $106.07, up 4 percent. \u201cI\u2019m not so worried about growth. Growth will slow down, probably in the next couple of quarters,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cThat will be fine. The key is to make sure costs don\u2019t go up, because when you make so many investments, integration costs rise, and they need to make sure these investments benefit them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "PAID POST Though they have the financial wherewithal and technical know-how to implement cutting-edge technologies, a surprising share of companies are thinking twice about moving ahead because of worries over security breaches and tougher regulatory demands. Indeed, across key emerging technologies \u2014 including cloud, big data and mobility \u2014 security woes appear to be a drag on new investment.  This is the main finding of the inaugural Dell Global Technology Adoption Index, which set out to assess how often-overlooked midsize companies \u2014 organizations with 100 to 5,000 employees \u2014 are adapting these technologies to spur growth.  The research involved thousands of interviews with senior managers and information-technology decision-makers from 11 countries, ranging from emerging markets to wealthy economies. The state of security that emerged reveals that most companies must make significant strides in preparedness to improve their chances of thwarting attacks. Among the findings:  When treated as a constructive investment, security upgrades can allow companies to confidently adapt new technology. When viewed as a costly chore, however, dealing with security risks can raise anxiety levels among key decision-makers and delay the pursuit of innovations that may otherwise boost productivity, improve customer experience and lift the bottom line.  Indeed, when asked what was stopping companies from adopting big data and cloud solutions, doubts about data security ranked high. Those trepidations were identified by 44 percent of decision-makers who were asked about barriers to expanding mobile programs. Fear of a data breach easily topped the list, trumping the perennial challenge of scarce financial resources.  \u201cYes, security worries may, at first blush, put a damper on tech investment. Yet for midsize companies willing to commit, this barrier can be transformed into an opportunity, driving out the fear and doubt that would otherwise impede a forward-leaning embrace of those very technologies that can bring about their next level of growth,\u201d said John McClurg, vice president of global security at Dell. \u201cSmart security investment can trigger a cascade of further technological gains that, in turn, can open up a competitive lead.\u201d  Confidence in the next-generation firewalls used by Amerijet encouraged the Florida-based freight carrier in July to place its cargo management system in a private cloud, said Jennifer Torlone, the company\u2019s senior director of technology and information services.  She credits the shift with simplifying and accelerating the process of opening remote offices around the world. Before the move, it took a new office at least 90 days to become fully functional. This summer, Amerijet opened 11 offices in only a week, she said.  \u201cBecause of the technology we have in the data center, we can be more flexible,\u201d Torlone explained.  A bespoke mapping service helped organizers of the London Summer Olympics ensure that practically all aspects of the event went off without a hitch. The solution not only helped the games go smoothly, it was also a boon to the tech startup that made it. For PIE, the small company behind the service, the risk of taking on such as a large project paid off with a wave of new business.  But sudden success also pushed the organization right up against an all-too-common capacity constraint. The on-premise digital infrastructure that underpinned PIE\u2019s Olympics operation wasn\u2019t suitable for the company\u2019s new business strategy \u2014 an approach that hinged on the ability to scale and handle more dynamic data, said Freddie Talberg, the company\u2019s chief executive.  A decision to expand key infrastructure and processing into the cloud helped PIE survive these growing pains. Today, the London-based company is on course to scale up more quickly, by providing its mapping services as a software service via the cloud.  PIE\u2019s fast transformation, from proprietary operations to cloud-based services, might suggest that most industry leaders have a firm grasp on the cloud and all of its benefits. After all, most midsize businesses are using the cloud. Yet independent research commissioned by Dell found that, unlike PIE, most midsize firms aren\u2019t getting all that they can from the technology.  More than three quarters of the tech decision-makers surveyed for the Dell Global Technology Adoption Index said their companies do not yet use the cloud to:  How the cloud became so popular among midsize businesses appears to come down to practicality. The largest share of respondents, just over one third, said the cloud was simply the \u201cbest fit\u201d when asked why they decided to adopt it.  But competitive pressure is also driving the shift. Companies in developing nations are most likely to be motivated by a desire to be first to adopt cloud services. While 16 percent of respondents globally cited early adoption for getting into the cloud, 27 percent of firms in India cited that as their priority. Brazil and China are close behind, at 20 percent. Most new companies in emerging markets lack the capital access that\u2019s seen in the developed world, making cloud services\u2019 lower up-front price tag more alluring.  But for all of the cloud\u2019s promise \u2014 from lower costs to flexibility of deployment \u2014 worries over data security remain a major barrier.  Adoption has advanced quickly, yet 21 percent of companies surveyed have yet to commit to the technology. And while most are considering it, the fear over a data breach is the main factor holding them back, the index shows.  A U.S. executive in the hospitality industry captured the concerns of many holdouts. In responding to the survey, he cited \u201csusceptibility to interruption by hacker threats\u201d as the main reason for his company\u2019s \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach.  These firms will want to figure it out, said William Fellows, a cloud analyst at 451 Research. Employees have made it clear that they\u2019re going to work in the cloud \u2014 whether to access email, to facilitate video conferencing, or simply share big files \u2014 irrespective of company policy. This grassroots demand is forcing companies to open the door to sanctioned apps so employees aren\u2019t tempted to store company data in clouds managed by others.  \u201cThe range of things going on \u2014 like Dropbox, with sync being the new save \u2014 shows there\u2019s definitely a need,\u201d Fellows said.  Attitudes toward the cloud\u2019s safety vary by region. Globally 49 percent of non-users cited security when asked why their company hasn\u2019t moved forward. Yet in Europe, 60 percent of executives \u2014 more than any other area \u2014 are similarly unconvinced. Regulations on the continent requiring in-country data storage may also be compounding Europe\u2019s slower adoption of cloud services.  While a minority of companies report strong doubts about cloud security, those who have migrated to the cloud are generally upbeat. Among current cloud users, all but a few report they are confident in the security measures they had in place \u2014 whether their networks were private, public or hybrid.  Strong evidence of impenetrability is what Talberg from PIE wanted to see before investing in his company\u2019s first cloud, a private one built by Dell. \u201cThey\u2019ve given us all the test evidence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was really about getting the assurance.\u201d  It might seem incongruous, but in terms of making mobile technology integral to everyday business, companies in emerging markets are outpacing their ostensibly deeper-pocketed competitors in wealthier regions  The finding, captured by Dell in a rare look at midsize companies, should not suggest a lack of awareness of mobility\u2019s promise. Rather, many companies are stymied by the challenge of managing security.  The Dell Global Technology Adoption Index found that less than half of the info-tech decision-makers interviewed would describe their company\u2019s mobile strategy as \u201cstrategic and aligned with business goals.\u201d Results from the same self-assessment conducted in emerging markets were markedly more positive.  How China, India and Mexico managed to leapfrog the United States and much of the developed world in folding mobility into daily operations comes down to a lack of landline connections in those countries.  As mobile carriers came online, consumers in emerging markets quickly bought up cell phones. For burgeoning local companies, this made possible a different kind of communications ecosystem, unburdened by the need to transition from wired to wireless.  Thus companies in emerging markets can avoid much of the costs of cabling and connecting phone and data networks. Indeed, they also often count on employees to supply their own gear, embracing bring-your-own-device \u2014 or BYOD \u2014 programs rather than restraining workers\u2019 use of their personal technology.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t have to deal with legacy, it makes your life significantly easier,\u201d said Bob O\u2019Donnell, founder and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research. \u201cIt\u2019s the legacy problem that complicates all of these transitions.\u201d  Companies in Latin America and Asia, for example, appear to be spending a relative pittance on device hardware, as executives in those countries reported having the fewest company-owned smartphones, tablets and computers.  While U.S. firms recognize the bottom-line benefits of these BYOD strategies, they remain wary because of security threats. A liberal BYOD policy can, after all, put an organization at higher risk if data becomes easier to access by hackers.  Focusing too much on BYOD may also detract from other aspects of mobility. Companies that can successfully develop and publish custom mobile apps, for instance, will have a greater chance of extending the capabilities of everyday business software, opening up anytime, anyplace access.  Among BYOD and mobile leaders \u2014 and laggards \u2014 security looms as a persistent worry. Executives who are attempting to think more strategically about how they use mobile devices face a series of challenges, the index shows.  \u201cSecurity and fear of a data breach\u201d was identified by 44 percent of executives worldwide as a barrier to expanding mobile programs \u2014 more than any other factor. Half said they weren\u2019t even comfortable with the safeguards their companies take to protect what\u2019s already in place.  A top concern? Deterring employees from putting company security at risk, particularly via mobile devices. At least 25 percent of respondents cited these compliance priorities:  O\u2019Donnell said that while most companies will readily admit how much they fear a data breach, many are not investing the time and effort needed to prevent one from happening. The use of biometrics in mobile authentication, for instance, is long overdue, he said.  \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a lot more about fingerprints, iris scans and all these kinds of sci-fi solutions. They\u2019re starting to become real,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s 2014, and we\u2019re still using passwords. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d  Companies that can effectively manage BYOD and mobile security will lift their odds of realizing bigger benefits from the technology. While survey respondents reported near-term gains in the form of improved efficiency and productivity, there\u2019s little doubt that these solutions will also help in the long term, by increasing sales and creating business opportunities.  But for now, the potential is still greater than the reality. Dell\u2019s GTAI index shows that just 14 percent of companies have so far been able to boost their bottom lines in this way.  Bullish market forecasts suggest the big data revolution is well underway. Spending on big data will surge by 27 percent per year, to $32.4 billion, through 2017, according to market analyst IDC. Yet in many corners, using analytics to mine deep veins of raw data into prognostic insights remains an aspiration.  The most recent figures, gathered by Dell in its inaugural Global Technology Adoption Index, show that immense stores of digital information are going untouched at midsize companies. These firms, which employ between 100 and 5,000 workers, are just now figuring out how to extract meaning from the information.  The survey found that while 61 percent of respondents have big data that could be analyzed, less than two-fifths actually understand the potential benefits sufficiently to do so. Others said they don\u2019t believe their companies have anything to gain by investing in the technology. This is especially the case in health care and local government, the index found.  A senior manager working in the U.S. utilities industry told Dell interviewers that his company recognized big data\u2019s promise, but remained \u201cvery ignorant,\u201d explaining that they were in the \u201cinfancy of researching the big data wave.\u201d  Security and cost remain barriers, as well. As the two biggest obstacles, respondents point to the difficulty of obtaining adequate funding to invest in systems able to process the information, as well as the challenge of securing these deep pools of information.  Some midsize firms are inching closer to adoption, however. Latecomers to digital record keeping, they are just now taking stock of their new, searchable archives and investigating whether there may be more to reap from all the information they\u2019ve collected.  New lower-cost tools are helping. For instance, Hadoop \u2014 an open-source software that can process big batches of data using clusters of ordinary servers \u2014 has made analytics a possibility for firms that could not justify spending huge sums on proprietary systems.  \u201cI see true adoption on the horizon,\u201d said Joanna Schloss, business intelligence and analytics evangelist at Dell Software. \u201cToday, [businesses] are really looking at, \u2018What are we going to do with a Hadoop strategy?\u2019 People are embracing it in earnest.\u201d  Vipshop, an online discount retailer in China, uses Hadoop to analyze data that spans more than 3,000 servers in four data centers, said WenYong Yang, the company\u2019s senior director of operations. By studying transactional data, Vipshop looks for ways it can increase sales and improve the customer experience.  Technology that tracks what happens to the data has eased concerns about a breach, Yang said. \u201cWe know who\u2019s touching the data,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are monitoring every operation. We know exactly who\u2019s doing what.\u201d  Uncertainty over big data is commonplace in most of the world \u2014 everywhere, that is, but China. The index shows that while 41 percent of mid-size companies globally understand big data and are pursuing it, 68 percent of Chinese companies report they are doing so.  While the index didn\u2019t set out to measure in a controlled way which countries were more advanced in big data capabilities, it did take a snapshot of the world\u2019s attitudes on the topic. The takeaway is that companies in China are by far the most optimistic, followed by India and Canada. The U.S. ranked in the middle with 36 percent of respondents saying that their companies are pursuing big data.  Companies chasing big data dreams need strong chief executives who are willing to push info-tech staff to mine the data to answer complex questions about future business, Judith Hurwitz, president and CEO of the tech consultancy Hurwitz & Associates said. To do so, she emphasized, forceful leadership from the top is vital.  Companies also should run security software that controls who can access and change data to protect private information, Hurwitz added. \u201cThe problem, of course, is that the bad actors are not standing still waiting for you to figure it all out,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re always on the move.\u201d CreditsProduced by T Brand Studio.

{"Headline": " The Downside of Eating Too Locally ", "Date": "2014-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 TO appreciate the depth of our national political divide, look no further than our Thanksgiving tables. The organic turkeys and farmers\u2019 market produce of coastal urbanites face off against the frozen Butterballs and rich gravies of our rural interior, each side equally contemptuous of the other. Or so it might seem.But as climate change begins to take its toll on farm country, this geopolitics of \u201calternative\u201d and \u201ctraditional\u201d food is changing. These days, the call to change our food system is coming straight from the heart of red-state America.I realized this when I went home to Montana to research a book about Timeless Seeds, an organic lentil and heritage grain business that weathered the devastating drought 0f 2012. I interviewed people like Jerry Habets, a barley grower in Conrad, Mont. Three dry years at the turn of the millennium left him desperately searching for answers. Bankrupt, divorced and about to lose his family\u2019s 87-year-old homestead, Mr. Habets tried the Bible. Then he went to a psychic. And then he went organic. That improved his soil so it could store more water. Tuna McAlpine, a rancher down the road in Valier, made the same decision 10 years earlier, when he stopped using chemicals and converted to a grass-fed livestock system. A libertarian who is concerned that the Republican Party has gotten too soft on guns, he doesn\u2019t want anybody infringing on his constitutional rights. Not the government \u2014 and not Monsanto. \u201cI\u2019m a stubborn Scotsman,\u201d he explains. Mr. Habets and Mr. McAlpine are part of a powerful rising tide of the movement to change our nation\u2019s system of growing food: family farmers in the heartland who are determined to get out of the commodity trap. Central Montana is not the type of place you might expect sustainable food to blossom. It\u2019s heavily Republican. It\u2019s hundreds of miles from the closest major metropolitan area. Frequent droughts and early impacts of climate change make it a tough place to farm, and struggling rural economies make it a tough place to earn a living. And yet, if you look closer, there\u2019s a host of reasons sustainable food has taken root here in central Montana. Many farmers are the third or fourth generation on their land, and they\u2019d like to leave it in good shape for their kids. Having grappled with the industrial agriculture model for decades, they understand its problems better than most of us. Indeed, their communities have been fighting corporate power since their grandparents formed cooperative wheat pools back in the 1920s. For the food movement to have a serious impact on the issues that matter \u2014 climate change, the average American diet, rural development \u2014 these heartland communities need to be involved. The good news is, in several pockets of farm country, they already are.There are dozens of efforts happening across the farm belt, from the antibiotic-free Ozark Mountain Pork Cooperative in Missouri to David Brandt\u2019s soil-building cover crops in Carroll, Ohio. But just as these rural efforts started gaining steam, an unfortunate thing happened to the urban food movement: It went local. Hyperlocal. Ironically, conscientious consumers who ought to be the staunchest allies of these farmers are taking pledges not to buy from them, and to eat only food produced within 100 miles of home. By all means, we should continue developing local food systems \u2014 in both urban and rural areas. But we also need to build strategic partnerships between affluent urban consumers and rural producers in environmentally sensitive, low-income areas. We\u2019re used to this fair-trade paradigm for tropical commodities like bananas and coffee. It\u2019s time to apply it to rural America, too. Even if you live hundreds of miles away from Montana, eating organic lentils grown there helps farmers responsibly steward their land. Eating food that is grown responsibly \u2014 no matter where it is grown \u2014 is a smart strategy for combating climate change. Transportation to the final point of sale accounts for only about 4 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the average American diet. The bigger problem is the way we produce that food, particularly the fossil-fuel-intensive manufacture of nitrogen fertilizer. Since lentils can pull nitrogen from the air and work with bacteria to convert it into fertilizer, organic farmers rotate lentils and other legumes into their fields, planting them between cycles of other crops, as a substitute for industrially produced nitrogen. The next step in overhauling our food system is large-scale change in the American heartland. Farmers like Mr. Habets and Mr. McAlpine are up to it. We should all support them.Liz Carlisle, a doctoral candidate in geography at the University of California, Berkeley, is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cLentil Underground.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Among Harvard Graduates, Women Fall Short of Their Work Expectations", "Date": "2014-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewWomen are not equally represented at the top of corporate America because of the basic facts of motherhood: Even the most ambitious women scale back at work to spend more time on child care. At least, that is the conventional wisdom.But it is not necessarily true for many women, according to a new study of Harvard Business School alumni. Instead, it found, women in business overwhelmingly want high-achieving careers even after they start families. The problem is mismatched expectations between what they hope to achieve in their careers and family lives and what actually happens, both at work and at home.Men generally expect that their careers will take precedence over their spouses\u2019 careers and that their spouses will handle more of the child care, the study found \u2014 and for the most part, men\u2019s expectations are exceeded. Women, meanwhile, expect that their careers will be as important as their spouses\u2019 and that they will share child care equally \u2014 but, in general, neither happens. This pattern appears to be nearly as strong among Harvard graduates still in their 20s as it is for earlier generations.So even though career-oriented women don\u2019t see their roles as different from men\u2019s, other factors \u2014 like public policy, workplace norms and men\u2019s expectations \u2014 are stuck in a previous era, when the lives of women and men looked very different.Nearly 7,000 alumni answered survey questions about career and life goals, and researchers weighted their answers to reflect their representation in the overall population. Male and female graduates had indistinguishable goals; they said they wanted meaningful, satisfying work and opportunities for career growth, as well as fulfilling personal lives.Yet among those working full time, men were significantly more likely than women to have direct profit-and-loss and personnel management responsibility. Fifty-seven percent of men were in senior management positions, compared with 41 percent of women, and fewer women than men said they were satisfied with their careers.The data show that their diverging paths are explained in part by discordant expectations in marriages. (The researchers didn\u2019t have data on sexual orientation and assumed opposite-sex partnerships.)About 60 percent of male graduates who were 32 to 67 years old expected that their careers would take priority over their wives\u2019, and nearly three-quarters of the men said that turned out to be true. About 80 percent expected their spouses to do most of the child care, and that happened for 86 percent of them.Among women in that age group, however, only 17 to 25 percent expected their husbands\u2019 careers to take precedence, but they did so 40 percent of the time. Half of the women expected to handle a majority of child care, but nearly three-quarters said they ended up doing so.Graduates ages 26 to 31 appeared to be on track to end up in similar disagreement, the study said. Only one-quarter of the women said they expected their partners\u2019 careers to be more important than theirs, yet half the men said their careers would be more important. Forty-two percent of women expected to handle a majority of the child care, yet two-thirds of men expected that their wives would.Only 11 percent of the women left the work force to care for children. When the study controlled for family-friendly career moves, like declining a promotion, they found that none explained women\u2019s underrepresentation in senior management. \u201cIn fact, many senior managers had made such moves. \u201cA lot of people will say companies are going to favor people who work harder,\u201d Ms. Ely said. \u201cBut people targeted as high potential are given more slack and allowed more flexibility because companies want to keep them.\u201dThe findings of the Harvard study rang true to Christina LaMontagne, 33, an executive at NerdWallet, a personal finance start-up in San Francisco, who graduated five years ago. \u201cThat\u2019s what I perceived from my male colleagues at H.B.S.,\u201d she said. \u201cMen still expect to have the dominant career, women increasingly expect to have a dominant career and there\u2019s a bit of a gulf there that isn\u2019t reconciling.\u201dShe says it helps that she and her husband, who works in private equity, \u201care on the same page.\u201d She said that she was upfront about her career goals, and that she and her husband \u201cactively manage\u201d the balancing of their jobs and child care. \u201cI met my spouse at Harvard Business School, so he knew what he was getting into,\u201d she said.Not all business-school marriages are as equitable. The Booth study found that female graduates who had children and high-earning husbands worked fewer hours and were less likely to work at all than those with lower-earning spouses.The economists said that was not only because their husbands made enough money to support the family, but also because families required parental time at home. And when someone needs to cut back at work, it tends to be the woman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Election\u2019s Eve, G.O.P. Is Confident, but Voters Are Sour", "Date": "2014-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by20 PhotosWASHINGTON \u2014 The most expensive midterm campaign in American history stumbled into Election Day on Tuesday with voters\u2019 interest at record lows and their divisions deep over what they want their government to do in President Obama\u2019s final two years.Republicans entered the final hours confident they will gain at least six seats and take control of the Senate, but polls showed several races too close to call. Likely runoffs in Georgia and Louisiana, along with late vote counts in Alaska, Colorado and Iowa, will mean Senate control may remain in doubt beyond Tuesday night.The same could be true for governors\u2019 races in Colorado, New Hampshire, Georgia and Florida.The uncertainty about the outcome is a fitting match for the mood of the nation. A slowly but steadily improving economy \u2014 with six months of strong growth, gasoline below $3 a gallon for the first time in four years and substantial deficit reduction \u2014 has not translated into broader optimism. Voters are more inclined toward blame than credit. Instead, they are seemingly worn down by economic struggles and late waves of panic, chiefly about the threats posed by the Islamic State and the possible spread of Ebola.Polls show voter interest in the election substantially lower than four years ago. The real intensity has been generated by the deluge of broadcast television ads \u2014 more than 1.5 million have aired during this election cycle, according to Kantar Media/CMAG, which tracks political advertising.And candidates in both parties have done little to inspire the electorate. Unlike midterms in 1994 and 2006, when the party out of power made strong gains, Republican candidates did not carry a defined platform into this election, nor did they campaign on many policy specifics. Democrats spent months playing down if not denying their support for the president\u2019s agenda.Mostly, both sides trucked in umbrage and outrage. In Iowa on Monday, the Republican Senate hopeful Joni Ernst jumped on the comments of the retiring Democratic senator she hopes to replace, Tom Harkin, who said he did not care \u201cif she\u2019s as good looking as Taylor Swift.\u201d\u201cI am offended,\u201d she said as she barnstormed through Iowa on the last full day of campaigning. \u201cTo be compared to Taylor Swift, I guess that\u2019s O.K., though; I mean she\u2019s a very successful woman. But if my name were John Ernst and I were a guy he wouldn\u2019t be saying those things about me.\u201dFor their part, Democrats in New Hampshire pronounced themselves appalled after the state\u2019s Republican chairwoman, Jennifer Horn, announced in Manchester: \u201cThis is our time, we need to crush it. We need to grab it, run with it, push their heads under over and over again until they cannot breathe anymore, until the elections are over on Tuesday night and we\u2019ve won it all.\u201dIn Kansas, another extremely close race, Greg Orman, an independent, knocked on doors in the Kansas City suburbs just miles from where Senator Pat Roberts, the embattled Republican incumbent, rallied his voters.But the closing day of the campaign was dominated by a debate over whether Mr. Orman had called the state\u2019s venerated former senator, Bob Dole, a clown when he called a Roberts campaign rally featuring the 91-year-old elder statesman and other Republican luminaries \u201ca Washington establishment clown car.\u201dTuesday will be a test between the Democrats\u2019 well-honed voter targeting and turnout machine and a Republican ground game playing catch-up. The NBC-Wall Street Journal poll found that 58 percent of Republicans in late October said they were interested in the campaign, statistically identical to the 57 percent of Democrats.At the same time in advance of the Republican wave in 2010, 70 percent were interested. In 2006, before the Democratic wave, two-thirds of Democrats professed interest, well above today\u2019s level.At a Republican rally at an aircraft hangar near the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, the enthusiasm for the former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate Mitt Romney seemed as loud or louder than for any of the homegrown candidates and dignitaries, including Gov. Sean Parnell and Dan Sullivan, who hopes to oust Senator Mark Begich, a Democrat, on Tuesday.Pat Fleming, 75, a retired medical radiology technologist, held a Dan Sullivan for Senate sign to her chest, but asked about the outlook for Tuesday, she mostly talked about somebody else.\u201cWhatever it takes to get rid of Harry Reid,\u201d she said, referring to the Senate majority leader from Nevada, who is deeply unpopular in Alaska.The appeal of something new is weighing down incumbents from both parties. When Mr. Orman arrived with his wife in a suburb of Kansas City on Monday afternoon, one woman pulled into her driveway, hopped out of her car and walked to Mr. Orman saying, \u201cHey, you\u2019re not Pat Roberts.\u201dFor all the money and nail-biting races this year, the outcome is not likely to result in a drastic change of policy. Mr. Obama will still be in office to defend his health care law and other accomplishments against Republican efforts to reverse them. And Republican leaders in Congress will have to wrestle with political crosscurrents that could affect their ability to confront the president or to work with him.At least three Republicans \u2014 Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida \u2014 are considering runs for their party\u2019s 2016 presidential nomination. They will be tempted to move to the right to appeal to Republican presidential base voters.Mr. Cruz, in an interview with The Washington Post, said this weekend that a Republican-led Senate should hold Mr. Obama accountable for his policies, and argued that his colleagues should aggressively pursue a repeal of the president\u2019s signature health care law.Politically, Democrats are banking on that sort of agenda for their own comeback.\u201cIf Republicans take the Senate and expand their margins in the House, no one in their right mind would believe that Ted Cruz and the Tea Party House Republicans will say, \u2018Now is the time for us to compromise,\u2019 \u201d said Representative Steve Israel of New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cThey\u2019re going to double down.\u201dAt the same time, many more Republicans elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010 but standing for re-election in Democratic or swing states in 2016 will probably want to tack to the center. Freshman Republican senators from New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Illinois, Ohio and Missouri could have very different political imperatives than their counterparts running for the White House.\u201cQuite frankly, going into 2016, the Republicans have to make a decision whether they\u2019re in control or not in control,\u201d Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in an interview with CNN on Monday. \u201cAre they going to begin to allow things to happen? Or are they going to continue to be obstructionists? And I think they\u2019re going to choose to get things done.\u201dDemocrats will face their own soul-searching after controlling a Senate that for two years has defined dysfunction.\u201cThe moderate and middle of the Democratic Party has really been challenged\u201d by this campaign, said Senator Joe Manchin III, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia.Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about the final hours of campaigning for the midterm elections referred incorrectly to the 1.5 million television advertisements aired during the midterm election cycle. The number includes all broadcast television advertisements, including those by candidates \u2014 not just advertisements by outside groups.Reporting was contributed by Kirk Johnson from Alaska, Nick Corasaniti from Iowa, Katharine Q.

{"Headline": "Rock Bottom Economics", "Date": "2014-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis may all sound wild and radical, but it isn\u2019t. In fact, it\u2019s what mainstream economic analysis says will happen once interest rates hit zero. And it\u2019s also what history tells us. If you paid attention to the lessons of post-bubble Japan, or for that matter the U.S. economy in the 1930s, you were more or less ready for the looking-glass world of economic policy we\u2019ve lived in since 2008.But as I said, nobody would believe it. By and large, policy makers and Very Serious People in general went with gut feelings rather than careful economic analysis. Yes, they sometimes found credentialed economists to back their positions, but they used these economists the way a drunkard uses a lamppost: for support, not for illumination. And what the guts of these serious people have told them, year after year, is to fear \u2014 and do \u2014 exactly the wrong things.Thus we were told again and again that budget deficits were our most pressing economic problem, that interest rates would soar any day now unless we imposed harsh fiscal austerity. I could have told you that this was foolish, and in fact I did, and sure enough, the predicted interest rate spike never happened \u2014 but demands that we cut government spending now, now, now have cost millions of jobs and deeply damaged our infrastructure.But are these bad calls just water under the bridge? Isn\u2019t the era of rock-bottom economics just about over? Don\u2019t count on it.It\u2019s true that with the U.S. unemployment rate dropping, most analysts expect the Fed to raise interest rates sometime next year. But inflation is low, wages are weak, and the Fed seems to realize that raising rates too soon would be disastrous. Meanwhile, Europe looks further than ever from economic liftoff, while Japan is still struggling to escape from deflation. Oh, and China, which is starting to remind some of us of Japan in the late 1980s, could join the rock-bottom club sooner than you think.This bodes ill for the future. What people in power don\u2019t know, or worse what they think they know but isn\u2019t so, can very definitely hurt us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Shifting Ebola Epidemic", "Date": "2014-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialRecent gains in controlling the Ebola epidemic in West Africa have been encouraging, but they offer no reason for complacency. In Liberia, the hardest-hit country, the rate of new infections has declined in some areas, and several treatment units have been reporting empty beds for more than a month. But in adjacent Sierra Leone the number of new cases has shot upward, while in Guinea, where the epidemic started, the incidence of new cases appears to have stabilized over all, with growth in some districts and declines in others. All told, Ebola has infected more than 14,000 people in West Africa and killed more than 5,000 of them.Alarmingly, the virus has twice been carried from Guinea into previously unaffected Mali. This is the kind of spread that experts have warned could lead to a widening epidemic throughout Africa unless it is tamped down quickly. An infected 2-year-old girl from Guinea died in Mali but does not seem to have spread the virus to others. An infected imam from Guinea died of Ebola in Mali, as have two others, including a nurse who treated him. Hundreds of others may have been infected at a ritual washing ceremony of the imam\u2019s body or through other contact.Given the changing shape of the epidemic, United Nations and American officials are considering a more nimble response that would deploy smaller, more geographically dispersed treatment centers, rather than complete all of the large treatment units that were planned. Some nonprofit groups recommend sending rapid-response teams by helicopter to remote villages. As the outbreak moves, international assistance must keep up with shifting needs. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "East-West Meets Far North", "Date": "2014-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn geopolitical terms, one can see incredible things here. Huge fishing vessels with Cyrillic nameplates unload tons of king crab and cod at Kirkenes harbor, destined for the European market. Farther down the road, at the shopping mall \u2014 labeled in Cyrillic \u2014 Russian families from across the border come to purchase yogurt, cheese, winter coats and perfumes. We are talking about, please note, NATO territory.This isn\u2019t just a result of a natural, free local economy; after the breakdown of the Soviet Union, people in the Arctic built an astonishingly well-functioning, cross-border neighborhood here. Fishing takes place on the basis of a bilateral quota system. Thanks to a regional trade deal, Russian customers bound for Kirkenes don\u2019t need visas. As a result, more than half of the buyers in Kirkenes\u2019s supermarkets, salespersons say, are Russians, boosting the economy of this 10,000-person town several times over. The latest and most promising common endeavor involves talks over the mutual exploitation of the oil and gas fields in the Barents Sea.It\u2019s no wonder, then, that the Norwegians above the Arctic Circle are particularly nervous about the prospect of a new Cold War. Is there no way out? they ask. Many here argue that Mr. Putin is never going to give back Crimea to Ukraine anyway \u2014 so why should we maintain sanctions that will not only cripple Russia\u2019s economy, but ours, too? It\u2019s a question that has already started to travel farther south across Europe.In an office overlooking the snowy hills surrounding Kirkenes Fjord, Arve Henriksen fears that the work of decades is at stake \u2014 all because of a quarrel in a faraway country. The 47-year-old self-made man started his career in 1991 with a simple but rewarding idea: delivering ice cream to neighboring Russian towns. Today, Mr. Henriksen owns a shipping agency that provides equipment and management for all kind of vessels calling at Kirkenes.Russian trawlers are some of Mr. Henriksen\u2019s best clients. So why does foreign policy have to destroy such a fantastic local success story? he asked. \u201cWe will be hit,\u201d he said, nodding toward one of the town\u2019s newly built piers. Recently, oil and drilling companies have become one of Mr. Henriksen\u2019s biggest partners, but high-tech parts for this industry are now prohibited as exports, according to the European sanctions regime. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cso many politicians have come up here and applauded this very special region. But they don\u2019t take into consideration what their big politics mean for us.\u201dThe bigger question is: If the local people in this region can cooperate, who is responsible for the idea that Russia and Europe can\u2019t create win-win situations in other border regions, like Ukraine, Georgia or Moldova?The journey from Kirkenes to the Russian port city of Murmansk takes three hours, but politically, the distance feels like three decades. Once the traveler leaves the \u201cLilyhammer\u201d land of colored wooden houses, crossing the border checkpoint to the east, he finds himself in one of the world\u2019s biggest nuclear gun rooms. The Kola Peninsula is home to the most important units of Russia\u2019s Northern Fleet, among them nuclear submarines and Tupolev strategic bombers. It is a vast landscape of frozen lakes, hoarfrosted birches and a massive double fence, topped with barbed wire and modern surveillance cameras, running along the demarcation line for miles. The towns we pass en route are mostly army barracks \u2014 or look like them. Soldiers with fur hats trot down the streets in companies.It was from this spot of land, NATO reported, that six long-range bombers took off in the past weeks to fly along the Norwegian coast and on toward Portugal. Tensions soared; NATO jets scrambled.Ah, that\u2019s nothing to worry about, said Olga Buch over a hot cup of tea in her office in Murmansk. The \u201cgeopolitical situation,\u201d she believes, is only temporary. Ms. Buch needs to remain optimistic, for job reasons. She is director general of Murmanshelf, an association aimed at enhancing the exploration of oil and gas fields in the Barents Sea, an endeavor for which Moscow needs partners. Russia has the resources, the Norwegians have the know-how.Ms. Buch says there is no way the sanctions the European Union has imposed against Russia \u2014 or Moscow\u2019s countermeasures \u2014 will hurt the trust of and cooperation with their Norwegian neighbors. But that seems like wishful thinking. I also tried to meet political representatives from Mr. Putin\u2019s United Russia party, but they declined to be interviewed.One Western businessman in Murmansk told me that what really worried him was how Mr. Putin\u2019s new efforts at self-assertion appear to have trickled down to many citizens here. Politics can change people, he warned, and said there clearly was a growing anti-Western climate. He said it would take the pen stroke of just one bureaucrat with a neo-nationalistic mind-set to chase him and his company out of the country.The hard truth for the people of Finnmark is that the future of their little wonderland does not lie in the hands of European politicians; it is up to Mr. Putin. The West will not and should not back down from the sanctions as long as Mr. Putin violates international law. The reason both sides suffer is that the Kremlin pursues a you-lose-I-win-philosophy instead of enhancing win-win situations, whether in Kiev or Kirkenes.Perhaps the Russian president should come and see this friendly place. After my visit I recalled the famous words of Ernst Reuter, one of the first mayors of postwar Berlin. In 1948, as the Soviets tightened their blockade around the city, he urged the world: \u201cSchaut auf diese Stadt!\u201d \u2014 \u201cLook at this city!\u201d Before you plan your next step, Mr. Putin, look to Kirkenes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hong Kong Moves to Refashion Itself as a Global Hub of Creativity", "Date": "2014-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 When Candace Campos moved from the United States to Hong Kong six years ago, she encountered few hurdles to opening her own interior design company.She started small, transforming her 750-square-foot home from a gutted commercial rental into a bright living space styled like a New York loft. Word of mouth led to a 2008 cover piece featuring her apartment in the Hong Kong magazine Home Journal and to interest from expatriates who wanted to bring Western aesthetics into their Hong Kong homes.\u201cThe idea of leaving pipes exposed, beams and columns raw, and floors as concrete was not a design aesthetic found in Hong Kong,\u201d said Ms. Campos, 34. \u201cSo it was easy to stand apart from other designers.\u201dThe initiatives are starting to pay off. The contribution of the creative industries to the territory\u2019s gross domestic product increased to 4.9 percent in 2012 from 3.9 percent in 2007, according to the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department \u2014 about 97.8 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $12.6 billion. The number of people employed in those fields also increased by 20,000 from 2007 to 2012, to 200,370.Mr. Chu, who is also the chairman of PMQ, said its mission was to \u201craise the creative appreciation of the public.\u201d His foundation, the Musketeers Education and Culture Charitable Foundation, donated 100 million Hong Kong dollars to the project.He said it was time for a broader change in Hong Kong. \u201cIn the future, why couldn\u2019t it be \u2018Designed in Hong Kong and manufactured in China\u2019?\u201d Mr. Chu said.But executives in creative fields say that although the local talent pool may be deepening, customers\u2019 views on creative work can remain stuck in the past.Early on, she noticed that clients did not want to bother with identifying their brand\u2019s core values, instead preferring to jump on flashy marketing trends.\u201cWith the thriving business economy in Hong Kong, finding prospective clients has never been a problem,\u201d she said. The challenge can be convincing those prospects that \u201cit\u2019s better to invest in the brand rather than a short-term campaign.\u201d\u201cLocal businesses will pay for a quick fix but not a long-term strategy with the right tactics, because they presume the strategic-planning work is out of their budget,\u201d she added.The American university based in Savannah, Ga., opened its Hong Kong campus, housed in the former North Kowloon Magistracy building, in 2010. Mr. Dickensheets said it had seen increasing interest from local students since the beginning. Enrollment increased to 600 in the this year\u2019s incoming class from 141 in 2010.\u201cFor Hong Kong parents, they want their children to have an American education without leaving,\u201d he said.When Lucia Ho, 21, applied to the college, \u201cmy parents didn\u2019t like it at first,\u201d she said, but not for the obvious reasons. It was not because she wanted to study art, but because it was an international school.Student work as varied as furniture pieces and framed prints lines the corridors of the college. In one classroom, design concepts that have been presented to local companies like Cathay Pacific Airways and HSBC are on display.The 2007 report says a creative, collaborative philosophy is sometimes lacking in Hong Kong\u2019s educational system, and the university is trying to embrace those attributes. In-class critiques, for instance, enable students \u201cto better adapt the work in the real world,\u201d Ms. Ho said. If people reject her ideas, she said, \u201cI won\u2019t feel bad, because every idea is helpful.\u201dAs more people like her find work in the nascent creative industries, they will begin to change the general perception of such work in Hong Kong, Mr. Dickensheets said.The long-term goal for Hong Kong, he said, is to create a culture in which \u201cthe designer can be valued as much as a banker.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama to Introduce Sweeping New Controls Aimed at Ozone", "Date": "2014-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEnvironmentalists and public health advocates have praised the E.P.A. rules as a powerful environmental legacy. Republicans, manufacturers and the fossil fuel industry have sharply criticized them as an example of costly government overreach.The proposed regulation would lower the current threshold for ozone pollution from 75 parts per billion to a range of 65 to 70 parts per billion, according to people familiar with the plan. That range is less stringent than the standard of 60 parts per billion sought by environmental groups, but the E.P.A. proposal would also seek public comment on a 60 parts-per-billion plan, keeping open the possibility that the final rule could be stricter.Public health groups have lobbied the government for years to reduce ozone and said the regulation was one of the most important health decisions Mr. Obama could make in his second term.\u201cOzone is the most pervasive and widespread pollutant in the country,\u201d said Paul Billings, a senior vice president of the American Lung Association. William Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, said, \u201cOzone is not only killing people, but causing tens of millions of people to get sick every day.\u201dBut industry groups say that the regulation would impose unwieldy burdens on the economy, with little public health benefit.The proposed ozone rule comes as the longstanding battle over Mr. Obama\u2019s use of the Clean Air Act to push his environmental agenda is erupting in Congress and the courts. The ozone rules are expected to force the owners of power plants and factories to install expensive technology to clean the pollutants from their smokestacks.Next year, the E.P.A. is expected to make final two more historic Clean Air Act rules aimed at cutting planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. Those rules, which are intended to curb pollutants that contribute to climate change, could lead to the shutdown of hundreds of power plants and freeze construction of future coal plants.The Republican-majority Congress, to be led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the incoming majority leader, has vowed to block or overturn the entire group of rules. In a separate development, the Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to take up a challenge led by industry groups against another E.P.A. rule intended to curb emissions of mercury from coal plants.\u201cWe\u2019re facing a series of regulations, and the cumulative cost of compliance and the burden of permitting is significant,\u201d said Cal Dooley, president of the American Chemistry Council, a group which has lobbied aggressively against the rules. \u201cAn industry such as ours is poised to make significant investments in growth, but these regulations make that harder.\u201dThe standard for ozone was last set in 2008 by the Bush administration at a level of 75 parts per billion, above the range of 60 to 70 parts per billion recommended by the E.P.A.'s scientific advisory panel at the time, although never enacted. Environmental and public health groups challenged the Bush standard in court, saying it would endanger human health and had been tainted by political interference. Smog levels have declined sharply over the last 40 years, but each incremental improvement comes at a significant cost to business and government.The E.P.A. had planned to release the new ozone rule in August of 2011, but as Republicans and powerful industry groups prepared to go on attack against the plan, Mr. Obama decided to delay its release, fearing that opposition to the regulation would hurt his re-election chances in 2012.At the time, Mr. Obama said the regulation would impose too severe a burden on industry and local governments at a time of economic distress.Environmental advocates, who took the delay as a setback, then sued the Obama administration, and earlier this year a federal judge ordered the E.P.A. to release the rule by Dec. 1.An earlier version of this article reported incorrectly the ozone pollution thresholds. They are measured in parts per billion, not parts per million.An earlier version of this article and its headline misstated the nature of the ozone that the regulation is intended to reduce. It is a smog-causing pollutant created by emissions from factories and coal plants; ozone itself is not emitted.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Defying Expectations, Japan\u2019s Economy Falls Into Recession", "Date": "2014-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe second consecutive quarterly decline in gross domestic product could upend Japan\u2019s political landscape. Mr. Abe is considering dissolving Parliament and calling fresh elections, people close to him say, and Monday\u2019s economic report is seen as critical to his decision, which is widely expected to come this week.\u201cUnfortunately, the numbers were not good,\u201d Mr. Abe said in a speech at an event hosted by the Komeito party, the coalition partner of his governing Liberal Democratic Party. \"Now that we\u2019ve finally grasped the chance to escape from our long deflation, we cannot let it get away.\u201dRising sales taxes have been blamed for triggering the downturn by deterring consumer spending, and with Japan having now slipped into a technical recession, the chances that Mr. Abe will seek a new mandate from voters to alter the government\u2019s tax program appear to have increased significantly.The preliminary economic report, issued by the Cabinet Office, showed that gross domestic product fell at an annualized pace of 1.6 percent in the quarter through September. That added to the previous quarter\u2019s much larger decline, which the government now puts at 7.3 percent, a slightly worse figure than in its last estimate of 7.1 percent.The surprise recession underscores the difficulties faced by Mr. Abe, who won power two years ago on a pledge to reinvigorate the economy and end his country\u2019s long streak of wage and consumer-price declines. His agenda, dubbed Abenomics, has focused largely on stimulus measures, in particular an expanded program of asset purchases by the central bank. Yet its impact, economists say, has been dulled by the tax increase, which was approved under a previous government.The tax plan was intended to curb Japan\u2019s immense government debt, which at about two and a half years\u2019 national economic output is the largest in the developed world. But there are concerns that after years of sluggish wage growth, consumer confidence is still too weak to handle the increase. Instead of solving the debt problem, heavier taxes could simply push the economy back into a downward slide.\u201cRaising the consumption tax is supposed to increase government revenues, but if we fall back into deflation it will all be for nothing,\u201d Mr. Abe said at a meeting of Group of 20 leaders in Brisbane, Australia, on Sunday.Akira Amari, Mr. Abe\u2019s economy minister, said after the economic report on Monday that rising taxes were having \u201ca larger impact than expected, given that Japan\u2019s deflationary mind-set has not yet been cleared away.\u201dThe still half-completed sales-tax increase, a heated political issue in Japan, has also become a target of concern for leaders in the United States. Last week Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew urged Japanese and European policy makers to do more to stimulate their economies.\u201cIf things are really bad in Europe and Japan, if there\u2019s a real slowdown in China, that\u2019s a headwind in the United States that we don\u2019t need,\u201d Mr. Lew said.Japan\u2019s economy was already clearly struggling to shake off the effects of the first stage in the planned two-step tax increase, which was implemented in April. After the sharp slowdown in the second quarter, institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of Japan, cut their estimates for economic growth this year and next. The central bank, its goal of reaching 2 percent stable inflation looking increasingly out of reach, was prompted late last month to expand its bond-buying program further.Even so, the data reported on Monday confounded analysts\u2019 forecasts, which were mostly more optimistic. Economists surveyed by news agencies and research groups had been forecasting annual growth of slightly more than 2 percent on average. The report showed weakness in many important areas of the economy. Consumer spending barely picked up from its depressed level after the first tax increase in April, while indicators of housing and business investment declined.Companies also reduced inventories of finished goods more aggressively than anticipated. That hurt growth but could help the economy rebound later on, since businesses would have to produce more to meet any increase in demand.The Nikkei 225 stock average fell about 3 percent and the yen weakened against the dollar. European markets were trading slightly higher in their early afternoon on Monday.Although the second part of the tax increase would not be carried out until October, Mr. Abe needs to decide what to do about it soon, to give Parliament time to change legislation if he opts to cancel or postpone it. If fully enacted, the plan would increase the tax on all goods and services sold in the country to 10 percent over 18 months. It now stands at 8 percent after the first increase in April.Mr. Abe has not said how much the economy would have needed to grow to give him the confidence to raise taxes again, but one of his economic advisers, Etsuro Honda, has argued that the minimum number needed to be close to 4 percent \u2014 higher even than the forecasts and far better than the surprising negative result.Abenomics is now in a particularly delicate phase. Consumer prices are rising, if not yet as strongly as hoped, as are corporate profits and the value of assets like stocks and property. But so far not much of the new wealth has reached average workers. Incomes have fallen behind the rising cost of living, in effect making people poorer. Another of Mr. Abe\u2019s advisers, Kozo Yamamoto, a veteran lawmaker in the Liberal Democratic Party, says the second tax increase needs to be put off \u201cuntil wages catch up\u201d to prices.Mr. Abe and his inner circle appear to have interpreted the economy\u2019s struggles as signaling the need for an even bolder, purer stimulus program. Instead of encouraging economic activity through central bank money printing, on the one hand, while constraining it with higher consumer taxes on the other, he seems poised to twist the policy dial fully toward stimulus.Many of his critics, however, would like to see him act more assertively in other areas, like loosening business regulations, that they think will have more lasting benefits for the economy.\u201cThe numbers are much worse than expected,\u201d Yukio Edano, secretary general of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan, said. \u201cThe boom and bust in demand around the consumption tax hike show the limits of Abenomics.\u201dMr. Abe does not technically need to call an election to modify the tax plan, because his party is in firm control of both houses of the national legislature, the Diet. Even the existing tax legislation gives him some scope for review if he judges that the economy is struggling, and with a parliamentary majority, the Liberal Democratic Party and Komeito could rewrite the law as they wanted.Experts said Mr. Abe might wish to seek a broader mandate for such a controversial issue, however.\u201cThe cabinet will rationally dissolve the Lower House with an aim to seek the public support for the postponement,\u201d analysts at Credit Suisse wrote in a note to clients. \u201cP.M. Abe may decide on dissolving the Lower House by the end of this week.\u201d The Yomiuri newspaper said an announcement could come on Tuesday.Parliament\u2019s current term lasts until mid-2016, making any election a year and a half sooner than legally necessary.

But they say they know they have to deliver or face a backlash in 2016.\u201cI think it really becomes important to appear to want to be a governing party rather than a complaining party,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the party leadership. \u201cMy belief is we have about six months before the American people check that box one way or the other.\u201dThe Republicans took control of the Senate on Tuesday, picking up at least seven seats, and expanded their majority in the House. Their victory in the Senate was significant but not the largest historically \u2014 though it could rank among the top five election year swings since 1946.Anticipating for months that they would take the Senate and pad their majority in the House, Republicans have been quietly discussing their agenda and approach after regularly accusing Democrats, led by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, of thwarting their priorities.They say they will focus on balancing the budget, restoring an orderly process for spending bills, revising if not repealing the health care law and enacting a major overhaul of the tax code \u2014 ambitious goals, given years of stalemate and discord.Before taking up the issue of immigration, Republicans are likely to see what unilateral action President Obama undertakes, and how the country reacts to it.Senate Republicans also intend to use their control of committees to bring new scrutiny to the White House, federal agencies and Mr. Obama\u2019s expanding use of executive authority. Mr. McConnell, who will succeed Mr. Reid as majority leader when the new Congress convenes in January, has also promised wholesale changes in the way the Senate operates, including a five-day workweek, more floor debate and empowered committee chairmen.Republicans say they intend to force Mr. Obama to make choices on bills passed by the House that Senate Democrats have been able to keep from his desk, potentially touching off the president\u2019s first extensive use of the veto after six years in office.Some Democrats who have been frustrated by the stalemate in the Senate say they are open to cooperating with Republicans.\u201cRight now, we are helping destroy each other,\u201d said Senator Joe Manchin III, a centrist Democrat from West Virginia. \u201cI would like to think we can work together. I\u2019d like to get my amendments in debate.\u201dIn gaining control of the Senate, however, Republicans ousted some of the red-state Democrats most inclined to work with them, such as Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, reducing the number of potential Democratic allies.Maps of precinct-level results from some of the closest Senate races.Other tensions may complicate their efforts. Mr. McConnell, with few votes to spare, will have to balance the views of a handful of more moderate Republicans, such as Senator Susan Collins of Maine, with those of unyielding conservatives such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who following the election said Republicans should press their advantage as hard as possible.Mr. McConnell will also have to contend with the competing interests of Mr. Cruz and at least two other Republican senators expected to run for president \u2014 Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida \u2014 and those of senators up for re-election in 2016 in swing states like Illinois, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.As for legislation, the party\u2019s leaders in Congress are eying five major priorities:On a conference call last week, Speaker John A. Boehner assured his members that he was \u201cprepared to move quickly, along with Mitch McConnell, to make clear that the new Congress will be about jobs and the economy,\u201d according to an official familiar with the speaker\u2019s remarks.\u201cI\u2019m talking about bills to green-light construction of the Keystone pipeline and increase exports of American-made liquefied natural gas; to restore the 40-hour workweek for American workers that was undone by Obamacare; to encourage American employers to hire more of our veterans,\u201d Mr. Boehner said, according to the official.Senator Jeff Sessions, the conservative Alabama Republican who will lead the Budget Committee, has had his staff looking at federal spending for months to find places to cut in hopes of proposing a budget that would be balanced in as little as a decade. But despite wide sentiment among Republicans for cuts, a divide exists within the party.Some Republicans would like to reverse a series of Pentagon spending constraints put in place through earlier budget deals with Democrats, arguing that the military is being strained at a time when it is being required to fight the continuing threat of Islamic terrorism in the Middle East. Mr. Sessions has expressed reservations about easing the spending limits on the Pentagon, and doing so would make balancing the budget harder and require even more to be cut from politically sensitive social programs.But reaching a budget deal is also essential to putting in place a set of procedural shortcuts that would allow Republicans to force through changes in the health care law and a tax package on a simple majority vote, avoiding the threat of a Democratic filibuster.If they can enact a budget, Republicans hope to return to reviewing what traditionally have been 12 separate annual spending bills and reinvigorating a process that has all but collapsed by putting the bills on the floor and allowing senators to amend them.In March, for the first time since Mr. Obama took office, Republicans will also have to find a way to pass an increase in the debt limit as the majority party \u2014 a difficult task given that the debt limit has become such a lightning rod for conservatives who object to any increase in federal borrowing power. Mr. McConnell suggested on Wednesday that Republicans would address the debt limit in the budget.The key to a deal will be the Obama administration. Treasury officials have already developed a detailed plan to simplify the corporate tax code and lower the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 35 percent. Republicans want it closer to 25 percent and have repeatedly said any tax overhaul must include reductions in the individual tax rates, which apply to many small businesses. It looms as a difficult negotiation, but it is possible Mr. Obama could take a page from President Ronald Reagan, who worked with Democrats to pass the 1986 Tax Reform Act.For instance, a medical device tax used to pay for the law is opposed by lawmakers from both parties who represent manufacturers, and a repeal of the tax could pass Congress. And another group of Republicans and Democrats has also called for returning the health law\u2019s definition of full-time work to 40 hours from 30, arguing that the lower limit is forcing too many people out of work because of employers\u2019 efforts to comply with the law. Mr. Boehner singled out that measure as one that he would like to see advance.Over all, those on both sides of the aisle agree that the change in Senate control presents a chance to curb the gridlock that has consumed Congress, but it also holds peril for Republicans if they fail to deliver.\u201cThey have a golden opportunity,\u201d Mr. Manchin, the Democratic senator from West Virginia, said. \u201cIf they get that and fail miserably, it is very bleak for them in 2016.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The record shows that the president\u2019s party can rebound from major losses to win at the polls in two years. Bill Clinton, for instance, bounced back from the 1994 Republican landslide to easily win re-election in 1996.Similarly, President Obama, whose party suffered major losses in 2010, went on to defeat Mitt Romney in 2012, and George Bush won the 1988 election after Republicans suffered major losses in 1986, President Reagan\u2019s sixth year in office.From that perspective, party control of Congress is a relatively minor issue for future presidential elections. If the economy is strong, Mrs. Clinton won\u2019t need to distance herself from Mr. Obama \u2013 she\u2019ll be rushing to take credit for the prosperity Democrats have brought to America.

{"Headline": "A Forest Threatened by Keystone XL", "Date": "2014-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCALGARY, AlbertaENVIRONMENTALISTS typically fret about the prospect of adding monstrous new amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere if the Keystone XL pipeline is approved, and for good reason.But for a vast stretch of western Canada\u2019s boreal forest, the fight over extracting bitumen has already been lost. The question is, how much more will we lose?Since the mining frenzy for this garbage crude took off in 2000, nearly two million acres of this ancient forest have been cleared or degraded, according to Global Forest Watch \u2014 a swath more than six times the size of New York City. If Keystone XL and other proposed pipelines are approved and bitumen production grows, much more forest will be lost.The Senate is expected to vote Tuesday on the long-delayed pipeline. The House approved it last Friday. President Obama has signaled that he would probably veto it. But even if he does, with Republicans set to take control of Congress in January and only two years left in the president\u2019s term, no one thinks that would mean the end of Keystone XL.Ground zero in this fight is in western Canada, where the forest hugs the northern flowing Athabasca River. The Athabasca deposit is the largest of three bitumen formations in Canada. This tarry mixture of sand, water, clay and bitumen, which the Cree used to heat up to repair leaky canoes, lies under a northern forest of spruce and aspens roughly the size of Florida.The shallow deposits are scooped up by huge electric shovels and then hauled away in 400-ton-capacity trucks to mills that separate the bitumen from the sand. The waste is then dumped into lakes of polluted sludge. But most of the bitumen lies so deep in the frozen ground that it must be melted with steam and then pumped to the surface for processing. This requires steam injection plants that blast scalding steam into the ground through wells.Where bitumen is near the surface, the landscape is reduced to a treeless wasteland. For the harder-to-extract bitumen, the steam plants require a supporting network of roads, pipelines, power lines, seismic lines and well pads that do their own damage. The natural gas that powers these plants is generated by the hydraulic fracturing of shale-gas formations in British Columbia. One battlefield leads to another.Woodland caribou, shy, lichen-eating animals, are a notable casualty. They avoid cut lines like the plague and won\u2019t cross a logged forest. In recent years their population has declined significantly. They are listed as threatened by the Canadian government.Bitumen mining requires about three barrels of water to produce one barrel of oil. Surface mines take their water from the Athabasca River while the steam plants drain aquifers. All the water comes from the Mackenzie River Basin, which covers one-fifth of Canada. The basin\u2019s freshwater energizes the Beaufort Sea.During bitumen processing the water collects a variety of pollutants and is stored in tailing ponds. Along the Athabasca River, more than a dozen of these enormous waste ponds hold back this industrial excrement. Pollutants in these lakes are leaking into groundwater and the Athabasca River.Last year, the journal Geoscience Canada described the dams as \u201csome of the largest man-made disruptions of the Earth\u2019s surface, easily seen from space (visible using Google Earth), a major hazard for birds, and a continuing concern regarding the potential for leakage into the surface water system.\u201dAir pollution from bitumen mining has blackened winter snows with particulates dozens of miles from the Athabasca mines. Come the spring melt, these pollutants rush into the Athabasca River. A growing ring of mercury contamination surrounds the project.The reclamation of these blown-up forests remains a nightmarish challenge. Nobody really knows how to put a boreal forest back together once it has been stripped of its trees, soil, wetlands and fish-bearing rivers. More than half of these devastated forests contained peat lands. Those landscapes took thousands of years to form. They also fed caribou, stored carbon, recharged groundwater, protected biological diversity and acted as protection against floods.The miners plan to substitute forest lowlands with artificial hills constructed of sand and petroleum coke. The hills will be topped with a salt-tolerant plantation forest. Mining pits filled with toxic waste and topped with freshwater will pass as wetlands. The industry has called this crude terraforming a \u201csustainable landscape that is equal to or better than how we found it.\u201dThe American social critic Lewis Mumford described mining as barbaric to land and soul. By any definition, Keystone XL grants license to an earth-destroying economy.Advertisement"}

The 2.7 did a fine job of pulling the load on the ring road around the stadium, and the turbo may have even helped it get going. The performance difference between it and the 5.3-liter V8-equipped Chevrolet Silverado next to it (which has a higher towing load rating) was almost unnoticeable without looking at numbers, so the real contest will come down to fuel economy. Ford has not released estimates for the new engine.Ford had also set up a short drag racing strip, and the 2.7 performed admirably against even the Chevy with a 6.2-liter V8, which took longer to register that the throttle pedal had been mashed to the floor. Much like the turbocharged 1.4-liter 4-cylinder-equipped Ford Transit Connect, the unloaded 2.7-liter turbo truck took off quickly from a dead standstill. (The Chevrolet 6.2 was still better at roasting its rear tires.)There was also a demonstration of Ford\u2019s improved infotainment system, and the automaker had a creative way of presenting it. A row of pickups was arranged in a semicircle around the presenter, and journalists sat in the trucks, listening to him through the FM radio. As he went through the system\u2019s many menus, my finger accidentally grazed the wrong button on the steering wheel. I was unable to figure out how to get back to the correct mode, so the remainder of his presentation was accompanied by a Spanish-language report about the Vatican on AM radio. So much for technology.The aluminum F-150s are available with new features, including a four-camera system that allows the driver better visibility in the areas blocked from view by the truck\u2019s lofty stance and huge grille. One of the more useful gadgets Ford is offering is a step that\u2019s normally hidden inside the tailgate. With the gate down, the step can be popped out, along with a stafflike handle to aid climbing into the bed without falling. Ford said the interior was larger on the new model, and, when compared visually with its Chevrolet rival, it did indeed seem more spacious inside.Advertisement"}

Global Times is often shrill, but that tone reflects the way President Xi Jinping is tugging his regime in a more nationalistic, assertive and hard-line direction.Then there\u2019s something a bit more personal: China doesn\u2019t seem to want to give me a visa.I\u2019ve been visiting China for more than 30 years and lived in Beijing for five. I speak Mandarin and have been alternately hailed by Chinese authorities and detained by them. But I\u2019ve had cordial relations with the last few foreign ministers, and, until now, I\u2019ve always received visas.Xi has been ruling China for two years now, and he has shown some inclination toward economic and legal reforms. Two years ago, I thought Xi might open things up a bit. Boy, was I wrong! Instead, it increasingly seems that Xi may deepen reforms in some areas but, over all, is a tough-minded nationalist who takes a hard line on multiple fronts so as to challenge nearly everything that Obama stands for:Deng Xiaoping accepted technologies that brought political risks because they would help the economy, but Xi seems willing to sacrifice business convenience for more rigid political control.Xi comes across as cocky and proud that China is now booming and strong, and he has been willing to poke his finger in the American eye. In 2009, he derided \u201cwell-fed foreigners who have nothing better to do than lecture us about our own affairs.\u201dWhen Obama first traveled to Beijing in 2009, his efforts at conciliation were perceived as signs of weakness, and China then overplayed its hand, Washington responded and relations suffered.Chinese officials vociferously denied the report, but the episode is a reminder how much China increasingly matters worldwide, for good or for ill.

Mr. Hickenlooper defeated Republican challenger Bob Beauprez.DENVER \u2014 It was getting late on election night, and Gov. John W. Hickenlooper was trailing. Colorado\u2019s senior United States senator, Mark Udall, had already conceded defeat, and other Democratic politicians were falling here and across the country. Political allies reported encouraging signs \u2014 long lines at college-town polling sites, strong support in Colorado\u2019s suburban counties \u2014 but it was never supposed to be this close for Mr. Hickenlooper, a governor who had cast himself as a moderate, pro-energy Democrat at the helm of a growing Western economy.\u201cI feel nervous at every moment,\u201d Mr. Hickenlooper, watching results roll in, said in a hotel room above Denver\u2019s newly refurbished Union Station, his tie loosening with each passing hour. \u201cI feel nervous at every moment.\u201d By Wednesday morning, thousands of late votes from the Democratic bastions of Denver and Boulder had reversed the gap, giving Mr. Hickenlooper a narrow win that defied a wave of Republican victories in races for governor in usual Democratic strongholds like Maryland, Massachusetts and Illinois.His victory over his Republican challenger, the former congressman Bob Beauprez, also staved off a rout of Democrats in Colorado, a state where Democrats have flourished in recent years. Representative Cory Gardner decisively beat Mr. Udall to become the first Colorado Republican elected to the Senate in more than a decade, and Representative Mike Coffman, a Republican, handily rebuffed a Democratic challenge in a district that had been redrawn to include many immigrants.That Mr. Beauprez, a banker and bison rancher who lost his last bid for governor by 17 points, had come so close to beating Mr. Hickenlooper offered a warning to Democrats about the precariousness of power in a swing state that has embraced legal marijuana but roundly rejected tax increases to fund schools.At a news conference tinged with celebration and giddy relief, Mr. Hickenlooper theatrically wiped his brow and sketched out a second-term agenda that would focus on job growth and an education overhaul. He said he wanted to help the long-term unemployed as well as the economies of cities like Pueblo and Colorado Springs, where growth has lagged. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment, an opportunity, to seize the bit and move forward,\u201d Mr. Hickenlooper said, in a nod to the dissatisfaction in conservative rural corners of the state. He said he had talked on the phone with Mr. Gardner, the newly elected senator, who promised that the two leaders would be able to work well together, though he did not say on what.Mr. Beauprez conceded the race for governor on Wednesday afternoon. It was still unclear on Wednesday whether Mr. Hickenlooper would govern with a divided legislature or one that retained Democratic control. County officials in suburban Denver were still sifting through ballots in close races that could determine control of the State Senate, which had a one-vote Democratic majority entering the elections. Colorado Democrats did celebrate at least one comeback: They reclaimed two State Senate seats that had been lost to Republicans in recall elections in September 2013 amid a rash of populist anger over Colorado\u2019s new laws requiring background checks on private gun sales and limiting the size of ammunition magazines.Mr. Hickenlooper\u2019s re-election victory was much narrower than his first win, in 2010, when he vaulted into office over a divided, dysfunctional Republican field as a former brewpub owner and Denver mayor who had endeared himself to voters with quirky, positive campaign ads.Mr. Hickenlooper\u2019s win, by about 26,000 votes as of Wednesday afternoon, and Mr. Udall\u2019s 77,000-vote loss suggested a split verdict on Democratic candidates. Voters ratified a governor who had led the state through floods, fires and a mass shooting inside a movie theater, but they ousted a senator who had alienated some voters by focusing relentlessly on his opponent\u2019s positions on abortion and birth control.One voter who split the ticket, William Kaufman, 25, a law student at the University of Colorado, Boulder, said Mr. Hickenlooper had run on his record while Mr. Udall had run a \u201cfear-mongering\u201d campaign against Mr. Gardner. As a result, Mr. Kaufman said, he voted for both Mr. Gardner and Mr. Hickenlooper.\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he said, \u201cI found myself appreciating Hickenlooper\u2019s track record.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Kentucky and Elsewhere Find Answer in Bottle ", "Date": "2014-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLimestone buildings house distillation equipment and bourbon barrels at the Woodford Reserve Distillery in Versailles, Ky. No state has benefited from the growing alcohol business quite like Kentucky, where state officials believe the bourbon industry has increased its payrolls 77 percent over the past two years, to about 15,400 jobs.LAWRENCEBURG, Ky. \u2014 Alcohol may not be single-handedly saving state and local budgets from the red, but it is certainly helping.Consider Kentucky. Coal mines in parts of the state are struggling to stay open, but here among the gently rolling hills of horse country, bourbon is booming.At the Wild Turkey plant, a new bourbon distillery is rising, the first built from the ground up here since Prohibition. Visits to the company\u2019s tasting room, where guests can sip bourbon and gaze into a gorgeous valley, have doubled in the past few years.The company paid over $778,000 in real estate and property taxes to Anderson County this year, twice what it paid in 2010, making it the biggest taxpayer by far. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have them,\u201d said Brian Stivers, the property valuation administrator for the county. \u201cWithout their expansions we would have probably had to raise the tax rate.\u201dWhile Kentucky has enjoyed a special upswing from bourbon, across the country, changing consumer tastes and changes to state regulatory and tax policies have created a bull market in booze-related businesses.\u201cIn human history,\u201d said Garrett C. Peck, a historian who has written several books on alcohol and Prohibition, \u201cthere has never been a better time to be a drinker.\u201dFrom Colorado to southwestern Michigan to the District of Columbia, craft beer, a small but rapidly growing segment of the beer market, continues to expand. Distilleries, benefiting from changes in regulation, are growing in nearly every state. The farming of hops, once largely a small crop limited to a few Western states, is also on the rise.Spirits revenue nationwide \u2014 from all alcohol except beer and wine \u2014 increased to over $60 billion last year from roughly half that in 2000, according to the Distilled Spirits Council. Exports of spirits, much of it whiskey, have increased to nearly $1.5 billion from $531 million over that same time.The growth of many segments of the alcohol business reflects consuming trends that have dominated the marketplace for the past several years. A fixation on local products, a nostalgia for American traditional food ways and a lust for upscale everything \u2014 from a $5 cup of coffee to $10-a-pound organic chicken \u2014 have now reached single-barrel $100-a-bottle bourbon.Further, the resurgence of classic cocktails has fueled the whiskey industry, which for decades was all but dormant, with bourbon filling the shot glasses of older men in front of \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d and not much else. And alcohol is generally highly taxed.\u201cA key factor is the growing interest in American whiskey,\u201d said Frank Coleman, a spokesman for the Distilled Spirits Council. \u201cThen obviously you have all these ancillary economic impacts,\u201d he said, such as sales of bottles, corn used to make bourbon, and tourism.No state has benefited quite like Kentucky. State officials believe the bourbon industry has increased its payrolls here 77 percent over the past two years, to about 15,400 jobs. The Kentucky Bourbon Trail, a collection of distilleries along a scenic route, draws thousands of visitors annually, and many companies have added production capacity.Distilleries like Woodford Reserve offer museumlike experiences to tourists streaming through. They get to watch vats of yeast bubble and workmen roll barrels full of fresh whiskey in roughly the same manner as their predecessors centuries ago. And, of course, they get to taste bourbon.In downtown Louisville, Whiskey Row, once home to offices and warehouses for distillery owners and distributors that were all but shuttered during Prohibition, is coming alive again. Evan Williams, another whiskey producer, has opened the first interactive exhibit along the Row, where visitors can watch a mildly hagiographic video about the life of Mr. Williams and sip bourbon in one of a few cool period-era saloons and lounges.The parent company of Woodford Reserve will invest $30 million in Whiskey Row for a new distillery for Old Forester, the nation\u2019s first bottled bourbon.Among the state\u2019s moves were the virtual elimination of taxes and fees that were preventing expansion and permitting some state parks to sell alcohol. \u201cThe bourbon industry is such a boon for us,\u201d Gov. Steven L. Beshear said. \u201cThe effect that it has on other sectors in creating jobs is very important to us.\u201dOther states have enjoyed the spoils of craft beer. Some 10.6 million barrels of it were produced in the first six months of 2014, up from about 4.9 million for the same period in 2010, according to Bart Watson, the chief economist at the Brewers Association, which represents small and independent brewers.The craft beer industry has also benefited from changes in laws in several states, which now allow tasting and sales of beer on the premises. This year, for instance, Minnesota passed an omnibus liquor bill that permitted craft distillers to open what are essentially taprooms on their premises.In states with numerous microbrewing businesses, like Colorado, thousands of jobs have been added over the past five years as the businesses have multiplied.\u201cIn 2012, craft brewing contributed $33.9 billion to the U.S. economy and more than 360,000 jobs total,\u201d Mr. Watson said. \u201cThis in an industry that didn\u2019t exist 40 years ago.\u201dEven hops farmers are benefiting, largely because craft beers use more and different varieties of hops in production. Over 72 million pounds of hops have been produced this year, a 26 percent increase in just under the last decade, according to the Department of Agriculture.All of this can be a boon to state and local governments struggling to get back in the black. Nine states increased excise taxes on alcohol to help fill budget holes between 2005 and 2011.Further, alcohol revenues are far less volatile than other state tax revenues. Between 2005 and 2013, annual total state tax revenues fluctuated between 9 percent growth and 9 percent decline, while state alcohol tax revenues rose steadily between 1 percent and 5 percent, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center.\u201cThis has been an amazing thing for our community,\u201d Edward Russell, the associate distiller at Wild Turkey, said as he walked through the company\u2019s modern, mechanized bottling facility. His father has worked here for 54 years, probably never dreaming of the boom that has modernized and expanded the operation.\u201cIt used to be my consumer was an older male Southern gentleman until this mixology started,\u201d Mr. Russell said. \u201cIt\u2019s like we all just woke up and decided we were going to be American again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Though students and faculty members at more than 400 colleges have called for administrators to divest from fossil-fuel energy companies, fewer than 20 have committed to doing so. Stanford recently divested from coal, but none of the other schools had endowments within the 150 largest in 2013.The principal justification schools offer is that endowments should be reserved to advance an academic mission. As Cornell\u2019s president, David J. Skorton, put it, \u201cWe must resist, in almost all cases, the temptation to manage these precious funds to further social or political causes, no matter how worthy.\u201d Drew Gilpin Faust, Harvard\u2019s president, said, \u201cThe endowment is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change.\u201d Let\u2019s separate what universities say from what they mean. Their appeal to the image of university as ivory tower, where objective research is conducted in social isolation, rings hollow. Universities have cultivated relationships with businesses, governments and donors for commercial and political purposes. Derek C. Bok, a former Harvard president, wrote, \u201cThe \u2018ivory tower\u2019 has been breached at so many points and the connections with the outside world have grown so numerous and close that the term no longer has descriptive value.\u201d Every university president knows this.Every university president also knows that endowment managers don\u2019t have unfettered discretion. Would anyone defend a university that bought stock in a company known to employ child laborers? Moral considerations have altered investment policies in the past. More than 150 schools divested from South Africa during apartheid \u2014 albeit reluctantly. Others divested from the tobacco industry and select Sudanese companies. What presidents really mean is something more nuanced, like \u201cdivestment should be considered only in extraordinary cases about which there is broad consensus.\u201d You can see why they might feel this way. Causes abound. Portuguese colonialism in Africa was the outrage in 1972 when Harvard students occupied university buildings and the word \u201cdivestiture\u201d first emerged. Today, students are calling for divestment from prison companies, China and Israel. It\u2019s easy to see how taking sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would undermine universities\u2019 role as a forum for open debate. Divestment is a slippery slope. Where do universities draw the line? Columbia\u2019s president, Lee C. Bollinger, says, \u201cThe bar has to be very high, and the reason is there are lots of things that people don\u2019t like about the world.\u201dBut what better forum than the university could there be for distinguishing among competing moral claims? Knowing students and professors, these debates would be prolonged, but it\u2019s easy enough to structure the questions that would be asked and how they\u2019d be answered regarding fossil fuels.First, what is the significance of the social cause? University presidents have overwhelmingly acknowledged the harm caused by fossil fuels, though some, including Brown\u2019s president, Christina H. Paxson, have argued that \u201cthis harm is moderated by the fact that coal is currently necessary for the functioning of the global economy.\u201dThen we\u2019d ask about the school\u2019s mission. Perhaps investments in fossil fuel are justified if profits are used for social good, like financial aid programs, which are supported by endowments. But most elite private colleges remain bastions of privilege. Public universities \u2014 especially community colleges, which have better track records on access \u2014 have a more compelling claim on this defense. Next, how much would divestment cost? Not much. According to a 2012 report sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute, oil and natural gas constituted merely 2.1 percent of endowment holdings. Some research suggests that endowments would have performed better over the past decade had they excluded fossil-fuel companies.Finally, how would divestment advance the cause? Defending Western Washington University\u2019s decision to remain invested in fossil fuels, the president, Bruce Shepard, wrote, \u201cEverybody understands that divestment by our foundation would have no material effect on climate change.\u201d More constructive, wrote Ms. Faust, would be to \u201cthink about how we might use our voice not to ostracize such companies but to encourage them to be a positive force.\u201d This recalls South African divestment campaigns, when presidents argued universities could exert more leverage if they remained invested. But Nelson Mandela and the South African president, F. W. de Klerk, each cited divestment as influential. Endowments have quadrupled in size since 1990, in real dollars. Of course, the National Party had the power to end apartheid. Even the most optimistic environmentalist cannot envision fossil-fuel usage ending immediately. \u201cI also find a troubling inconsistency,\u201d wrote Ms. Faust, \u201cin the notion that, as an investor, we should boycott a whole class of companies at the same time that, as individuals and as a community, we are extensively relying on those companies\u2019 products and services for so much of what we do every day.\u201dIt\u2019s a valid point, but if presidents think it relieves them of all duty, they aren\u2019t listening to the distinction students and faculty have drawn between driving corporations out of business and changing their behavior. For fossil-fuel companies don\u2019t just extract and sell energy. They also spend on elections and oppose renewable energy standards. Investment could be contingent on a company\u2019s agreeing to curtail its political spending, report on climate change or include environmental experts on its board. Universities could distinguish among fossil-fuel companies and industries, as Stanford did in divesting from coal. Of course, global warming is at bottom a dilemma about the nature of fiduciary duty \u2014 about whether that duty is solely to make money or whether we also owe an ethical obligation to endangered species, the inhabitants of low-lying islands and our children. If this debate included more voices, one can\u2019t help but imagine that our universities might construe their obligation more broadly. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Does Wall Street Like Gridlock? It Depends on the Grid", "Date": "2014-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesWall Street likes gridlock. That claim has been made for decades.When Washington is so thoroughly absorbed in political posturing and sniping that it can\u2019t manage to interfere with Wall Street, the stock market is free to get on with the real business of America: making money. That\u2019s the logic, anyway. It makes some sense, but there\u2019s a problem with it: Strictly speaking, the numbers don\u2019t support it \u2014 not if you use an institutional definition of Washington gridlock. By this definition, gridlock is a political alignment in which the president belongs to one party while the other major party controls at least one house of Congress. We\u2019ve been living with that kind of gridlock for almost four years, and we have two more years of it ahead. But certain fundamentals persist, Professor Rosenthal said: \u201cIt will still be an extremely polarized Congress \u2014 and it will still be unlikely that very much important legislation will be enacted in Washington.\u201d What has gridlock actually meant for the stock market? Stocks have been on a tear since the 2010 midterms, but if you go back further in history, it\u2019s hard to demonstrate much of a connection between institutional gridlock and stock performance. Over all, he found that during gridlocked years since 1901, the Dow gained just 4.06 percent, annualized. That compares with an average of 6.27 percent for all years and 7.88 percent for years without gridlock \u2014 defined as years when either the Democrats or the Republicans controlled the White House and all of Congress. In short, based on those numbers, gridlock has been a hindrance for the stock market. I called him about that statement, and he readily acknowledged that it wasn\u2019t based on statistics. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can prove with numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s been true in certain circumstances, and is likely to remain true now.\u201dIn his commentary, he was careful to differentiate between two types of institutional gridlock: benign inaction resulting from the checks and balances embodied in the Constitution, and self-induced crisis, which unsettles the stock market. Gridlock will be good for the market in the next two years, he said, \u201cas long as it doesn\u2019t lead to another debt-ceiling crisis and a government shutdown.\u201dIn a similar vein, Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said that while we would still face gridlock in January, \u201cin some respects we\u2019re in a much better spot than we were, say, two years ago, in the sense that we don\u2019t face the same superdramatic deadlines on the calendar.\u201d In contrast to the situation in late 2012, the country is not facing a dreaded \u201cfiscal cliff,\u201d with the threat of major contractions in government spending and of rising tax rates all coming in a very short period. Mr. Harris said: \u201cThe good thing is that I don\u2019t see that kind of brinkmanship occurring in the next two years, because it was very unpopular when it happened before and some of those battles are over now. The bad thing is that it\u2019s hard to see anything very positive coming out of Washington.\u201d In fact, periods of extreme conflict in Washington over the last several years were associated with brief stretches of high market volatility. But stalemate has been the dominant mood \u2014 and the stock market has prospered. During the years of institutional gridlock since January 2011, the market has had an annualized return of 11.22 percent. That institutional alignment \u2014 with a Democratic president, a Democratic Senate and a Republican House, has occurred only that one time since 1901, Mr. Hickey said, and it has produced the best annualized return of any political alignment in the entire period. When you slice and dice the numbers so finely, differentiating between gridlock under Democratic and Republican presidents, the case for gridlock becomes more interesting. With gridlock, market returns have been great when a Democratic president has served along with at least one Republican-controlled house in Congress. But they have been mediocre, at best, when a Republican has been president under gridlock. For example, in periods like the one to begin in January \u2014 those with a Democratic president and Republican control of both houses \u2014 the market has gained 10.32 percent, annualized. That\u2019s been the second-best political alignment, as far as stock market returns go.For all combinations of gridlock under a Democratic president, the annualized gain was 10.58 percent. Under a Republican president with gridlock, it was only 1.37 percent. Why? It could be coincidence. But Mr. Hickey surmised that \u201cthe market likes a Democratic C.E.O. and a Republican C.F.O.\u201d The idea is that in general, the market has prospered under Democratic presidents, but prefers that their spending be curtailed by Republicans in Congress. Rising political polarization in Congress correlates closely with rising income inequality in America, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re now approaching levels of inequality we haven\u2019t seen since the Gilded Age,\u201d he said. This has been accompanied by disproportionately high earnings on Wall Street, he observed. With a highly polarized, Republican-dominated Congress likely to be bickering with a Democratic president in his last two years in office, he said, major tax and regulatory legislation to restore a more equitable balance is unlikely. \u201cWall Street is getting very rich,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd with gridlock, that trend is likely to continue. It\u2019s no wonder that Wall Street likes gridlock.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Obama Left Fighting for His Own Relevance", "Date": "2014-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Two things were clear long before the votes were counted on Tuesday night: President Obama would face a Congress with more Republicans for his final two years in office, and the results would be seen as a repudiation of his leadership.But that was not the way Mr. Obama saw it. The electoral map was stacked against him, he argued, making Democrats underdogs from the start. And his own party kept him off the trail, meaning he never really got the chance to make his case. \u201cYou\u2019re in the Final Four,\u201d as one aide put it, \u201cand you\u2019re on the bench with a walking boot and you don\u2019t get to play.\u201dBut the Republican tide was stronger than projected, sweeping away Democrats even in some of those few blue states where the president did campaign. Mr. Obama now faces a daunting challenge in reasserting his relevance in a capital where he will be perceived as a lame duck. If the hope-and-change phase of his presidency is long over, he wants at least to produce a period of progress and consolidation to complete his time in the White House.After making congratulatory telephone calls from the White House on Tuesday night, Mr. Obama will kick off that final phase on Wednesday with a news conference seeking bipartisan accommodation on issues of mutual interest, and he invited Republican and Democratic leaders at the White House on Friday. At the same time, aides said, Mr. Obama is eager to throw off the constraints of a campaign that he did not direct and begin to defend his record in a more robust way again.\u201cHe\u2019s going to be aggressive. He\u2019s ready to go,\u201d said another senior official, who like others did not want to be identified discussing plans before the election results were tabulated. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of important stuff to get done in the lame duck. He\u2019ll talk about that tomorrow. We\u2019ve got a lot of important stuff to get done in the last two years. He\u2019s anxious to get going on that.\u201dTo Republicans, it sounded as if Mr. Obama was hardly chastened or heeding the message of the election, evidently more anxious to find excuses than to rethink the way he has governed. Absent a change in attitude from the president and a genuine outreach on issues that matter to them, Republicans said, the next two years could simply usher in even more political squabbling.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge opportunity to get things done if his frame of mind is in the right place, and it\u2019s not clear it is,\u201d said Sara Taylor Fagen, who was President George W. Bush\u2019s political director when he lost Congress in 2006. \u201cHe\u2019s never shown an interest or willingness to work with members of Congress. Talk to Democrats \u2014 they don\u2019t feel he ever made an effort to court them. It\u2019s not clear he\u2019ll make an effort to court Republicans.\u201dRepresentative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, said both parties needed to find a way to get past their mutual suspicions to forge a new working relationship. \u201cHe feels burned, and we feel burned too,\u201d Mr. Kinzinger said. \u201cFor four years, it\u2019s been a lot of mistrust on both sides.\u201dJust two years after Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election, the midterm results underscored just how far he has fallen in the public mind. Nearly six out of 10 voters on Tuesday expressed negative feelings about his administration, according to exit polls. For every two voters who said they had cast ballots to support Mr. Obama, three said they were voting to express their opposition to him.The electorate was deeply pessimistic about the country, with seven out of 10 describing the economy as not so good or poor and eight out of 10 expressing worry about the direction of the economy in the next year.Numbers like that discouraged Mr. Obama\u2019s aides, who said they had not done a good job getting out the president\u2019s record, noting that the deficit has fallen by half, unemployment is now below 6 percent, the price of gasoline has fallen sharply and the economy is growing at a decent rate.Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. talked about that at a lunch last week, according to an administration official, and the vice president later gave voice to it in a CNN interview aired on Monday. \u201cWe have to be more direct and clear about exactly what it is we\u2019re looking to do,\u201d Mr. Biden said.But Mr. Obama was focused on the odds against him. His staff researched it and told him that no president in more than a half-century had as many Senate seats open in states lost by the president. \u201cThis is probably the worst possible group of states for Democrats since Dwight Eisenhower,\u201d Mr. Obama told WNPR radio in Connecticut on Tuesday.In those red states, Mr. Obama was politically toxic and deferred to candidates who asked him to stay away. In the last days of the campaign, he visited just five states, compared with 10 states visited by Mr. Bush in similar circumstances in 2006. \u201cThe White House concluded that it should be the responsibility of those individuals who have their names at the top of the ballot to drive the strategy,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary.Mr. Obama understood in some cases but privately resented others. \u201cWe think that was a mistake,\u201d one aide said. Mr. Obama\u2019s irritation became clear when he said publicly that even if he was not on the ballot, his policies were, a comment that Republicans gleefully wrapped around the necks of their Democratic opponents. So Mr. Obama held his tongue, but privately kept quizzing his political director, David Simas, about the latest information on early voting.He had long ago given up hope that he would be able to push through some of his favorite priorities before leaving office. He told a former aide several weeks ago that he knew he would never be able to expand pre-kindergarten as he once hoped, and regretted it. But he hopes for possible deals on corporate taxes, trade and infrastructure. And he will try to use the lame-duck session of the departing Democratic Senate to push through as many nominations as possible.Whether Republicans are open to dealing with him in the new year remains uncertain. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and other conservatives will resist. But Speaker John A. Boehner will have one of the largest House Republican caucuses in modern times, giving him more room to maneuver because he can afford to lose some dissenters if he makes common cause with Mr. Obama.Anita Dunn, a former White House adviser to Mr. Obama, noted that voters in polls on Tuesday were just as negative about Republican leaders as they were about Mr. Obama. In the end, she said, voters were eager not for more failure but for progress by both parties. \u201cThe message for anybody who\u2019s in power is that voters are looking for a change in how they approach getting things done,\u201d Ms. Dunn said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Is Granted Delay in Payment to European Union", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Britain was given the leeway on Friday to defer a payment of 2.1 billion euros, or about $2.6 billion, to the European Union, whose demand had given ammunition to a populist party pressing the country to leave the bloc.Officials said Britain would receive a rebate of about \u20ac1 billion on the payment, an amount that was likely to have been refunded at a later date. As a result, Britain will be able to use that cash to reduce the current bill.\u201cWe have halved the bill, we have delayed the bill,\u201d George Osborne, Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, said following a meeting of European Union finance ministers in Brussels.But other ministers said Britain would end up paying the entire amount, because it would have already used up \u20ac1 billion of its rebate entitlements.Mr. Osborne \u201cdidn\u2019t negotiate a discount today and no discount has been awarded,\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, told reporters, according to Reuters.The deal, which involves a change to European law that will need final approval from member governments, represents a classic European fudge designed to protect the interests of an important member government under intense domestic pressure. But the willingness of the European Union authorities to craft the deal also showed a commitment to helping Prime Minister David Cameron keep a lid on discontent with Europe in Britain.The surcharge, which had been due in full on Dec. 1, was the result of an adjustment of Britain\u2019s membership fees because of changes in accounting methods and the growth in its economy. The revision took place after the European Commission reviewed the economic performance of all member states since 1995.Under the arrangement negotiated Friday with the European Commission and with European Union finance ministers, Britain would make two interest-free payments before September.After the meeting in Brussels, European Union finance ministers said in a joint statement that the additional payments would have been \u201csubstantial,\u201d that the payment due date of Dec. 1 was \u201cshort,\u201d and that those factors could have resulted \u201cin exceptionally high fiscal implications.\u201dThe one-time bill for \u20ac2.1 billion, which is in addition to Britain\u2019s annual payment of about \u20ac11 billion to the European Union, provoked a furious response in Britain at a time when the U.K. Independence Party, which advocates leaving the bloc of 28 nations, is nipping at the heels of the governing Conservatives, led by Mr. Cameron.Mr. Cameron has already pledged to renegotiate the terms of British membership of the European Union.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mario Draghi Says E.C.B. Will \u2018Do What We Must\u2019 to Stoke Inflation", "Date": "2014-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, strongly signaled on Friday that he and his colleagues were preparing a new round of powerful monetary stimulus to jolt the flagging eurozone economy.While slowing growth was the reason for Beijing\u2019s move, in Europe the big concern is a worrisomely low inflation rate that is both a symptom and cause of the 18-nation euro currency union\u2019s inability to achieve any sustainable growth at all.Speaking at a banking conference in Frankfurt, Mr. Draghi said the European Central Bank would \u201cdo what we must to raise inflation and inflation expectations as fast as possible.\u201dIf the bank\u2019s current policies, which include some purchases of corporate bonds, do not end the threat, Mr. Draghi said, \u201cwe would step up the pressure and broaden even more the channels through which we intervene, by altering accordingly the size, pace and composition of our purchases.\u201dAt issue is whether the European Central Bank will follow its peers around the world, including the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England, in buying government bonds on a large scale, a policy known as quantitative easing.With interest rates around most of the developed world having been effectively cut to as low as they can go, conventional monetary policy has reached its \u201czero lower bound.\u201d While there is no consensus on the effectiveness of quantitative easing, many economists point to the relatively strong British and American recoveries as evidence that it works.The risk Mr. Draghi now runs is that unless the central bank\u2019s actions keep pace with his words, he can lose credibility. Many economists have been pushing for most of this year for the central bank to take more aggressive stimulus steps, while Mr. Draghi in his monthly news conferences has been saying the equivalent of \u201cstay tuned.\"If, after Friday\u2019s statements, Mr. Draghi is unable to announce significant new measures when he and his governing council meet in early December, the financial markets could register their disappointment. Some analysts immediately predicted, though, that Mr. Draghi was simply trying to buy more time.Mr. Draghi will find himself even more on the spot at the December meeting if a closely watched report on eurozone inflation next week shows prices falling further.Mr. Draghi spoke Friday as the world\u2019s central banks are increasingly concerned that very low inflation will tip into outright deflation \u2014 a self-reinforcing condition in which consumers and businesses put off purchases and investments in the expectation that prices will fall. Deflation can also crush fragile borrowers by raising the real interest rate on their loans, which would load weak banks with a new round of defaults on loans.Eurozone consumer prices rose just 0.4 percent in October, far below the central bank\u2019s target of close to but less than 2 percent. In fact, some member states have already begun to experience deflation. Mr. Draghi and his peers are afraid that consumers and investors will increasingly see low inflation as the new normal, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.The European Central Bank in September cut its main interest rate target to a rock-bottom 0.05 percent, and reduced its deposit rate to minus 0.2 percent, effectively charging banks for leaving unused funds at the central bank. The bank has been buying private-sector loan assets since early October. And it has announced longer-term low-interest loans to banks in an effort to restart lending.So far, that has not been enough. Recently, Mr. Draghi has said the central bank intends to expand the size of its balance sheet \u2014 that is, to inject money into the market \u2014 by 1 trillion euros, or about $1.25 trillion. Economists say the current measures fall far short of what is needed to hit that level.Michel Martinez, chief eurozone economist with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, noted that Mr. Draghi had not provided much detail about his inflation-fighting plans. Mr. Martinez said he expected the central bank to increase its purchases of private-sector assets, including packages of housing loans known as covered bonds, as well as of debt issued by agencies like the European Investment Bank.\u201cBut when you do the math, you make a rough assumption that the E.C.B. takes 20 percent of all those available assets,\u201d Mr. Martinez said. \u201cThat\u2019s barely \u20ac400 billion.\u201dIf Mr. Draghi is going to hit his target, Mr. Martinez added, \u201cobviously the answer is to purchase government bonds.\u201dExpectations that the central bank will increase the supply of euros in the market led investors to sell the European currency in favor of dollars, particularly as the Federal Reserve has begun reining in its own bond-buying. The euro fell about 1 percent to $1.2438 in afternoon trading. The Euro Stoxx 50 index gained 2.97 percent. Yields on Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds fell roughly 1 percent.And yet, the path to employing wholesale bond-buying is not an easy one. There is significant opposition to such a policy in Germany, for example, and even if the political hurdles are overcome, economists say they wonder whether the eurozone \u2014 in which each country, rather than the bloc as a whole, issues bonds \u2014 is the appropriate venue for quantitative easing.Two of Germany\u2019s gatekeepers on the question of quantitative easing \u2014 the government\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, and the German central bank\u2019s president, Jens Weidmann \u2014 addressed the same conference on Friday but declined to comment on Mr. Draghi\u2019s speech.In any case, Mr. Martinez said he was not convinced that Mr. Draghi was ready to act in the near term, perhaps not before next summer.\u201cThe E.C.B. is buying time in the hope that the outlook improves,\u201d he said.Guntram B. Wolff, who follows the European economy as director of the Brussels-based research institute Bruegel, agreed.\u201cMy take is that it will still take some time before\u201d Mr. Draghi commits to buying government bonds, Mr. Wolff said. \u201cMy sense is that the German government is moving toward the position that this may have to happen at some point to prevent a catastrophe in terms of prolonged low inflation or even deflation. It has serious implications for Germany, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How One Lawyer\u2019s Crusade Could Change Football Forever", "Date": "2014-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are 1.27 million lawyers in the United States, one for about every 300 Americans \u2014 about 400,000 more of them than there are doctors. Their work is rarely glamorous, and especially for those just starting out in the profession, it can be grinding and repetitive. Jason Luckasevic, hired out of law school in 2000 by a firm in Pittsburgh, passed the bar exam on his first try and was quickly sworn in to practice. The ceremony, such as it was, took place on a Thursday in a clerk\u2019s office, rather than in a courtroom in front of family and friends, because his bosses needed him to get started. The following Monday morning, he drove to Johnstown, about 90 minutes away, where he spent the day taking depositions from former employees of an enormous steel plant that had exposed them to asbestos. Late that afternoon, he climbed back into his Honda Civic and headed home. He repeated this routine for the next six months, five days a week, racking up some 400 depositions and about 20,000 miles on the road.Luckasevic harbored no grandiose visions for himself \u2014 no ambition to clerk for a Supreme Court justice, no thought of blazing new legal ground. His father was a machinist, his mother a teller at a credit union, his godfather the president of a United Steelworkers local. \u201cWorking lawyers for working people\u201d was the motto of Goldberg, Persky & White, the firm he joined, and it suited him just fine. \u201cWe were one of the early firms into the asbestos world,\u201d Luckasevic explained to me over breakfast not long ago. \u201cIt was difficult, but it was also great. My attitude was, I\u2019m going to work hard, do good at this and be successful. Hopefully, I\u2019ll be like some of the established guys in the firm and start making some nice money and have a nice vehicle.\u201dAs Luckasevic was getting started on his legal career, his older brother, Todd, was in his medical residency at the Allegheny County medical-examiner\u2019s office, working under a forensic pathologist named Bennet Omalu. The Nigerian-born doctor spent some Thanksgivings with the extended Luckasevic clan. He and the Luckasevic brothers sometimes went out for beers together or to hockey games. Luckasevic found Omalu to be good company, \u201can easy guy to be around, even though you could tell he was brilliant or even a genius.\u201dIn 2002, Omalu performed an autopsy on Mike Webster, a former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman and a member of pro football\u2019s Hall of Fame. Webster was just 50 when he died, and he spent the last years of his life suffering from dementia, at times living in his pickup truck. When Omalu studied Webster\u2019s brain in his laboratory, he noted a degeneration of tissue and other markers of decline usually present only in people decades older or sometimes in boxers suffering from \u201cpunch drunk\u201d syndrome. Over the next few years, he autopsied five other former N.F.L. players, none of them old, and saw the same patterns: tangled brain tissue and the accumulation of tau protein, a characteristic of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.Omalu published his findings on Webster in 2005 in the journal Neurosurgery. He identified what he was seeing as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and suggested that football caused irreversible brain damage. The N.F.L.'s response was to attack him, and N.F.L.-affiliated doctors demanded, without success, that Neurosurgery retract the article. Later his conclusions were called \u201cpreposterous\u201d and a \u201cmisinterpretation of the facts.\u201dLuckasevic by this time had begun to take on other types of cases: auto accidents, slip-and-falls \u2014 the bread and butter of the plaintiffs\u2019 bar. He did not seem to be on the verge of initiating a landmark case. At first, his response to the public controversy picking up around Omalu, whom he occasionally employed as an expert witness, was just to step up and defend his friend. He remembers thinking: Why would Bennet make this stuff up. I mean, why would he? It\u2019s just not done. He worried that Omalu would pay a professional price. \u201cIt looked to me like Bennet had raised his hand and said there\u2019s a problem we need to be aware of, and he got savaged for it.\u201dOne day as they sat together at his law office, Luckasevic told me, he asked Omalu how he was going to fight back and defend his reputation. \u201cBennet\u2019s response was something like: \u2018You\u2019re a good lawyer. You\u2019ll figure it out.\u2019 \u201dLuckasevic began to think about whether he could buttress Omalu\u2019s lab findings. In 2006, he had his first meetings with retired N.F.L. players, who introduced him to other players. The damage that Omalu observed when he looked at brain tissue under a microscope, Luckasevic saw in human terms. Many of the men he met suffered from headaches, memory loss, depression and sleeplessness. He went down a checklist when one of them came into his office the first time. Was the former player employed? On disability? Could he follow the conversation, or did his wife have to fill in details and answers to questions? The worst off among them seemed many years older than their chronological age.To build a case against the N.F.L., Luckasevic knew that he first had to win the trust of the former players. They came from a distinct subculture, men who had built their lives and identities playing a violent game. They were deeply connected to one another and still invested in football \u2014 even as they came to believe they were suffering from its effects. \u201cThese guys, they have to feel they have a friendship with you before there\u2019s a business relationship,\u201d Luckasevic said. \u201cThey have to have your cellphone number. They\u2019ll keep calling and calling and calling until they get you, and you\u2019ll have a conversation, and then they\u2019ll call you back an hour later and ask the same questions and have the same conversation. It\u2019s really horrific.\u201dIn 2011, Luckasevic filed suit against the N.F.L., at first on behalf of 75 players. Among them were Mark Duper, a three-time Pro Bowl selection at wide receiver for the Miami Dolphins, and Fred McNeil, a linebacker who played a dozen seasons for the Minnesota Vikings. (McNeil became a lawyer after he retired from football, but dementia has forced him to leave the profession; an article published on the Vikings\u2019 website said that he cannot remember the scores of the Super Bowls he competed in.) Luckasevic\u2019s civil action, later joined by dozens of lawyers around the nation who brought thousands of their own clients, is now moving toward final settlement, perhaps as soon as later this month. In September, the N.F.L. filed documents in federal court, prepared by actuaries, estimating that 28 percent of the retired players eligible for payments under the settlement will develop long-term cognitive deficiencies, many of them at \u201cnotably younger ages\u201d than the general population. In other words, they will suffer from early-onset dementia. With that, the connection between football and brain damage was validated. There was no more denying it.Some of Luckasevic\u2019s new N.F.L. friends have sent him signed pictures of themselves \u2014 action shots from their N.F.L. careers \u2014 because that\u2019s what former pro athletes do. The photos hang on his office wall. In a couple of them, the players are bent at the knees in an athletic crouch, with their helmets pointed straight at opposing players, just as they were taught since they first put pads on.Other recent events below the professional level have added to football\u2019s season of troubles and to the incipient impression that there might be something defective at the core of the sport. The college game\u2019s most prominent player, the Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston, has been embroiled in multiple scandals \u2014 the most serious a rape allegation that may have been incompletely investigated. Seven high-school players in Sayreville, N.J., were criminally charged with hazing, and their team, a perennial state champion, was disbanded for the season. Over the course of a week in September and October, three high-school football players died after collapsing on the field.For decades, the N.F.L. has been seemingly immune to bad publicity, swings in the wider economy or entertainment trends. Every addition to the increasing number of ways that Americans amuse themselves \u2014 D.V.R.s, streaming content on computers and mobile devices and perhaps soon our watches \u2014 benefits the lords of professional football. Their game only becomes more valuable as the number of people watching TV programs in real time shrinks. The sole non-N.F.L. event on the 2013 list of the Top 10 most-watched television programs was the Academy Awards broadcast, at No. 7, between two postseason playoff games. The Oscars had 40 million viewers, the Super Bowl 108 million. N.F.L. revenue last year was about $9 billion, but the stated goal of its commissioner, Roger Goodell, in 2010 was to increase that to $25 billion by 2027.It seemed reasonable, as the season began under a dark cloud, to ask: Could this be the moment when things turn sour for the N.F.L., the beginning of the end of its long dominance? Boxing, once hugely popular, has been pushed to the margins of American culture. Many commentators have asked whether that could happen to football. And yet, past the halfway point of the season, the game is as popular as ever. Ratings are up. The N.F.L.'s associated spinoffs, like the sale of licensed merchandise and participation in the fantasy-football phenomenon, continue to grow. The Buffalo Bills, one of the league\u2019s least valuable franchises, recently changed hands for more than $1 billion. The Dallas Cowboys are worth an estimated $3.2 billion.But what if the template for football\u2019s future is not the fate of boxing but rather that of the tobacco industry? The parallels, of course, are not perfect. But tobacco, like football, was once deeply embedded in the American economy, culture and mythology. Its history, in fact, is inseparable from that of the nation itself. The first crop was planted by an early settler in Jamestown, John Rolfe (also known as the husband of Pocahontas), and it quickly became Virginia\u2019s largest export and a primary impetus for the growth of slavery through much of the South. Cigarette smoking surged at the beginning of the 20th century, and into the mid-1970s, about 40 percent of American adults were smokers, and they could smoke everywhere they wanted \u2014 in restaurants, on buses and airplanes, in workplaces and college classrooms, in their cars with the windows up and their children in the passenger seats.The fight against tobacco\u2019s use has been long and has unfolded in stages, beginning with public-health warnings. A Johns Hopkins researcher reported in 1938 that smokers did not live as long as nonsmokers. A half-dozen years later, the American Society for the Control of Cancer warned that smoking might pose dangers but said \u201cno definite evidence exists\u201d that it caused lung cancer. In 1964, the U.S. surgeon general, Luther L. Terry, issued a landmark report. It linked smoking and cancer and set in motion decades of measures that deeply cut into smoking rates and tobacco\u2019s profits and influence, beginning, first, with Congress\u2019s passing measures that required health warnings on cigarette packages and later banning cigarette advertising on radio and TV. What came next were the lawyers, as well as more regulations and restrictions. After routinely defeating lawsuits brought by smokers (and families of deceased smokers), tobacco companies became more vulnerable. In 1998, they agreed to pay $206 billion to settle a lawsuit brought by the attorneys general of 46 states, who were seeking compensation for costs to the public related to smoking-related illnesses.It\u2019s worth noting the year that the first tobacco manufacturer acknowledged that cigarettes cause cancer: 1997. By then smoking was already in decline. In most cases now, people can no longer smoke inside their workplaces; inside public buildings and sometimes not even near the entrances of those buildings; in public parks or on beaches; and even not in some casinos, which were just about the last refuge for smokers. Many people who might still want to smoke can\u2019t afford it: High taxes have driven the price of a pack of cigarettes above $10 in some states and above $14 in New York. About 18 percent of American adults now smoke \u2014 fewer than one in five. Tobacco\u2019s shift from integral part of American life to its fringes took about half a century.For lawyers who work on contingency fees, each case is a financial investment. (As the ads say, they get paid only if you do.) Luckasevic had just turned 30 when he picked up on Omalu\u2019s research and began reaching out to retired N.F.L. players. At the time he filed suit against the N.F.L. in 2011, he had just been made partner. It was an audacious act. His firm\u2019s base of business was in Western Pennsylvania, where football is sacrosanct and the Pittsburgh Steelers are beloved. From a purely legal standpoint, the case presented substantial challenges, chief among them the possibility that the collective-bargaining agreement between the league and its players might prevent the complaints from ever reaching a courtroom. All the hours he invested could have ended up being wasted. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk-reward analysis you have to do,\u201d Peter T. Paladino, the president at Goldberg, Persky & White, told me when I asked him about how Luckasevic\u2019s idea was received there. \u201cDo we want to represent these folks? Yes, we do. But is it going to bankrupt the firm? Are we going to put ourselves in such a hole that we can\u2019t represent the interests of our other clients?\u201dHis firm\u2019s elders did not want to challenge the N.F.L., but Luckasevic could not abide the thought that it was too big to take on. With his firm\u2019s O.K., he teamed up with prominent plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, one in Miami and another in Los Angeles, who functioned as mentors. They signed up their own players. Luckasevic\u2019s own roster of clients grew to 535.But the case made his wife anxious. The couple had their first daughter in 2007 and a second the following year, and she left her job to be at home with them. \u201cI\u2019m not a risk taker like he is,\u201d she said. \u201cI said, \u2018What\u2019s this going to do to your career?\u2019 \u201dAs lawyers from around the country signed up former players as clients, Luckasevic had to struggle to keep from being closed out by more established lawyers from bigger firms. \u201cI\u2019ve had arguments with all those guys,\u201d he said, referring to those who brought the subsequent cases. \u201cI\u2019ve said, \u2018If I didn\u2019t file that first lawsuit, you would never have done it.\u2019 They say, \u2018Oh, yeah, we would have.\u2019 . . . Nobody wanted to. Nobody wants to be the first penguin to jump in the water and get eaten.\u201dWhen I spoke with Christopher Seeger, a Manhattan lawyer who is one of the two lead negotiators in settlement talks with the N.F.L., he struck a diplomatic tone when I asked about Luckasevic. \u201cBeing the first to file is incredibly important,\u201d he said. \u201cHe took a risk.\u201d Seeger said there had been other firms considering suing the league, including his own, which began looking into it in 2008.I first met Luckasevic last February at a sports bar in North Jersey, where one of his clients, the former New York Giants defensive end Leonard Marshall, was hosting a pre-Super Bowl party. It was an odd sort of event, one designed to both celebrate the coming game and raise money and awareness for research into football-related brain damage. It brought into focus what had been one of Luckasevic\u2019s foremost challenges: overcoming his clients\u2019 feelings that they were almost suing themselves. They had played the game since boyhood and were caught up in its mythology, just like the fans. \u201cThe reason I didn\u2019t file earlier is that a lot of guys just couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wanted to. They knew they needed to. But they couldn\u2019t.\u201dAt the party, Marshall took a seat beside me at one point. He is a huge human being with a face the size of a dinner plate. He had expected many of his Giants teammates from two Super Bowl championship teams to attend, along with other celebrities, but almost none of them showed. Someone said Chaka Khan had passed through, but I never saw her. Marshall was clearly disappointed at the turnout, and he told me that his day had not begun well, either. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to get out of bed,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel good, mentally.\u201dThe essential argument of the players\u2019 claims is that a compact was broken: They understood that they were giving their bodies over to football, but they did not realize they were also putting their intellectual and emotional well-being at risk. Marshall said he had experienced headaches and depression since the end of his career. \u201cWhen you get into football, you think about hurting your knees, your back, even your neck. But your brain, man, no. We didn\u2019t think about that. I didn\u2019t sign up for that.\u201dLater I talked to another of Luckasevic\u2019s clients, Joe DeLamielleure, who played for the Buffalo Bills and Cleveland Browns in the 1970s and 1980s and was voted into pro football\u2019s Hall of Fame in 2003. Among his symptoms, he said, are headaches, bursts of anger and 68 percent hearing loss in his left ear, which he attributes to years of right-handed defensive linemen slapping him in the head. \u201cI lived football, I loved football,\u201d DeLamielleure said. \u201cI can tell you the starting lineup from the Detroit Lions from 1961. I can tell you their numbers. I can tell you the colleges they attended. That\u2019s how much I loved it, but knowing what I know now, I wish I wouldn\u2019t have played. . . . I look at how I am now and I think, Is this a temporary thing or am I going to end up like Mike Webster?\u201dThe federal judge in the concussions suit, Anita B. Brody, eased the sides into talks without ever ruling on a key legal issue: whether their collective bargaining agreement with the league prohibited players from suing for damages. If she had ruled for the players, they might have been in a position to bargain for a better settlement or perhaps to win an even bigger award from a jury. But a ruling for the league would have forced the players into mediation or arbitration and most likely only modest payouts. She may approve the settlement as soon as Nov. 19, when a hearing is scheduled in Philadelphia, and retirees who qualify could start seeing money within about 90 days, before this season concludes.Luckasevic\u2019s initial filing charged that the N.F.L. was involved in \u201ca scheme of fraud and deceit\u201d by failing to warn players of the dangers they faced and by publishing research of its own that falsely minimized risks. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the N.F.L. will compensate retired players (or their heirs) based on the severity of their impairment, sorted into such categories as \u201cearly dementia,\u201d \u201cmoderate dementia,\u201d \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d \u201cParkinson\u2019s disease\u201d and \u201cdeath with C.T.E.\u201d The maximum payout, for those given diagnoses of Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, or A.L.S., is $5 million.Luckasevic does not hide the fact that he believes his case was hijacked by more established lawyers who headed the committees that negotiated the deal. \u201cI give them credit,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they did what they think was right. But it\u2019s not how I would have done things.\u201d He says the settlement focuses almost solely on cognitive issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a weakness of the deal, because what happens to these guys\u2019 brains also causes changes in emotion and behavior. Mood swings, depressions. Suicidal thoughts. It\u2019s not just that you get in the car to get a loaf of bread and by the time you pull out of the driveway, you can\u2019t remember where you\u2019re going.\u201dGiven the offer that was on the table, he would have fought on to trial if necessary. But the settlement does get money into the hands of some players who need it desperately, perhaps soon. It also sets aside $112 million for lawyers, who, if the case had gone to trial, might have waited years to be paid.Players still have the choice of \u201copting out\u201d \u2014 rejecting the terms of the deal and suing the league as individuals \u2014 and at least a couple of Luckasevic\u2019s clients will be among them. The N.F.L. will have to defend or make individual settlements with plaintiffs who opt out, including some notable ones, like the family of Junior Seau, one of the best linebackers in N.F.L. history, who at age 43 died by self-inflicted gunshot and whose autopsied brain showed the markers of C.T.E. (Of the 79 brains of deceased N.F.L. players that have been studied, 76 have shown what appears to be football-related damage.) There is the possibility that Seau\u2019s family or other remaining plaintiffs could win a jury award well beyond the $5 million cap in the settlement, into the tens of millions or even more, but they will have to wait for a trial and then what is likely to be a drawn-out appeals process.It is shortsighted, however, to assume that the N.F.L. and its owners will emerge from the settlement unscathed or that the league\u2019s economic and cultural status are not under threat. Now that the N.F.L. has acknowledged that its product comes with dire health consequences, the sport, below the professional level, faces legal and regulatory challenges that will most likely intensify in the coming years. California recently passed a law barring state middle-school and high-school teams from conducting full-contact practices for more than three hours a week during the season; contact is not allowed at all in the off-season. California is always something of a trendsetter when it comes to lawmaking, as it has been with auto emissions, climate change and smoking bans. And as history has shown in the cases of smoking and other hazardous practices, regulation tends to expand over time: If a state can ban blocking and tackling in practice, what\u2019s to prevent it from prohibiting those activities in games by banning football entirely or turning it into flag football? (Several other states, including Alabama and Texas, have similar restrictions on football practices.)It is not easy in most locales to sue school districts, and in many cases, the dollar amounts on liability are limited. Nonetheless, schools are increasingly being sued over football. Parents of a high-school junior in Tampa who suffered a concussion on the sidelines after jumping for a pass have sued the Hillsborough County school district; he drove himself home, but later was put in a medically induced coma for nine days to reduce brain swelling. It\u2019s possible that the very thing meant to protect players \u2014 new protocols that define how they should be evaluated for a possible brain injury, and how long they should be kept out of play if one is diagnosed or suspected \u2014 will actually put school districts, administrators and coaches at more legal risk. Now that they have, in a sense, been forewarned, what happens if they don\u2019t follow the protocols or don\u2019t have certified athletic trainers on staff or coaches smart enough to deal with possible concussions while they are also deciding on the right third-down play? What\u2019s more, insurers may in time deem the sport too risky. Health insurers might treat it as a costly risk factor like smoking or a bad driving record. As football becomes more and more regulated, many districts may reasonably conclude that it\u2019s more than they can handle.C.T.E. and claims of football-induced brain damage are also likely to play a part in criminal trials, perhaps even some high-profile ones involving N.F.L. stars. \u201cI can\u2019t speculate on individual players,\u201d David Franklin, a clinical neuropsychologist at the University of California, Riverside, School of Medicine, said when I asked him about this, \u201cbut you have to ask how the concussions issue changes the landscape from a law-enforcement perspective. I think it has to over time, because we now know that players are suffering repeated insults to the parts of the brain that cause changes in behavior.\u201d Rates of smoking plunged and the industry declined because tobacco use could not be made safe. The N.F.L. may be at a similar juncture now. It has instituted rules changes to make its own games less violent and is funding and promulgating supposedly less dangerous ways to play at the youth level. But there is no assurance that any of it will make football any more healthful than low-tar cigarettes made smoking. The burden will fall on the N.F.L. to litigate the concussion issue in public and prove that its sport does not rob participants of their consciousness.It appears the league may already be losing the argument with a segment of the nation\u2019s parents. Between 2010 and 2012, Pop Warner, the nation\u2019s largest youth-football program, experienced a 10 percent drop in participation after years of steady growth. It attributed the decline to concerns over concussions. There\u2019s no reason to think its numbers won\u2019t continue to fall.The settlement class includes only retired players, not current ones. In an interview with The New Yorker earlier this year, President Obama, an avid Chicago Bears fan, said that if he had sons, he would not let them play football but he would remain a fan of the sport. \u201cAt this point, there\u2019s a little bit of caveat emptor,\u201d he said of the current N.F.L. players. \u201cThese guys, they know what they\u2019re doing. They know what they\u2019re buying into. It is no longer a secret.\u201d When I talked to Luckasevic about the president\u2019s remarks, he said: \u201cBut my guys didn\u2019t know. That\u2019s the whole point. They didn\u2019t assume this risk.\u201dWhen he was a child, Luckasevic said, Sundays in his household were for \u201cchurch and football.\u201d His family had a couple of Steelers season tickets at about the 40-yard line, behind the visitors bench. \u201cThey were actually too low, but it was sort of neat because you were so close to the players.\u201dHis father would always take him or his brother. When it was his turn, Luckasevic would take his camera, and he has snapshots of some of the men he now represents. He no longer watches any football. He has lost his taste for the game.Advertisement"}

But Mr. Sullivan, a former state attorney general and natural resources commissioner, was successful in putting that label back on and making it stick.\u201cI am deeply humbled and honored to be chosen by my fellow Alaskans,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said in a Facebook posting on Wednesday.Mr. Sullivan, 49, a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve and a former assistant secretary of state under President George W. Bush, rode a Republican wave in a strong year nationally for his party. But he also told voters that by electing him, Alaska would be elevating another conservative; Alaska\u2019s other senator, Lisa Murkowski, is also a Republican.Now that Republicans have captured control of the Senate, Senator Murkowski is expected to be the next chairwoman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, an important post for an Alaskan because the economy and the state budget are deeply tied to oil production.Ms. Murkowski was appointed to her Senate seat in 2002 by her father, former Senator Frank H. Murkowski, a Republican who was elected governor that year. She then won election in 2004 and re-election in 2010.Mr. Begich, a son of Representative Nick Begich, who died when his plane was lost in 1972, trailed by about 8,100 votes after the polls closed on election night.The governor\u2019s race in Alaska was also hard fought and close \u2014 and is still unresolved. The incumbent, Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican, trailed by about 4,000 votes after the first day\u2019s count of absentee ballots on Tuesday, behind Bill Walker, an independent who ran with a Democrat as his running mate. Mr. Walker, a former Republican, led by about 3,100 votes on election night.Both Mr. Walker and Mr. Parnell said on Tuesday that the count should go on.\u201cWith more than 30,000 ballots yet to be counted, there\u2019s still no clear winner in our race,\u201d Mr. Parnell said in a statement.Mr. Walker said in a news conference that he was also not declaring victory. \u201cI haven\u2019t won \u2014 we haven\u2019t won,\u201d he said. But Mr. Walker, a lawyer, businessman and former mayor of the town of Valdez, said that the State Constitution mandated that the next governor \u2014 whoever that might be \u2014 must be sworn in on Dec. 1, and that required efforts now to get ready, and so he named the leaders of his transition team.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Great Wage Slowdown Hurts Democrats", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIncomes and OutcomesIt\u2019s a simple rule: A weak economy makes for an unpopular president. President Obama is on course to become the fourth president of the last six to leave office with an approval rating well below 50 percent. Each of the previous three \u2014 both Bushes and Jimmy Carter \u2014 also had something else in common: Median family income fell during their presidencies.When the economy isn\u2019t performing well \u2014 when incomes, the most tangible manifestation of the economy for most families, aren\u2019t rising \u2014 Americans don\u2019t feel good about the state of the country. When they don\u2019t feel good about the country, they don\u2019t feel good about the president, and they tend to punish his party.Mr. Carter and George H.W. Bush lost their re-election bids. George W. Bush watched his party lose Congress and the White House in his final two years. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Reagan, on the other hand, watched their vice presidents win the popular vote in the next presidential election (albeit with very different outcomes).He wrote he was skeptical that slow wage growth was \u201cdriving elections in a very clear way.\u201d He instead suggested that structural political forces played a bigger role.Mr. Obama won re-election in 2012 with mediocre income growth, but voters may in part been giving him credit for helping rescue the economy from the financial crisis. They won\u2019t necessarily be so patient in 2016 and 2012.Why might that be? The economy is the obvious culprit. Weak income growth has helped make Mr. Obama unpopular and made most Americans unhappy with the country\u2019s direction. No wonder people voted against his party, just as they voted against the party in power at previous times when incomes were stagnant.Slow-growing incomes won\u2019t necessarily keep Hillary Clinton \u2014 or whoever is the Democrat nominee \u2014 from becoming president in 2016.

Mr. Crist was unable to overcome months of attack ads, which constantly referred to him as a \u201cflip-flopper\u201d for switching his party affiliation from Republican to Democrat.Mr. Scott took the stage at a hotel here just before 11:30 p.m. and announced that Mr. Crist had called him to concede the race.Citing the creation of 651,000 jobs as a key to his win, Mr. Scott told supporters that it was time to put partisan politics in the past. \u201cFlorida is on a mission, \u201d he told supporters, \u201cand that mission is to keep growing and to become the very best place in the world to get a job, raise a family and live the American dream.\u201dWill Weatherford, a Republican and Florida\u2019s house speaker, said the strong showing among Republicans statewide represented \u201ca validation\u201d of the governor\u2019s policies.\u00a0\u201cThis is a historic night; Florida is a purple state,\u201d Mr. Weatherford said at Mr. Scott\u2019s campaign party here. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to run statewide as a Republican.\u201d\u00a0The contest was close enough that Mr. Scott, a multimillionaire former health care executive, was forced to dip into his personal bank account to turbocharge his campaign, recently plunging $12.8 million into the race. In 2010, Mr. Scott spent $70 million of his own money, which was crucial to his victory over Alex Sink.Neither candidate was particularly well liked by the state\u2019s disillusioned voters. To generate excitement, each drew marquee national names to the campaign. In recent days, President Bill Clinton and Vice-President Joseph R. Biden Jr. stopped in Florida to campaign for Mr. Crist, while Mr. Scott drew former Gov. Jeb Bush and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.A third candidate, Adrian Wyllie, a Libertarian, was also on the ballot. Mr. Scott was a political neophyte when he rode the 2010 Tea Party wave to narrow victory, casting himself as a tough conservative who could create jobs and turn around Florida\u2019s battered economy. In the past two years, facing sharply negative approval ratings, he moderated some of his conservative stances, advocating for increases in education and moving more to the center on environmental issues and health care. Mr. Crist was governor from 2007 to 2011, largely as a relatively popular moderate Republican. But he cast the party aside in 2010 during his unsuccessful run as an independent for the Senate against Marco Rubio. In 2012, Mr. Crist became a Democrat, saying the Republican Party had traveled too far to the right. Advertisement"}

He is purposely trying to use race to divide Americans.\u201dThis glosses over a hundred years of history that will be tucked quietly away into some attic of amnesia.Let\u2019s review how we got to this point where African-Americans vote so overwhelmingly Democratic and are suspicious of Republican motives.But allegiances flipped.In response to the bill, Barry Goldwater waged a disastrous campaign built in part on his opposition. As NPR put it: \u201cGoldwater can be seen as the godfather (or maybe the midwife) of the current Tea Party. He wanted the federal government out of the states\u2019 business. He believed the Civil Rights Act was unconstitutional \u2014 although he said that once it had been enacted into law, it would be obeyed. But states, he said, should implement the law in their own time.\u201d Whites were reassured by the message, but blacks were shaken by it.Richard Nixon, for whom both Stein and Buchanan would work, helped to seal the deal. Nixon had got nearly a third of the African-American vote in his unsuccessful 1960 bid for the White House, but when he ran and won in 1968 he received only 15 percent. In 1972, he was re-elected with just 13 percent of the black vote. That was in part because the Republican brand was already tarnished among blacks and in part because the Nixon campaign used the \u201cSouthern strategy\u201d to try to capitalize on racist white flight from the Democratic Party as more blacks moved into it.That\u2019s right: Republicans wanted the Democrats\u2019 \u201cNegrophobes.\u201dThe history of party affiliations is obviously littered with racial issues. But now, there is considerable quarreling and consternation about the degree to which racial bias is still a party trait or motivating political factor for support of or opposition to particular politicians or policies.It is clear that our politics were \u201cracialized\u201d long before this president came along \u2014 and that structure persists \u2014 but that\u2019s not the same as saying the voters are racist.This wasn\u2019t a perfect or complete measure of racial bias, but more a measure of flagrant bias \u2014 the opinions of people aware of their biases and willing to confess them on a survey.That said, they found that:\u201cSo there\u2019s a partisan gap, although not as large of one as some political commentators might assert. There are white racists in both parties. By most questions, they represent a minority of white voters in both parties. They probably represent a slightly larger minority of white Republicans than white Democrats.\u201dStill, the question is how much of this muck at the bottom of both barrels sullies what\u2019s on top? The best measure many find for this is in the rhetoric and policies of party leaders.At that rate, Republicans will never attract more minorities, try as they may to skip over portions of the racial past or deny the fullness of the racial present.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Hong Kong, One-Bedroom Apartments That Could Fit in a Bedroom", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetHONG KONG \u2014 There are breathtaking views of Victoria Harbor from a 23rd-floor apartment that recently sold for $722,000 in the new Le Riviera building. The high-end German appliances and marble countertops evoke European luxury. In the entrance of the building, colorful wire mesh sculptures by Spanish artists hang from the ceiling.There is just one catch. The apartment is only 275 square feet, with a bedroom just large enough to accommodate a double bed.\u201cIf we don\u2019t buy now, we might not be able to afford it later,\u201d said Frank Wu, 60, the new owner of this so-called microflat in Shau Kei Wan, a former fishing village on the northeastern edge of Hong Kong Island.Real estate in Hong Kong defies logic. The city is one of the most expensive places in the world to live and it has smashed one real estate record after another for years. As property costs continue to soar, even once improbable living spaces are now getting snapped up at astronomical prices.At Le Riviera, three-quarters of the units sold so far have been microflats like the one Mr. Wu purchased. And Hong Kong developers are putting smaller and smaller units on the market \u2014 one recently built 165-square-foot apartments.But the housing boom, and the inequality it has exposed, has been taking a toll. The high property costs faced by young people added to simmering discontent that prompted tens of thousands to take to the streets in pro-democracy protests this autumn.For many young adults who live packed and stacked in with their parents, it is becoming harder to imagine having a place to call their own. Rents have skyrocketed. And some here now worry that the real estate market could stumble, particularly if the United States Federal Reserve starts to raise interest rates next year. Lending in Hong Kong is tied to the American rates.Speaking in her office down the street from the Le Riviera, To Pui-lui, a real estate agent who has sold two units of similar size in the building, hints at looming trouble ahead. She recently advised her daughter, a doctor, against buying right now.\u201cIt\u2019d be disastrous if the price falls from such a high point,\u201d Ms. To said.Since a low point of Hong Kong\u2019s property market in 2003, average house prices have increased by more than 300 percent, according to data from the Centa-City Index, which is compiled by the real estate agency Centaline and the City University of Hong Kong.Helping propel this rise has been Hong Kong\u2019s thriving economy, which significantly expanded over the last 10 years after the rapid growth of China. Strong demand from wealthy mainland Chinese and limited land supply have also helped to prop up prices, although this effect has slowed since the government put into effect a series of cooling measures, like additional taxes paid on property purchases.First-time buyers now dominate the market, spurred on by the ultracheap interest rates.\u201cThe mortgage rate is below 2 percent, so it is very attractive for the buyers,\u201d said Patrick Wong, a property analyst at BNP Paribas. At Le Riviera, only one buyer so far did not need a mortgage, according to Hip Shing Hong, the project\u2019s developer.Mr. Wu, a retired structural engineer who lives in the Mid-Levels, a more expensive part of Hong Kong Island, bought his microapartment as an investment. He already has a potential tenant, a Canadian woman whose family lives in the neighborhood, and said he planned to charge about 16,000 Hong Kong dollars, or more than $2,000 per month.Many middle-income families now populate areas away from Hong Kong\u2019s center, in neighborhoods like Kowloon East, where the commute is longer but prices are cheaper. In Tseung Kwan O, a neighborhood to the northeast in the New Territories, new properties have recently sold for as little as 10,000 Hong Kong dollars, or $1,290, per square foot, about half that of the units at Le Riviera. Even in these neighborhoods, though, prices have been lifted by the overall market.But the frenzy in Hong Kong\u2019s property market may soon fade. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the United States dollar, so the interest rate policies are linked. When rates go up, those who have borrowed money to finance new homes will feel the effects as their mortgage payments rise. This concern is more pronounced in Hong Kong, where mortgages are not set at a fixed rate.\u201cThey are making themselves slaves to the property market,\u201d said Nicole Wong, a property analyst at CLSA.Many Hong Kong residents still remember the last property bust, which was set off by the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. As Hong Kong\u2019s economy took a hit, unemployment rose and deflation set in, chilling prices. The outbreak of SARS in late 2002 exacerbated the descent in prices. By mid-2003, property prices had hit rock bottom.Ms. Wong remembered visiting a foreclosed apartment in 2003 where the family\u2019s belongings had been left behind. Childrens\u2019 backpacks were still on the table, their homework half finished, she recalled. In another room, she spotted gambling tickets.\u201cIt was a shocking, shocking experience,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could see all that struggle of a family right before they were taken away.\u201dDevelopers seem undeterred for now. They continue to build new properties, increasingly with incentives like tax waivers, which can amount to as much as a 10 percent discount. Microapartments are a small part of the offerings, but they are growing, with a handful of developers jumping in. This is partly because the overall price tag looks cheaper than bigger units \u2014 especially farther afield from Hong Kong Island \u2014 making them more affordable to a wider swath of buyers.Even by Hong Kong standards, the latest apartments offered by Li Ka-shing, Asia\u2019s richest tycoon, are remarkably small. At Mont Vert, developed by Mr. Li\u2019s company Cheung Kong Properties, some units range from 165 square feet to 196 square feet.Prospective buyers interested in a recent batch of similar units were not even able to see them before they agreed to buy, a common occurrence in Hong Kong.Mr. Wu, who acknowledged the risks of buying the Le Riviera flat when prices were so high, does not seem too concerned. He said that he and his wife could always move in.Surveying the empty bedroom, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s all right for me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump has done it, calling for the return of the death penalty in New York and \u201ca little backbone\u201d in American foreign policy. Cindy Crawford and Richard Gere did it, proclaiming themselves, despite tabloid rumors to the contrary, \u201cvery married.\u201d It remains the mass protest medium of choice for political organizations (gay Republicans vs. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel), professional groups (disaffected authors vs. Amazon) and even corporations (Walmart vs. the world).It is a storied tradition, buying a chunk of newspaper space to get a message out to the public. But the half-page ad taken out in an issue of The New York Times last month by this small church congregation, titled \u201cThe Economic Well-Being Award,\u201d recalls an earlier era of civic participation: It is looking for answers, not supplying them. And the middle-class congregants \u2014 nurses and firefighters and retirees \u2014 seek nothing less than the key to American economic prosperity.Leading off with a side-by-side comparison of economic data from 1946 to 1971 and 1972 to 2012, the ad offers $33,000 to any economist who can explain why the economy was so much stronger in the post-World War II period than after 1972.That line of thinking began with the early-morning musings of the church\u2019s pastor, the Rev. Robert Emerick, who said recently that he was trying to sort through the punditry in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election when he realized he could not separate fact from bluster.\u201cI just realized that if I didn\u2019t know any better or couldn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d be stuck basically making a psychological choice, not a rational choice,\u201d Mr. Emerick said. \u201cThat\u2019s not O.K. Not when we\u2019re talking about people\u2019s lives and jobs and the country\u2019s future.\u201d(Or as Karen McGivern, one of the church\u2019s lay leaders and a nurse from Bensonhurst, put it: \u201cShould taxes be higher or lower? You know, who knows? Is there even an answer? And if there isn\u2019t an answer, then everybody should just stop lying about it.\u201d)In the hours around dawn for nearly a year, the pastor began reading up on economic history. He combed through reams of economic data culled from government databases. He started preaching about how Americans had been better off in the postwar years, with more people sharing in the general wealth.Sundays took on a tinge of Economics 101.Then came the idea of offering $33,000 from the proceeds of the sale of the church\u2019s previous, historic building, known as the Green Church, in 2009.\u201cI said: What? You want to do what?\u201d Ms. McGivern recalled. (Besides the prize money, the newspaper ad cost $18,000.)It did not take long for her to come around, though a committee of congregants had several meetings to debate the prize and whether any money should be attached before a majority vote established the award.As economics prizes go, $33,000 is not much. Still, Mr. Emerick said he had received about a dozen responses from economists. There is no deadline or minimum (or maximum) length; in fact, Mr. Emerick envisions something of a long-term project. The knottier challenge will be the church\u2019s main stated requirement \u2014 an answer free of ideological bias.\u201cWe want to think that the \u201950s and \u201960s were the \u2018real America,\u2019 and the \u201970s and \u201980s were an exception,\u201d Mr. Sicilia said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a really good question now, because we\u2019ve been in a period of pretty slow growth for quite some time.\u201dBesides, he pointed out, there is no telling whether what worked in 1950 would work in 2014.\u201cHow,\u201d she said, \u201chave things gotten out of whack here?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Repsol Hunts for Oil Off the Canary Islands", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Repsol, the Spanish oil company, started prospecting for oil off the Canary Islands on Tuesday amid stiff opposition from local politicians and environmentalists.Repsol is the lead operator of a consortium that has earmarked $350 million to cover an exploration phase that is expected to last four months. The project\u2019s oil exploration vessel, the Rowan Renaissance, started a deepwater survey about 30 miles from the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, part of a Spanish archipelago off the west coast of Africa that is also a major tourism destination.Repsol estimates that the project could eventually yield 110,000 barrels of oil a day, enough to cover a tenth of Spain\u2019s oil consumption. However, the company also says that the likelihood of actually locating oil below Spain\u2019s Atlantic waters is just under 20 percent.Repsol owns 50 percent of the consortium. Its partners are the Australian company Woodside, which has a 30 percent stake, and the German company RWE, which has 20 percent.An oil discovery near the islands could help reduce Spain\u2019s reliance on oil imports, but the project has outraged environmentalists and has turned into a political dispute between the islands\u2019 government, which unsuccessfully tried to hold a referendum on the issue, and the central administration in Madrid.Repsol\u2019s project has been heavily criticized by environmentalists as a threat to dolphins and other local wildlife and flora, not only because of a possible oil spill but also because of tremors caused during the exploration phase. It has also been opposed by regional politicians, whose criticism has been aimed at the national government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, especially over the decision this year to allow Repsol to look for hydrocarbons off the islands.In recent months, environmentalists, residents and local politicians have taken part in several protests on the islands against the project. The regional government had also scheduled a referendum for this month to allow residents to vote on whether to search for oil, but Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government struck down the plan, with the backing of Spain\u2019s constitutional court.Tensions came to the fore on Saturday when the Spanish Navy rammed into a boat of Greenpeace activists who were protesting before the start of the exploration phase. The propeller of the Greenpeace boat broke a 23-year-old Italian woman\u2019s leg after she fell overboard during the confrontation. The Spanish Defense Ministry has said that the navy intervened to stop the activists from illegally boarding the oil exploration vessel, but Greenpeace said it was carrying out a peaceful protest. Greenpeace said Tuesday that the boat, the Arctic Sunrise, had been detained in Lanzarote after Spain\u2019s government accused the organization of violating maritime traffic rules during its protest.The Canary Islands, home to 2.2 million people, are governed by a coalition government that combines politicians from local parties with the Socialists, Spain\u2019s main opposition party. Tensions with Madrid have been exacerbated by the fact that Jos\u00e9 Manuel Soria, the minister of industry, energy and tourism, comes from the archipelago. Mr. Soria, who approved the Repsol project, is also the president of the regional branch of Spain\u2019s governing Popular Party.The regional confrontation over the oil project also comes at a particularly delicate time for Mr. Rajoy, who has been facing a more serious secessionist challenge from Catalonia, which held an informal poll over independence this month despite legal and political objections from Madrid. Still, Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government has been looking to reduce Spain\u2019s reliance on oil imports and rein in an energy bill that has risen in part because of subsidies granted to solar power companies and other producers of renewable energy in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. Since then, the government and the renewable-energy sector have been at loggerheads over cuts in the subsidies, which producers have challenged in court as a breach of contract.Spain imports over 99 percent of its hydrocarbons, one of the highest dependencies on imports among Western industrialized nations. Spain now produces only 8,000 barrels of oil a day, from Repsol\u2019s Casablanca platform, which is about 25 miles off the coast of Catalonia.Repsol notes that Spain spent about 35 billion euros, or $44 billion, amounting to 4 percent of gross domestic product, on oil and gas imports last year, not far below the \u20ac43 billion that it earned from tourism, which has been one of the few sectors of the Spanish economy to emerge unscathed from the financial crisis.If oil is discovered, Repsol and its partners would invest $7 billion over five years to develop their project, and then $5.2 billion over 20 years of production. Developing the project could create 3,500 to 5,000 jobs, according to Repsol, but this employment forecast has been disputed by local politicians.Pedro San Gin\u00e9s, who heads the local authority of Lanzarote, warned last month that \u201cRepsol\u2019s project will destroy a lot more jobs on the islands than the few that it could create\u201d because it will harm a tourism sector that represents about a third of the Canary Islands\u2019 revenues and relies on Northern Europeans seeking sun and pristine beaches.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank of England Holds Interest Rate Steady", "Date": "2014-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Bank of England on Thursday left its key interest rate unchanged at historically low levels as policy makers try to balance Britain\u2019s economic recovery against lower-than-expected wage growth and the risk that continued weakness in the eurozone might put pressure on the country\u2019s economy.Britain\u2019s central bank said it would keep its benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent, where it has been since March 2009. The bank also left unchanged a stimulus program of holding 375 billion pounds, or about $598.8 billion, in government bonds that it has bought over the past five years.The European Central Bank is expected to announce its decision on interest rates later on Thursday. In September, the central bank cut rates in a surprise move and announced a bond-buying program in hopes of stimulating growth in the eurozone.The Bank of England had not been expected to act on Thursday, but its decision comes as policy makers in Britain are increasingly divided over how soon to begin raising rates.Two members of the central bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee broke ranks from the majority in August and voted to raise rates. That represented the first dissenting votes since Mark J. Carney became the governor of the Bank of England last year and the first call to raise rates since 2011.The dissenting panel members, Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, have continued to push for higher rates at subsequent meetings, saying current \u201ceconomic circumstances were sufficient to justify an immediate rise,\u201d according to minutes from the committee\u2019s October meeting.The majority of the committee believed that there remained \u201cfew signs of inflationary pressure\u201d in the British economy to justify a rate increase, but the pace of growth in the economy might be easing, according to the meeting minutes. The majority also expressed concern that further weakness in Europe could have an impact Britain\u2019s recovery.The central bank is expected next week to update its forecast for growth and inflation in Britain.The Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday that its preliminary estimates indicated the economy in Britain had grown by 0.7 percent in the third quarter, compared with the previous quarter, contributing to an annual growth rate in gross domestic product of 3 percent.It was the seventh consecutive quarter in which the economy had grown, the longest sustained period of quarterly growth since the financial crisis began in 2008, the agency said. During that time, unemployment has dropped sharply.The drop has raised questions about whether the tightening job market will put inflationary pressure on prices as employers are forced to pay higher labor costs to meet increasing demand for their products.Rising housing prices in Britain, particularly in London, have been a particular concern for bank officials this year as they have examined whether to increase rates. In May, Mr. Carney warned that the housing market posed the greatest threat to Britain\u2019s recovery as consumers take on more debt to buy homes.But housing prices have begun to cool somewhat this fall, putting less pressure on the bank to consider a rate increase.\u201cThe housing market appeared to be cooling with house price growth slowing to a more sustainable pace,\u201d according to the minutes of the October meeting.For the moment, most analysts do not expect the central bank to consider a rate increase before next year.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said on Wednesday that it expected that policy makers would begin to raise interest rates gradually in mid-2015 as economic growth slowed somewhat in Britain and unemployment stabilized around 5.5 percent.The British think tank had anticipated the first rate increase in February, but now it expects the rise will come in June.\u201cRecent weak inflation numbers appear to have alleviated the pressure to tighten monetary policy,\u201d the independent research institute said Wednesday. \u201cOn balance, we think the risk of waiting a few more months to start raising interest rates outweighs the risk from a premature tightening.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Glass doors at one end of the room lead to a covered outdoor entertainment area, with a fireplace that can be fueled by either gas or wood. The kitchen has a polished concrete countertop, stainless-steel appliances and a subway tile backsplash. The ceramic tile floors are designed to look like distressed wood.The master bedroom has warm beige carpeting and a wood ceiling with painted beams. The top of the vanity in the master bathroom is made of 2,500-year-old rimu wood that was buried during one of the eruptions of the Taupo Volcano. The shower floor is lined with hand-laid pebbles. Another bedroom, which could also be used as a master suite, has a peaked timber roof and access to a deck. A window overlooks the library downstairs, with wood shutters that can be closed for privacy.A path through the bush connects the main house with the pool house tucked into the hillside, which has a game room, a kitchenette, a bathroom and a sauna.The house is one of about 100 homes built around Mahina Bay, a residential area on the eastern shore of Wellington Harbor. The village of Eastbourne, a five-minute drive, has cafes, shops and restaurants. The city of Lower Hutt is about 15 minutes away. Wellington\u2019s central business district is a 30-minute drive, but the commute time stretches to 45 minutes during rush hour. Ferry service to Wellington, about a 20-minute ride, is also available. The airport is a 40-minute drive.MARKET OVERVIEW\u201cDynamic markets have been occurring in two different parts of the country,\u201d said Marty Scott, the managing director of Harcourts Team Wellington. Auckland is benefiting from a strong job market and an immigration boom, partially fueled by New Zealanders returning home from abroad to take advantage of the strong economy. Meanwhile, Christchurch, on the South Island, has experienced a construction boom as the city recovers from the 2011 earthquake. Both cities are seeing double-digit price growth, Mr. Scott said.Other parts of the country, including Wellington, have experienced more modest price growth, and are just now returning to price levels not seen since the 2008 global financial crisis. But Mr. Scott noted that New Zealand\u2019s small population of around 4.5 million means there are relatively few real estate transactions every year, making it hard to generalize about market trends.In Wellington, for example, which has a population of about 180,000, Mr. Scott said there are only around 40 sales per quarter of properties costing more than a million New Zealand dollars (around $780,000 at 1.28 New Zealand dollars to the United States dollar). He said it is possible to buy a very high-quality home \u2014 usually a renovated four-bedroom built between 1910 and 1930, in a style the locals refer to as the California bungalow \u2014 for around 700,000 to 900,000 New Zealand dollars, or about $550,000 to $705,000. When it comes to homes in Wellington costing more than 1.5 million New Zealand dollars, \u201cthe buyers are not hunting in packs,\u201d he said.Homes in the Hutt Valley, where this house is, are less expensive than in the city. Historically, most New Zealanders have lived in smaller houses on quarter-acre plots, although that trend is changing. Mr. Scott said the unusually large size of this house and its acreage would make a higher price point unsurprising. The 180-degree harbor views also contribute to the higher price.WHO BUYS IN NEW ZEALAND\u201cThe United Kingdom remains a steady source of migrants into New Zealand,\u201d Mr. Scott said. India, China and South Africa have also been well represented in recent years. He said Auckland has been experiencing population growth of about 40,000 people a year, mostly because of immigration and young professional New Zealanders moving back to the country from abroad.\u201cMost of the foreign buyers for the Eastbourne area tend to be from the U.K. or Europe,\u201d said Duncan Povey, an owner of Tommy\u2019s Real Estate Lower Hutt, based in Eastbourne, which has this listing.BUYING BASICSForeigners can own land in New Zealand, but some properties deemed strategic by the Overseas Investment Office, such as large tracts of farmland or land within protected green space, require government consent before noncitizens are allowed to purchase them. Mr. Scott said it is unusual for residential properties to require such approval, however.Transaction costs include a fee of about 1,000 to 1,200 New Zealand dollars to transfer the title, according to Mr. Povey. A building inspection for this house will probably cost another 1,000 New Zealand dollars, and an appraisal costs 800 to 1,000 New Zealand dollars. There are no other fees. \u201cIt\u2019s quite an easy process,\u201d Mr. Povey said.Not all properties in New Zealand are marketed with an asking price, as is common in the United States. Some are sold at auction, while some, like this house, are advertised with a price range instead of a single price.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish, Maori; New Zealand dollar (1 New Zealand dollar = $0.78)TAXES AND FEESAnnual taxes, payable to the city council, come to 10,824 New Zealand dollars, or about $8,450, according to the listing agent.CONTACTAn earlier version of this article omitted the name of the co-listing agent for the property.

{"Headline": "Democrats Count on Edge With Women to Limit Election Losses", "Date": "2014-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats are nervously counting on an enduring edge among female voters in most states to prevent a Republican rout in Tuesday\u2019s elections. Yet so great is the uncertainty that even before the returns are in, some are second-guessing the party\u2019s strategy of focusing more on issues like abortion and birth control than on jobs and the economy.The danger for Democratic candidates is that their advantage among women could be so reduced by dissatisfaction with President Obama and the country\u2019s course that it is not enough to offset Republicans\u2019 usual edge among the smaller population of male voters. Should that happen, a party pollster, Geoff Garin, acknowledged, \u201cThey\u2019ll lose.\u201dBut he and other Democratic strategists professed optimism, however tempered, for the party\u2019s imperiled Senate majority, among other things. Mr. Garin pointed to surveys of states with the most competitive Senate contests showing that on average Democratic candidates lead among women by about 12 points, while men favor the Republican by an average of nine points. Since women account for more than half the electorate, Democrats theoretically can withstand some erosion of support.As for the party\u2019s emphasis on women\u2019s issues, he said, \u201cIf Democrats weren\u2019t running on these issues, the situation would be much worse.\u201d\u201cThe headwinds that you get from Obama and other factors affect everybody \u2014 they don\u2019t only blow in the faces of men,\u201d Mr. Garin added. \u201cEven in the face of those headwinds, Democrats are still much better able to succeed with women voters than with men voters.\u201dIn Kentucky and Louisiana, new polls grabbed attention for suggesting that Republican Senate candidates had made inroads with women. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate\u2019s Republican leader, was essentially tied among women with the Democratic challenger, Alison Lundergan Grimes, in a Bluegrass Poll taken Oct. 25-29. But the poll, by SurveyUSA, does not meet polling standards of The New York Times because it was partly conducted using automated phone calls.Louisiana\u2019s embattled Democratic senator, Mary Landrieu, narrowly led her Republican challenger, Bill Cassidy, among women and men likely to vote by Tuesday, according to a poll conducted Oct. 11-24 by the University of New Orleans Survey Research Center. But both groups flipped in Mr. Cassidy\u2019s favor for the expected December runoff election that will be required by state law, assuming neither candidate exceeds 50 percent.Yet in a number of battleground states for the Senate and for governor, Democrats continue to have enough of an advantage among women to be in contention, even though many of the states are heavily Republican.That was true for Senate candidates in Colorado, Iowa, Georgia, Arkansas, New Hampshire and North Carolina, recent polls indicated. In Iowa, a Democrat, Bruce Braley, had a 12-point advantage among women over his Republican rival, Joni Ernst, who led by 15 percentage points among men, in a poll conducted for CNN/ORC International this week; over all, the two were statistically tied. Ms. Ernst has been a particular target of women\u2019s groups because \u2014 unlike Cory Gardner in Colorado, another Republican Senate candidate \u2014 she has not backed off her support for a \u201cpersonhood\u201d amendment conferring constitutional rights at conception, which would effectively outlaw abortion and some fertility treatments and birth control methods.Both parties\u2019 strategists are scouring the rush of final polls and state tallies of early voters to gauge whether Democrats are succeeding at their ambitious goal that has defined this campaign season: persuading and turning out women, particularly minority and unmarried women. Those are Democrats\u2019 most reliable supporters, but also the groups most likely to skip voting in a nonpresidential election year. Married white women are more likely to vote, and tilt toward Republicans.Democrats and allied women\u2019s groups say they are confident the party\u2019s candidates will do better among women than in 2010, the previous midterm election year, when Republicans overall won female voters by a single percentage point and captured a majority of the House and many state legislatures. Page Gardner, founder of the Voter Participation Center, which works to increase voting among unmarried women, said single women are more engaged than earlier in the year. A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, however, suggested their interest is lower than in recent elections.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly true that we\u2019d be doing better if we were doing better with women, but I do not see a disproportionate drop with women relative to men,\u201d said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster.Trends are hard to discern from the array of state and national polls. The evidence about women\u2019s leanings is mixed, and sometimes contradictory.In Arkansas, the Republican candidate, Tom Cotton, was tied with Senator Mark Pryor among women in a poll of likely voters conducted Oct. 4-7 by Fox News. Yet Mr. Pryor had an 11-point edge among women in an Oct. 19-23 poll for NBC News and Marist College\u2019s Institute for Public Opinion.\u201cOn balance, I am not convinced the Democrats will make sufficient inroads with white women to make up for the margin by which they are going to lose white men,\u201d said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster. Democrats have not won a majority of white women since 1992.Tuesday\u2019s results, Mr. McInturff added, would tell \u201cwhether it is possible that the single-minded focus that most Democratic candidates attached to the \u2018war on women\u2019 meant they never conveyed an economic and jobs message that might have led a higher chunk of the persuadable male vote to vote Democrat.\u201dRepublicans increasingly make that argument that Democrats miscalculated in their zeal to galvanize women who otherwise would not vote in a midterm election \u2014 especially since The Denver Post this month endorsed Mr. Gardner, the Republican candidate, for Senate, criticizing the Democratic senator, Mark Udall, for an \u201cobnoxious one-issue campaign\u201d about contraceptives.Democrats counter that Republicans use the phrase \u201cRepublicans\u2019 war on women\u201d more than Democrats to stoke a backlash among older and married women who reject partisan, feminist-sounding rhetoric and lean Republican. Ms. Greenberg said Republicans were \u201cdeliberately misconstruing\u201d Democrats\u2019 legitimate attacks. Yet she and other Democratic strategists complain their party has not effectively espoused a broader economic agenda, when women tell pollsters their top concern is jobs and the economy.Marjorie Connelly contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

He will not sit around doing nothing while they look for the courage to enact immigration reform. He will continue to demand a higher minimum wage and new spending on public works, and expansion of early education programs.\u201cObviously, Republicans had a good night,\u201d he said, a quiet admission that his party got drubbed, losing control of the Senate, as well as at least 14 House seats. But he said he hopes to meet regularly with Republican leaders and work on areas where there is mutual agreement.Republicans ran on no message except that Mr. Obama was always wrong, and voters on Tuesday said they were angry with the country\u2019s direction and political gridlock, taking their fury out on the president\u2019s party because he is in charge. (As he noted, two-thirds of eligible voters didn\u2019t even show up.)Under those circumstances, Mr. Obama was justified in sticking with what he called \u201cthe principles that we\u2019re fighting for,\u201d which got him elected twice: creating job opportunity by expanding the economy, the top issue on the minds of most voters. There is no need to backtrack on goals like a higher minimum wage or expanded health insurance when most voters say they want those things.Mr. Obama also said he would request $6.2 billion to fight the spread of Ebola and would ask Congress to formally authorize the military action against the Islamic State. Mr. McConnell seems open to cooperation on these issues, saying he would work with the White House on trade and corporate taxes and wants to hear its requests on Ebola and the Islamic State. Immigration is a different story. Mr. Obama said that, if Republicans continued to block a reform bill, he would take executive action to improve the immigration system before the end of the year. Mr. McConnell warned that any such action would \u201cpoison the well\u201d for legislation. Mr. McConnell also promised continued divisiveness over regulations on business and the energy industry through demands made in spending bills, and he vowed to take action against big pieces of the health care reform law, including the individual mandate.Mr. Obama said he would never agree to end the mandate, which would gut the health law, and there is no reason he should. Voters said they wanted the two parties to stop bickering and work harder, not erase the progress made in the last six years. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Decides Pacific Trade?", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 While the United States and Japan dawdle over the last details of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, China is moving to fill the vacuum. Beijing is intent on defining trade relations in the Asia Pacific for the 21st century.As host of the approaching Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings, which take place just a week after America\u2019s midterm elections, Beijing has been pushing for a post-meetings declaration that will lock in its vision of free trade \u2014 language that will, according to reports, endorse the so-called Beijing road map, which does not include the T.P.P. As the United States trade representative, Michael Froman, said, \u201cWe do not expect to have a final agreement on T.P.P. at APEC.\u201dThe Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement would bring broad economic benefits for a vast majority of citizens in the 12 countries that would be signatories to the deal \u2014 including Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico and Vietnam, among others. The T.P.P. would set high standards for regulatory systems, rules on intellectual property and fair competition \u2014 standards that China should aspire to but cannot currently meet.So as well as promoting its alternative plan to shape the region\u2019s economic future by means of an Asia-Pacific free trade area with considerably lower standards, Beijing is betting that the small number of vocal opponents of the T.P.P. in America and Japan will derail the agreement. For the T.P.P. parties, failure to conclude an agreement would have untold costs, as countries like China that pursue mercantilist, government-directed economic policies would be emboldened to set the terms of trade in the Asia-Pacific region.China understands that democratic systems like those of the United States and Japan show great deference to the interests of small groups. They protect minorities from the tyranny of a majority. In effective democracies, however, the interests of small groups are protected not through stalemate and inaction, but through compromise, as new policies move forward for the overall benefit of a country.Trade negotiations test democracies to their limits. In the final phases, weary negotiators attempt to find common ground. Small interest groups that fear being disadvantaged become more shrill and intransigent; larger business and industry stakeholders that would gain by the deal fall largely silent; and the public, which would gain most of all, is confused. Media coverage is saturated with ever more strident rhetoric over ever narrower issues, overshadowing the fundamental interests at stake.This is the stage we have reached in the American-Japanese negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Public debate has become dominated by, on one hand, the profits of pork farmers in Japan and the United States and, on the other, political maneuvering to assign blame in anticipation of a failure to close a deal.Lost in the discussion are the advantages to both countries\u2019 overall national interest and an overwhelming majority of their respective citizens. Few voices are heard saying that a T.P.P. agreement will establish American-Japanese leadership in setting a course that will enable greater prosperity throughout the Asia Pacific region.It is time to make the compromises necessary to close a deal that will set the standard for international business in the future. Critically, a small number of relatively minor issues must not block an agreement between two of the world\u2019s three largest economies.The T.P.P. will provide an American- and Japanese-led framework for business in the world\u2019s center of economic power. It will establish the best practices already observed by American and Japanese companies for a trading area of nearly 800 million consumers in 12 countries. And it will be open to new members, including China, that are willing to accept the high standards that the T.P.P. will demand.It\u2019s important to note that China has expressed interest in joining the T.P.P. \u2014 even if this reflects a view in Beijing that the agreement is more inevitable than desirable. While China\u2019s accession to the T.P.P. would place the world\u2019s second-largest economy on a more certain and stable path, it would do so based on rules developed under the leadership of free-market democracies. Many of the areas in which weak World Trade Organization rules have failed to level the playing field for foreign companies in China would be strengthened under the T.P.P., making China a better place to do business.China understands that the T.P.P. will reinforce the vital American-Japanese alliance. That alliance is, of course, the bedrock of the region\u2019s security upon which the Asian economic miracle was built. As Japan assumes a more important international role, the T.P.P. provides additional strategic ties that will enhance Tokyo\u2019s ability to manage relations with the countries that pose the greatest challenges.A failure to conclude the T.P.P. would be a terrible setback. In place of establishing joint leadership in a rules-based regional economic system based on free-market principles, the American-Japan relationship would suffer from a period of mutual recriminations and loss of trust and cooperation. As both President Obama and Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, have stressed, the time for bold action to conclude the T.P.P. is at hand. China\u2019s bet against Japan and the United States has only reinforced the urgency of closing the deal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Labor MarketBut dig a little deeper and you find a much sunnier story. When read carefully, today\u2019s report provides more evidence that the labor market is improving quite rapidly, and that the recovery has gained momentum over the past year.To start with, realize that there are two separate surveys of employment. The survey that garners the most attention is based on asking (nonfarm) firms how many people are on their payroll, and this is the count that suggests employment grew by 214,000.The Labor Department statisticians separately survey households, asking people if they have a job. This alternative measure of employment receives less emphasis, because it tends to be extremely volatile. Bearing this disclaimer in mind, it is notable that the household survey suggests that employment grew by an impressive 683,000 in October. While this number should be treated with substantial caution \u2014 it surely overstates the actual pace of employment growth \u2014 it should not be discounted completely.My preferred rule of thumb is to put 80 percent weight on the nonfarm payrolls survey, and 20 percent weight on the household survey. This weighted average, which probably better describes underlying labor market conditions, suggests that employment grew by a very healthy 308,000 jobs in October.Finally, today\u2019s numbers are simply the first estimate made by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and they will be revised as more information comes to light. For reasons that remain largely mysterious, these initial estimates have tended to be highly cyclical, underestimating job losses during the recession, and then systematically underestimating job gains during the recovery. During the current economic recovery, the initial estimate of nonfarm payrolls has understated monthly employment growth by an average of 28,500 jobs.If this pattern continues, it is highly likely that the latest estimates will be revised upward. Indeed, the initial estimate for job growth in August has been revised from a disappointing 142,000 to 203,000, and the estimate for September has already been revised from 248,000 to 256,000.The old saying is that the devil is in the details. Today\u2019s report suggests just the opposite \u2014 dig into the details, and you\u2019ll find a much sunnier story about the labor market. All told, I read today\u2019s report as providing more evidence that the labor market recovery is gaining steam.Advertisement"}

But in recent years, exports from Asia have been growing more slowly than before the financial crisis. This may be good news.Before the crisis, China, Japan and many other Asian economies relied excessively on exports and too little on domestic demand, which helped them generate large current account surpluses but made them more vulnerable to a slowdown in industrialized Western nations. At the same time, high consumer spending and unsustainable levels of debt powered the American economy, leaving the country with large current account deficits and big job losses in manufacturing.In response to the export slowdown in Asia, leaders in those countries should carry out policies that will stimulate domestic demand \u2014 like investing much more money in health care, education and other public services \u2014 and make their economies less vulnerable to economic weakness in the rest of the world.It is not realistic to expect Asian countries to quickly transform their economies.

What she has lost heart in, she said after casting her vote at the municipal building here Tuesday morning, are the public officials representing her in the nation\u2019s capital.\u201cThere\u2019s too much fighting in Washington,\u201d said Ms. Dempsey, 59, after voting for the Democratic candidates for Senate and governor here, in two of the most contested races in the nation. \u201cEverybody is trying to get their own way, and things are not getting done the way they should be getting done.\u201d When asked if her vote would change anything, Ms. Dempsey glanced back at the empty sidewalk leading to the polling place. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201dMs. Dempsey\u2019s bleak view of the state of American politics resonated across the country on Tuesday, with voters heading in and out of polls expressing frustration and resentment against all things Washington: President Obama and Congress, Republicans and Democrats, big-money contributors and the Supreme Court decision that opened the financial floodgates for negative advertisements in states like this.Despite all the negativity, a number of voters said they thought their votes mattered \u2014 in particular Republicans, who said that winning control of the Senate would curb what many described as the excesses of Mr. Obama. \u201cThe Democrats are spending too much money, Obamacare is a farce and needs to be repealed \u2014 or at least substantially repealed,\u201d said William Burke, 66, a retired lawyer who lives in Georgia and voted Republican.But many voters said that after watching the infighting in Washington \u2014\u00a0and considering the fact that Mr. Obama is heading into the twilight of his presidency \u2014 they did not think that anything made much of a difference.\u201cThey just don\u2019t seem to get anything done anymore,\u201d said John Miller, an independent in Iowa voting at the Red Oak Fire Department. \u201cAll they do is fight between each other and don\u2019t get anything done. So we \u2014 and I \u2014 need something different in there. Everything needs to change.\u201d Shari Pizarro, 49, a Democrat who works as a waitress in St. Petersburg, Fla., said she voted Democratic but had few hopes for Washington \u2014 now or in the future. \u201c I have no clue what\u2019s going on in D.C., but what I do know is that you can\u2019t really trust anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all screwed up no matter who\u2019s in the White House.\u201d The interviews came in an election in which many analysts were expecting a notably low turnout, reflecting the distress many people have voiced about the state of the government. Again and again, voters said they were exhausted after having been deluged with attack advertising on television, emails pleading for money and election pamphlets clogging their mailboxes. Such bombardments only reinforced their disenchantment with Washington, they said.Some voters blamed both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue for the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s as dysfunctional as you probably can get,\u201d said Ken Berra, 60, a Democrat and lawyer in Kansas. \u201cYou have a president who unfortunately is a lightning rod \u2014 the Republicans, no matter what he does, don\u2019t like it.\u201d Kenneth Haynes, 60, offered a similar view as he came to vote at Luling Elementary School in Luling, La. \u201cThey\u2019re always calling each other the bad guy when they\u2019re all the bad guy,\u201d he said.Warren Sloan, 45, a mechanic, voted Democratic in the Georgia election and said that although he blamed both parties for the battling, he faulted Republicans more.\u201cEverybody\u2019s doing their part,\u201d Mr. Sloan said. \u201cBut one thing I\u2019ve noticed about the Republican Party \u2014 and I\u2019ve listened to Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity for years \u2014 is they can tell you what you\u2019re doing wrong, but they can\u2019t come up with a better solution.\u201dAnn Halloran, 72, an independent who said she had voted for Republicans as she left the polls in Salem, N.H., called Mr. Obama \u201cthe driving force that has caused us to go in the wrong direction, and hopefully these people are going to be the ones that are going to take a step back.\u201dThe issue that the White House might have expected to boost Democratic candidates \u2014 the economy, which by many measures is in far better condition than it was even two years ago \u2014 may have in fact proved to be a negative for the president and his party. In preliminary exit polls of voters conducted by Edison Research, a large majority of voters described the national economy in negative terms and most said the United States economic system favored the wealthy. \u201cThe economy is terrible,\u201d said John Madron, 61, who has been unemployed since 2009, after casting his vote in this community outside Denver. \u201cEspecially for manufacturing. I\u2019ve been in manufacturing all my life, and right\u00a0now, I\u2019m unemployed. There\u2019s no positions throughout this country because it\u2019s all been outsourcing.\u201dMr. Madron said he voted for Mr. Obama when he first ran for president in 2008, but after that voted Republican.The public resentment toward Washington went beyond the people in charge; voters in states that had been at the center of these battles said they had been overwhelmed by advertisements paid for by wealthy donors. \u201cSince they\u2019ve allowed all the money in politics, it\u2019s gotten much worse,\u201d said Scott Hasson, 40, a photographer who lives in Denver. \u201cEveryone says our vote matters, but until we can check the system and start taking a lot of that money out, I feel like it\u2019s just power, people with money have the power.\u201dThe exit poll showed most Americans disapproved of Mr. Obama, and that clearly hurt Democratic candidates. \u201cObama has not accomplished what he promised to the community,\u201d said Juan Neyra, 69, a retired security guard in Denver.

{"Headline": "2 Worlds of Hong Kong, and a Fatal Intersection ", "Date": "2014-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe women, Seneng Mujiasih, 29, and Sumarti Ningsih, 23, also came to Hong Kong to better their lives. Leaving poverty in rural Indonesia, they were among the city\u2019s more than 300,000 foreign domestic workers, mostly women from Southeast Asia, earning as little as $530 a month cleaning houses and caring for children and old people, six days a week, 17 hours a day.Their worlds collided, the authorities believe, in the garish neon bars of Hong Kong\u2019s red light district of Wan Chai, where Asian women, often current or former housemaids, earn extra money selling overpriced drinks and furtive sex to foreign men.Mr. Jutting, 29, who had called the police, was charged with two counts of murder. He is now being evaluated to determine whether he is mentally fit to stand trial; if convicted, he would face life in prison.The police have released few other details. How Mr. Jutting met the women, the nature of their relationship and investigators\u2019 theories about the motive for the killings are not publicly known.But interviews with friends, relatives and acquaintances, as well as extensive records left online by the suspect and the victims, yield a detailed portrait of a side of this financial capital that is rarely seen. They tell the story of impoverished immigrants who, trapped by harsh work rules that relegate them to second-class status and desperate to support families at home, were drawn to the bars of Wan Chai, and a banker who had a great deal of expendable income, and, according to his Facebook page, an abiding interest in young Asian women.Seneng means \u201chappiness\u201d in Javanese, and Ms. Seneng tried to bring some to her family, sending money home every three months to help them build a house, pay for her mother\u2019s diabetes medicine, buy a bed.A friend, who did not want to be identified because she has started a new life in Indonesia and does not want her Hong Kong history publicized, said she and Ms. Seneng held two jobs in Hong Kong, working part time as domestic servants during the day and as prostitutes at night. At places like the New Makati Pub & Disco, a dimly lit second-floor walk-up bar, they could make as much as $100 on a busy night by encouraging men to buy drinks, and more than $250 for sex.It was a double life that Ms. Seneng, who also went by the name Jesse Lorena, seemed to embrace. Photos on her Facebook profile show her as a fun-loving woman who liked to hang out at Hong Kong nightclubs and post sexually suggestive photos that drew admiring comments. But other photos show her fully covered in Muslim dress, a head scarf over her hair.The friend said the maid\u2019s job was enough to pay for room and board but left nothing to send home. Working the bars in Wan Chai seemed the only way. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be like this forever,\u201d she said.Like Ms. Seneng, Ms. Sumarti, called Aliz by friends, was by far the biggest breadwinner in her family, sending the equivalent of $300 every month to help pay for the care of her son, Novan, who turns 5 this month. She left school at 13. She had worked as a servant here, came back on a tourist visa and was to have returned to Jakarta on Nov. 3. Her family said she had recently taken a D.J. course in Jakarta. \u201cShe made me happy,\u201d said a friend, Susiati. \u201cShe had to take care of her son, and it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201dMr. Jutting had been working in Hong Kong more than a year, after starting at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London in 2010, in the derivatives unit. He was \u201cwell regarded and a hard worker,\u201d a co-worker said, and liked to travel to neighboring countries in Southeast Asia on weekends.With four years of experience, he would have been earning $600,000 to $800,000 a year, according to a banker familiar with the company\u2019s compensation.Ms. Seneng and Ms. Sumarti would have had to work 100 years as domestic servants to earn what Mr. Jutting made in a year. Meager as their wages were, they catapulted the women far beyond their worlds at home. Ms. Sumarti\u2019s father, for instance, earns about $2 a day helping neighbors tend their rice fields in central Java. His own small rice plot brings in about $400 a year.The gulf between the haves and have-nots in Hong Kong is among the world\u2019s widest. This gap is reinforced by laws that rights groups say institutionalize a caste system among foreigners, putting expatriate business people like Mr. Jutting at the top and migrant workers such as Ms. Seneng and Ms. Sumarti at the bottom.Domestic servants, called helpers, cannot apply for permanent residency, which businessmen like Mr. Jutting qualify for after seven years. And they are subject to a special pay scale, with a wage floor that works out to about two-thirds less than Hong Kong\u2019s minimum wage of $3.87 an hour. The law also makes their lives here dependent on remaining in the good graces of their employers. If dismissed, they have 14 days to leave the country and must pay hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, to placement agencies to arrange a return.Facing those hurdles, and dismal job prospects back home, some dismissed servants decide to overstay their visas. Such was the case with Ms. Seneng, who had overstayed her domestic servant visa by three years, according to the Indonesian Consulate. With no right to work in other professions, some end up in Wan Chai.\u201cThere are a million and one ways to exploit the migrant domestic workers, especially from Indonesia,\u201d said Norma Muico, a researcher for Amnesty International who focuses on migrant rights. \u201cIf they come out of this with a successful migration, it\u2019s due to luck, because there are so many ways it can go wrong.\u201dThe building where Mr. Jutting lived in a 31st-floor apartment is a four-minute walk from the bars on Lockhart Road in Wan Chai, where aging madams, paired with heavily made-up young women in short, skintight skirts, grab passing men by the arm. They beckon them to come in and converse with the Filipino, Thai, Vietnamese and Indonesian women inside.Robert Van den Bosch, 47, entertainment manager for the Queen Victoria pub on Lockhart Road, said he had known Ms. Seneng for two years and had identified her photos to the police. He said that she had worked at bars in Wan Chai where men would buy her drinks. She would get a cut from the bar, about $2 to $3 a drink. Working six days a week, she could earn as much as $580 a month, more than a housemaid\u2019s salary, he said.The last time he saw Ms. Seneng was on the night of Oct. 31, hours before the police say she was killed. She gave him two kisses, as usual, and said she was off to the New Makati a few doors down. By then Mr. Jutting had stopped showing up for work regularly had gained weight, his co-worker said, adding that on Oct. 27, Mr. Jutting resigned.On the night of Oct. 31, about the time Ms. Seneng was saying goodbye to Mr. Van den Bosch, Mr. Jutting posted what was to be his final public Facebook entry before his arrest. Citing an article about a study showing increasing happiness in countries with growing economies, he wrote, \u201cMoney DOES buy happiness: Growing wealth of Asian nations is making their people happier \u2014 but women are more content than men.\u201dIt is not clear how Ms. Seneng ended up in Mr. Jutting\u2019s apartment.On Nov. 9, about 200 people, mostly Indonesian women, attended a memorial service in Victoria Park. Ms. Sumarti\u2019s friend, Susiati, sat on a blanket, wearing a surgical mask to hide her face. She and a cousin of Ms. Sumarti\u2019s held photos of the two dead women. White roses were laid out in front of them.A Muslim cleric, Muhammad Faisal Firdaus, offered a prayer and a eulogy. \u201cThey are accused of being sex workers, but it is not known why they do so,\u201d he said. \u201cSee them as human beings.\u201dJoe Cochrane contributed reporting from Jakarta, Indonesia, and Yenni Kwok and Alexandra Stevenson from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vibrant, Timid Berlin ", "Date": "2014-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDispatchMany of these accomplishments are laid out in \u201cBerlin Now: The City After the Wall,\u201d a recent book by the German author Peter Schneider. He is right in saying that in recent decades no other city \u201chas changed as much \u2014 and for the better \u2014 as Berlin,\u201d lauding the sense of openness that has drawn immigrants, revived the shattered Jewish population and made the city a magnet for a creative class that is also luring cutting-edge businesses.All of this is worth celebrating, but to longtime residents like me, the moves that made this possible all ended about 20 years ago. Since then, the city has been coasting, mostly consumed by small-bore issues instead of grasping the chance to become a truly great city. Berlin has tried to make a virtue of being a less polished version of London or Paris \u2014 in the words of its departing mayor, \u201cpoor, but sexy.\u201d Yet that is more a reflection of a city whose ambitions rarely extend beyond narrow parochialism.Given what happened during and after World War II, perhaps this isn\u2019t surprising. One of the most dynamic cities of the early 20th century lost its elite to emigration or genocide, and then its infrastructure to saturation bombing and street-to-street fighting. In the aftermath, its great companies fled \u2014 Allianz and Siemens to Munich, Deutsche Bank to Frankfurt \u2014 while what remained of its middle class went anywhere to escape the rubble and isolation.The fall of the Berlin Wall resuscitated the city. Subway and light rail lines between the two halves of the city and its hinterland were reconnected, museum holdings put back together and Germany decided to move its capital here from Bonn, which eventually brought thousands of well-paid and well-educated civil servants to help restock the middle class. Living here during those early years of reunification was thrilling. I recall in 1992 taking one of the first light-rail S-Bahn trains to Potsdam, the city of parks and palaces to Berlin\u2019s south. It had been cut off for decades but suddenly was there, like an apparition out of the Prussian past. It seemed Berlin just had to flip a few switches to join the ranks of great global metropolises.Instead, what followed were two decades of inaction. Berlin did get several important things right: the Holocaust memorial in the city center succeeds \u2014 as a warning, as a tourist attraction and as a piece of urban planning \u2014 far better than most people had thought possible. The nation\u2019s Parliament is another achievement; a young democracy needs a good spiritual center, and Sir Norman Foster exorcised the Reichstag of Wilhelminian bombast, transforming it into a fitting symbol for a vibrant republic. But since then, the city\u2019s problems have started to pile up: the cheaply built central train station with its short roof and low ceilings; the failure to redevelop old Tempelhof Airport; the controversial proposal to shoehorn the city\u2019s world-famous museum of European paintings into a smaller space; a similar, tourism-driven plan to shrink the Ethnological Museum and relocate it in a fake Baroque palace; and the inability to come up with effective measures to stave off gentrification. And then there\u2019s the new airport. It was needed 20 years ago, was supposed to open in 2011 and is now unlikely to see traffic before 2016, by which time it already will be too small for projected passenger flows. All these problems can be explained away as bad luck, or typical of ambitious, large-scale projects. And of course all big cities have their problems. But in Berlin\u2019s case they are a fair reflection of the fact that the city has been treading water, and that many of Berlin\u2019s accolades stem from the big changes of a quarter-century ago and not the efforts of city administrations since then.The reasons for this stagnation go back to the Cold War. Early on, West Berlin did have internationally known mayors like Ernst Reuter and Willy Brandt. But by the 1970s, the city had become a backwater. Few ambitious politicians wanted to lead the western half (not to mention the eastern section, which was run as part of East Germany\u2019s one-party state). The city became synonymous with second-tier politicians.When the Berlin Wall fell, these parochial officials took over the unified city. Not surprisingly, their vision was almost comically narrow. In 1993, the long-serving mayor, Eberhard Diepgen, said Berlin\u2019s new center should look like \u201ca city space like those we know from old black and white photographs.\u201d This lack of imagination was reflected in building codes that required most new structures to be small and not look too modern. Over the years, the city center has become filled with dull, historicized structures. The other lasting effect of this era was an epic housing bubble brought on by a corrupt bank that the city\u2019s leaders created by merging several local banks. That bubble eventually cost Mr. Diepgen his job and saddled Berlin with billions in debt. Mr. Diepgen was replaced in 2001 by the current mayor, Klaus Wowereit, a suave, telegenic Social Democrat. It has been under his leadership that the city has slowly recovered. And yet for the most part his administration has simply stayed out of the way of the longer-term trends that reunification had set in motion. Perhaps the most important of these was the bursting of the housing bubble that Mr. Wowereit\u2019s predecessor created. That left Berlin with a glut of cheap apartments, which made the city a magnet for young, creative people and start-ups.BUT when the city took concrete action, the results were usually closer to the agony of Berlin\u2019s new airport. It is not only decades overdue, but like the central train station, it was built on the cheap. It has no subway connection, no dedicated light-rail line and increasingly it seems that planes will be heavily penalized for landing at night, guaranteeing it will never become a hub.And like many of Berlin\u2019s big projects, corruption seems to be behind its delay, leading to resignations and official inquiries. For many years, I comforted myself by saying that Berlin had thrived because of its leaders\u2019 mismanagement. After all, if the city weren\u2019t so badly run, real estate prices would be high, which would drive away the young people and tech start-ups. There\u2019s some truth to this, but it\u2019s the equivalent of telling China that it should remain poor because if it got rich its competitive advantage in low wages would evaporate. Comparisons to China\u2019s capital, Beijing, often come up in my mind when I think of Berlin. Over the past quarter-century, I\u2019ve spent all but three years bouncing between the two cities. Of the two, I vastly prefer Berlin: It has a vibrant civil society, better museums, more affordable housing, a more open and tolerant attitude, and of course much less smog. But in some maniacal way Beijing is chasing the future to a degree that Berlin can\u2019t \u2014 or won\u2019t. Maybe it\u2019s because Berlin has endured too much to indulge in this game, but Beijing feels as if it is at the center of something special, ominous at times, but thrilling nonetheless. The city can be overcrowded and dirty, but it\u2019s also at the phase in its history where it\u2019s building a subway line every year. Meanwhile, Berlin still hasn\u2019t managed to run a subway line from the eight-year-old main train station to the western part of the city, where two-thirds of the population lives. It\u2019s fine to be world-weary. But that shouldn\u2019t be an excuse for being dull and timid. Yet for many who have witnessed the city\u2019s post-wall fortunes, it feels that this is what lies beneath the art galleries and start-ups: a scarred city content to remain in the second league.

{"Headline": "Myanmar Needs Time", "Date": "2014-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorNAYPYIDAW, Myanmar \u2014 Myanmar is in the midst of changes unparalleled in our history. Expectations are high, but the needs of our people are even greater. We must succeed in our transition to peace, democracy and inclusive economic development. And for this to happen we need the rest of the world to appreciate the complexity of the challenges that the Burmese government faces.We live in the shadow of our past \u2014 a past shaped by colonial occupation and military dictatorships, and by our unique geography between Asia\u2019s giant civilizations of India and China, a geography that must be carefully managed. We suffer from extremely limited institutional capacity and even more from the mind-sets and mentalities that emerged under isolation and authoritarian rule. These are things that cannot change overnight. One of our most important tasks at the moment is bringing about a just and sustainable end to 70 years of armed conflict \u2014 one of the longest-running internal conflicts in the world. We are committed to a federal union formed under the principles of democracy, equality and self-determination. We have been in talks with nearly two dozen different ethnic-based armed groups with the goal of a nationwide cease-fire agreement. We want an end to fighting that will allow displaced people to return home and resume their livelihoods. We wish to open space for dialogue at all levels \u2014 including political talks at the highest levels \u2014 aimed at a final peace accord. These talks may well lead to constitutional reforms, including in the area of civil-military relations.We are also determined to end the humanitarian crisis in our western Rakhine State, a site of recent communal violence. We will very soon release a final action plan to address the totality of issues in Rakhine State, one that conforms to accepted international standards in all respects, including on issues of humanitarian access, resettlement, livelihoods and citizenship. We are committed to heightened security to prevent any further violence and will take the toughest measures under the law to prosecute those responsible for violence or incitement to violence. There will be no forced resettlement of people. All people in Myanmar, regardless of ethnicity or religion, deserve the same fundamental rights and freedoms. In a year\u2019s time we will hold general elections. We are committed to an electoral process that is totally free and fair, and are working hard to ensure the elections will be a major step forward in building our democracy. We are in constant dialogue with political parties and hundreds of civil society organizations. We will not only allow domestic monitors but international election observers as well. We hope for elections that are not only free but that encourage substantive debates of policies, offering people real choices for the future.We are committed as well to a free media. The newly established Myanmar Press Council is working hard to make this a reality and we understand fully the importance of a free, independent, and responsible media as a key component to any democratic society. Alongside all these political efforts, we are working as hard as possible on developing our economy. Reducing poverty is a task that can be second to none. This requires many different reforms \u2014 from currency reform to the creation of a central bank to establishing a more liberal trade and investment system than previously existed. It is essential that we expand our economy in an inclusive way and in a way that protects our natural environment at the same time as we embark on our political changes. We are encouraged and heartened by the support given by governments and international institutions. America \u2014 both the United States government and American friends and organizations \u2014 has played a critical role in moving us away from decades of dictatorship to a place where we can now at least see the light at the end of the tunnel. President Obama \u2014 who arrived in our country on Wednesday and leaves for Australia on Friday \u2014 and Secretaries of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Kerry have all been important, but so too have senators and representatives from both sides of the aisle in Congress. Our interest is not in aid funding for our reforms. What we want more than anything is that friends of Myanmar around the world understand the nuances of what is happening and be aware of the big picture: that we are a small nation between giant neighbors, poor and isolated for decades, with entrenched systems and views that have grown up over generations, now trying decisively to move toward peace and democracy. It is a grand experiment, but we are determined to succeed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conspicuous Consumption? Yes, but It\u2019s Not Crazy", "Date": "2014-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewBuyers of these products have plenty of money, of course. But are they different from the rest of us in other ways? It\u2019s an important question. Because income growth in recent decades has been so heavily concentrated at the very top, luxury markets have become the biggest drivers of economic activity around the world. To understand these markets, we must first understand the motives of the customers they serve, and it\u2019s here that many analysts have stumbled.The term was inspired by the economist Thorstein Veblen, who interpreted much consumption by the rich as an attempt to signal their great wealth to others. In his view, the lavish summer mansions of 19th-century industrialists in Newport, R.I., were valued less for their own sake than for the fact that they marked their owners as people of wealth and power.Yet wealth-signaling is probably less important than Veblen thought. Rich people buy luxury goods for many reasons, but even those seeking to display their wealth can almost always find efficient ways of doing so. Why buy a gratuitously expensive good when you can signal your riches just as effectively with an equally expensive good that you actually like? To be sure, billionaires are often willing to spend enormous sums for beautiful things that can\u2019t be duplicated at low cost. But almost none of them would want to buy more of something simply because its price had risen.If BMW and Mercedes sedans had been Veblen goods, their producers could have responded to the Lexus challenge by simply raising their prices. In fact, they have managed to prosper by getting costs under control and making their cars much more appealing.The rich, of course, are willing to spend more, often a lot more, for products that deliver quality improvements they value. But few of them want to throw money away. In that respect, they\u2019re like middle-income Americans, many of whom don\u2019t feel especially prosperous these days. Yet relative both to current world standards and to living standards of the past, middle-income Americans are incredibly wealthy. And when viewed from the perspective of those standards, much of their current consumption is strikingly similar to that of today\u2019s rich.Each day, for instance, many of us consume espresso brews priced at what would be almost a week\u2019s wages in other parts of the world. We\u2019d be offended if someone described these purchases as attempts to display our wealth. And we\u2019d be puzzled if someone said we\u2019d buy even more lattes if our favorite cafe were to raise its prices. The coffee just tastes better, we\u2019d say, and we\u2019re willing to pay a premium for that.Luxury markets are already important, and with inequality poised to grow further, these markets will become ever more so. Those who fail to understand them cannot hope to understand what drives the world economy.That goal will remain elusive until we recognize that the wealthy are essentially similar to the rest of us. They just have a lot more money.The Economic View column last Sunday, about patterns of spending on luxury goods, misidentified the metal from which a Reinast toothbrush, costing $4,200, is made. It is titanium, not platinum.ROBERT H. FRANK is an economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Americans Are Preferring the Lease to the Mortgage", "Date": "2014-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsTHE homeownership rate in the United States plunged during the Great Recession. Many families lost their homes as prices collapsed and unemployment rose.Now the economy is growing, and there are more jobs than ever. Home prices have risen, although they have not fully recovered.But the homeownership rate continues to decline.The Census Bureau reported this week that the rate fell to 64.3 percent in the third quarter, the lowest level since 1994. Since the second quarter of 2004, when the rate peaked at 69.4 percent, the number of homes owned by the people who live in them is virtually unchanged, but the number occupied by renters has risen by nearly 25 percent.Just why that is \u2014 and whether it is a bad thing \u2014 is subject to debate. Before the recession, it was a government goal, promoted by presidents of both parties, to get the ownership rate up. Homeowners were thought to care more, and thus maintain their homes better. They could profit from rising home prices, helping poorer people who bought homes improve their economic status. Changes in lending practices made it much easier for people to qualify for home loans, and soaring home prices made those who still rented appear to have passed up easy profits.After the collapse, renting was necessary for many people who had lost their homes. Some of them lacked the money to cover the down payments that were again required for mortgages, or their credit was damaged enough that they were unlikely to qualify for a mortgage even if they could otherwise afford the cost.There are still worries that homes are expensive, and loans may be difficult to obtain, but there seem to be other reasons people are not lining up to buy.One is that the recession provided a reminder that jobs can be lost and homeownership can make it difficult to relocate. Some unemployed people could not sell their homes to move to more promising areas. And, of course, it was renters, not buyers, who looked wise after home prices collapsed.Whatever the reason \u2014 whether many people cannot afford to buy or whether a lot of them now fear the consequences of buying \u2014 the result has been a liftoff in rentals. And that has caused builders to put far more effort into apartment buildings than they had in recent years.Of course, some apartments are sold as co-ops and condominiums, particularly in big cities, and some single-family homes are rented. But few builders build single-family houses hoping to rent them, while many multifamily properties are constructed with rentals in mind.The accompanying charts show the trend in the homeownership rate since 1980, and the trends in a variety of housing measures since the homeownership rate peaked in 2004. Vacancies leapt in the recession, and while they have declined since 2009, the proportion of vacant units is still higher than it was before the recession began. That fact could be helping discourage single-family housing starts, which remain far below prerecession levels, even though multifamily starts have fully recovered.In early 2006, less than 17 percent of new residences constructed were in multifamily buildings. Over the most recent 12 months, the proportion is more than twice that. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine\u2019s Slow Collapse ", "Date": "2014-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe crisis in Ukraine has reached an impasse. The cease-fire signed in Minsk, Belarus, in September never really took hold, but at least it provided a cover for efforts to reduce the level of fighting and focus on stabilizing and reforming the Ukrainian economy as a prelude to a serious, long-term search for a resolution of the crisis. Now even the fig leaf of cease-fire is gone. Russian armored vehicles are rolling into eastern Ukraine \u2014 disowned, of course, by Moscow. Gunfire is exchanged constantly in and around Donetsk, and Kiev has basically disowned residents of territories claimed by separatists by cutting most government services, benefits and pensions. And though elections to the Ukrainian Parliament on Oct. 26 brought in a new, pro-Western legislature, Kiev is still far from forming a government or producing a viable program of reforms.The United States and the European Union have made clear, and correctly so, that they hold President Vladimir Putin of Russia largely responsible for this state of affairs. He was snubbed at the Group of 20 meeting in Brisbane, Australia. Then Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, once the European leader deemed most cautious in relations with Moscow, assailed him for reviving a Cold War atmosphere 25 years after the Berlin Wall fell.There is no question that by annexing Crimea and arming separatists in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin has done great damage to East-West relations \u2014 and to his country, which finds itself isolated and in economic trouble. The decision on Monday by the European Union to add more separatist leaders to the list of Mr. Putin\u2019s allies barred from Europe may be largely symbolic, but along with the cold reception in Brisbane, it does let the Russian leader know that the West is not about to let him off the hook. That said, it is important to acknowledge that officials in Kiev, and more specifically President Petro Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, have responsibilities they must live up to. Ukraine has been plagued by corruption since it became independent, and the current crisis has made it even more imperative for the leaders to form a government and come up with a credible economic and political strategy.The Ukrainian economy is in terrible shape \u2014 the currency has lost almost half its value against the dollar in 2014, the industrial centers of Donetsk and Luhansk are in separatist hands, coal mines have shut down. The International Monetary Fund has provided emergency aid, but the hard fact is that the European Union and the United States cannot be expected to make substantial commitments until Ukraine provides a clear reform plan and priorities for outside investment. Johannes Hahn, the new European Union commissioner for enlargement, is right to insist that the union will not hold a donors\u2019 conference without this.In addition to an economic strategy, Kiev needs to prepare a plan for loosening central control in a way that might satisfy residents of the eastern provinces. The decision by President Poroshenko to cut government benefits and pensions to residents of areas under the control of Kremlin-backed separatists, though understandable in the circumstances, has left those unable to flee feeling betrayed by Kiev, creating a vacuum for Moscow to fill.There is no question that ordering painful reforms when a country is already on its knees is asking a lot. That is why it is imperative that Western leaders make clear that they will give Kiev substantial assistance only after it embarks on a serious program of economic and political reform. After all, that was what the Ukrainians who took to the streets in December 2013 fought for.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Urban Farmers Trade Goods and Stories at \u2018Crop Swaps\u2019", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 The Bay Area is a culinary never-never land, a place where aspiring apiarists hire beekeeping coaches, and even 7-year-olds can discuss the virtues of Himalayan salt.That is why, on a recent Sunday, a motley group of gardeners bearing windfall harvests of habanero chiles, persimmons and prickly pear cactus fruit gathered for a \u201ccrop swap,\u201d an urban agricultural ritual in which city farmers get together to share their surplus bounty.The crop swap is a sort of farmers market that operates on the barter system. It allows Ms. Bourque to diversify her pantry while socializing with neighbors. \u201cIt forces you to be creative,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a culinarian, I want that flavor,\u201d she said.Neighborly exchanges of goods are nothing new, of course: In the early days of the Plymouth Colony, for instance, the Pilgrims traded English tools, clothing and other items for the Indians\u2019 beaver fur and corn, said Patrick Browne, the executive director of the Pilgrim Hall Museum in Plymouth, Mass.At swaps, planting pointers and other local intelligence can be gleaned: In Oakland, gardeners compared notes on getting rid of aphids without using pesticides and on growing vegetables in the current drought. (Sample tips: For the garden, use water from the children\u2019s minipool and excess water caught in plastic buckets in the shower.)Ms. Han, an avid forager, prepares for the bimonthly swap she started in the city\u2019s Silver Lake neighborhood by hiking through the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains in search of pine needles and fern fronds, which she uses for infusing honey, and roaming city streets to find pink peppercorns, fennel pollen and green walnuts for a liqueur she makes based on an Italian recipe.Ms. Han considers swaps part of the \u201cshareable food movement,\u201d along with canning; community-supported agriculture, in which people place regular orders directly from a local farm; and communal shares in pigs and cows. \u201cFor a lot of people, it\u2019s the next step of eating local,\u201d she said.Richmond has designated the purple tree collard, planted originally by Southern shipyard workers, as its official green, and recently incorporated wellness, including agriculture, into its general plan. Visitors to the main library can check out seeds, including heirloom Italian pole beans and kale. Residents are drawn to seeds and swaps in part because growing produce is less expensive than buying it at a supermarket, Ms. Clifford said.At dusk on a recent evening, about five dozen Rivets from around the city assembled in Lila Skye\u2019s driveway for the Ellis M. Gold Memorial Crop Swap, named for her partner and fellow crop-swapper who died of cancer this year. The mood was jubilant, both because of the Vietnamese cilantro, native currants and other crops being shared, and perhaps equally because of the recent election, in which progressive local candidates defeated those backed by the oil giant Chevron, the city\u2019s biggest employer and taxpayer.As night descended, the swappers, smartphone flashlight apps at the ready, perused a cornucopia of fruits, vegetables and herbs that managed to thrive in microclimates, an oddity of Bay Area life in which columns of fog shimmying through the Golden Gate cause wild variations in temperature, wind and moisture, thwarting newbie gardeners.Charles Daniels, an 80-year-old retired lawn and garden shop owner, came with apples, sorrel and pepino dulce, a South American fruit that tastes like a blend of honeydew and cantaloupe. As he delivered them, a large spider was inching up another swapper\u2019s pink-edged camellia.\u201cI always grow too much,\u201d Mr. Daniels said. \u201cSo I need a source for getting rid of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Mr. Cloud, who is divorced, was not sure how he could do that without relying on his two daughters.\u201cOur virtual village can connect me with people my own age so I can do more things,\u201d said Mr. Cloud, a retired technology consultant. \u201cI worry about being single and getting older.\u201dNow, Mr. Cloud has all the support he needs. He can tap into Capital City Village\u2019s network of more than 100 service companies referred by members. Dozens of volunteers will walk his dog or do yard work. When he wants to meet people, Mr. Cloud can attend house concerts in a member\u2019s home, go to happy hour at the local Mexican restaurant or hear a champion storyteller give a talk. He has also made over 40 village friends.These villages are low-cost ways to age in place and delay going to costly assisted-living facilities, say experts. Yearly membership dues average about $450 nationally, and most villages offer subsidies for people who cannot afford membership costs. Armies of volunteers, who help run many villages, also help lower member costs by doing yard work, picking up prescriptions or taking members shopping or to the airport.At the core of these villages is conciergelike service referrals for members, said Judy Willett, national director of the Village to Village Network. Members can find household repair services, and sometimes even personal trainers, chefs or practitioners of Reiki, the Japanese healing technique. Most important, the villages foster social connections through activities like potlucks, happy hours and group trips.\u201cAs people get older, they face the major dilemma of isolation,\u201d Dr. Agronin said. \u201cHaving a local network of people to engage with opens up whole new worlds. It\u2019s about discovering your strengths and the joy of living.\u201dVirtual village members stay in touch through village websites and email, or by calling local village offices. Many villages also turn to social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to stay in touch, Ms. Willett added.For Susan McWhinney-Morse, who helped to found the village, staying on Beacon Hill was a no-brainer. She loved the community, her neighbors and her elegant rowhouse there. \u201cSo we looked at community resources, such as transportation and health care, and asked ourselves, \u2018How can we access them in an orderly way?\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said. The answer was that virtual retirement villages could address crucial aging issues.People who passionately believe in controlling their lives are best suited to the villages, said Ms. McWhinney-Morse, now 81. \u201cThis is not a social service model,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is how we take care of ourselves. You need time and energy to devote to it.\u201dThe village, she added, \u201cgives you a sense of worth and accomplishment.\u201d\u201cThe whole idea is being engaged and helping one another,\u201d said Mr. Scharlach, who has studied nine retirement villages in California. \u201cThey\u2019re not just services, they\u2019re designed to be communities.\u201d He added that 90 percent of adults wanted to stay in their own homes as they aged, anyway. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of promise in virtual villages,\u201d he said.In the future, baby boomers will push virtual villages into mass acceptance, Mr. Scharlach said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be dependent on families or the government,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the idea of consumers calling their own shots is taking off.\u201dThe village has only about a dozen social events a year, such as maple sugaring parties, though. \u201cWe\u2019re a bunch of loners up here,\u201d said Frank Harnden, chairman of Monadnock at Home. \u201cSo we\u2019re more focused on services, since it\u2019s harder to get together. The municipalities don\u2019t have services in place.\u201dMr. Harnden, 69 and married, was hooked on virtual villages after hearing about them. Like Mr. Cloud in Texas, he was worried about aging. His parents had gone through difficult final years with serious illnesses.A former boy scout, Mr. Harnden also likes lending people a helping hand, and has driven two hours to help a member by doing a 10-minute task. \u201cI like doing a good turn daily,\u201d he said.For all their good works, virtual villages usually are not equipped to handle serious illnesses. A few villages, however, are experimenting with health care-related innovations.Mr. McAleer said that the villages, a fairly new concept, might not last forever, though. \u201cThey could die if the funding isn\u2019t there,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you\u2019re left in a house without a village.\u201dWhy? Virtual villages are essentially nonprofits, and many are only partly supported by member dues. Dues account for over half of funding, Ms. Willett of the Village to Village Network said, and the rest comes from foundations and donations. Already, 15 have closed because of finances, she said. Ms. McWhinney-Morse acknowledged that Beacon Hill Village was \u201cconstantly fund-raising.\u201dFor Mr. Cloud, though, virtual villages offer advantages similar to life insurance, which is bought before it is needed. \u201cThey help baby boomers stay in their homes,\u201d he said, \u201cand not spend all their money on living expenses.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deal on Carbon Emissions by Obama and Xi Jinping Raises Hopes for Upcoming Paris Climate Talks", "Date": "2014-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 The historic announcement by President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China that they will commit to targets for cuts in their nations\u2019 carbon emissions has fundamentally shifted the global politics of climate change. The agreement has given a fresh jolt of optimism to negotiations aimed at reaching a new international climate treaty next year in Paris, where the American and Chinese targets are expected to be the heart of the deal.\u201cFor the world\u2019s biggest emitters to be coming together and announcing concrete numbers, serious numbers, sends a signal to the world,\u201d said David B. Sandalow, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s assistant secretary of energy for policy and international affairs until May 2013. Nearly two decades ago, the world\u2019s first climate change treaty, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, failed to stop the rise of planet-warming carbon pollution in large part because of a standoff between China and the United States, which never signed the deal.But experts and negotiators cautioned that the emissions reductions targets now put forth by the two countries will not be enough to prevent an increase in global atmospheric temperature of 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 Fahrenheit. That is the point where scientists say the planet will tip into a future of dangerous and irreversible warming, which will include the loss of vast stretches of arable land, rapid melting of Arctic sea ice, rising sea levels, extreme droughts, storms and flooding.Under the Kyoto plan, developed economies, including the United States, were to slash their fossil fuel emissions, while developing countries like China were exempt. The United States refused to ratify the treaty, while China went on to become the world\u2019s largest carbon polluter. In the following years, the superpowers remained at an impasse over climate change. Many other governments also refused to cut emissions, arguing that if the world\u2019s top two polluters were not acting, they shouldn\u2019t have to, either.A series of scientific and economic reports have concluded that in order to avoid the 2-degree temperature rise, the world\u2019s largest economies will have to drastically cut carbon emissions within just a few years \u2014 a rate far more rapid than what the United States and China have offered. At the same time, experts negotiating the Paris deal say that an essential component of the treaty will be a tax on industries for their carbon emissions \u2014 an idea that remains a political nonstarter in the United States.Many experts also criticized China\u2019s target of reaching a peak in its carbon emissions by 2030 as little more than business as usual.Many other major emitters \u2014 including Australia, India and Russia, as well as petrostates like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, whose economies depend on continued markets for fossil fuels \u2014 do not appear likely to offer up similar targets anytime soon.As a result, architects of the Paris agreement are adjusting their expectations. Laurence Tubiana, France\u2019s climate change ambassador to the United Nations and a central figure in efforts to forge the Paris deal, said that she does not expect the Paris deal to resemble a traditional top-down United Nations treaty. Instead, she anticipates that it will resemble a collection of targets pledged by individual countries, along with commitments from each government to follow through with domestic action.Rather than a treaty, Ms. Tubiana said she envisions a deal called the \u201cParis Alliance\u201d \u2014 a name that she said conveys \u201call the countries working together.\u201d She also said that she does not see the 2015 Paris deal as the final effort on climate change. Rather, she hopes that it will be the first in an ongoing series of summit meetings at which alliance members reconvene to pledge further reduction targets.Negotiators are also acknowledging that in failing to stave off a 2-degree Celsius temperature rise, a 2015 deal must include provisions to help poor countries adapt to the consequences of climate change, such as droughts, floods and extreme weather. When Hillary Rodham Clinton was secretary of state, she pledged that the United States would help mobilize the flow of $100 billion annually from rich countries to poor countries by 2020 for a United Nations Green Climate Fund.Rich countries will meet next week in Berlin to formally announce their pledges, but so far they are far short of the $100 billion goal.In the meantime it remains unclear how the agreement between the United States and China will influence other major emitters.In India, the world\u2019s third-largest carbon polluter, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has signaled that it will not announce a target for specific emissions cuts. India has long maintained that it should not be required to commit to such cuts.\u201cI doubt the Indian government is going to change anything at this time,\u201d said Rajendra M. Abhyankar, a former Indian ambassador to the European Union and a professor of public diplomacy at Indiana University\u2019s School of Public and Environmental Affairs. \u201cThe action by China might create a notional pressure, but I doubt it will be a great pressure.\u201dStill, Mr. Abhyankar pointed out that Mr. Modi is, like Mr. Xi, interested in pursuing economic growth fueled by low-carbon energy \u2014 if that energy can be obtained cheaply. As the negotiations for the Paris deal play out, India is expected to pressure the United States to provide cheap or subsidized access to renewable energy technology.China has long argued that it should not have to commit to cutting carbon pollution, since its energy consumption helped fuel the rise of its poor rural population to the middle class. But Mr. Xi has laid out a strategy of economic growth that is not directly tied to fossil fuel consumption, in hopes that his country could begin to decouple economic growth from carbon emissions.An earlier version of this article misstated the title of Narendra Modi. He is the prime minister of India, not its president.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Partisan Atmosphere, It Can Even Be Hard to Find Numbers That Agree", "Date": "2014-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoSince his second term began, President Obama has had a solid answer to Republicans\u2019 \u201cWhere are the jobs?\u201d complaint. The jobless rate has fallen two full percentage points.Yet Mr. Obama\u2019s own ratings have fallen, too. So has public confidence that the economy is getting better, even as the economy gets better.Democrats face big losses in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. Indeed, voters now tell pollsters that they trust Republicans more than Democrats on the economy as well as on foreign policy. On top of that, the party not holding the White House nearly always gains in midterm elections \u2014 often a lot.Even more promising for Republicans, most critical contests this year occur in conservative states. Yet voters disdain the Republican Party itself \u2014 more than the Democrats. They disapprove of Congress more than Mr. Obama. For all their problems, Democrats remain close enough in enough places to frustrate Republican hopes of regaining the Senate, for a third consecutive election.In part, the failure of those gains to brighten the public mood reflects the nature of the modern economy. Benefits flow disproportionately to a high-earning minority, while average families struggle. Mr. Obama and fellow Democrats themselves invoke those struggles as the reason to enact their economic proposals. It also reflects the long-term trend toward partisan polarization. Rising numbers of voters interpret economic developments through the prism of political arguments \u2014 furnished, conveniently, by politically tinged news sources.As a result, said John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, \u201cit\u2019s harder for objective features of the political landscape like the economy to make a difference.\u201dForeign policy has frustrated Democrats in a different way. Americans have embraced the individual policy steps Mr. Obama has taken \u2014 winding down wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, shunning ground troops in Syria. But the frightening advance of the Islamic State and its gruesome public executions have led them to conclude Mr. Obama\u2019s overall approach is not working.In response, Democratic candidates lean on fundamental shifts in their party\u2019s direction on social issues. But Republicans have deflected their \u201cwar on women\u201d attacks more effectively than before.Republicans face different headwinds. Aside from history, their greatest fundamental advantage is geography. The retirement of Democratic senators in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia provides prime pickup opportunities in philosophically congenial territory. Other Democrats face re-election in Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina.Yet in some places demography is at odds with geography. A growing proportion of college-educated and nonwhite voters gives Democrats hopes of holding their Senate seat in North Carolina, and snatching a Republican one in Georgia. More difficult to fathom is whether the superiority that Obama-era Democrats have shown in identifying, registering and turning out potential supporters will again render some polls misleading.In states like Alaska and Colorado, they need it to. Since World War II, the veteran political scientist John Petrocik notes, 80 percent or more of election voting has been completely predictable: self-described Democrats backing Democratic candidates, self-described Republicans backing Republicans.What tilts the outcome are decisions by a much smaller number of milder partisans and independents. The most powerful single influence on, and signal of, those decisions is their feeling about the most conspicuous political figure in the country. That is the incumbent president. But the meaning of that fundamental indicator, presidential job approval, is changing, too.Partisan polarization has hardened attitudes toward presidents and reduced their fluctuation. Soon after taking office in 1977, midway through the nation\u2019s late-20th-century electoral realignment, President Jimmy Carter reached 75 percent approval in the Gallup poll. Two years later, his approval rating had fallen to 28 percent. President Obama has never reached either extreme.His approval in the Gallup poll peaked in January 2009 at 69 percent. His lowest three-day Gallup average has been 38 percent. Strategists in both parties agree that his current standing \u2014 40 percent approval, according to Gallup \u2014 is a bad sign for Democrats. It helps explain why Republicans are favored in seven of the 10 most closely watched Senate races.If the outcome of each race matches current averages of public polls, Republicans will recapture a majority with 52 seats. If Democrats win every race in which they trail by three percentage points or less, they will hold it with 52.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greeks Go on Strike Over New Austerity Measures", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Thousands of Greeks walked off the job on Thursday in a general strike to protest further austerity measures, while government officials wrangled with the country\u2019s international creditors over economic policy and whether to extend Greece\u2019s financial bailout.The 24-hour walkout, the first general strike since April, shut down public services, forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights and disrupted public transportation across the country.At issue are proposed civil service layoffs and pension-system changes that the international creditors, known as the troika, have demanded. The European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund have bailed Greece out financially twice since 2010, providing a total of 240 billion euros ($300 billion) in loans to help the country cope with its immense debts. In return, they have insisted that Greece impose strict fiscal discipline, including deep spending cuts and tax increases.Household incomes have since fallen by one-third and unemployment is running at 26 percent, while the country\u2019s debt burden remains proportionally the highest of any country using the euro currency.When Greece unveiled a draft 2015 budget last month that included proposals to ease the economic pain and stimulate the economy with a range of tax cuts, the government appeared to be riding a wave of popular opposition to austerity, which Germany has championed for all of Europe\u2019s struggling economies. Popular protests against austerity policies have been seen in France, Italy, Spain and other countries, and government leaders have begun to push back against the European Union\u2019s fiscal rules.But as the international lenders took a hard line in recent talks with Athens, a sense has grown among Greeks that their country is being punished, and that Greece is being held to tight restrictions while countries like France and Italy were allowed to adopt 2015 budgets that bend or break the rules.The European part of Greece\u2019s bailout program is currently set to expire Dec. 31, and the monetary fund\u2019s part in March 2016. At the Greek government\u2019s request, face-to-face negotiations between Greek officials and the creditors over economic policy and a possible extension to the program resumed in Paris on Tuesday after a six-week hiatus. But the talks ended on Wednesday without an agreement.To meet the creditors\u2019 demands, Athens would have to modify some legal protections for workers and overhaul pensions as well as raising more tax revenue and suspending a program that helps financially struggling Greeks with their tax debts.For its part, the Greek government maintains that the 2015 budget it has presented is already nearly balanced, for the first time in decades, and that further cuts are unnecessary. It bases its view in part on a forecast that the economy will grow by a solid 2.9 percent next year. A parliamentary vote on the budget is scheduled for Dec. 7.Tensions between Greece and its creditors appeared to peak on Thursday. The country\u2019s finance minister, Gikas Hardouvelis, told members of Parliament that the International Monetary Fund \u201cappears indifferent to the political climate in Greece.\u201dHe was apparently referring to growing antagonism between Prime Minister Antonis Samaras\u2019s coalition government and the leftist Syriza party. Syriza opposes any more austerity, and said it would block a scheduled presidential election in February, a move that would almost certainly lead to an early general election that recent polls indicate the leftists would win.The leader of Syriza, Alexis Tsipras, speaking at a protest rally in Athens on Thursday, said the crisis with the creditors \u201cconfirms in the most dramatic way that the strategy of submission and servitude to the irrational demands and desires of the troika is a dead end.\u201dEvangelos Venizelos, the deputy prime minister, said on Thursday that Greece\u2019s exit from the European part of the bailout program might be delayed by \u201ca few days or weeks\u201d due to \u201ctechnical reasons.\u201d But he insisted that there would be \u201cno new European program,\u201d and that if necessary Greece could continue to draw on the monetary fund\u2019s assistance.\u00a0Advertisement"}

Bound at the ankles and moving in sync, they have hustled toward their declared goal of ending economic stagnation.Mr. Kuroda had lobbied hard for Mr. Abe to follow a long-agreed-to timetable to increase the national sales tax, which was meant to double to 10 percent, with the first step coming last April and the second next October. Many saw an implicit deal: Mr. Kuroda would print more money, supporting the economy, and Mr. Abe would raise taxes and tackle the debt.\u201cFiscal discipline is the responsibility of the government and Parliament, not the central bank,\u201d Mr. Kuroda said at a news conference on Wednesday, seeking to dispel talk of a rift. Asked if he thought delaying the tax increase would have the intended effect of encouraging growth and inflation, he added, \u201cThere\u2019s no point going into my personal views.\u201dMasamichi Adachi, a former central bank official who is now an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said it was inevitable that Mr. Abe\u2019s wishes would prevail in any policy rift. \u201cSome people regarded it as a coalition, and in that sense he\u2019s lost standing,\u201d he said of Mr. Kuroda. \u201cBut he totally understands he\u2019s under Abe, not an equal. At the end of the day, the B.O.J. has no independence from the Abe administration.\u201dMr. Kuroda was appointed the Bank of Japan\u2019s governor by Mr. Abe last year. Before that, he built his career at the Ministry of Finance, which has pushed for years to have the sales tax raised. With government revenue constrained by weak growth and deflation, Japan\u2019s debt has grown to the equivalent of two and a half years of economic output, by far the highest in the developed world.Within the ministry, Mr. Kuroda was known as an advocate of aggressive stimulus measures, something that set him apart from more cautious colleagues. Yet compared with others in Mr. Abe\u2019s inner circle, which includes proponents of all-out government spending financed by the central bank, he has been a relative budget hawk.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because he still carries some Finance Ministry DNA, but he\u2019s aware that if the government loses all financial constraint, there\u2019s a risk of a bond-market plunge,\u201d said a former finance ministry official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid antagonizing his former colleague.Gross domestic product contracted at an annualized rate of 1.6 percent, the data showed. That followed a 7.3 percent plunge in the previous quarter, after the first stage of the sales tax increase. The blow to consumer spending from the increase led to the recession and persuaded Mr. Abe to delay the second phase.Mr. Kuroda now appears to be focused on holding Mr. Abe to a pledge to stick to the new 2017 timetable no matter what obstacles the economy throws up. The plan is to balance the budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2020. Many economists say that is unrealistic, but Mr. Kuroda said on Wednesday that it was crucial to try.\u201cThe government has laid out a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan and has set a clear target,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope the government follows this plan diligently and creates a sustainable fiscal structure.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Roll Over, Mahler: U.S. Orchestras Are Shrinking", "Date": "2014-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byComposers have long dreamed of bigger orchestras.But as some American orchestras struggle in the post-downturn economy, they are taking a page from the corporate world and thinking smaller: They are downsizing, shedding some full-time positions while making up the difference with less costly part-time musicians.Such reductions do not mean that they must become chamber orchestras, or even play their fortissimos with less issimo. But they do require a greater reliance on freelance musicians to play large-scale works by, say, a Bruckner or a Mahler or a Richard Strauss.Some of the orchestras say that they can maintain quality by hiring talented musicians to sit in and note that even major, healthy ensembles use substitutes in the case of vacancies or absences. But musicians warn that an overreliance on freelancers endangers the things that make orchestras great: the cohesion that comes from playing together over many years, the performing traditions that are developed and passed down, even the ability to divine in a flash what a familiar conductor is seeking with a cocked eyebrow or a flick of the wrist.Some freelancers took exception. But Mr. Kurth, who stressed in an interview that he respected their talent, said that he had experienced the phenomenon from the other side when, while locked out of his regular job in Atlanta, he was hired as a substitute player with the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington.\u201cI was that player on the outside, struggling to fit in, and not always sure how to anticipate the conductor,\u201d he said.For many years the story of orchestras was expansionary. Tim Carter, a professor of musicology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said that during the 19th century, ensembles expanded dramatically. \u201cThere are three elements which are each feeding off of each other,\u201d he said. \u201cLarger performance spaces requiring larger orchestras, which encouraged composers to write music for larger orchestras \u2014 which required larger orchestras, which required larger concert spaces.\u201dOrchestra size became a point of contention during the lockout in Atlanta, which ended when the orchestra\u2019s management gave up its unusual quest to drop the requirement for a minimum number of players from the contract and players agreed to let vacancies go unfilled longer.\u201cOur policy has been to hire substitute players as needed for the demands of the repertoire \u2014 and concert reviews have been pretty stellar this fall, so it doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue that is noticeable to critics or audiences,\u201d she said in an email. Some well-respected orchestras augment their full-time musicians with other players. The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, which is widely considered one of the best in the world, has an official complement of 99 players. But since the ensemble\u2019s contract envisions four performances a week, and the Met performs seven, the orchestra bolsters its ranks with musicians who are not full-time orchestra members. Of course, being in a city with a large pool of top-notch freelancers helps.Robert J. Flanagan, an emeritus professor of economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who wrote \u201cThe Perilous Life of Symphony Orchestras: Artistic Triumphs and Economic Challenges,\u201d said the recent cuts were a reversal of the growth in the late 20th century, when many American orchestras began paying better and growing larger. \u201cNow, basically, orchestras are trying to change labor from being quite as fixed a cost into a more variable cost,\u201d he said. Bruce Ridge, the chairman of the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, a players\u2019 conference of the American Federation of Musicians, said that such cuts were shortsighted. \u201cOur belief is that no arts organization can cut itself to success, and that no business ever solved a financial problem by offering an inferior product,\u201d he said. Some orchestras are bucking the trend. The Dallas Symphony Orchestra\u2019s contract calls for a minimum of 82 players, but the ensemble has long had more than 90. Jonathan Martin, its president and chief executive, said that having a larger complement helped the orchestra to play late Romantic and contemporary repertoire, fostered artistic cohesion, helped attract talent and simply made it sound better in its hall. \u201cOur consistent practice,\u201d he said, \u201chas been that we fill vacancies when they occur so that we maintain that strength.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Carbon Tax Could Bolster Green Energy ", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneA couple of years ago, the smart money was on wind. In 2012, 13 gigawatts worth of wind-powered electricity generation capacity was installed in the United States, enough to meet the needs of roughly three million homes. That was some 40 percent of all the capacity added to the nation\u2019s power grid that year, up from seven gigawatts added in 2011 and just over five in 2010.\u201cWind is competitive in more and more markets,\u201d said Letha Tawney at the World Resources Institute. \u201cBut any time there is uncertainty about the production tax credit, it all stops.\u201dThese wobbles underscore both the good news and the bad news about the world\u2019s halting progress toward reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that are capturing heat in the atmosphere and changing the world\u2019s climate.The good news is that humanity is developing promising technologies that could put civilization on a low carbon path that might prevent climate disruption.These technologies allowed the Environmental Protection Agency to pass new rules aimed at achieving a 30 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from American power plants by 2030, compared with 2005.The bad news is that civilization is mostly not yet on such a low carbon path. While promising technologies to get there have been developed, it is unclear whether nations will muster the political will and mobilize the needed investments to deploy them.Challenges remain to relying on intermittent energy sources like the sun or the wind for power. Still, experts believe that hitching solar and wind plants to gas-fired generators, and using new load management technologies to align demand for power with the variable supply, offer a promising path for aggressively reducing the amount of carbon the power industry pumps into the atmosphere, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of the nation\u2019s total carbon dioxide emissions.And new Energy Information Administration projections to 2040 show prices for renewables falling even lower. By then, electricity from photovoltaic solar plants could be generated for as little as $86.50 per megawatt-hour, without subsidies. In some areas wind-based plants could produce it for as little as $63.40.Nuclear energy is also becoming more competitive. Without any subsidies, new-generation nuclear power coming on stream in 2040 could cost as little as $80 per megawatt-hour, all costs considered. This is only marginally more expensive than electricity produced with coal or natural gas, even without the added cost of capturing the carbon dioxide.Progress is faltering on several fronts. The precipitous fall in the prices of photovoltaic cells from 2008 to 2012 pretty much stopped in 2013, after rapid consolidation of the industry.The International Energy Agency now projects that installed global nuclear capacity in 2025 will fall 5 percent, to 24 percent below what will be needed to stay on the safe side of climate change. And carbon capture technologies, which will be essential if the world is to keep consuming any form of fossil fuel, remain hampered by high costs, meager investment and scant political commitment.\u201cThe unrelenting rise in coal use without deployment of carbon capture and storage is fundamentally incompatible with climate change objectives,\u201d noted the International Energy Agency in its Technology Perspectives report.Despite the falling costs of renewable energy in the United States, the Energy Information Administration\u2019s baseline assumptions project that in 2040 only 16.5 percent of electricity generation will come from renewable energy sources, up from some 13 percent today. More than two-thirds will come from coal and gas. Without some carbon capture and storage technology, drastic climate change is almost certainly unavoidable.What is necessary to get us on a safer path?White House officials trust that the administration has the tools, including fuel economy and appliance efficiency standards, the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s new limits on power plant emissions and regulations to limit other greenhouse gases.Yet the Energy Information Administration\u2019s projections suggest how hard the task will be. Though they were developed before the Environmental Protection Agency issued its new rules, they included hypothetical outlines that could mimic some of its effects. In one, coal power plants were decommissioned more quickly; in another, subsidies to renewable energy were kept until 2040. In another, the price of renewables fell faster than expected. None of them did much to move the carbon dial.There is one tool available to trim carbon emissions on a relevant scale: a carbon tax. That solution, however, remains off the table.If a carbon tax were to be imposed next year, starting at $25 and rising by 5 percent a year, the Energy Information Administration estimates, carbon dioxide emissions from American power plants would fall to only 419 million tons by 2040, about one-fifth of where they are today. Total carbon dioxide emissions from energy in the United States would fall to 3.6 billion tons \u2014 1.8 billion tons less than today. By providing a monetary incentive, economists say, such a tax would offer by far the most effective way to encourage business and individuals to reduce their use of fossil fuels and invest in alternatives.Is this enough? No. This proposal still leaves the United States short of the 80 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions that the White House is aiming for and that experts consider necessary by 2050 to prevent climatic havoc. But at least it\u2019s in the same order of magnitude.Most important, perhaps, the Energy Information Administration\u2019s estimates make clear that the real constraint lies not in our ability to develop the necessary technologies but in our political will to deploy them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Defying Soviets, Then Pulling Hungary to Putin ", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, as the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall is commemorated Sunday, Hungary is a member of NATO and the European Union and Mr. Orban is in his third term as prime minister. But what was once a journey that might have embodied the triumph of democratic capitalism has evolved into a much more complex tale of a country and a leader who in the time since have come to question Western values, foment nationalism and look more openly at Russia as a model.After leading his right-wing party to a series of national and local election victories, Mr. Orban is rapidly centralizing power, raising a crop of crony oligarchs, cracking down on dissent, expanding ties with Moscow and generally drawing uneasy comparisons from Western leaders and internal opponents to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.\u201cHe is the only Putinist governing in the European Union,\u201d said Joschka Fischer, the former German foreign minister.Some other Eastern European countries, especially Poland, have remained oriented toward the West and still harbor deep suspicions of Russia long after the Cold War ended.But Hungary is one of several countries in the former Soviet sphere that are now torn between the Western ways that appeared ascendant immediately after the fall of the Soviet Union and the resilient clout of today\u2019s Russia. Money, culture and energy resources still bind most regional countries to Russia as tightly as to Europe. Mr. Putin\u2019s combative nationalism is more popular here than what many see as Western democratic sclerosis.Mr. Orban has laid out a philosophical vision and justification for his authoritarian-leaning approach that suggests a long-term commitment to turning Hungary into something quite different from what the West anticipated when the Iron Curtain collapsed and the Berlin Wall came down.In a speech this summer, Mr. Orban declared liberal democracy to be in decline and praised authoritarian \u201cilliberal democracies\u201d in Turkey, China, Singapore and Russia.Hungary, he said, will be \u201cbreaking with the dogmas and ideologies that have been adopted by the West\u201d and will instead build a \u201cnew Hungarian state\u201d that will be \u201ccompetitive in the great global race for decades to come.\u201dAchieving that vision will require tougher stances toward outside forces, including nongovernmental organizations, the European Union and foreign lenders and investors, he said.As recently as 2008, Mr. Orban was a fierce critic of Mr. Putin. But the tone has changed, and the two have grown friendly, with Russia investing heavily in Hungary.\u201cOrban is a populist who acts, doesn\u2019t just talk,\u201d said Peter Kreko, director of the Political Capital Institute in Budapest, an independent research organization. As a result, he added, Hungary \u201ccan serve as a role model in Eastern Europe,\u201d enticing countries like Romania and Bulgaria to follow an authoritarian path.The only difference between Mr. Orban and authoritarians in other countries, Mr. Kreko said, is that \u201cwhen they turn to the West, they try to smile, and Orban doesn\u2019t even try.\u201dThe grand center of Budapest, with its floodlit palaces flickering in the Danube, its sophisticated cafes, crowded theaters and the tourist-choked streets, betrays little sense of authoritarian unease. Yet behind the designer boutiques, young and struggling artists worry about when their state financing might be cut off if they fail to hit the proper note, and government watchdog groups suffer attacks in the state-controlled media while waiting anxiously for the arrival of investigators.In the west of Hungary, German auto plants and other foreign investments create the semblance of a Western European lifestyle. But the feeling is quite different in the rural east, where destitute families, many of them Roma, either toil in one of Mr. Orban\u2019s public works projects or languish in hopes the economy will improve.\u201cHe is the same guy he used to be 25 years ago,\u201d said Zoltan Kovacs, the prime minister\u2019s international spokesman. \u201cHe wants to get rid of the attitudes, the remnants of the former system \u2014 get rid of the attitude that people live on social aid rather than work.\u201dAfter the first free elections in 1990, Mr. Orban was one of several figures who had helped topple communism to jostle for power and influence. Most Hungarians, like others in Central and Eastern Europe, had unrealistic expectations of a quick, good life under democracy and capitalism.They embraced NATO membership, which in 1999 came with the immediate duty to oppose Russia and fight in the war over Kosovo. They chafed at long negotiations, but like seven other former Soviet bloc nations welcomed European Union membership in 2004.Hungarians perhaps felt the hardship of transition more bitterly than most because they had lived better than many others in the Soviet bloc under communism.Hungary had \u201cgoulash communism,\u201d said Balint Ablonczy, domestic political editor of the pro-government journal Heti Valasz. Liberal democracy brought freedom of speech, but also the loss of jobs and of a sense of security, he said.In 1998, voters threw out the Socialist government and handed power to Mr. Orban and his party.But as prime minister in that first term, \u201che overdid the nationalist ideology,\u201d said Julia Lakatos, an analyst at the Center for Fair Political Analysis, a research group in Budapest. In 2002, the Socialists won back power.In 2010, though, voters turned back to Mr. Orban, who appeared to have learned from his previous mistakes.Critics contend that the government uses its purse strings to control the arts and make the news media compliant. Dissent is attacked in the official press and sometimes investigated by the government.Even some conservative supporters are slightly wary of the extent to which Mr. Orban has systematically assembled power: packing courts and the chief prosecutor\u2019s office with loyalists, altering the Constitution and laws so his party dominates.\u201cHe ran as someone who would bring the two sides together in Hungarian politics, but when he got in he said, no, it is the time of the right, the time for revenge on the left,\u201d said Mr. Ablonczy, the editor. \u201cFor him, politics is fighting. I am a man of the right, but my deepest disappointment with this government is this logic of always fighting.\u201dFidesz won a second consecutive four-year term in April, its coalition again eking out a two-thirds majority in Parliament that essentially allows it to pass whatever laws it pleases. The party also won the European Parliament elections in May and local elections Oct. 12, a rare triple in fractious Europe these days.Signs abound of the distance Hungary has traveled since communism\u2019s fall.Laszlo Magas helped organize a Pan-European picnic in Sopron on the Austrian border that, in 1989, provided a first death knell for the Berlin Wall. Hundreds of East Germans used the occasion to pour across the once-sealed frontier.Now a Fidesz member of the Sopron City Council, Mr. Magas refused to discuss politics at all, he says, because foreigners do not understand the country. Western news media, he says, seek out only opponents of Mr. Orban, who are a tiny minority in today\u2019s Hungary.Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Saturday with an article about Hungary\u2019s gradual shift away from democratic capitalism and western values under Viktor Orban misstated the timing of Mr. Orban\u2019s most recent election as prime minister. As the article correctly noted, he was last elected in April \u2014 not in 2010, which was when he was first elected.Palko Karasz and Andras Nagy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Halliburton served barbecued crawfish from Louisiana. A commemorative firearms dealer hawked a \u201cone-million barrel\u201d shotgun emblazoned with the slogan \u201cOil Can!\u201d Mrs. North Dakota, in banner and crown, posed for pictures. The Texas Flying Legends performed an airshow backlit by a leaping flare of burning gas. And Gov. Jack Dalrymple was the featured guest.Traveling through the \u201ceconomically struggling\u201d nation, Mr. Dalrymple told the crowd, he encountered many people who asked, \u201cJack, what the heck are you doing out there in North Dakota?\u201d to create the fastest-growing economy, lowest unemployment rate and (according to one survey) happiest population.\u201cAnd I enjoy explaining to them, \u2018Yes, the oil boom is a big, big help,&apos\u2009\u201d he said.Gov. Jack Dalrymple with Janelle Steinberg, Mrs. North Dakota, at a celebration in Tioga in June for reaching a milestone: one million daily barrels of oil.Outsiders, he explained, simply need to be educated out of their fear of fracking: \u201cThere is a way to explain it that really relaxes people, that makes them understand this is not a dangerous thing that we\u2019re doing out here, that it\u2019s really very well managed and very safe and really the key to the future of not only North Dakota but really our entire nation.\u201dTioga, population 3,000, welcomed North Dakota\u2019s first well in 1951, more than a half-century before hydraulic fracturing liberated the \u201ctight oil\u201d trapped in the Bakken shale formation. So it was fitting that Tioga ring in the daily production milestone that had ushered the Bakken into the rarefied company of historic oil fields worldwide.But Tioga also claims another record: what is considered the largest on-land oil spill in recent American history. And only Brenda Jorgenson, 61, who attended \u201cto hear what does not get said,\u201d mentioned that one, sotto voce.The million-barrel bash was devoid of protesters save for Ms. Jorgenson, a tall, slender grandmother who has two wells at her driveway\u2019s end and three jars in her refrigerator containing blackened water that she said came from her faucet during the fracking process. She did not, however, utter a contrary word.\u201cI\u2019m not that brave (or stupid) to protest among that,\u201d she said in an email afterward. \u201cI\u2019ve said it before: we\u2019re outgunned, outnumbered and out-suited.\u201dNorth Dakotans do not like to make a fuss. Until recently, those few who dared to challenge the brisk pace of oil development, the perceived laxity of government oversight or the despoliation of farmland were treated as killjoys. They were ignored, ridiculed, threatened, and paid settlements in exchange for silence.But over the past year and some, the dynamic seemed to be shifting.Satellite photos of western North Dakota at night, aglitter like a metropolis with lighted rigs and burning flares, crystallized its rapid transformation from tight-knit agricultural society to semi-industrialized oil powerhouse. Proposals to drill near historic places generated heated opposition. The giant oil spill in Tioga in September 2013 frightened people, as did the explosion months later of a derailed oil train, which sent black smoke mushrooming over a snowy plain.The engine of an oil train that derailed and exploded in a collision near the governor\u2019s hometown, Casselton, in December 2013.Then, this year, North Dakotans learned of discovery after discovery of illegally dumped oil filter socks, the \u201cused condoms\u201d of the oil industry, which contain radiation dislodged from deep underground.Suddenly a percolating anxiety came uncorked. \u201cThe worm is turning,\u201d Timothy Q. Purdon, the United States attorney, said in April.It was against this backdrop that on a brisk spring day David Schwalbe, a retired rancher, and his wife, Ellen Chaffee, a former university president, walked headlong into the wind on their way to an F.B.I. office in Fargo.A mile-long oil train was rumbling through downtown. Wordlessly, Mr. Schwalbe tightened his grip on the black binders bearing what he considered evidence, based on an unusual deal involving his family\u2019s land, that Governor Dalrymple had a corrupt relationship with the oil industry.\u2018This has David kind of nervous,\u201d Dr. Chaffee confided. \u201cHe comes from a very below-the-radar culture.\u201dA landfill that takes waste from oil fields, situated close to the banks of\u00a0 the Missouri River.An oil field service vehicle on a recently cut and regraded access road near Watford City, N.D.A battery of oil storage tanks in a production unit.Oil trains for the BNSF Railway pass through Minot, N.D., on their way east from the Bakken.As a boy in the 1950s, Mr. Schwalbe scampered up and down the steep banks of Corral Creek, which flows from Killdeer Mountain into the Little Missouri River. His family homestead lay in the remote region where Theodore Roosevelt sought solitude in what he called the \u201cdesolate, grim beauty\u201d of the Badlands.Like many in his generation, Mr. Schwalbe took for granted the craggy buttes and rippling grasslands, the cottonwoods and poplars, the mule deer and mountain lions. He never anticipated a day when this singular landscape would be ravaged, in his view, by rigs, pumping units, waste pits and pipelines and when he would become an archetypal North Dakotan of a certain age, disheartened by what others saw as progress.As he helped his father run cattle 11,000 feet above the Bakken formation, Mr. Schwalbe came to understand that the family ranch would never sustain his parents and their six adult children. After college, he settled in eastern North Dakota, returning home mostly for \u201cbrandings, hunting and holidays.\u201dEllen Chaffee and her husband, David Schwalbe, gave the F.B.I. what they considered evidence of Governor Dalrymple\u2019s corrupt relationship with the oil industry.When their father died, five Schwalbe siblings \u2014 David, Dennis, Donnie, Donnette and Dale \u2014 sold their shares of the ranch to their brother Delry. All six kept their rights to what lay beneath the surface, however. Just in case.The Schwalbes were following the lead of Burlington Northern Railroad, which once owned every other tract in the area, the legacy of a federal land grant. The railroad eventually sold the surface but retained the minerals, which were managed by its energy company, Burlington Resources, now a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips.\u201cWe figured they knew something we didn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Schwalbe said.Land has long been sliced and diced in North Dakota from generation to generation, with surface ownership severed from the ownership of underlying minerals like coal and oil. Given that mineral rights trump surface rights, this made many residents of western North Dakota feel trampled once the boom began.In 2006, a land man for Marathon Oil offered to lease the Schwalbe siblings\u2019 480 acres of minerals for $100 an acre plus royalties on every sixth barrel of oil.\u201cWithin a few years, people were getting 20, 30 times that and every fifth barrel,\u201d Mr. Schwalbe said. But the Schwalbes did not expect \u201cto see any oil come up out of that ground in our lifetime.\u201dOil companies were just starting to combine horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing to tap into the mother lode of Bakken oil. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really know yet about fracking,\u201d he said.The Schwalbes\u2019 first well was drilled in 2008, their second the next year. Powerless to block the development, Mr. Schwalbe and his wife, nearing retirement, took some comfort in the extra income, the few thousand dollars a month.Then that was threatened, too.On June 20, 2011, the Schwalbes received a letter informing them that Burlington Resources intended to forge a 30,883.94-acre oil production unit that would effectively override their lease agreement with Marathon and subsume their mineral property. In the Bakken, such units are typically 1,280 acres.The Schwalbes were instructed to sign a ratification agreement by August, when a hearing was scheduled on what some started calling \u201cthe mega-unit.\u201d The mega-unit would include the Little Missouri State Park, a patchwork of private, state and federal land beloved for its rugged trails.Initially perplexed by the thick document on their doorstep, the Schwalbes soon grasped a painful point: though they would be ceding control of their mineral property, their consent was not required. Only the owners of 60 percent of the unit\u2019s minerals were needed for ratification, and Burlington, together with the federal government, already met that goal.\u201cThat\u2019s part of why they chose Corral Creek for their scheme,\u201d Dr. Chaffee said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have to deal with a lot of fleas like us, the pesky citizens.\u201dThe proposal had the potential to set an advantageous precedent for the oil industry.As ConocoPhillips officials explained at the August hearing, they aimed to maximize oil recovery by being freed of the \u201cartificial boundary lines\u201d that require 200-foot setbacks from the borders of each standard production unit. Their plan would allow for 23 more wells; for 73,000 more barrels of oil per well; and for consolidated production that would reduce \u201csurface disturbance,\u201d truck traffic and air pollution. It was a proposal \u201cfor the common good,\u201d they said.Members of the North Dakota Industrial Commission, which oversees the oil industry, from left: the agriculture commissioner, Doug Goehring; Governor Dalrymple; and the attorney general, Wayne Stenehjem.Many of the \u201cpesky citizens\u201d were skeptical. \u201cBasically this whole unit scenario is only good for one person, and that\u2019s Burlington,\u201d Leroy Fettig, a land and mineral owner, said at the hearing.In normal units, oil leases expire after a set time if no drilling occurs and owners can then renegotiate on better terms or put them up for bid. But under the proposed unit, Mr. Fettig said, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to drill one additional well to hold all the acreage here theoretically for a very long period of time.\u201dHe worried, too, he said, that Burlington would have unfettered access to a nearly 50-square-mile area and be able to situate well pads, roads and gathering pipelines without having to negotiate easements or rights of way.\u201cMr. Fettig, you\u2019re not an engineer, are you?\u201d a lawyer for Burlington asked him. \u201cYou\u2019re not a geologist?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer, either,\u201d Mr. Fettig replied.Mr. Schwalbe\u2019s lawyers cautioned that he would see a significant drop in his monthly checks, as his royalties would be shared with all the mineral owners in the mega-unit, including ConocoPhillips itself. Down the road, he could recoup that loss, and then some, when wells were developed elsewhere in the unit. But he worried that if, say, oil prices dropped, he would not see that income in his lifetime.Before the hearing, Mr. Schwalbe had approached Lynn D. Helms, director of the state\u2019s Department of Mineral Resources, with a compromise: unitize the property in phases to be fairer to the owners of the dozen existing wells.\u201cI realize in the overall scope of things, my check is pretty small, but it\u2019s got a Social Security check beat all to hell,\u201d Mr. Schwalbe said at the hearing. \u201cI\u2019m hoping with the help of the commission this can be worked out equitably for everybody.\u201dMr. Helms ultimately executes the policies of the three elected officials \u2014 the governor, attorney general and agriculture commissioner, all Republicans \u2014 who make up the North Dakota Industrial Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry. Yet at their monthly meetings, he guides them calmly from vote to vote and rarely encounters dissent. A review by The New York Times of meeting minutes since 2011 found no failed motions concerning oil and gas.\u201cYou feel as if the meetings are a performance, that everything\u2019s sort of done under the table, with a lot of back-room deals,\u201d said Wayde Schafer, the Sierra Club\u2019s sole employee in North Dakota.Private citizens were not the only ones concerned about the mega-unit. \u201cBefore we get all up in arms about it, we have a few questions about what the proposal is and if it is going to benefit us or not,\u201d a state land official wrote to a state oil official in October 2011. \u201cOne of the things that has got us so upset is that they are playing this off as a \u2018done deal.&apos\u2009\u201dIt is essentially a done deal, the oil official responded, saying he expected an order at the Nov. 21 commission meeting would \u201cdispose of this case.\u201dThe Nov. 21 vote was postponed.On Dec. 16, Mr. Schwalbe received a notarized copy of an order signed by Mr. Helms on Dec. 5. Citing \u201cissues in this case of such complexity that additional time is necessary for the commission to render a decision,\u201d it continued the case for 45 days. Mr. Schwalbe breathed a sigh of relief.Lynn D. Helms, the director of the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources, has a dual mission as both an oil industry promoter and its chief regulator.On Dec. 20, however, he got a call from his brother Donnie: The commission had taken up the matter after all, voting unanimously to approve the mega-unit.\u201cWe were just dumbfounded,\u201d Mr. Schwalbe said. \u201cIt seemed so sneaky. You know how sick a feeling it is when somebody takes your property away and gives it to somebody else? And you don\u2019t even get a chance to be there and protest?\u201dMr. Helms\u2019s spokeswoman, Alison Ritter, said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in that order that says we couldn\u2019t act before the 45 days was up.\u201dBefore the vote, Mr. Helms had recommended approval because, he said, the mega-unit would allow for more efficient drilling with fewer multiwell pads and storage tank batteries and \u201ca much smaller impact on the park.\u201d He also cited \u201cone other major positive\u201d \u2014 the recovery of an additional 15 million barrels of oil. During the long discussion that followed, the park was barely mentioned, though Mr. Helms did note that the development called for no tank batteries inside it.In a statement to The Times, Governor Dalrymple\u2019s office said the commission had acted \u201csolely to preserve the Missouri State Park\u2019s viewscape.\u201dUnder the present development plan, there will be up to 28 wells and, despite what was said before the commission\u2019s vote, three storage tank batteries inside park boundaries, Jesse Hanson, a state parks official, said. He called it \u201ca significant intrusion.\u201dNorth Dakota\u2019s small conservation movement has shied away from the confrontational approach that characterizes the antifracking movement elsewhere.\u201cWe all feel we have to issue the apologia that we\u2019re not anti-oil, we just want to see it done responsibly,\u201d Dr. Chaffee said.The industry, as a result, has not grappled with much opposition. \u201cFrom a conservation standpoint, I can name most of those people,\u201d said Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council.In her split-level house overlooking the majestic White Earth River Valley, Brenda Jorgenson, for one, has been a persistent thorn in the side of industry and state officials.\u201c\u2009&aposReluctant landowners\u2019 is the phrase they use for people like us,\u201d her husband, Richard Jorgenson, said, laughing. \u201cReluctant landowners standing in the way of progress.\u201dWhile the Schwalbes were battling the mega-unit, the Jorgensons were trying to get their dirty drinking water tested by the state and then challenging, unsuccessfully, the burial of a waste disposal pit they call a \u201ctoxic tomb\u201d on their property. Later, also unsuccessfully, they fought the construction of a high-pressure gas pipeline in their fields.\u201cWe had a human prayer line to block that pipeline,\u201d Ms. Jorgenson said. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a ticking bomb in your backyard.\u201dOne company, in fact, sued three activist landowners in 2011, seeking damages for trespassing after the men tried to document what they believed was the cover-up of a saltwater spill.A judge dismissed the lawsuit, calling it an effort to \u201cshut these people up.\u201d\u201cIt was a great result, which is kind of rare,\u201d said Derrick Braaten, their lawyer.When Mr. Purdon, the United States attorney, tried to hold oil companies accountable for dead migratory birds, the result was not as satisfactory.For years, federal wildlife agents had been imploring oil companies to cover their waste pits; migratory birds sometimes dived or fell in, dying preventable deaths. But some companies preferred to absorb the cost of citations rather than invest in netting.In 2011, Mr. Purdon decided firmer action was needed. In one sweep through the Bakken, Richard Grosz, a special agent for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, collected 28 dead birds from drilling sites. One, found submerged, had a rock tied to its neck: \u201cThey had tried to deep-six the evidence,\u201d Mr. Grosz said.Six oil companies were charged with misdemeanor violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Mr. Purdon said that within hours of the complaints being filed, he received a call from a friend with a message from top-ranking state officials: \u201cIf Tim thought he would be a federal judge someday, that\u2019s done.\u201dThree companies signed plea agreements. The others fought the charges, and not just in court. During a presidential campaign debate, Mitt Romney, whose energy adviser was chief executive of one of those companies, Continental Resources, mocked the prosecution; The Wall Street Journal called Mr. Purdon \u201cdodo prosecutor of the year.\u201dA federal judge dismissed the cases, saying the bird act was meant to address deliberate killing by hunters and poachers.Since then, Mr. Grosz said, \u201cwe have not gone back out in the oil patch to look for these things. Birds are still being killed. But we\u2019ve quit.\u201dThe mega-unit became a reality on Jan. 1, 2012. Mr. Schwalbe\u2019s first royalty check was reduced by 95 percent.For many months, Mr. Schwalbe and his wife stewed. Then Dr. Chaffee, apolitical during 15 years as president of state universities, decided to get partisan. She joined the Democratic ticket of State Senator Ryan Taylor, a fresh-faced rancher who faced an uphill battle against Mr. Dalrymple for an office under Republican control for two decades.Mr. Dalrymple was running his own first race for governor, having ascended to the post in 2010 after his predecessor was elected to the United States Senate.On the day Mr. Taylor announced Dr. Chaffee\u2019s candidacy for lieutenant governor, Mr. Schwalbe stepped off the sidelines of what his wife called a \u201cnear-hermit existence.\u201d His first campaign assignment was to study the opposition\u2019s year-end financial disclosure report.And there he found what he believed to be an explanation for why the mega-unit \u201ccase of such complexity\u201d had gotten simpler after Mr. Helms signed the Dec. 5 continuation order.On Dec. 5, the Exxon Mobil Corporation PAC contributed $600 to Mr. Dalrymple\u2019s campaign. On Dec. 12, Harold G. Hamm, chief executive of Continental, gave $20,000. On Dec. 17, the Marathon Oil PAC gave $5,000. On Dec. 21, the day after the mega-unit vote, for which he was present, Continental\u2019s Bismarck-based lawyer gave $5,000. On Dec. 27, Denbury Resources contributed $5,000.All these companies held a working interest or lease ownership in the Corral Creek mega-unit. ConocoPhillips, which stood to profit the most, had contributed $1,000 through its PAC in October.Ryan Taylor, at his ranch in Towner. Running as a Democrat, he lost a bid\u00a0 for governor in 2012 and for agriculture commissioner this year.The governor\u2019s office declined The Times\u2019s requests to interview him, and provided a written statement. It did not verify or deny The Times\u2019s calculation of contributions or respond to specific questions about allegations of conflicts of interest.Over the campaign, Mr. Dalrymple would collect over $93,000 from those with a direct interest in the mega-unit and a total of about $550,000 from oil-related executives, lawyers and political action committees. That represented a quarter of the $2.16 million in contributions over $200 (the bar for disclosure) to Mr. Dalrymple.Governors in top oil-producing states typically get industry contributions. In North Dakota, though, the governor\u2019s relationship to those contributors\u2019 interests is uniquely direct because he is chairman of the Industrial Commission.In California, by contrast, the Department of Conservation supervises the industry. In Alaska, it is a commission appointed by the governor. In Texas, it is the elected Railroad Commission.\u201cNorth Dakota\u2019s is a hugely defective setup,\u201d said David C. Thompson, a lawyer in Grand Forks. \u201cOur elected officials regulate companies they get contributions from and companies they own stock in. Nobody ever recuses himself; they just vote.\u201dIn mid-2012, Mr. Schwalbe approached Mr. Thompson at a campaign event. The lawyer happened to be researching state corruption laws on behalf of Brad Crabtree, a Democratic candidate for the Public Service Commission, which, in addition to regulating utilities, oversees oil pipeline siting and mine reclamation.Mr. Crabtree, who went on to lose, had declined to accept contributions from the energy industry and sought to shine a spotlight on \u201ccomprehensive, institutionalized conflict\u201d in the way North Dakota\u2019s regulators conducted business.Mr. Thompson, meanwhile, discovered a Watergate-era bribery statute that made it a felony for public officials to accept \u201ca thing of pecuniary value\u201d from any \u201cactor\u201d with an imminent or pending proceeding before them. No quid pro quo was necessary; the mere possibility that the official\u2019s \u201cperformance or nonperformance\u201d of his duties could be affected made it a crime.Therefore, Mr. Thompson concluded in a legal analysis posted on the blog NorthDecoder.com, Mr. Dalrymple, in the case of the mega-unit, had taken bribes.That bombshell landed with a fizzle. The state media took no interest, Mr. Taylor said, and, \u201cas a candidate behind in the polls, who would be accused of trying to make sheer political hay,\u201d he declined to use the allegations.Then Mr. Thompson got a call from Paul Sorum, a founder of North Dakota\u2019s Tea Party running for governor as an independent..\"He said, \u2018Are you aware of the citizen-initiated grand jury process?&apos\u2009\u201d Mr. Thompson related. \u201cYou need 10 percent of voters\u201d in a county to sign a petition.A week before the election, a petition filed in Dunn County, where the mega-unit is, asked a judge to convene a grand jury to determine whether Mr. Dalrymple could be prosecuted for bribery.On Election Day, Mr. Taylor lost by nearly 30 points. Even before he had formally announced his candidacy for governor, the State Legislature had eliminated two rural districts, one of them his. \u201cThat was a dirty deal,\u201d he said.A couple of weeks later, a judge dismissed the grand jury petition, finding a few signatures illegitimate.The conservationists of North Dakota often express nostalgia for the strong stance that former Gov. Arthur A. Link took during a coal-mining boom in the 1970s. He pledged to protect the state for future generations \u201cwhen the landscape becomes quiet again.\u201d\u201cWhen the draglines, the blasting rigs, the power shovels and the huge gondolas cease to rip and roar, and when the last bulldozer has pushed the last spoil pile into place and the last patch of barren earth has been seeded to grass or grain, let those who follow and repopulate the land be able to say, \u2018Our grandparents did their job well,&apos\u2009\u201d he said.An oil well being drilled inside the mega-unit.The current governor is better known for his business acumen than his rhetoric. John Stewart Dalrymple III, 66, is something of a patrician, a rarity in North Dakota. His state biography says he grew up \u201con the family farm in Casselton,\u201d N.D., but he was born in Minneapolis and attended a private day school there before boarding at St. Paul\u2019s School in New Hampshire and going on to Yale, like his father before him.The 140-year-old family farm once stretched over 32,000 acres, making it \u201cthe largest cultivated farm in the world,\u201d according to North Dakota State University archives. More recently, Dalrymple Farms has been one of the state\u2019s largest recipients of federal commodity subsidies.Mr. Dalrymple was more of an agribusinessman than the typical North Dakota farmer: \u201cI\u2019m not saying he never greased a combine, but his farm office was in the National Bank building in Casselton and he\u2019d wear a white shirt to work,\u201d said Bill Patrie, a specialist in rural cooperatives who worked with Mr. Dalrymple to establish a farmer-owned pasta co-op.Mr. Dalrymple served as co-op chairman through eight years in the legislature and a decade as lieutenant governor. While lieutenant governor, he championed the cooperative\u2019s conversion to an investor-owned firm in which he was a major shareholder, and then oversaw its sale to a Canadian conglomerate, making $3.77 million.\u201cIn essence, Jack converted a quasi-public local institution into a personal, one-time profit maker and sold it to a multinational corporation,\u201d Mr. Patrie said, adding, \u201cI believe he used his public office for private gain.\u201dBut Mr. Patrie said the local news media and farmers\u2019 groups did not raise objections.\u201cWe North Dakotans trust our politicians \u2014 even when they sell us out,\u201d he said.Many Democrats were incensed when Edward T. Schafer, a Republican former governor, toured the state in an oil industry-sponsored \u201cFix the Tax\u201d bus in 2011, arguing that oil taxes should be lowered to prevent the boom from going bust. The effort failed; afterward, Mr. Schafer was named to the board of Continental Resources, and awarded a compensation package, mostly stock, valued at $700,000 that year.According to Mr. Dalrymple\u2019s 2012 statement of interests, he and his wife own oil stock themselves, including unspecified amounts in at least one company with regular business before his Industrial Commission: Exxon Mobil, a top state producer through its subsidiary XTO.Because XTO was a working interest owner in the mega-unit, Mr. Schwalbe believed the governor himself could be said to have \u201cowned a piece of the property.\u201dIn early February 2013, Mr. Schwalbe filed a second grand jury petition.At the same time, state legislators pushed for a higher bar for citizens to convene grand juries so that innocent people would not be subjected to criminal charges, as one legislator put it. They succeeded. And a judge threw out the second citizens\u2019 petition.Mr. Schwalbe felt defeated, but pockets of resistance were beginning to develop as the boom intensified.Early this year, an irritated crowd at a Mountrail County Commission meeting confronted Mr. Helms, the director of mineral resources, asking why state officials had approved an oil waste pit in the wellhead protection area for a municipal water supply.Mr. Helms explained that his inspectors had had the wrong maps, adding, \u201cWe strive for perfection, but since we\u2019re human, we have to settle for excellence.\u201dThat came across as cavalier to the Rev. Carolyn Philstrom, a young Lutheran pastor, who shot off a letter to the editor of a local newspaper. \u201cI baptize babies with that water,\u201d she wrote, though she subsequently tempered her outspokenness because it bothered parishioners.When the illegally dumped oil filter socks were discovered, Rick Schreiber, the director of solid waste for McKenzie County, became the rare official voicing outrage at what he called oil company recklessness and state inaction.\u201cI\u2019m not here to make friends with the oil patch,\u201d Mr. Schreiber said in February as trucks rolled over the radiation detector he had installed at his landfill. \u201cIf I\u2019m the guy that has to beat the hornets\u2019 nest with a stick, I\u2019ll do it.\u201dFlares burning at an oil production site in Watford City, N.D. Residents who live close to flares complain of both the noise and the wasted fuel.This year, the Industrial Commission has gradually taken steps to assert greater authority over the industry.After applications to drill near a 19th-century battlefield and near the Elkhorn Ranch in Theodore Roosevelt National Park stirred unusually heated public debate, the commission established special procedures including a public comment period for drilling on public, though not private, land near 18 \u201careas of interest.\u201d The petroleum industry had resisted, cautioning that \u201cradical environmentalists\u201d would exploit the comment period to obstruct development. But conservationists saw the measure as a watered-down version of a proposal that already offered too little, too late.Next, after more than a dozen mineral owners filed anti-flaring lawsuits, the commission moved to clamp down on a longstanding problem. Some 30 percent of the natural gas produced in the state \u2014 compared with less than 1 percent nationwide \u2014 was being treated as a byproduct of oil production and burned off.At a hearing in April, Dr. Lyle Best, a pediatrician, said he lived downwind of tall flares that roared like jetliners and flickered light through his bedroom window.Rick Schreiber, the director of solid waste for McKenzie County, with an oil filter sock, one of the \u201cused condoms\u201d of the oil industry, at the county landfill.\u201cOur real annoyance, however, is the understanding that these two flares have burned off over 60 million cubic feet of natural gas in the past six months and are continuously wasting enough energy to heat hundreds of homes at the same time that many people in our country are sleeping on the street, and at least one North Dakotan died of hypothermia this winter,\u201d he said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t even address the issue of carbon dioxide and other pollutants.\u201dWhen the commission voted in July to require \u201cgas-capture plans\u201d and impose production restrictions if companies did not meet them, Mr. Dalrymple said, \u201cI hope that what we do today, we are serious about.\u201dAnd when QEP Resources petitioned to create its own mega-unit, Mr. Dalrymple dissented from the 2-to-1 vote of approval. In its statement, the governor\u2019s office said the QEP mega-unit, unlike the Corral Creek one, would not have provided a \u201cbenefit to conservation efforts.\u201d QEP later dropped its plan.In April 2014, a cleanup crew equipped to handle hazardous radiation removed a large cache of filter socks illegally dumped inside an abandoned fuel station in Noonan, N.D.Oil filter socks can contain radiation dislodged from deep underground.At the entrance to the mega-unit, on the dirt access road built for the hundreds of trucks that now traverse what used to be pristine pastures, Mr. Schwalbe\u2019s cousin, Candyce Kleemann, sat at the wheel of her pickup, photographs on her dashboard.\u201cThese are the before pictures: before the invasion,\u201d said Ms. Kleemann, who lives and ranches inside the unit. \u201cWhen we fought the unit, they told us there would be minimal damage or changes. But it\u2019s a different landscape. Look, that\u2019s our new saltwater injection well.\u201dShe pointed to a sign: \u201cDanger: H2S. Poisonous gas.\u201d And to another: \u201cCaution: power lines.\u201d Her own sign, proclaiming her land to be private property, made her snort.\u201cThat one\u2019s useless,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re even more powerless than surface owners in the rest of the oil patch. In this unit, oil can go wherever they want here, put roads and gathering lines wherever they want, bury crud in our ground. The state does not seem to care.\u201dIn 2012, Ms. Kleemann\u2019s husband, Robert, a Dunn County commissioner, complained to the state that the unit development plan was being modified, putting 11 wells within a half-mile of six homes.When an official responded that the changes appeared necessary for topographical reasons, Mr. Kleemann wrote back, \u201cI do not think you could understand our concerns unless we could put a drilling rig on each side of your house so you could listen to the clang of pipes, the roar of motors, the constant beep of the horn and be awakened in the morning to the driller giving orders over the bullhorn and you could try to sleep with the constant noise of Jake Brakes.\u201dState officials were more concerned that ConocoPhillips was not developing the unit as aggressively as promised. Now the pace has picked up, with several dozen wells drilled in 2013 and several dozen more this year.In April, when the Schwalbes laid out their concerns to two F.B.I. agents in a windowless room in the Fargo federal building, they felt encouraged. The agents seemed apprehensive \u201cbecause of the individual involved,\u201d Mr. Schwalbe said, but gradually \u201ctheir interest was piqued.\u201d\u201cThey thanked us for coming forward,\u201d he said afterward, surprised.In the summer, though, a final meeting with the agents left them disheartened. The investigation remained open, they were told, but prosecutors saw no federal case to be made.Mr. Schwalbe, who had wagered that \u201cthis year is going to be better because people are starting to get mad,\u201d was disappointed by the November elections, too.His wife\u2019s former running mate, Mr. Taylor, ran again, this time for agriculture commissioner, proposing that oil well setbacks from homes be increased to a quarter-mile from 500 feet and that pipelines be fitted with antispill devices. But he lost, as did a ballot initiative to set aside tax revenues for conservation. With considerable oil industry backing, the agriculture commissioner was re-elected, as was the attorney general, extending the mandate of the current Industrial Commission.Mr. Schwalbe does not like to visit Corral Creek anymore. The landscape is, in his eyes, scarred, the tranquillity spoiled. His new outspokenness led him into an uncharacteristic public role as spokesman for a new group, North Dakota Rural Voters.\u201cI never thought I\u2019d be involved in anything like this,\u201d he said. \u201cAt my age, I thought we\u2019d just slide through the rest of our lives. But at a certain point, it became a point of pride for me personally and me as a North Dakotan. I don\u2019t like people taking things that don\u2019t belong to them, not my money, not my property, not my state.\u201dNorth Dakota took on the oversight of a multibillion-dollar oil industry with a regulatory system built on trust, warnings and second chances.In 2011, Andrew J. Rohr and two other workers were badly burned when a towering derrick erupted into flames and toppled. \u201cI was a human torch,\u201d Mr. Rohr said.Michael Wines contributed reporting from Bismarck, N.D.Sources: North Dakota Department of Health; analysis by The New York Times; Satellite imagery courtesy of Google; final image in flyover by Jim Wilson/The New York Times.\nProduced by Gregor Aisch, Hannah Fairfield, John Niedermeyer, Matt Ruby and Jeremy WhiteAn article on Monday about the politics surrounding an unusual land deal in the North Dakota oil country described incorrectly, in some editions, a redistricting plan that eliminated the State Senate seat of Ryan Taylor, a Democrat who ran against Gov.

{"Headline": "3rd-Quarter Growth Rate Is Revised Up, to 3.9% ", "Date": "2014-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe nation\u2019s economic output grew at an even faster rate during July, August and September than the government initially estimated, giving the economy its strongest six-month performance in more than a decade.The shift in the annual rate of growth to 3.9 percent from 3.5 percent was mainly because of a bigger-than-expected jump in consumer spending, bolstered by a modest increase in reported business investment.\u201cThe upward revision was almost exclusively due to much stronger buying by consumers,\u201d said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company. \u201cI find that very encouraging coming into the commercial side of the holiday seasons.\u201dWhile the economic recovery, now into its sixth year, has been lackluster, Mr. Tannenbaum noted that in four of the last five quarters, \u201cgrowth has moved to a much stronger level.\u201d This 3.9 percent growth rate comes on the heels of a 4.6 percent jump in G.D.P. during the second quarter, after a freezing winter that helped cause the nation\u2019s output to drop at a rate of 2.1 percent in the first three months of the year.Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, agreed that \u201cthe trend has shifted higher,\u201d although he said he doubted that G.D.P. growth could be sustained at the third quarter\u2019s nearly 4 percent pace.Falling gasoline prices, which left Americans with more cash for other purchases, partly explain why people could spend more, economists agree.The G.D.P. figures made the drop in the Conference Board\u2019s latest measure of consumer confidence to 88.7 in November from 94.1 in October all the more of an anomaly. Other surveys, including the Rasmussen index, have shown confidence surging.Consumer spending is a closely watched figure because it accounts for 70 percent of economic activity and must advance at a steady rate to power the economy forward.But it is business investment, including the rise and fall of inventory accumulation, that most influences economic turning points. Nonresidential investments grew by 7.1 percent, while investment in equipment reached 10.7 percent.\u201cThe thing I was most encouraged by was the pickup in business investment spending,\u201d said Jerry Webman, chief economist at Oppenheimer Funds, \u201cThat says business confidence is building, and that we should expect to see hiring continue.\u201dGovernment spending, which grew at a 4.2 percent pace, turned out not to be quite as substantial as the Commerce Department initially estimated.The economy\u2019s growth has steadily reduced the unemployment rate. Last month, the official rate hit 5.8 percent, a drop of 1.4 percentage points from a year earlier. Employers have added more than 200,000 jobs for nine months in a row, according to Labor Department figures.And signs are growing that the quality of jobs is improving. A report released on Monday by Julie Hotchkiss, a research economist and senior policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, disputed claims that many of the newly created jobs were part-time positions.But the job market is still far from fully employing millions of Americans who want to work, one of the main reasons wages have stagnated, barely keeping up with the persistently low rate of inflation.In addition, the housing sector is well below historical standards. Residential housing investment was up 2.7 percent, according to the revised G.D.P. figures.At the same time, the Case-Shiller Home Price Index of 20 major cities, released on Tuesday by Standard & Poor\u2019s, rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.8 percent in September, a sharp slowdown from the double-digit pace prices were rising earlier this year.\u201cThe overall trend in home price increases continues to slow down,\u201d David M. Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in a statement. \u201cThe Northeast region reported its first negative monthly returns since December 2013.\u201d\u201cThe only region showing any sustained strength is the Southeast led by Florida; price gains are also evident in Atlanta and Charlotte,\u201d he added. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a study on household debt and credit, also found that new and refinanced mortgage loans hit their lowest level since 2000, largely because of a bump in interest rates last year.Still, the American economy is one of the few bright spots in the global economy. In recent weeks, Japan\u2019s central bank and Europe\u2019s have moved to nudge their sagging economies forward by lowering interest rates. In the United States, the latest G.D.P. figures have given economists one more reason to believe that the Federal Reserve will start moving in the opposite direction next year.As Mr. Tannenbaum said, Tuesday\u2019s report \u2014 the second of three increasingly refined measures the government issues on quarterly economic activity \u2014 may \u201cbring forward the day where the Fed can think about normalizing interest rates.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Chief of Viacom Says Nielsen Is Outdated", "Date": "2014-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRatings for Viacom\u2019s networks, which include MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, tumbled 15 percent during the quarter that ended in September, according to Nielsen data compiled by Bernstein Research. Those ratings challenges led Viacom\u2019s domestic ad sales to decline 5 percent for the quarter, the company reported Thursday.Philippe Dauman, Viacom\u2019s chief executive, said a large portion of the viewing of Viacom networks was through mobile apps, gaming devices and other platforms that traditional Nielsen ratings do not include.\u201cWe are in a transitional moment with existing measurement services that have not caught up to the marketplace,\u201d Mr. Dauman said during a conference call. \u201cThey are trying to catch up. I am sure they will eventually catch up. In the meantime, we are not waiting for that.\u201dMr. Dauman said about 30 percent of Viacom\u2019s domestic advertising revenue was not dependent on Nielsen ratings, such as sales for mobile apps, personalized advertising and sponsorships. In the next three years, the company should increase that portion to about 50 percent of its domestic ad sales, he said.Net earnings totaled $732 million, or $1.72 a share. That compared with $804 million, or $1.68 a share, during the same quarter last year.Nielsen long has dominated in TV ratings, and its statistics are the currency on which nearly $70 billion in advertising is sold each year in the United States.The company has faced a wave of backlash in recent years, as a series of TV and advertising executives criticized its ability to measure the new ways people watch television. That criticism heightened in recent weeks after the company acknowledged that it had been reporting inaccurate ratings for broadcast networks for seven months.Nielsen called on the industry to adopt standards to capture viewing across all screens. The group has announced a series of initiatives that it promises will capture digital viewing. Nielsen had said that it would include mobile viewing in its traditional TV ratings this fall, although this has yet to be done.\u201cWe\u2019re committed to delivering comprehensive measurement, and we are going to follow the consumers wherever they go and however they view on any device,\u201d said Laura Nelson, a Nielsen spokeswoman. \u201cThe advertisers and the programmers ultimately determine what measurement currency to trade on.\u201dViacom has attributed ratings declines to Nielsen before. Three years ago, its Nickelodeon network suffered a period of double-digit ratings declines. The network later said that the plunge was because a generation of viewers outgrew Nickelodeon and loyal viewers left the network at the same time that competition from other TV and digital outlets grew.Viacom is not alone in its advertising woes. Other media companies have reported declines in domestic advertising revenues in recent weeks. In total, national television advertising revenues dipped about 0.5 percent in third quarter of 2014, the worst quarter for advertising growth since the recession, according to MoffettNathanson Research.Media executives and analysts have pinned the weakness on ratings issues, advertisers seeking more flexibility with their budgets, the increasing threat from digital rivals and the broader economy.\u201cIt is clear that the trends continue to deteriorate not just for Viacom but for most of its peers,\u201d Michael Nathanson, a media analyst with MoffettNathanson said in a research report.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Doing Good in Harm\u2019s Way", "Date": "2014-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial SectionAs Dr. Rick Sacra prepared to fly to Liberia to treat patients in the Ebola zone, he prepared for the worst.He sat down with his wife, Debbie, at their home in Worcester, Mass., for a conversation both somber and direct, showing her a spreadsheet of insurance and family assets. \u201cWe talked about the risk that I could get Ebola, and I could die.\u201d Colleagues from SIM, the group that he works with, had suggested he would most likely be safe. One told him, \u201cIf you follow the protocols, you won\u2019t get it.\u201dIn the anxiety and anger swirling around the questions of quarantine for health care workers returning from West Africa, the quiet heroism and determination of people like Dr. Sacra and the organizations they work for can be forgotten. Dr. Sacra, who went to Liberia after two colleagues there, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, contracted Ebola, chose to go to one of the world\u2019s toughest places to help some of the world\u2019s most desperate people, serving an organization that has done such work for decades.Other kinds of risk seem to be rising in hot spots like Syria, where aid workers and journalists have been beheaded by Islamic State militants. Doing good no longer provides a protective shield, said Jim Lanning, director of applications and logistics for International Relief and Development, a group in Arlington, Va. While relief or missionary work has never been risk-free, he said, being part of an organization dedicated to helping people usually \u201cwas a free pass,\u201d he said.\u201cNow it\u2019s a target,\u201d Mr. Lanning said.Ms. Rilling said that although many potential donors were motivated by hands-on activities like drives for clothing or canned goods, \u201ccash is the best donation\u201d because it provides groups the flexibility to respond to changing circumstances and to buy goods locally, which can save money and help local economies.\u201cWe go to areas where people, a lot of people, are in the ditches of life,\u201d said Ken Isaacs, vice president for programs and government relations at Samaritan\u2019s Purse.\u201cThere\u2019s risk involved; there\u2019s a lot of human suffering involved,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of our ministry. That\u2019s who we are.\u201d Cushy places, Mr. Isaacs said, don\u2019t need the organization\u2019s help \u2014 though, he added jokingly, \u201cSydney would be nice.\u201dAs the disease worsened in Monrovia, Liberia, where Samaritan\u2019s Purse worked with SIM, crowd unrest grew into riots, with people \u201cthreatening to burn the hospital down and threatening to hurt us,\u201d Mr. Isaacs said. And unlike a war, where the areas of greatest risk can be mapped out \u2014 a sniper\u2019s alley here; a border clash there, with artillery in heavy use \u2014 a disease like Ebola is \u201cinsidious,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s stealthy, like a torpedo. You don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to happen \u2014 and you\u2019re waiting. You\u2019re waiting.\u201dStill, SIM is well accustomed to dealing with illness and chaos, said Bruce Johnson, the president of SIM USA. \u201cThis is, unfortunately, not new to us in Liberia,\u201d a country that has been torn by civil war and a breakdown in basic services, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been there since the 1950s.\u201dThe group tries to build institutions that can be run locally, he said. \u201cOur philosophy is work with those people in that country \u2014 train and equip them, and as quickly as possible turn that over to them and work alongside them in a collaborative way.\u201dSIM has a 136-acre campus in Monrovia with a hospital and other services. Its initial Ebola care center had 75 beds, \u201cand that was overrun,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. As Ebola continued to spread, the group opened part of the campus to Doctors Without Borders, which built and ran an Ebola center with 200 beds.It was on that campus that Dr. Sacra and Ms. Writebol, a hospital worker with SIM, became infected, along with Dr. Brantly, a doctor with Samaritan\u2019s Purse who was working at the SIM hospital.Ms. Writebol said she had been in Africa for a year when Ebola appeared to be making its way to Monrovia, where she was working on the SIM campus. The group started evacuating expatriate staff members from facilities when she and Dr. Brantly fell ill. Ms. Writebol\u2019s husband, who directs electrical and water services for the campus, could only stand by as her treatment began. The torments of the disease continued after she was taken to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta for treatment.\u201cThere were nights when I would lay my head on my pillow,\u201d she recalled, \u201cand you would think, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll wake up in the morning.' \u201dShe experienced peripheral neuropathy \u2014 numbness, tingling and pain in the extremities. \u201cIt was very painful \u2014 so painful that at night while I was at Emory, they would have to pull the sheet off the tops of my toes. Even the weight of the sheet was just excruciating,\u201d she said. She had burning sensations in her feet that health care workers treated with ice packs.Now, she says: \u201cI\u2019m thankful I can walk. I\u2019m just thankful for my life.\u201dDr. Sacra went through torments as well. \u201cIt was really pretty awful,\u201d he said. But comparing himself to Ms. Writebol, he said, \u201cI think she was quite a bit more sick than I was.\u201dHe and Ms. Writebol, he joked, are part of a \u201csmall, exclusive club.\u201dBut, he said, he felt that he had to go to Liberia \u2014 he could not just let a nation where he had worked for much of the last 15 years languish. \u201cIt would be like watching something bad happen to your hometown.\u201d He added, \u201cI feel like, hey, if I can do something about that, I feel that\u2019s my God-given responsibility to take care of my neighbor.\u201dEach group finds its niche in a crisis. At the Healey International Relief Foundation in Lumberton, N.J., Robert T. Healey Sr., the founder, said his group expected to spend more than a million dollars on efforts to help people in Sierra Leone. The group is sending personal protection equipment and gloves while sticking with long-term projects like running a hospital it built with partners and developing a plant to produce bagged intravenous fluids. The Healey foundation has been working with Christian churches and building on longstanding relationships in Sierra Leone since first becoming involved at the turn of the century.The Healey family fortune, derived from a yacht-building business founded by Mr. Healey and his brother, as well as real estate and oil and gas interests, helps finance projects in some of the world\u2019s poorest locales. \u201cWe take so much for granted here,\u201d Mr. Healey said.An infected cut can be fatal \u201cout in the bush country,\u201d he said. In the developed world, \u201cyou go down to the drugstore, you buy some Neosporin, you put it on your arm and it solves the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cOver there, they have nothing. I mean nothing.\u201dHe is 85 years old, he says, and has provided for his wife, seven children and 11 grandchildren. But, he said, \u201cHow do you go to sleep at night when there are children in Sierra Leone who are dying?\u201dAnother relief organization, International Medical Equipment Collaborative or IMEC, of North Andover, Mass., gathers surplus medical equipment and supplies for relief organizations working around the world. \u201cI\u2019m fairly confident this is what I was put on this earth to do,\u201d said the group\u2019s founder, Tom Keefe.The group organizes \u201cprotective equipment suites\u201d \u2014 surgical gowns, gloves, masks and more in the proper proportions \u2014 that can be loaded onto pallets and shipped out by truck, sized so that 20 can fit in a shipping container. These can then be delivered directly to hot spots, ready to use. Mr. Keefe has teamed with Mr. Lanning of International Relief and Development, an organization that handles shipping for groups like his.Not every charitable organization working on the ground is fighting disease. Playing to Live is running a pilot program in Liberia for children orphaned by the disease, hoping to aid their recovery with art therapy and play. The project is headed by Alexis Decosimo, a doctoral student in East Tennessee State University\u2019s College of Public Health, who says the therapy can \u201cbuild resiliency and hope, and create a safe place to process trauma.\u201dBut risk is ever-present. According to the latest report from Humanitarian Outcomes, an organization funded by U.S.A.I.D., 2013 set a record for violence against civilian aid workers, with 251 attacks that killed 155 people and wounded 171; 134 were kidnapped. According to the group, those figures for aid worker victims represent a 66 percent increase over 2012.Groups try to stay as long as they can in difficult situations, Mr. Salloum of SIM said, but there is a point when it is time to go. \u201cI was leading our team in South Sudan for the last year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were forced out of the country twice in the last year.\u201d With battles that led to pro- and anti-government forces shelling and destroying towns, \u201cwe had to evacuate people who were in harm\u2019s way.\u201d Working with Samaritan\u2019s Purse, they pulled out for a time, Mr. Salloum said.Trevor Hughes, the director of risk management and global security for International Relief and Development, said a job like his was \u201cmore common than it used to be.\u201d Not all groups or individuals in a conflict zone understand that a particular logo on a truck \u201cmeans you\u2019re not a part of the conflict, or whatever the situation is, and everybody loves you because you\u2019re there to improve the situation.\u201d\u201cBad things happen and good people are targeted \u2014 directly targeted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what color your skin is or what passport you hold.\u201dGroups like his constantly evaluate the level of risk. \u201cThere are some very clear principles\u201d set by each group, he said, based on common ideas of how to evaluate risk that govern the time to pull up stakes. Ultimately, he said, the question comes down to, \u201cWhat are we achieving here?\u201dDifferent missions will evaluate risk differently, he said. If something like a civil war breaks out, a group might suspend its childhood vaccine campaign. But if the group is running a war hospital, it is \u201cliterally saving dozens of lives, every hour of the day and night,\u201d Mr. Hughes said. \u201cThat goes to the core of what they do.\u201dMany of those who work with Ebola patients and come back to the United States find themselves facing a different set of problems: the spreading hysteria over the disease and efforts to impose mandatory quarantines. Underlying these issues is fear of a disease that is still poorly understood, even by many professionals, Dr. Sacra said.After surviving Ebola and being released from the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, he came down with a cough, a fever and conjunctivitis back home in Massachusetts. As he described it, \u201cMy immune system was tired and distracted from the recent hike up Mount Everest, and now the molehill is giving it a hard time.\u201d He went to a hospital, expecting to be given antibiotics and sent on his way. Instead, \u201cI got greeted with the moon suits and the whole deal,\u201d even though the symptoms he described were not those of Ebola. Eventually, he got his antibiotics.Dr. Sacra said that organizations like his were willing to comply with requests for a measure of quarantine after trips, but sought balance. Those in SIM generally follow guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by local health departments, but \u201cwe recognize that sometimes you have to make adjustments above and beyond what\u2019s necessary legally, according to the rules, to relieve anxiety\u201d in the community.\u201cWe may go beyond to be a helpful part of the community,\u201d he said.Still, a measure of good sense and proportion is needed, he said: There are gradations of caution that do not go as far as forced isolation. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of levels to this, and all sorts of nuance \u2014 and we\u2019ve lost this,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019re willing to go above the minimum restrictions if we need to be good neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it starts making an impact on the actual purpose of the ministry \u2014 the program we\u2019re trying to run \u2014 you have to balance.\u201d Neighbors in American communities are important, he acknowledged, but \u201cwhat about our neighbors in West Africa? They are equally important to us.\u201dWhat do these volunteers get out of their often-grueling experience? Kim Federici, a retired oncology-hematology nurse from a town outside San Antonio, said a big part of it was inspiration. She recently returned from working in Liberia with Doctors Without Borders.She has made several trips for the group, to Armenia, Cambodia and other countries. She was asked to do \u201chealth promotion\u201d in Liberia and worked to her limits, talking with people about how to avoid infection and working with a team of 20 local people. They went from town to town, teaching, going out with ambulances to pick up the sick and accompanying burial teams, trying to reduce panic with calm words and repeated explanations.Even when things were at their worst, and families lost beloved relatives, \u201cthe ones who had the tears and the grief still celebrated the survival of the others,\u201d she said. She recalled a painful conversation with a man in one town who lost seven members of his family. When she called him to tell him that his wife had died, he said, \u201cI cannot bear this any longer,\u201d and hung up the phone.When she came back through the town on another day for the burial of one of his neighbors, \u201che came running out and he put his hands on the car,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said, \u2018How do I thank you?' \u201d She was stunned, but he explained: \u201cLook. I have my daughter and my granddaughter.\u201dShe said, \u201cIt really humbles you to be in that kind of a situation.\u201dMs. Federici, now home again, said, \u201cI was never clearer about how humanity looks to the light \u2014 when it is pressed to the ground, it looks to the light.\u201dAn article on Friday about volunteers who risk their health or lives to help people misidentified a country in which Kim Federici, a retired nurse from Texas, recently worked with Doctors Without Borders. It is Liberia, not Sierra Leone. The article also erroneously included one country among those in which Ms. Federici has worked with the aid group. She has not worked in Mexico.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Democrats\u2019 Immigration Problem", "Date": "2014-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSAN DIEGO \u2014 PRESIDENT OBAMA\u2019S executive order eliminating the threat of deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants is good policy. It is the right thing to do. But it is a dangerous move for the Democratic Party. But Latinos and Asian-Americans made up only 11 percent of the electorate. Even if immigration were the only issue driving their vote \u2014 and it most certainly was not \u2014 it could have shifted the national partisan balance of power by only a few percentage points. Whites, meanwhile, accounted for 75 percent of the electorate. Far more than any other group, whites will decide the fate of the parties in the years to come. Unfortunately for the Democratic Party, the data suggest that immigration very much matters for whites.Immigrants are moving to almost every corner of the nation. They usually look different from the white majority. And, irrespective of the facts, the dominant narrative maintains that immigrants rely heavily on public services like welfare, education and health care, that immigrants take jobs from native-born workers and lower their wages, and that immigration is leading to cultural decline. This anxiety is coupled with an increasingly clear partisan divide on immigration. No Democrat in the Arizona Legislature, for example, supported the 2010 state law known as SB 1070, which among other things directed law enforcement officers to check the immigration status of people they\u2019d arrested or stopped; all but one Republican voted for it. Republicans have condemned Mr. Obama\u2019s executive order as a usurpation of Congress\u2019s authority. Put it all together: Many white Americans see that America is changing, believe that immigration is driving many of the negative changes and know that one party stands largely on the side of immigrants while the other party stands largely in opposition. For many whites, this is a powerful motivation to vote Republican.For the Democrats, the consequences are severe. Only 38 percent of white voters in the midterm elections sided with Democratic candidates. Almost two-thirds of whites without a college degree voted for Republicans in the midterms; as recently as 1990, these voters overwhelmingly favored Democrats. There are no easy solutions for the Democrats. Shifting to the right is not possible, given the party\u2019s strong pro-immigration constituencies. Half of the Latino and Asian-American populations profess no allegiance to any party. Shifting to the right on immigration might cost more minority votes than it gains white votes. The Democrats could simply hold tight and wait until changing demographics give them an edge. That might be an effective long-term strategy, but it is likely to give Republicans control of the levers of power for decades. Mr. Obama\u2019s approach \u2014 moving to the left \u2014 makes all kinds of sense from a policy standpoint. The data show that immigrants are generally not a burden on America. They work hard. They use relatively few government services. They contribute to the economy. A vast majority of the undocumented have committed no crime other than crossing the border. They should be allowed to stay. Optimistic Democrats will point to California, where the party made major gains by opposing Proposition 187, a Republican-backed measure in 1994 that sought to cut public services to undocumented immigrants. But California \u2014 a majority-minority state where losing a few white voters can be more than balanced out by winning over Latino and Asian-American voters \u2014 is not America. As long as whites represent a vast majority of voters and as long as most remain skeptical of immigrants, supporting immigrants\u2019 rights will be likely to hurt the Democrats. The dilemma isn\u2019t going away. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Vital Role of the Occasional Voter", "Date": "2014-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewLow voter turnout is a bad thing. Let\u2019s get that out of the way immediately.What\u2019s more, voter turnout isn\u2019t evenly dispersed: Hispanics and lower-income people are less likely to vote, for example, a disturbing sign of disenfranchisement. And even if low turnout were uniformly spread among economic and racial groups, it would still be disheartening. It runs counter to our fundamental democratic ideal of universal governance by an active electorate. As a matter of principle, we would want everyone to vote, and to do so in an informed and reasoned way.But one type of nonvoter provides a silver lining in this otherwise gloomy state of affairs. These people, whom I call sporadic voters, don\u2019t apathetically sit out all elections. They fail to go to the polls sometimes but do go at other times, presumably when they perceive the stakes to be high. And unlike apathetic nonvoters who undermine democracy, sporadic voters may actually bolster it. In fact, recent behavioral research suggests that this group may provide a reservoir of neutrality that can help keep democracy from going astray. To understand this research, it\u2019s worth reviewing the textbook economic model of why people might not vote. To economists, voting is a classic example of a free-rider problem. Getting to the voting booth requires time and energy, but statistically each vote matters only a little, so many people who value democracy count on others to carry the load for them. Such nonvoting behavior, of course, has negative consequences. But there is another way of looking at it. Rather than focusing on what drives people to vote, consider how voting drives people. Imagine that someone asks you to place a large \u201cDrive Carefully\u201d sign on your lawn. Even if you agree with the sentiment, you may not want the sign on your lawn, so you say no. Imagine, however, that instead of being asked to put up a sign, you are asked to add your name to a petition for the same cause. It\u2019s less of a commitment, and you may well say yes: It\u2019s no surprise that small requests elicit more positive responses. To test this idea, we compared the polarization of 19- and 20-year-olds in an election year. Both age groups were eligible to vote, but only the 20-year-olds were able to vote in the previous election \u2014 and thus had a chance to formally commit themselves to candidates and ideologies.We found that the 20-year-olds held stronger and more uniform views than the 19-year-olds. That wasn\u2019t just a result of aging: When we looked at more age groups, we found that 18- and 19-year-olds, both of whom were ineligible to vote in the previous election, were similarly polarized; there were also no polarization differences between 20- and 21-year-olds, both of whom were able to vote previously. This and other evidence led us to conclude that exposure to the voting process more effectively committed people to a candidate or party. This, then, may be the hidden cost of voting, at least in American elections in this era: We find ourselves locked into one partisan policy or candidate. We process new information in a biased way. We cement a position and escalate our commitments. In essence, we become less neutral. The key to short-circuiting this process may be that outsiders \u2014 those who haven\u2019t agreed to any of the small steps \u2014 view the whole thing differently. They see the question about putting up the yard sign for what it is: a big and unreasonably intrusive request. They don\u2019t feel compelled to say yes because of their own past behavior. By showing up in the middle of a process of escalation, they may help to prevent it. A combination of neutrality and persistent voting would be ideal. But our psychologies are complicated. If they override our narrow self-interest and lead us to vote instead of free-riding, the very act of voting may make us more partisan. Sporadic voters can provide an antidote: Their previous lack of engagement may serve as a counter to partisanship.There is a line between apathy and neutrality. People who sit out all elections provide little value to a democracy. People who sit out some elections, jumping in at crucial times, serve an important role as a reserve army of the uncommitted.

{"Headline": "Triumph of the Wrong", "Date": "2014-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI\u2019ll talk in a bit about some of the reasons that may have happened. But it\u2019s important, first, to point out that the midterm results are no reason to think better of the Republican position on major issues. I suspect that some pundits will shade their analysis to reflect the new balance of power \u2014 for example, by once again pretending that Representative Paul Ryan\u2019s budget proposals are good-faith attempts to put America\u2019s fiscal house in order, rather than exercises in deception and double-talk. But Republican policy proposals deserve more critical scrutiny, not less, now that the party has more ability to impose its agenda. So now is a good time to remember just how wrong the new rulers of Congress have been about, well, everything.But if Republicans have been so completely wrong about everything, why did voters give them such a big victory?But the biggest secret of the Republican triumph surely lies in the discovery that obstructionism bordering on sabotage is a winning political strategy. From Day 1 of the Obama administration, Mr. McConnell and his colleagues have done everything they could to undermine effective policy, in particular blocking every effort to do the obvious thing \u2014 boost infrastructure spending \u2014 in a time of low interest rates and high unemployment. This was, it turned out, bad for America but good for Republicans. Most voters don\u2019t know much about policy details, nor do they understand the legislative process. So all they saw was that the man in the White House wasn\u2019t delivering prosperity \u2014 and they punished his party.Will things change now that the G.O.P. can\u2019t so easily evade responsibility?

{"Headline": "Sliding Oil and Gas Prices Give Americans More Money to Spend", "Date": "2014-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerican consumers are going to enjoy a more bountiful Christmas this year, thanks in part to a most unlikely source: Saudi Arabia.\u201cIf oil prices stay between $75 and $95 a barrel, we would see the kind of stimulus package that the Federal Reserve or Congress could never do,\u201d said Douglas R. Oberhelman, the chief executive of Caterpillar, the multinational maker of heavy construction equipment.The impact is especially significant for low- and middle-income Americans, who have been largely left behind by the anemic economic recovery that began in the middle of 2009. Even as the job market has improved, most workers have received only modest wage increases. Median income remains roughly 5 percent below the peak it hit in 2007.Of course, the shifting energy picture will create losers as well as winners. Falling crude prices could eventually slow surging domestic oil and gas production, dimming one of the major economic bright spots of recent years. But while a further decline in oil prices would make it harder to tap the most costly oil shale deposits and deep offshore reserves, economists say the overall momentum will more than compensate for any potential slowdown in the energy patch.\u201cWhen oil prices fall, the benefit to consumers outweighs the loss to producers,\u201d said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cInvestment in oil and gas production is still less than 1 percent of gross domestic product. Consumer spending is 68.5 percent of G.D.P.\u201dEven in Texas, the estimated loss of 15,000 energy production jobs that might occur if lower crude prices persist would be offset by increased employment in sectors like refining and transportation, as well as in businesses that rely on consumer spending, according to Mine K. Yucel, senior vice president and director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\u201cThere may be some slowing, but it\u2019s not going to be dramatic if we stay around $80,\u201d Ms. Yucel said. \u201cIf the price goes below $70, we will probably see a tapering off of production.\u201dIn the meantime, the most economically fragile part of the population is already feeling some relief, which is likely to lead to extra spending on a variety of other goods and services.Penny-pinching has been a way of life for Elaine Murszewski since she was laid off from her tech support job in 2009, but Ms. Murszewski, who is self-employed in the Denver suburb of Aurora, says lower gas prices are already making life a little easier.\u201cIf my clients need me to go to their homes, I don\u2019t have to worry about my gas tank being empty,\u201d said Ms. Murszewski, who cobbles together about $900 a month helping two clients organize their offices and run online marketing campaigns.With Americans spending roughly $1 billion a day on gasoline, Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, estimates that consumers will save roughly $8.4 billion in November and December, compared with the last two months of 2013, based on an average price for regular gasoline of about $2.89 a gallon as opposed to $3.23 last November and $3.26 last December.The extra cash in shoppers\u2019 wallets and pocketbooks could help generate nearly half a percentage point in added economic growth in the fourth quarter, and roughly $70 billion more in consumer spending over the next year, according to Barclays.At Mall of America, a sprawling complex with 500 stores, mini golf and an aquarium in Bloomington, Minn., the drop in gas prices came as welcome news. Almost half of the 40 million visitors a year are out-of-state tourists, and most of them drive to the mall, which is just south of Minneapolis, said Dan Jasper, a mall spokesman.\u201cIf they can save some money on gas, it makes it much easier for families who might be on a budget to hop in that car and come up for the day,\u201d Mr. Jasper said.Crude oil prices have been falling since they peaked early in the summer, as demand slowed from China and weak European economies. The decline sharpened earlier this month when Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest oil producer, cut the price of exports to the United States in a bid to retain market share.At the pump, the drop in prices has been rapid, and most experts do not foresee a reversal of the trend anytime soon.\u201cWe think lower gas prices in the U.S. are going to last for at least a year,\u201d said Edward L. Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup. \u201cEven if growth turns around globally, it would take two years of added demand around the world to move prices per barrel back to the mid-90s.\u201dOn Wednesday, the federal Energy Information Administration cut its forecast for crude prices next year to $83 per barrel, $18 less than what the agency estimated last month, and predicted that the price of regular gasoline would stay below $3 gallon through all of 2015.While consumers are the biggest beneficiaries, lower energy prices are also a boon to small-business owners like Barry Grossenburg.The owner of Grossenburg Implement, a farm equipment business, Mr. Grossenburg sends his small fleet of trucks hundreds of miles from his main location in the small town of Winner, S.D., every day during the fall harvest season. Grossenburg Implement consumes roughly 250,000 gallons of diesel and gasoline a year, he said, so the savings at the pump could lift the company\u2019s annual profit by $100,000.Farmers who spend hours on the road this time of year hauling crops to market, he added, are also pleased with the drop in prices. \u201cThe fuel thing is going to help the whole economy,\u201d Mr. Grossenburg said.The automobile industry looks to be among corporate America\u2019s biggest beneficiaries. Sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles jumped 9.1 percent last month from October 2013, according to the Autodata Corporation, as consumers flocked to more expensive, less fuel-efficient models that generate bigger profits for automakers. Passenger car sales registered a 2.8 percent increase.But while some experts fear that efforts to conserve energy will falter if gasoline prices stay low, automakers say they will be more careful this time about ramping up production of S.U.V.s in response to cheaper gas, to avoid being left with bloated inventories when prices eventually rebound.Lower crude prices are also unlikely to have a big effect on alternative energy in power markets, experts say, because oil does not generally compete as a source of electricity with renewables like wind and solar.Meanwhile, businesses across the country are hoping oil prices stay down for a while.\u201cIf this goes into the spring, that will be very helpful,\u201d said Todd J. Teske, chief executive of Briggs & Stratton, a century-old Milwaukee manufacturer that is the world\u2019s largest producer of gasoline engines for outdoor equipment like lawn mowers and snowblowers. \u201cWhen the consumer has a few more dollars in their pocket, they\u2019re apt to usually spend the money.\u201dBill Vlasic and Diane Cardwell contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A New Bounty of Oysters in Maryland, but There Is a Snag", "Date": "2014-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 38\u00b0 North oyster farm on Chesapeake Bay in Leonardtown, Md., where the oysters are taken to\u00a0 mature. Oyster farming \u2014 also known as aquaculture \u2014 is one of the few growing businesses on the western shore of Maryland.RIDGE, Md. \u2014 A diver pulled a large, porous bag of oysters from Calvert Bay and heaved it onto the motorboat, and the sucker fish and baby crabs began to scurry and skid in a vain search for escape along the slippery floor. Another bounty of bivalves, almost ready for market. But not everyone is excited.Oyster farming, also known as aquaculture, is one of the few growing businesses here on the western shore of Maryland, a sleepy outpost best known for the sunburned watermen who have pulled crabs and fish from bays like Chesapeake and Calvert for generations. Recent changes to state policy and a growing national affection for oysters (sprinkled with lemon juice only, please) have brought back the shellfish, once as much a staple to Maryland as corn is to Iowa. In the past few years, the state has issued 111 oyster farming leases across 2,240 acres of waters; scores more are pending.The booming oyster business has come into conflict with the watermen of this region, who argue that the cages used to cultivate oysters are a menace to fishing lines and crab pots, and in some cases an eyesore for residents with waterfront homes.Unlike commercial oyster farmers, watermen can fish, crab and seek wild oysters with a mere license on public waterways. Farmers must get state-issued leases, which some watermen are pressing the state to limit.Oyster farmers \u2014 a m\u00e9lange of scientists, businesspeople, new-career seekers and others \u2014 argue that by recreating oyster reefs, they are helping to clean the area\u2019s bays, stimulate the very ecosystem that sustains crab and fish populations and return a tradition to the region.Maryland has a rich history in the water. American Indians predated colonial settlers in pulling oysters, crabs and other animals from Chesapeake Bay, a nearly 5,000-square-mile estuary, where fresh river water mixes with saltwater from the Atlantic Ocean.In 2009, President Obama issued an executive order calling on the federal government to lead a renewed effort to restore and protect Chesapeake Bay. A year later, when it was clear that the seven jurisdictions in the bay area would not meet their clean water goals after a 10-year effort, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a new \u201cpollution diet\u201d for the area.That year, Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley signed the Shellfish Aquaculture Leasing bill, removing many impediments to shellfish aquaculture, including prohibitions on leasing in many county waters, making them available for the first time to nonresidents and corporations, and ending restrictions on the amount of space that could be leased. Oyster farming immediately took off in various regions of coastal Maryland.Farmed oysters, like their wild kin, serve as filters for the water \u2014 one oyster can suck down and spit out 50 gallons of water a day \u2014 but are less prone to disease.\u201cOysters are the kidneys of the bay,\u201d said Kara Muzia, aquatic program manager for the Oyster Recovery Partnership.Other states are also having a boom in oysters. In Virginia, almost 77 million oysters were \u201cplanted\u201d in 2010, a more than 50 percent increase over the previous year.Baby oysters are farmed from \u201cseed\u201d in silos full of water that has been pumped from a river or the bay. The oysters then filter out algae (their food source) before sending that water back into the bay through parallel pipes.\u201cI add nothing to the water,\u201d said Mr. Blackwell, who has scores of cages across seven acres of water on Chesapeake and Calvert Bays and is seeking 60 more.As the oysters mature, they are placed in cages at the bottom of the water or floating near the surface. To property owners, the cages are often considered floating eyesores. (Mr. Blackwell says he will not use those cages within sight of property owners.) The oysters grow exponentially over several months and are then removed, cleaned, sorted and readied for refrigerated trucks that take them to airports or ports for distribution. Chesapeake oysters, less salty and a bit creamier than the West Coast varieties, are gaining popularity nationwide, farmers said.\u201cI can sell every oyster I can grow,\u201d said Tal Petty, the owner of Hollywood Oyster to the north. He has about 1,000 cages there and bristles at the complaints from watermen, who he said had long overfished public waters.\u201cEverybody has a soft spot for the waterman,\u201d Mr. Petty said, \u201cbut the fact is that there are not many of them left, and the number of people who are employed by oyster farms compared to the number of watermen is getting very close. It\u2019s a transition time.\u201dSome farmers are working to cultivate relationships with watermen, exchanging skills and knowledge as the state works to mediate compromises.\u201cI have been in the middle of it,\u201d said Tom Courtney, 68, who has worked as a waterman his entire life but buys oysters from some of the farmers for his popular, ramshackle seafood restaurant. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to get into a business down here, where everything is against you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Debate: Internet Access and Costs Are Top Issues", "Date": "2014-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneWhat is the problem with the Internet in the United States?In principle, this makes sense. It is hard to overstate the importance of broadband to America\u2019s economy and society. Free to do as they pleased, the clutch of companies that control access to the Internet would have enormous power to determine what information reaches Americans online.But would the cure be worse than the disease, entangling the Internet in an endless fight over regulation and perhaps slowing investment in one of the nation\u2019s most vital services? To some extent, it depends on how you view the threat.For Gene Kimmelman, president of the advocacy group Public Knowledge, what\u2019s at stake is no less than American democracy. He can remember 1992, when he was at the Consumer Federation of America pushing a bill that would re-regulate the cable industry and allow new satellite competitors into the market.\u201cI had well-funded satellite providers on my side,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere was no cable company that would take their ads.\u201d Left free to decide which content flowed through their pipes, broadband providers could similarly deploy their power in the service of their political preferences.The more prosaic \u2014 though actually trickier \u2014 issue net neutrality is meant to address is about price. Should broadband providers be allowed to charge providers of content differentially for different speeds or tiers of services?Consumer groups and free speech advocates like Public Knowledge argue this is a surefire way to split the Internet into \u201chaves\u201d \u2014 deep-pocketed companies that would pay to have their movies delivered at blistering speed \u2014 and \u201chave-nots\u201d that would be relegated to a congested, snail-paced lane.The smart kid with the clever new idea would no longer be able to compete with the zippy websites of established players in the fast lane. The Internet would lose its garage-based engine of creativity.These concerns shouldn\u2019t be lightly dismissed. In a world where the Koch brothers will spend tens of millions to install conservative Republicans in office, Mr. Kimmelman\u2019s political fears are not far-fetched.Still, the threats articulated by the staunchest defenders of a neutral Internet do not quite amount to an imminent danger, nor do they necessarily call for an all-out embrace of traditional regulation.Political spending might be at record highs. But the nation\u2019s broadband Goliaths have not, in fact, been using their might to throttle speech online. And they are likely to think twice before, say, alienating Democratic consumers by using their pipes to favor Republican causes.What\u2019s more, the threat to speech is the most easily addressed, via a straightforward ban against blocking or throttling legal content.The pricing threat is even more nebulous. Companies engage in differential pricing all the time, and broadband providers would surely do so if allowed. But that often serves consumers well.Robert Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology Innovation Foundation, noted that it would make sense for services like Skype, which needs its bits to arrive at their destination in a tight, precise sequence, to pay Internet service providers to prioritize their calls over email that doesn\u2019t require such careful timing.Or think of, say, T-Mobile offering to exclude music services from its data cap in order to attract more consumers. Syntonic, whose technology allows companies to provide sponsored content to customers free over wireless carriers, is in fact broadening access by low-income consumers.These forms of discrimination hardly affect other traffic. And with average speeds already around 10 megabits per second, notes Mr. Atkinson, \u201cthe market for prioritization is going to be a lot smaller than people think.\u201dTo date, the most notable instance of anything resembling paid prioritization is Netflix\u2019s payment to Comcast, Time Warner Cable, AT&T and Verizon to ensure its shows flowed smoothly on their pipes. Netflix accused the broadband providers of slowing its content on purpose to get paid and strongly supports tougher net neutrality rules. Still, the charge looks like a not unreasonable congestion fee to cover the added costs of handling its voluminous traffic. Comcast could either charge Netflix or require all its consumers to shoulder the burden. Its choice is hardly unreasonable.I once supported reclassifying broadband as a public utility under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, as the president is now proposing. The threat to free speech and innovation on the content side of the broadband economy seemed plausible enough to warrant a heavy hand.So far, however, the most awful situations have not come to pass. While this does not ensure they never will, it suggests that restraint can be achieved through lighter means that do not put at risk other crucial objectives \u2014 like broadening access to the Internet and tackling the nation\u2019s very real digital divide.President Obama suggested the F.C.C. should apply Title II more lightly than the law provides for, refraining from regulating prices. But other provisions could be equally chilling. Mr. Litan and Mr. Singer outlined how the requirement that broadband companies \u201cunbundle\u201d and lease capacity on their pipes to competitors hamstrung investment for years until the unbundling requirement was dropped.And, in the end, Title II would not necessarily ban differentiated pricing. It would just make it available to all comers on the same terms, banning only \u201cunjust or unreasonable discrimination.\u201d Mr. Litan noted that determining what this means could lead to endless, contentious and politically charged proceedings.The United States has an imperfect Internet. There is little competition in wired broadband, limited mostly to a cable company and a telecom carrier offering less powerful DSL access. Consolidation is shrinking the number of players further. And mobile broadband, while more advanced than in most other countries, is not yet a real competitor for fast fixed broadband.The cable companies that provide most fast broadband have a clear motivation to discriminate against content from rival sources to protect their business model. And their combination with programmers like NBC increases the risk of discriminatory treatment.But these shortcomings won\u2019t be fixed by regulating the flow of content on the Internet like electricity through the wires or voices traveling down a phone line. Stopping unreasonable discrimination can be done at a lower cost, on a case-by-case basis that does not imperil perhaps the most important objective of all: extending the Internet to all Americans.President Obama is right when he argues that the broadband companies connecting Americans to the Internet \u201chave special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of your home or business.\u201dIn the absence of more competition, this will have to be monitored by regulators. But the monitoring should be performed at the least possible cost.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a City Wary of Skyscrapers, a New Tower May Rise", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byParis JournalPARIS \u2014 The last skyscraper built in Paris opened in 1973, an unadorned dark block, rising 59 stories \u2014 the Montparnasse Tower. It was considered a disaster. To this day, Parisians joke that the tower offers the best views in the city, because it is the only place from which you cannot see it. City officials went to work banning future skyscrapers altogether.Now, however, four decades later, Paris is again considering a new skyscraper \u2014 a triangular, 42-story glass office tower designed by the Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron that would stand in the city\u2019s southwest corner.Over the years, Parisians have come to embrace some of the city\u2019s bolder architectural adventures, such as the glass pyramids inside of the Louvre courtyard or the Pompidou Center, built with its network of colorfully painted water pipes and air-conditioning ducts on the outside. But the resistance to skyscrapers has been fierce.For some Parisians, the new proposal is another Montparnasse in the making, an architectural star turn that would further disfigure one of the city\u2019s key selling points \u2014 an almost perfect 19th-century skyline.For the last few decades, they say, the city has done very nicely by keeping office towers outside the city limits in areas like La D\u00e9fense, on its western edge, now a forest of glass and steel.But in these trying times, with the country\u2019s economy moribund, the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has been arguing otherwise, delighted to see such a huge private investment in an area of Paris that, at the moment, is not much to look at.For now, the area is a collection of conference centers that lie between the highway that runs around the city periphery and a not particularly distinguished residential neighborhood in the 15th Arrondissement, near the Porte de Versailles.\u201cThere are many selling points to this project,\u201d said Jean-Louis Missika, the city\u2019s deputy mayor for architecture and urbanism. \u201cIt would be an important economic development for the city.\u201dMr. Missika argues that a project like the new tower would act as a kind of lighthouse, giving distinction to the entire neighborhood, as Frank Gehry\u2019s Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, prompted a rejuvenation of that city.Nonetheless, the project came close to dying this week as it failed to garner enough votes in the City Council. But as the vote came to an end, the winners made the mistake of brandishing their \u201cno\u201d ballots, making public what was supposed to be a private poll \u2014 and giving Ms. Hidalgo an opening to bring the whole matter to court.The vote was close, 78 to 83, pitting Ms. Hidalgo\u2019s Socialist city councilors against those from the center right and the environmentalist parties. A little more time and a new vote, city officials believe, and the tower might yet be built.Those against the project are furious at the mayor\u2019s maneuver. \u201cIt the vote had gone the other way, you can be sure that the mayor would have been just fine with it,\u201d said Olivier de Monicault, the president of SOS Paris, an association founded in the 1970s to oppose architectural projects, such as skyscrapers, that it believed would destroy Paris\u2019s distinct heritage.Mr. de Monicault said there were all kinds of arguments to be made against the tower, including that it was not a tower, but a wall that would cast a huge shadow on the surrounding neighborhood.But perhaps most fundamental, he said, is the fear of doing damage to the look and feel of the city: \u201cTourists do not come here to see Manhattan,\u201d he said.Leading the charge against the tower in the City Council was Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, from the center-right Union for a Popular Movement, who ran for mayor against Ms. Hidalgo this year and lost.Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet said the city\u2019s experience with solitary towers had proved them disastrous. \u201cThey overwhelm the neighborhood,\u201d she said.Moreover, she said, the tower would only help signal the edge of the city at a time when Paris is trying to reach across the highway that encircles it to better integrate the neighborhoods beyond.\u201cWe are not against modernity,\u201d Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet said, \u201cbut this is not about modernity. What we are hearing is the same arguments that got us the Montparnasse Tower. There is nothing unique here. All the cities in the world have glass towers. There is nothing inventive here.\u201dMs. Kosciusko-Morizet said she found the use of a secret vote to be particularly dishonest since such votes were never used except over issues of personnel nominations. She said her party members had objected to the secret ballot all along and said before the vote that they would not keep their votes private.A poll conducted last year by the B.V.A. polling agency found that most Parisians \u2014 62 percent \u2014 were against any new skyscrapers, even if for much-needed new housing. Often it seems it is the younger Parisians who are more inclined to see the new Triangle Tower in a positive light.\u201cFor me it makes economic sense,\u201d said Ralph Hippocrate, 28, a publicist for a French television channel. \u201cFor jobs it might create, but also for the good it might do for the businesses in the neighborhood.\u201dBut many older Parisians fear that city officials did not learn the lesson of Montparnasse, a building that regularly makes lists of the 10 ugliest buildings in the world. They believe that skyscrapers are simply out of place in the heart of Paris.\u201cWe are not in Dubai,\u201d said Danielle Outreman, 60, who is retired. \u201cI like it that in Paris I am not surrounded by enormous buildings. I think that putting them all in La D\u00e9fense is just fine.\u201dAurelien Breeden and Laure Fourquet contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sharp Words on Israel and Palestine", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:Israel\u2019s minister of the economy, Naftali Bennett, has vowed to do everything in his power to make sure that the Palestinian people never get a state. Another of his notable quotes is \u201cI\u2019ve killed lots of Arabs in my life, and there\u2019s no problem with that.\u201d He has referred to the idea of a Palestinian state as \u201cpointless\u201d and said Israel should \u201cbuild, build, build\u201d in reference to Israel\u2019s policy of stealing Palestinian land.In his Op-Ed essay, Mr. Bennett is furthering his cause. His dangerous argument against the two-state solution is built not on the pursuit of peace and justice, but on fear-mongering, unfounded justifications of Israel\u2019s illegal occupation of Palestine, and encouragement of apartheid.Mr. Bennett\u2019s no-state solution is no solution at all. It denies Palestinians the right to live in peace, freedom and dignity. It condemns both the Israeli and Palestinian people to an unsustainable status quo built on subjugation, not equality. Israelis have a right to their security, and so do Palestinians. But as long as our right to statehood is denied, we will both be less secure.We remain committed to a negotiated solution that delivers two states for two peoples. We recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist. But Mr. Bennett does not recognize Palestine\u2019s right to exist. If Mr. Bennett and his proponents want real peace and security, they must start by recognizing our equal rights to statehood and freedom.The writer is the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations.\u00a0To the Editor:Naftali Bennett\u2019s proposal holds out the prospect of greater autonomy and economic gains for Palestinians, both laudable goals. However, it should give us pause when the proposal, argued on strictly pragmatic grounds, also meets an unstated ideological goal of the writer \u2014 permanent Israeli control over territory on which Palestinians seek to establish their state.Mr. Bennett\u2019s proposal fits the religion-based agenda of his Jewish Home party like a glove by slicing off another piece of the West Bank for Israel, while offering scant assurances to Palestinians of anything more than greater autonomy in exchange for good behavior.Given the effectiveness of Israel\u2019s security barrier at shielding Israelis both from mortal threats to their lives and from the reality of the daily indignities that the occupation confers on Palestinians, one can well imagine Mr. Bennett\u2019s plan resulting in enlarged borders for the State of Israel with no concomitant progress toward freedom and equal rights for Palestinians. Such a so-called solution promises to make an untenable situation worse.\u00a0To the Editor:I find Naftali Bennett\u2019s honesty refreshing. His policy vision is no different from the one that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his predecessors have been busy implementing for years. The difference is that Mr. Netanyahu dissembles, stringing along Secretary of State John Kerry with occasional lip service to the two-state solution, while Mr. Bennett plainly admits that the emperor has no clothes.Of course, Mr. Bennett doesn\u2019t mention that no Palestinian leader of any legitimacy, not even the extraordinarily pliable Mahmoud Abbas, will ever be brought to accept and comply with the Bantustan arrangement he so candidly prescribes. A fifth item should therefore be appended to Mr. Bennett\u2019s \u201cfour-step plan\u201d: interminable asymmetric warfare.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Americans Say They Want Privacy, but Act as if They Don\u2019t", "Date": "2014-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Survey SaysAmericans say they are deeply concerned about privacy on the web and their cellphones. They say they do not trust Internet companies or the government to protect it. Yet they keep using the services and handing over their personal information.Distrust of digital communication has only increased, Pew found, with the young expressing the most concern by some measures, in the wake of the revelations by Edward Snowden about online surveillance by the government. Yet Americans for now seem to grudgingly accept that these are the trade-offs of living in the digital age \u2014 or else they fear that it is too late to do anything about it.\u201cThe reason is often they don\u2019t have real choice,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \u201cIt\u2019s not like picking up the newspaper and realizing ice cream has too many calories and you can start eating frozen yogurt, information that people can act on.\u201dOne reason is that once people are invested in a service \u2014 if they have all their social contacts on Facebook or years of email on Gmail, for instance \u2014 they have a hard time giving it up.\u201cIt\u2019s this modern economy that doesn\u2019t really rely on price, but on connections and stickiness,\u201d Mr. Rotenberg said. \u201cThe companies have done everything they can to make it impossible to go somewhere else.\u201dEighty-one percent of people do not feel secure using social media to share private information. Sixty-eight percent feel that way about online chats, 59 percent about text messaging, 57 percent about email, 46 percent about talking on cellphones and 31 percent about talking on landlines.In each case, those who said they were more aware of reports about government surveillance were more likely to say these communications were not secure.People harbor equal distrust of advertisers and the government, Pew found. Eighty percent of users of social networks say they are concerned about advertisers or businesses gaining access to their information there, and 70 percent say they are at least somewhat concerned about the government doing so without their knowledge.Yet highlighting the privacy paradox, 55 percent of people say they are willing to share information about themselves with web companies in order to use their services free, and 36 percent say they appreciate that these services are more efficient because they have access to this information.The types of digital information that people consider to be most sensitive are their Social Security numbers, health information, the content of emails and phone calls and their location. They are least sensitive about their purchasing habits, media consumption, political and religious views, and the identities of their friends.People with more education and higher incomes tend to be more sensitive about their online privacy, Pew found. And despite perceptions that young people care little about digital privacy, they often care more than older people. Email is an example. Just over half of all adults consider the content of email messages to be very sensitive. Fifty-nine percent of young adults feel that way, compared with 42 percent of older adults.\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty big, mounting body of evidence that suggests young adults are just as likely to care, if not more so, when it comes to awareness of government surveillance,\u201d said Mary Madden, a senior researcher for Pew\u2019s Internet Project and an author of the report.Pew offered some evidence that people are inured to the trade-offs of using digital services: Ninety-one percent agree or strongly agree that consumers have lost control over how their personal information is collected or used by companies. They are unsure what to do about it, though.Nearly two-thirds say they would like to do more to protect the privacy of their personal information online. About the same number think the government should do more to protect them.\u201cThe privacy survivalists will start exchanging PGP key prints, but that\u2019s not going to work for most people,\u201d Mr. Rotenberg said. \u201cI think more needs to be done at the macro policy level to restore trust: update federal privacy laws, limit circumstances under which government gets access and mandate better security.\u201dThe question is whether policy makers or their constituents will push for that \u2014 or whether they, too, have accepted privacy trade-offs as a fact of living life online.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Son Seeks Art Looted by the East Germans ", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust after sunrise on a March morning in 1982, the secret police pounded on the door of Helmuth Meissner, a Dresden art collector known for his refined taste.Inside, 2,000 works of art that Mr. Meissner had assembled over a lifetime \u2014 delicate porcelains, Asian carvings, dozens of paintings \u2014 lined the walls and shelves. Outside, four unmarked trucks stood ready to be stuffed with Mr. Meissner\u2019s prized possessions. Mr. Meissner\u2019s wife, Johanna, would later recall the police barging past her into the kitchen, hauling typewriters, measuring tapes, even their own coffee makers. It was going to be a long day. While the loss and anguish of Nazi art looting is well known, a second series of German art seizures, decades after World War II, has largely gone unnoticed.Between 1973 and 1989 the East German police, known as the Stasi, seized more than 200,000 objects in hundreds of raids, according to experts and official archives. As part of a broader government program to secure Western currency through the sale of the art, the police went after collectors like Mr. Meissner, who, when he objected, was sent, at 79, to a psychiatric hospital and portrayed as an enemy of the state. But now, Mr. Meissner\u2019s story has resurfaced, as his son tries to reclaim what he says was one of the most valuable items seized from his father more than three decades ago: a 1705 still life of four chestnuts by the Dutch artist Adriaen Coorte. In court filings in Munich, the New York family that now has the painting says that it was bought 25 years ago, legally, in good faith and with no understanding that it had been seized by the Stasi.Until recently, few Germans realized that the covert program, with its echoes of Holocaust-era looting, had ever taken place in the German Democratic Republic, said Gilbert Lupfer, the lead researcher for Dresden\u2019s state art collection.\u201cIt was very, very, well, elaborate, and also very secret,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason why it was not known in the G.D.R.\u201d The purpose of the program, according to historians, was purely financial. East Germany\u2019s economy at the time was faltering, and its own currency, the mark, was too weak to be of much use in foreign trade. Selling art abroad through brokers in Western Europe guaranteed a steady stream of cash. To depict the seizures as legal, the Stasi declared that the targeted collectors were \u201cart dealers\u201d who owed as much as 90 percent back taxes on the value of their so-called stock. Since no East German could pay the outsize tax bills, archival records show, the Stasi would take 90 percent of the best objects instead. \u201cPeople like the Meissners were seen as plums ripe for picking,\u201d said Ulf Bischof, a German lawyer who represents Mr. Meissner\u2019s son, Konrad, and specializes in restitution cases.Too few claims have surfaced so far \u2014 perhaps several dozen \u2014 to draw conclusions as to whether people who lost items to the Stasi are having as hard a time recovering them as those families whose art was plundered by the Nazis. But within Germany, where the Stasi is vilified for having tormented its own citizens, and where most of its actions were declared illegal after reunification in 1990, Mr. Bischof said, museums, auction houses and individuals he has approached on behalf of claimants have typically turned over items without litigation. German officials are also now discussing, Mr. Lupfer said, whether to add Stasi-confiscated items to Germany\u2019s Lost Art Internet Database in Magdeburg, an online listing of cultural objects seized under the Nazis that has been used by many heirs to reclaim lost works.\u201cArt looted under the Nazis remains our foremost issue,\u201d Mr. Lupfer said. \u201cBut we must never forget about the objects illegally confiscated by the Communist government of the G.D.R.\u201d In the case of the Coorte, the owner, June D. Weldon, who died last month, appealed to a German court in August to uphold her title to the work. Mrs. Weldon, a philanthropist whose generosity has been acknowledged by museums like the Frick Collection and by Colonial Williamsburg, said in the court papers that, if she holds the same painting that was taken from Mr. Meissner, its seizure had been the lawful action of the government in power at the time. Its removal \u201cwas done under the color of law as a tax forfeiture proceeding,\u201d said Mrs. Weldon\u2019s lawyer, Anthony J. Costantini. \u201cThis is not like a Nazi like Goebbels taking something and placing it on his wall.\u201d Art seized by the Stasi was often resold by a front corporation called Kunst und Antiquit\u00e4ten GmbH (Art and Antiques) that operated as part of a larger Stasi-controlled secret enterprise that brought in as much as $1 billion in hard currency a year through a range of illicit dealings, including hidden arm sales and the ransoming of political prisoners to West Germany. The art exporting arm alone took in as much as $40 million a year.By the mid-1980s, experts said, the Stasi art squads began running out of collectors to tax, and began swapping low-value East German marks or simple household necessities with people who unknowingly owned an item of high value. \u201cWhen they grew really desperate,\u201d Mr. Bischof said \u201cthey ripped up the medieval cobblestones from the streets and took the church relics and grabbed the old books from libraries.\u201d Like the Nazis, though, the Stasi left an exacting paper trail that has helped researchers track the provenance of items seized decades ago.Mr. Bischof said he used the records to track the chestnuts painting, including a photograph taken by the Stasi during the 1982 raid that shows it hanging on a wall in the Meissners\u2019 home.Coorte is known to have painted about 100 works, most of them finely detailed still lifes. There is no appraised value for the chestnuts painting, but those Coortes made using the same technique \u2014 with oil paint on paper affixed to a panel of wood \u2014 have drawn more than $2 million each at auction.The chestnuts painting that the Stasi seized was shipped to Amsterdam in 1988, the official archives show. Later that year, according to Mr. Bischof, the same painting was sold at auction by Christie\u2019s in the Netherlands for $76,974.The buyer, David Koetser, a Swiss gallery owner, sold it the following year to Henry H. Weldon, Mrs. Weldon\u2019s husband, for $145,000, according to Mr. Koetser\u2019s records. His sales receipt called the work \u201cStill Life with Four Chestnuts.\u201d At the time of the purchase, the Weldons had spent several decades amassing a robust collection of Dutch and Flemish masters. Their collection was exhibited at the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore in 1999. The catalog for the exhibition said the Coorte painting of chestnuts had come from a private collection in the Netherlands and had been shown through Mr. Koetser\u2019s gallery in Zurich, but it did not mention the Meissners or the sale by Christie\u2019s. Mr. Bischof said he tracked the painting to Mrs. Weldon in 2011 and sent her a letter detailing the Stasi raid, the arrest of Helmuth Meissner, and Mr. Meissner\u2019s confinement within a psychiatric facility, which a German state commission in 1997 called \u201ca clear case of abuse.\u201d Mr. Bischof also traced for her what he said was the route the Coorte took after falling into Stasi hands. \u201cWe hope we can resolve this matter amicably and in an atmosphere of mutual trust and can avoid a bitter and lengthy dispute,\u201d he wrote.When the negotiations broke down, Mrs. Weldon\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Costantini, filed the legal action in Munich, where Konrad Meissner lives, asking a judge to affirm her ownership and asserting in court papers that nothing presented so far establishes Konrad Meissner\u2019s ownership and that Mr. Meissner \u201cbases his claims on legally incorrect points of view.\u201d Mr. Costantini said Mrs. Weldon\u2019s heirs plan to continue the legal battle to retain the Coorte.In his brief, Mr. Costantini suggested that perhaps the Meissner chestnuts painting simply resembles a different one in Mrs. Weldon\u2019s collection. But the 2008 catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Coorte\u2019s paintings, by Quentin Buvelot, which is intended to be a full inventory of his works, does not list any other painting that features four chestnuts and is dated to 1705.Mr. Meissner, 76, said he is sure the Weldon painting is the one he grew up with. \u201cIt is hard not to recall your parents had this work on the wall,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you looked at it every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And 50 members of the paper\u2019s 80-person staff submitted notice to leave by the end of the year.\u201cI think Penta intends to misuse the newspapers for their own purposes,\u201d Mr. Kostolny said. \u201cTheir idea of free speech is entirely different from mine.\u201dIn the 1990s, after the collapse of Communism, most media outlets were either owned outright by the state or utterly dependent on government advertising. When foreign owners \u2014 most notably from Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States \u2014 subsequently bought up local newspapers, magazines and broadcast outlets, journalists found that the distant owners had no interest in local politics. That was a relief for a time.\u201cFor us, it was perfect,\u201d Mr. Kostolny said of the German conglomerate that owned SME. \u201cWe had very professional owners who never picked up the phone and tried to influence the newspaper. Not once.\u201dBut when the economy sank in 2008, most of these foreign owners decided to retreat to their core businesses back home and put their media companies in Central and Eastern Europe on the block. At that point, the distance between their Western owners and the political realities in their countries began to seem like a drawback, especially as the owners began selling to local interests with a direct stake in the coverage.\u201cIt turned out that as much as they didn\u2019t care about Slovak politics, they also didn\u2019t care about who they sold the papers to and the impact of the sale on Czech and Slovak society,\u201d Mr. Kostolny said.The end result, said Marian Lesko, a commentator for Trend Magazine, a Bratislava-based business journal also owned by Penta Investments, is that \u201cin Slovakia, independent media is no more, basically.\u201dAlexej Fulmek, the chief executive of Petit Press and one of the founders of SME, said he was troubled by Penta\u2019s stake in the company but decided to stay on to protect SME and the other Petit Press publications, including the most important network of regional papers in the country.\u201cI am not happy with the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t like Penta. They have too many economic interests with the government.\u201dFor its part, Penta bristles at being compared to politically connected oligarchs in the region, instead presenting itself as a fairly standard, Western-style investment company with interests in hospitals, retail outlets, real estate and other industries that now happens to include media.Officials of the company, led by its dominant principal, Jaroslav Hascak, said they were interested only in keeping their media investments profitable by consolidating them and had no intention of meddling in the newsrooms.\u201cWe do not have any direct businesses with the state,\u201d said Martin Danko, the group\u2019s chief spokesman. \u201cWe are not providing any services, not participating in any state competitions to supply something. But we are definitely operating in regulated businesses.\u201dPenta got into the media business after other entities controlled by local oligarchs \u2014 Mr. Babis, the Czech finance minister, as well as Ivan Jakabovic and Patrik Tkac, who control the J&T Finance Group in Slovakia \u2014 had already started investing in the industry.Penta\u2019s 45 percent interest in Petit Press prevents it from dominating the newsroom, even if it wished to do so \u2014 which, Mr. Danko said, it does not, because it understands that the credibility of the news is the core of the company\u2019s profitability.Mr. Kostolny doesn\u2019t buy it. \u201cPenta\u2019s real interest is in influence, in controlling their critics,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will make back their investment with one state contract, and nobody will bother them by writing about it.\u201dFor the moment, though, they have no office outside of the Next Apache cafe \u2014 the name, said aloud, sounds like \u201cnech sa paci,\u201d which means \u201chere you are\u201d in Slovak \u2014 where Mr. Kostolny and many former employees now hang out.\u201cI still don\u2019t have investors,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have computers. I don\u2019t have printing machines. I don\u2019t have anything.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Fulmek said he intended to spend the next several weeks trying to talk some of those who put in their notice to stay at SME with him and fight the good fight there. He even hopes to persuade Mr. Kostolny and his deputies to return, but he is not optimistic.\u201cThey are very pure,\u201d Mr. Fulmek said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s good, because the country needs such people.\u201dMiroslava Germanova contributed reporting from Bratislava; Kit Gillet from Bucharest, Romania; and Giorgi Kantchev from Sofia, Bulgaria.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At European Parliament, Pope Bluntly Critiques a Continent\u2019s Malaise ", "Date": "2014-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Tuesday, after a break of more than a quarter-century, another pope, Francis, returned here to the same setting, but with a grimly somber diagnosis.Europe, he declared, has lost its way, its energies sapped by economic crisis and a remote, technocratic bureaucracy. It is increasingly a bystander in a world that has become \u201cless and less Eurocentric,\u201d and that frequently looks at the Continent \u201cwith aloofness, mistrust and even, at times, suspicion.\u201dGently delivered, it was nevertheless a failing grade.\u201cIn many quarters we encounter a general impression of weariness and aging, of a Europe which is now a \u2018grandmother,\u2019 no longer fertile and vibrant,\u201d the pope, an Argentine, told the Parliament, where speeches usually trade in platitudes or mind-numbing technicalities.\u201cThe time has come for us to abandon the idea of a Europe which is fearful and self-absorbed,\u201d the pope added.By contrast, Francis gave little direct encouragement to calls for \u201cmore Europe,\u201d and instead echoed some of the complaints from surging populist politicians who view the European Union as a meddlesome force that inhibits rather than promotes ambition and economic growth.\u201cIn recent years, as the European Union has expanded, there has been growing mistrust on the part of citizens toward institutions considered to be aloof, engaged in laying down rules perceived as insensitive to individual peoples, if not downright harmful,\u201d Francis said, dressed in white clerical robes as he addressed the packed hall.Public discontent with the European Union\u2019s bureaucracy, widely seen as wasteful, elitist and self-serving, helped propel France\u2019s far-right National Front party and several other once-fringe nationalist groups to strong gains in May elections for the European Parliament. In France, the National Front came ahead of all other parties.The European Parliament, which maintains huge premises and staffs in both this French city near the German border and the Belgian capital, Brussels, has itself become an emblem of the waste and detachment from ordinary people\u2019s concerns that have drained support from a half-century push for greater integration and aided the rise of anti-European nationalists.In his speech, however, the pope also took aim at these populists, many of whom demand sharp curbs on immigration and denounce migrants as freeloaders, by pleading for more compassion toward immigrants.The plea has been a regular feature of the Vatican\u2019s agenda since Francis became pope after the surprise retirement of Benedict XVI last year. On his first trip outside Rome after his election, the new pope denounced the \u201cglobalization of indifference\u201d during a visit to the Italian island of Lampedusa, near where scores of migrants have drowned while trying to reach Europe from Africa in flimsy boats.\u201cWe cannot allow the Mediterranean to become a vast cemetery,\u201d the pope said Tuesday. \u201cThe boats landing daily on the shores of Europe are filled with men and women who need acceptance and assistance.\u201dHe added that the European Union\u2019s failure to find a common response to the flow of desperate migrants had led individual countries to adopt their own measures, \u201cwhich fail to take into account the human dignity of immigrants and thus contribute to slave labor and continuing social tensions.\u201dGuy Verhofstadt, leader of the Parliament\u2019s Alliance of Democrats and Liberals, said he agreed with the pope that Europe suffered from a \u201clack of dynamism\u201d and seized on this to push his own stalled demands for a \u201cnew leap forward\u201d toward greater European integration.Mr. Verhofstadt said Europe needed \u201ca new vision, a new ambition, exactly the same as in 1992,\u201d when the 12 members of what is today a 28-nation bloc moved to open their economies to cross-border competition as part of efforts to create a so-called single market by December of that year.Still, some of the pope\u2019s strongest supporters in Europe are not free-market liberals like Mr. Verhofstadt, but leftists like the Greek opposition leader Alexis Tsipras, a self-described atheist who visited the Vatican in September and hailed Francis as the \u201cpontiff of the poor.\u201dThe pope won particularly loud applause on Tuesday with remarks that seemed to challenge a largely German-scripted policy rooted in austerity as the cure to Europe\u2019s economic ills.\u201cThe time has come to promote policies which create employment,\u201d he said, \u201cbut above all, there is a need to restore dignity to labor by ensuring proper working conditions.\u201d In a second speech Tuesday to the Council of Europe, another Strasbourg assembly with a palatial building but little resonance among ordinary people, Francis said, \u201cIt is my profound hope that the foundations will be laid for a new social and economic cooperation.\u201dHe noted that the Catholic Church had played an important role over centuries in providing charity for Europe\u2019s poor but added: \u201cHow many of them there are in our streets! They ask not only for the food they need for survival, which is the most elementary of rights, but also for a renewed appreciation of the value of their own life, which poverty obscures, and a rediscovery of the dignity conferred by work.\u201dWhen John Paul II addressed the Strasbourg Parliament in 1988, he denounced Europe\u2019s steady drift from its Christian roots, warning that the \u201cexclusion of God from public life\u201d imperiled the Continent\u2019s future. His speech, though generally upbeat about the drawing together of Eastern and Western Europe, drew strong criticism from secularists who insisted that religion had no place in European institutions.Francis, by contrast, faced no such opposition and instead stirred repeated rounds of applause from members of Parliament. He also referred to Europe\u2019s Christian heritage and the dangers of losing it, but focused instead on issues like poverty, immigration and joblessness.The European Parliament has generally shunned issues of faith, seeing them as divisive and disruptive to the goal of \u201cever closer union\u201d laid down in the 1957 Treaty of Rome.Martin Shultz, the president of the European Parliament and Francis\u2019 host on Tuesday, helped lead a successful campaign in 2004 to block an Italian nominee to the union\u2019s executive arm because he had voiced personal support for Catholic teachings on abortion and homosexuality.All the same, Europe remains suffused with Christianity, its landscape dotted with ancient \u2014 now mostly empty \u2014 churches, and the anthems of many countries paying homage to God.Even the European Union\u2019s flag \u2014 a circle of 12 yellow stars on a blue background \u2014 has a coded Christian message. Ars\u00e8ne Heitz, a French Catholic who designed the flag in 1955, originally for the Council of Europe, drew inspiration from Christian iconography of the Virgin Mary wearing a crown with 12 stars. But official accounts of the flag today make no reference to this.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Surprisingly Elusive Number That Suggests Full Employment", "Date": "2014-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToday's EconomistLast month the national unemployment rate fell from 5.9 to 5.8 percent, ticking one-tenth of a point closer to the rate of full employment in the American job market. Of that, I\u2019m confident. What that rate of full employment is, no one knows. As the Federal Reserve prepares to begin removing its monetary support from the economy, acknowledging that uncertainty becomes increasingly important.Economics maintains that there is a rate of unemployment that is consistent with full employment such that if the actual jobless rate falls below that rate, inflation will accelerate.But there are reasons to doubt whether they are correct. If the economy were close to full employment, wage growth and inflation would probably be substantially stronger than they are right now.We know that economic slack and price pressures are usually negatively correlated. (Slack is the quantity of labor and capital that could be employed productively, but isn\u2019t.) So more slack, less inflation. But we don\u2019t know the strength or magnitude of the correlation between the two factors, in no small part because it changes over time, buffeted by factors ranging from the known, like changes in the supply of goods that feed directly into inflation, and the unknown, like speedups or slowdowns in productivity growth. We can see it happening, but we just don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s often hard to identify what\u2019s behind productivity growth.Most recently, two factors are playing an important role in dampening the so-called reaction function that translates diminished slack into faster price and/or wage growth. First, the bargaining clout of the American worker is unusually low right now; even steadily falling unemployment hasn\u2019t translated into wage gains. Second, an important part of what drives inflation is expectation about its future path, and the Fed has worked hard over the years to ensure \u201cwell-anchored inflationary expectations\u201d around its target of 2 percent inflation.Given all of these moving parts, we don\u2019t know what the Nairu is. And we haven\u2019t for quite some time.As unemployment fell below this alleged natural rate in the 1990s, wage pressures did in fact begin to build. But the Federal Reserve chairman at the time, Alan Greenspan, recognized that because productivity growth was accelerating, wage growth didn\u2019t obviously have to feed into price growth. Firms could maintain healthy profit margins and still raise pay (those were the days!).So, is the Federal Reserve flying blind, with no quantitative benchmarks to reliably guide their tightening schedule?Not at all. There are at least a few variables they can (and do) look at to get direct information on any overheating threats from diminished slack in the job market, and two of them are annual wage and price growth (shown in the accompanying chart with a composite wage series and the core price index by which the Fed mainly tracks inflation).The two used to move together, but inflation appears \u201cwell anchored\u201d since the latter 1990s, and wage growth has hugged 2 percent since 2009 despite the steep decline in unemployment since then.Another way to consider this dynamic is to track the evolving correlation between slack and wage growth. I\u2019ve found the correlation has become less negative, meaning tighter labor markets simply aren\u2019t pushing employers to bid wages up. I\u2019m convinced that weak worker bargaining power is a critical factor in this flattening correlation between slack and wage growth.While we can\u2019t nail down the natural rate, we\u2019re more likely, just as in the 1990s, to think it\u2019s higher, not lower, than it really is. So it\u2019s important that policy makers keep our imprecision in mind, especially as we approach rates close to the current estimates of the Nairu. As I read the evidence, the paychecks of a lot of workers depend on a natural rate that may be lower than we think it is.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.P.A. Ozone Rules Divide Industry and Environmentalists", "Date": "2014-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration on Wednesday announced a long-delayed environmental regulation to curb emissions of ozone, a smog-causing pollutant linked to asthma, heart disease and premature death.The sweeping regulation, which are aimed at smog caused by power plants and factories across the country, particularly in the Midwest, is the latest in a series of Environmental Protection Agency controls on air pollution that wafts from smokestacks and tailpipes. Such regulations, released under the authority of the Clean Air Act, have become a hallmark of President Obama\u2019s administration.Environmentalists and public health advocates have praised the E.P.A. rules as a powerful environmental legacy. Republicans, manufacturers and the fossil fuel industry have sharply criticized them as an example of costly government overreach. The National Association of Manufacturers has called the proposal \u201cthe most expensive regulation ever.\u201dThe proposed regulation would lower the current threshold for ozone pollution to a range of 65 to 70 parts per billion, from 75 parts per billion. That range is less stringent than the standard of 60 parts per billion sought by environmental groups, but the E.P.A. proposal would also seek public comment on a 60 parts-per-billion plan, keeping open the possibility that the final rule could be stricter.The agency estimates that the new regulation would by 2025 prevent from 320,000 to 960,000 asthma attacks in children, and from 330,000 to 1 million missed school days. It also estimates that by 2025 the rule would prevent 750 to 4,300 premature deaths, 1,400 to 4,300 asthma-related emergency room visits and 65,000 to 180,000 missed workdays.The regulation would come with a high cost to industry, which the E.P.A. estimates would be $3.9 billion in 2025, using a standard of 70 parts per billion. The cost would be $15 billion in 2025 at a standard of 65 parts per billion. (The E.P.A. chose 2025 as an example because that is when the agency expects the regulation to be fully in force.)The agency estimates that the economic benefits of the rule \u2013 measured in avoided asthma attacks, heart attacks, missed school and work days and premature deaths \u2013 would significantly outweigh the costs. It calculates the benefits at $6.4 billion to $13 billion annually in 2025 for a standard of 70 parts per billion and $19 billion to $38 billion annually in 2025 for a standard of 65 parts per billion.\u201cBringing ozone pollution standards in line with the latest science will clean up our air, improve access to crucial air quality information, and protect those most at-risk,'\u2019 the E.P.A. administrator, Gina McCarthy, said in a statement. \u201cIt empowers the American people with updated air quality information to protect our loved ones \u2014 because whether we work or play outdoors \u2013 we deserve to know the air we breathe is safe.\u201dPublic health groups have lobbied the government for years to rein in ozone emissions and said the regulation was one of the most important health decisions Mr. Obama could make in his second term.\u201cOzone is the most pervasive and widespread pollutant in the country,\u201d said Paul Billings, a senior vice president of the American Lung Association. William Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, said, \u201cOzone is not only killing people, but causing tens of millions of people to get sick every day.\u201dBut industry groups say that the regulation would impose unwieldy burdens on the economy, with little public health benefit.The Republican-majority Congress, to be led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the incoming majority leader, has vowed to block or overturn the entire group of rules. In a separate development, the Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to take up a challenge led by industry groups against another E.P.A. rule intended to curb emissions of mercury from coal plants.\u201cWe\u2019re facing a series of regulations, and the cumulative cost of compliance and the burden of permitting is significant,\u201d said Cal Dooley, president of the American Chemistry Council, a group which has lobbied aggressively against the rules. \u201cAn industry such as ours is poised to make significant investments in growth, but these regulations make that harder.\u201dThe standard for ozone was last set in 2008 by the Bush administration at a level of 75 parts per billion, above the range of 60 to 70 parts per billion recommended by the E.P.A.'s scientific advisory panel at the time, although never enacted. Environmental and public health groups challenged the Bush standard in court, saying it would endanger human health and had been tainted by political interference. Smog levels have declined sharply over the last 40 years, but each incremental improvement comes at a significant cost to business and government.The E.P.A. had planned to release the new ozone rule in August of 2011, but as Republicans and powerful industry groups prepared to go on attack against the plan, Mr. Obama decided to delay its release, fearing that opposition to the regulation would hurt his re-election chances in 2012.At the time, Mr. Obama said the regulation would impose too severe a burden on industry and local governments at a time of economic distress.Environmental advocates, who took the delay as a setback, then sued the Obama administration, and earlier this year a federal judge ordered the E.P.A. to release the rule by Dec. 1.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Black Friday Sales Slip as Discounts Start Earlier", "Date": "2014-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven as more stores opened their doors on Thanksgiving, hoping for a jump start to the holiday season, an initial reading suggested that combined sales on Thanksgiving and Black Friday fell 0.5 percent from the same period last year.ShopperTrak, a consumer analytics firm based in Chicago, warned that its estimates were preliminary, and that shifting spending patterns meant that holiday sales were now dispersed over a longer period. Retailers have been offering deep discounts well before their sales on Friday, and many stores moved the start of those offers to Thursday evening.Still, initial weak numbers from what is seen as a critical year-end shopping spree revives concerns among retailers that despite a brightening economic outlook and lower gas prices, consumers remain wary of spending.\u201cYou can try to get the consumer to spend earlier. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s more money in their pockets,\u201d said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group, a market research company.Brick-and-mortar stores also face a shift as much of the holiday spending happens online. A separate survey by IBM showed that those sales jumped, as more people shopped on smartphones and tablets than ever before.One positive sign, Mr. Cohen said, was that surveys indicated that many consumers appeared to be buying for themselves. That suggests that there is still ample gift-buying coming later in the year, he said.He also said that retailers had become better at integrating their brick-and-mortar stores with their online operations, offering the same deals on the web and in-store, for example, or giving customers the option of shopping online and picking up their purchases at a nearby store.In the immediate term, retailers need to brace for a lull after Black Friday, as exhausted consumers give shopping a rest, Mr. Cohen said. And he warned of thinning margins at retailers that discounted too heavily in a bid to bolster traffic.\u201cSome were offering 50 percent off the entire store,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make money that way.\u201dThe earlier start to Black Friday sales appeared to move consumers\u2019 shopping sprees forward. While traffic on Thanksgiving Day increased 27.3 percent, traffic on Friday fell 5.6 percent, according to ShopperTrak.Bill Martin, the founder of ShopperTrak, suggested that the figures showed that consumers were simply waiting until later in the season to do the bulk of their holiday shopping. Last year, he said, Black Friday weekend sales rose 1 percent from the previous year, though sales for the entire season ultimately logged a gain of 3.1 percent.\u201cThere is a significant amount of energy left in the consumer,\u201d he said in a news release. And more big shopping days remain, he said. That includes the final Saturday before Christmas, typically the biggest shopping day of the year.According to estimates released by IBM, which tracks sales at 800 retail sites in the United States, online sales on Thanksgiving Day increased 14.3 percent, while sales on Black Friday were up 9.5 percent. Sales from mobile devices jumped over 25 percent on both days, the company said. People logging onto shopping sites from their smartphones or tablets accounted for over half of all online traffic on Thursday, and almost half of traffic on Friday, IBM said.Just four years ago, less than 10 percent of the traffic came from mobile, said Jay Henderson, director of IBM Smarter Commerce.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing just how pervasive mobile has become,\u201d Mr. Henderson said. \u201cPeople are bringing their tablets to the dinner table as they finish up their pie,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new Thanksgiving tradition.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democracy\u2019s Circuses, Triumphs and Shams", "Date": "2014-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQuick HistoryThe main event of the past week was, of course, the midterm elections. It was a Republican romp, far greater than any poll predicted, but for those watching it from abroad it was also a striking lesson in the enormous complexity, expense, passion and mystery of the democratic process as practiced in the world\u2019s premier republic.All robust democracies surround elections with a circus atmosphere of stump speeches, TV debates, ceaseless polls, ads and posters. But none can surpass the United States in the range of offices that come up for election every two years, from the entire House of Representatives to scores of senators, governors, judges, local legislators and prosecutors, or the resolutions on issues like legalizing marijuana. And few spend anywhere near as much \u2014 around $4 billion was spent on this election.It\u2019s not all pretty, what with the prevalence of the attack ads and shameless lies. Nor is the mood of the American electorate understandable to a foreign observer: Why do American voters feel so strong a need to \u201cpunish\u201d President Obama when the economy is in decent shape, unemployment is falling, most troops are home from foreign wars and the political gridlock in Washington is hardly his fault alone?The apparent reason is that Americans are deeply dissatisfied with the way they are being governed. The departing Congress is widely reviled for its dysfunction, polarization and lack of achievement, and at times like this, people punish the president and his party. That may not seem fair or reasonable, but offering a legitimate channel for frustration and anger, and endowing the public with a sense that they can do something about it, is a key component of democracy.Twenty-five years ago, the people of East Berlin did something about their frustrations in a far different way, bursting through the wall that had physically denied them and millions of Eastern Europeans the most elemental freedoms.With the approach of Sunday\u2019s anniversary, however, many commentaries have focused on the dashed hopes and lost illusions of that joyous moment. Russia is again looming as a threat, China has found ways of combining authoritarian rule with economic might, the United States is widely perceived around the world as having misused its monopoly on superpower, the Middle East is locked in sectarian rivalries that spread vicious terror far beyond the region, and democracy appears on the defensive against populist challenges and economic troubles.None of that should detract from the sheer joy that was Nov. 9, 1989, in Berlin, when people who had lived under the threat of repression for thinking the wrong thought or dreaming the wrong dream suddenly found themselves free. I was there that night, and at many of the other celebrations across Eastern Europe and, yes, Russia, that collectively came to be known as the Fall of the Wall.Many recognized at the time that this was a plunge into the unknown, and many had fears and doubts about where it would all lead. But at the moment when the formidable forces of repression created by the Soviet Union and its minions retreated before the power of the human spirit, there could be only celebration. As there was, unforgettably, that night in Berlin, and as there should be on this anniversary.Over the past 25 years we have learned that building democracy requires more than triumphant moments like that night in Berlin \u2014 or the many days and nights of the Arab Spring in Middle Eastern capitals. However exhilarating it may be to topple statues of dictators and sack the offices of the political police, these are symptoms of a failure of the social contract, and not a guarantee that a new one will work better. Democracy is institutions, a culture, a history, a process.Meanwhile, in UkraineDemocracy is not what transpired in the sham elections held on Nov. 2 in Donetsk and Luhansk, the Ukrainian cities and surrounding areas held by pro-Russian separatists. Though many of the people who cast ballots may have honestly believed they were helping end the chaos in which they\u2019ve lived for more than half a year now, the elections called by leaders of the self-proclaimed \u201cpeoples\u2019 republics\u201d served only to freeze the conflict, leaving residents in limbo.The elections come a week after parliamentary elections in the rest of Ukraine, with a predictable victory for parties favoring a closer union with the West. The United States, the European Union and the United Nations refused to recognize the voting in the rebel territories, and the government in Kiev condemned it as a violation of a cease-fire agreement laid out by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in September. One result was that Ukraine cut off all state funding to rogue territories.Russia welcomed the elections, declaring that the \u201cpeoples\u2019 republics\u201d now had \u201clegitimate\u201d representatives to negotiate with Kiev on their future status. Moscow can also claim it is responding to legitimate demands for assistance when it funds and otherwise props up the rebel territories. NATO says hundreds of Russian troops are still inside eastern Ukraine training rebel soldiers.For now, the net effect is that Russia has added two more unrecognized \u201cstates\u201d and frozen conflicts to its collection, alongside South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Transnistria. That may suit President Putin just fine, but not his economy: The past week was the worst for the ruble in many years, dropping the Russian currency to all-time lows against the dollar and the euro.After the ElectionsEven if the midterm elections in the United States were not cause for celebration, given the sour mood of the electorate, the low turnout and the partisan attacks, they did demonstrate that there is a way to effect change other than through barricades or sham ballots.The change may not be for the better this time around. It is possible that a Congress now fully in Republican hands will only deepen the ugly duel with the Democratic president that has so damaged Washington in recent years. But there will be new elections in two years.It could also be that a lame-duck president in need of a legacy, a Congress in need of salvaging its brand and a Republican Party looking two years ahead will find ways to cut some deals. Initial signals were mixed, but already on the day after the election there was talk of various walls that could be breached, like reforming the tax code, promoting trade and eliminating the budget deficit.

You could make a cappuccino in the time it took to shift from first to second, and drink it in the time it took to get into third. There are many differences between the Hurac\u00e1n and its predecessor; the transmission is the most immediately noticeable.The 2015 Hurac\u00e1n ditches the single-clutch setup in favor of a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. The twin clutches allow seamless gear changes, up and down, keeping the power of the 5.2-liter V10 flowing in an uninterrupted torrent. Automatic mode is now akin to an actual automatic transmission, in that you don\u2019t notice it lurching from gear to gear like a new driver-ed student. In manual mode, the instant upshifts and perfect rev-matched downshifts make the whole package more cohesive. You\u2019re no longer thinking about the transmission as a separate part of the car. Except, that is, when you\u2019re in manual mode and you prod the accelerator deep toward the floor, prompting an automatic downshift to the lowest possible gear. It\u2019s always a surprise when this happens, the digital tachometer suddenly flickering over to 8,000 r.p.m. as the banshees scream into the cabin and all other traffic seems to freeze. You\u2019re in manual mode, fully in control, except for that one minor exception where the car takes over and catapults you into the next state. With both direct and indirect fuel injection, the V10 makes 602 horsepower at 8,250 r.p.m. This is a naturally aspirated engine \u2014 there are no turbochargers hitting you with a pneumatic ram of torque, just a swelling rush as the revs climb. You\u2019ve got to wind this thing up to exploit its power, and boy is it a joy to do that. Lamborghini claims a top speed of 202 m.p.h. Maybe you could get European delivery and take yours to Germany to dominate the left lane on an autobahn. Or sign up for an event like World Class Driving\u2019s 200 m.p.h. Challenge (since discontinued), where I hit 200 in a Gallardo on a two-mile supersonic runway in the Florida Everglades. (A supersonic runway is one of the few places where you can legally explore this car\u2019s capabilities.)\u00a0There\u2019s a three-mode rocker switch on the steering wheel that lets you choose the aggressiveness of the throttle, stability control and other electronic parameters, including the threshold at which the muffler bypass flaps open. \u201cStrada\u201d is your base setting (the one they must employ to pass the noise tests), followed by \u201cSport\u201d and \u201cCorsa.\u201d In terms of the exhaust sound, this switch could be labeled \u201cLegal,\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s to Say?\u201d and \u201cDefinitely Not.\u201d The steering wheel also hosts the windshield wiper controls and turn signal switch, following Ferrari\u2019s logic that stalks on the steering column only get in the way of the shift paddles. (Also, a lot of switches on the steering wheel conjure a Formula One vibe.) The downside is that sometimes you inadvertently activate the wipers in the middle of a right turn, which undermines your coolness. Just say that you saw a bug on the windshield.There won\u2019t actually be one, of course, because the glass is raked so steeply that insects seem to glance off. I spent six hours on the highway and returned with nary a Culicidae smeared on the windshield. I also returned with a bulging right calf muscle, because this $279,345 car didn\u2019t have cruise control. There is a blank dummy switch on the steering wheel where it will go, once it becomes available. I suggest that since Volkswagen owns Lamborghini, perhaps every Hurac\u00e1n could come with a complimentary Volkswagen Golf S, a $20,000 car that includes cruise control as a standard feature. Using the Golf for long slogs could also help you mitigate the Lambo\u2019s frightening fuel-economy numbers \u2014 an E.P.A.-rated 14 miles per gallon in the city and 20 on the highway. Those trucklike mileage estimates incur a $1,700 gas-guzzler penalty.That is but a pittance for a car that starts at $242,445, though the price seems less excessive when you consider that its quarter-mile time (10.4 seconds) has it hounding the seven-figure Bugatti Veyron. On top of that outlay, the $2,400 dynamic power steering can vary the steering ratio and provide small nudges of countersteer to help pull out of a skid. The $6,900 front-end lifting system seems mandatory for a car that will otherwise scrape its truffle-hunting snout on every speed bump and driveway incline from here to Ocean Drive. And the $3,900 reverse camera is a must-have. Unlike the Aventador, this car doesn\u2019t have \u201cLambo doors\u201d that scissor up and forward, so you can\u2019t back up while sitting nonchalantly on the doorsill looking like a Roman valet. While the Hurac\u00e1n is made of lightweight materials \u2014 its chassis is a hybrid of aluminum and carbon-reinforced plastic; the brake rotors are carbon ceramic \u2014 it doesn\u2019t feel lithe. It\u2019s a stiff car, serious and brutal in the way it goes about its business. In the finest Lamborghini tradition, its limits are high, and you\u2019ll need bravery to explore them. The all-wheel-drive system can send as much as 50 percent of the power to the front wheels, but it can also send 100 percent to the back. The variability in torque distribution means the car\u2019s handling is never going to be as purely predictable as a rear-drive car\u2019s. But all-wheel drive is what allows any driver to exploit the Hurac\u00e1n\u2019s greatest talent, that time-bending acceleration. I mean, the starter button has a red metal cover that you flip up as if you\u2019re arming a warhead. In most cars, that would be a ridiculous pretention. In this one, it feels appropriate: Hurac\u00e1n armed, ready to outrun gravity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Food Power!", "Date": "2014-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are four basic ways to change the food system. I talk about three of them a lot: The first is to eat differently, focusing on good food and especially plants; the second is to bring change to your work, whether that means becoming a farmer or helping other people eat better through your role as a teacher, doctor, artist, techie, lawyer or journalist. The third is to work locally to effect change in, for example, school systems or municipal politics.The fourth is the toughest: Change the system that governs everything, including food. This means changing dominant economic theories and practices, and indeed the nature of capitalism itself. That isn\u2019t happening anytime soon.But incremental changes are possible within that system. Some believe that food is a bipartisan issue, since it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interests to eat better and to protect the environment from the ravages of industrial agriculture. But it\u2019s also true that public health, income inequality, mitigating climate change and fighting racism (just a few examples) are bipartisan issues as well, and we know how slowly change comes with those, even though change is in the interest of all but a few defenders of the status quo.The Obama administration has been recent history\u2019s most vocal and progressive when it comes to food. But it has often been swimming against the tide because Democratic candidates are usually positioned as non-Republicans rather than as progressives with an innovative national campaign.Such a campaign would propose to improve the lives of working people by raising the minimum wage, establishing better policies for sick leave and family leave, creating better jobs and working conditions, improving the safety net, and supporting the re-establishment of unions, and truly progressive taxation on the rich and on corporations. And so on; these are also \u201cfood issues.\u201dIgnoring these issues in the midterm elections gave Republicans what they wanted: a series of contests between not very different candidates, half of whom were in the party of a largely unpopular and arguably stymied president. The results were predictable. (That Obama\u2019s project has been blunted by an often spiteful Congress is true, but when people\u2019s standards of living fall the party in power suffers.)Still, many successful Democrats these days are genuine progressives, and good on food as well. In the Senate they include Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Richard Blumenthal (Connecticut), Jon Tester (Montana), Cory Booker (New Jersey) and Kirsten Gillibrand (New York); in the House, Chellie Pingree (Maine) (full disclosure: a friend), Tim Ryan (Ohio), Earl Blumenauer (Oregon), Rosa DeLauro (Connecticut), Louise Slaughter (New York) and others. Ryan, Pingree and Tester, who is a farmer, have undoubtedly been helped into office in part by their stands on food issues.We are beginning to see the power of food as an issue.Seven months into office, Obama did mention a national soda tax, and later promised to \u201clet folks know\u201d whether their food was genetically modified. (We know how that worked out.) But as a candidate he certainly wasn\u2019t asked, in an open forum, where he stood on eliminating the nonmedicinal use of antibiotics in raising animals, sub-minimum wages in food service, restricting the marketing of junk food to children, and so on. Americans are increasingly aware of and concerned about these issues, and come 2016, it\u2019s the job of F.P.A. and of everyone who can be active in national elections to grill candidates about their views and hold them accountable for their words.That\u2019s got to stop. In food as in other issues, Democrats must put forth policies that are wholly different from \u2014 and better than \u2014 the Republicans\u2019. People often vote for candidates who represent change. And, historically, in the United States big-time change comes from social movements and from swings in voting blocs. We saw this in the 1930s around labor rights and the beginnings of the social safety net, and in the 1960s around civil rights and the safety net\u2019s expansion.Food policy has the potential to change the way people think and the way they vote; if we make our candidates take progressive positions on food, we\u2019ll be forging more progressive candidates. For people interested in good food, there\u2019s no better work to do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Borrowers in Hungary Learn Tough Lessons", "Date": "2014-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceFor many people in Central and Eastern Europe, a new experience began a quarter-century ago. Communist governments collapsed, and the wide world of private ownership, democracy and free markets opened up suddenly.It was not always a happy transition. This month, even as Germans were celebrating the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Hungarian government was passing laws and issuing edicts aimed at helping a large proportion of the populace recover from the mistake of buying houses with loans denominated in Swiss francs.The story of how Hungarians wound up deeply in debt in Swiss francs \u2014 a currency many of them had never possessed and none of them earned at their jobs \u2014 is partly a story of European overconfidence during the boom that preceded the credit crisis. But it is also a story of how poor regulation of banks can be disastrous \u2014 at first for the customers and then for the banks.The fascination with borrowing in foreign currencies spread through several countries in Central and Eastern Europe early in the current century. The benefits were obvious: Because interest rates in other currencies were much lower than those in local currencies, monthly payments on a mortgage denominated in euros or Swiss francs would be lower.The risks were also clear: If the local currency fell relative to the foreign currency, monthly payments would rise, perhaps precipitously.But at the time, that risk seemed manageable. Capital was flowing into the countries as they joined the European Union and began preparations to adopt the euro. Local currencies were strong and were expected to remain so.Hungarians were perhaps the most eager to borrow in foreign currency, particularly after the government cut back on a previous program to subsidize mortgage loans made in the local currency, the forint.\u201cStarting in 2004, people forgot the government-backed mortgages,\u201d said Zoltan Torok, an economist for the Hungarian unit of Raiffeisen, an Austrian bank.The government says half the households in the country ended up with foreign currency loans. And the situation was made worse by a lack of effective bank regulation. That enabled the banks to make a lot of money \u2014 until the disaster left them weak and the public furious.Some of the loans were denominated in euros, which seemed to make sense at the time because it was widely \u2014 but wrongly \u2014 expected that Hungary would switch to the euro by 2009, five years after it joined the European Union. So someone who took out a 25-year mortgage in euros would have currency risk for only a few years.But most of the loans were denominated in Swiss francs, simply because interest rates \u2014 and therefore initial monthly payments \u2014 were lower. When the Swiss franc appreciated relative to the euro after the financial crisis began in 2008, those borrowers were in even more trouble than those who borrowed in euros.In nearby Poland, the government imposed some regulations. Foreign currency borrowers had to be better off than many borrowers and therefore better able to withstand the risk. The banks were limited in their discretion in choosing exchange rates and had to follow market interest rates in making adjustments \u2014 something that has helped tremendously. Polish borrowers have still suffered, but nothing like those in Hungary.There, it turned out, only the banks were paying close attention to the details of the loan agreements people were signing. They gave the banks considerable discretion in determining the exchange rates they would follow and the interest rates that would be charged. The banks used that discretion to their own benefit.Viktor Orban, the populist who has been Hungary\u2019s prime minister since 2010, has tried a variety of measures to reduce the pain for the borrowers, including a moratorium on evictions of destitute homeowners and a scheme that reduced monthly payments but increased the amount owed. The government has imposed taxes on banks based on their assets, not their profits, of which there are not many.The authoritarian tendencies of the Orban government have drawn criticism in other European capitals, but its promise to hold the banks accountable has not hurt its popularity at home.In July, the government ordered the banks to pay compensation to borrowers who had been damaged by what the government viewed as unfair contracts. This week, Hungary\u2019s constitutional court upheld that law, saying that fairness was always required, meaning the new law did not amount to retroactive legislation. The payments are expected to be made early in 2015.\u201cThe amount the banks will have to pay back could be as much as 900 billion forints,\u201d said Yves Lemay, the managing director of banking and sovereigns at Moody\u2019s Investors Service in London, adding that amount, equal to about $3.5 billion, was \u201cabout 32 percent of the capital buffer of the entire system.\u201dThe government announced this week terms of a conversion of outstanding foreign currency mortgage loans into forints. The banks were relieved that the government chose market rates and that it agreed to provide euros to banks, which had taken on euro obligations to hedge their risks on the mortgage loans.But forcing conversion only assures there will not be more losses from future currency depreciation. It does nothing to offset the earlier depreciation. And the required compensation will not come close to making borrowers whole.Susanne Urogdi Kocsis, a 57-year-old Budapest resident, says she borrowed the equivalent of 7.4 million forints, or around $42,000, in 2007 to buy a larger apartment for her family. She says she has already paid back 4.5 million forints, \u201cbut the bank is asking for 11 million.\u201d She thinks converting the loan to forints, as the government is forcing banks to do, will be of little help. \u201cA lot of people won\u2019t be able to pay back, and we will never be able to get new loans,\u201d she said this week.Before the crisis, and the plunge in the forint, Hungary\u2019s banking system appeared to be profitable and well capitalized. Now none of the banks have investment grade ratings. Moody\u2019s, the credit rating firm, rates the only large Hungarian-owned bank, OTP Bank, at Ba1, the highest junk bond rating. Other banks, most of them controlled by Western European banks, have lower ratings. Several have needed capital infusions from corporate parents.The forint is now worth about 36 percent less in Swiss francs than it was when Hungary joined the European Union in 2004. Hungary\u2019s economy grew at an annual rate of 4.1 percent from 1999 to 2006. Seven years later, it was smaller than it had been in 2006, although it did grow 1.1 percent in 2013.The banks have suffered huge losses, said Mr. Torok, the bank economist, mentioning both the economic slump and the government actions. \u201cBut it is not like somebody is winning. Everybody is losing. The households are losing. The government is not winning.\u201dThe High & Low Finance column on Friday, about the way in which Hungarians ended up deeply in debt in Swiss francs, misstated Moody\u2019s credit rating of OTP Bank, a large Hungarian-owned financial institution. It is Ba1, which is the highest junk bond rating, not Ba2.Helene Bienvenu contributed reporting and Palko Karasz contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Well-Trod Victims of the Oil Fields: Roads Used to Get There", "Date": "2014-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneCRYSTAL CITY, Tex. \u2014 With much of the town sleeping, Tino Mendoza walked across a moonlit bus yard on a recent morning, preparing for his first trip of the day. While inspecting bus No. 32, he surveyed the latest casualty of this region\u2019s newfound oil and gas economy: a small but growing crack in the windshield. \u201cWe just replaced this one a month ago,\u201d Mr. Mendoza said. \u201cSome of the roads, they just take their toll on it.\u201dMedical centers in rural South Texas have always been few and far between, and getting care is especially difficult for those who cannot drive. The Southwest Area Regional Transit District, a 33-year-old organization financed largely through state grants, has used drivers like Mr. Mendoza, 28, to help shuttle people who cannot otherwise get to their medical appointments. But a rush to the Eagle Ford Shale \u2014 the oil-rich fields that have brought prosperity to many here \u2014 is clogging that lifeline. Roads crumbling under the weight of oil tankers blowing out tires, breaking axles and cracking windshields. And eighteen-wheelers crowd the roads, contributing to accidents and long waits in traffic. As a result, bus drivers must start earlier \u2014 and some patients must wait longer for rides home from their appointments. Such conditions are common across parts of South and West Texas, where a drilling bonanza has transformed life for better and for worse. \u201cWe literally start our routes in many areas as early as 2:30 in the morning,\u201d said Sarah Hidalgo-Cook, the transit district\u2019s general manager. \u201cIt does pose more expenses on our part \u2014 the fact that we have longer hours.\u201dHigh-paying oil field jobs are also siphoning workers from the local talent pool, making it hard to find mechanics and drivers. As a result, Ms. Hidalgo-Cook said, the district has been forced to shrink coverage in the eight-county region it serves. Mr. Mendoza, who frequently gets recruiting calls from oil field service companies, says he has no plans to bolt for a higher-paying job. Before taking this job two years ago he drove a dump truck, working 16-hour days. He would rather spend time with his wife and three children, he said, though he enjoys getting to know his passengers.One passenger is Jesus de Leon, a 50-year-old former oil field worker who now uses a walker and receives disability benefits. For seven years, the service has taken him to and from dialysis appointments. \u201cAll my relatives work, so that\u2019s why I have to rely on this bus,\u201d Mr. de Leon said. \u201cIt\u2019s a vital necessity right now.\u201d By 4 a.m., Mr. Mendoza was already en route to his first pickup, an elderly woman who needed dialysis treatment about 15 miles away in Carrizo Springs.\u201cThere\u2019s days when we try to avoid everything,\u201d he said as he approached an intersection. \u201cThis intersection itself, there\u2019s been, I say, about 15 or 20 accidents since I started.\u201dEarlier this year, he said, a flipped semi backed up traffic for three hours, leaving riders waiting for pickups. Several riders on Mr. Mendoza\u2019s route said they do not begrudge the industry for the inconveniences. Many have relatives working in the oil fields; some have worked for energy companies. But they cannot ignore what the trucks have done to the roads. \u201cI\u2019d be afraid to be driving on these roads right now if I could drive,\u201d Mr. de Leon said. \u201cThe oil field traffic doesn\u2019t care. The big trucks will get in your way purposefully because they want to pass.\u201dMaria Rios, a rider with diabetes, enjoys the bus. The seats are comfortable, and she gets to see her friends, she said. But the roads? \u201cThey\u2019re all broken by the 18-wheelers,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t like that because we go bouncing and bouncing and bouncing.\u201d Advertisement"}

Businesses like Airbnb say they are making the world more efficient by connecting buyers and sellers of services in ways never possible before.

After Mr. Mubarak was ousted in February 2011, she was one of the few of his cabinet ministers retained in the military-led transitional government.Prosecutors accused the organizations\u2019 employees, including dozens of Egyptians, of violating a strict but seldom-enforced ban on receiving unauthorized financing from abroad, charges punishable by prison time. But in court papers and the state news media, Ms. Abul Naga further accused the organizations of participating in a scheme by the American government to stir unrest in the streets.\u201cThe United States and Israel could not directly create and sustain a state of chaos, so they used direct funding, especially American, as the means to reach those goals,\u201d Ms. Abul Naga told investigators before the raids, in testimony later reported in the state news media.\u201cEvidence shows the existence of a clear and determined wish to abort any chance for Egypt to rise as a modern and democratic state with a strong economy,\u201d she continued, \u201csince that will pose the biggest threat to American and Israeli interests, not only in Egypt but across the whole region.\u201d The International Republican Institute, she said, served the \u201cright wing\u201d agenda of the Republican Party.

Dozens of Egyptian staff members were convicted and given suspended sentences.Ms. Abul Naga disappeared from the public eye with the election in 2012 of President Mohamed Morsi, an Islamist later deposed by the military.Her return as national security adviser coincides with new signs that the government may be cracking down again on nonprofit groups. Most rights groups and many other nonprofits here have operated for years in a kind of legal twilight, more or less openly violating the unenforced prohibition on receiving foreign financing without government authorization and oversight.But the government recently announced a deadline of Nov. 10 for full compliance with the old laws.

{"Headline": "Japan Abruptly Acts to Stimulate Economy", "Date": "2014-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan is opting for another round of shock treatment, in a stark admission that the country\u2019s economic revival plan is faltering. The bold move helped push stocks higher around the world. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 1.1 percent on Friday, and European equities ended the day up more than 2.5 percent. In Japan, the Nikkei 225-stock index average hit fresh highs, jumping almost 5 percent for the day. The yen fell to its weakest level against the dollar in a month.With pressure mounting, the central bank said it wanted to act pre-emptively, rather than risk eroding the progress the country has made in changing the public\u2019s deflationary mind-set. The Bank of Japan said it would target asset purchases of 80 trillion yen a year, or $734 billion, up from a previous range of \u00a560 trillion to \u00a570 trillion.The decision underscores Japan\u2019s divergent path with the United States. Citing the strength in the American economy, the Federal Reserve ended its six-year bond-buying campaign this week, an important milestone in the country\u2019s recovery. The Bank of Japan is hardly alone in struggling to keep consumer prices rising at a rate considered desirable by central bankers \u2014 typically about 2 percent, a level where increases are mild but still comfortably above deflation. Prices have been falling in parts of crisis-stricken Europe. Even in the United States, where the economy is stronger and the Fed\u2019s bond-buying program had been criticized by some inflation hawks, the rate remains below the official 2 percent objective. In the last week, Sweden\u2019s central bank, considered one of the most inflation-phobic, cut its benchmark short-term interest rate to zero in an effort to ward off falling prices. The strategy has provided a much-needed jolt to the economy, albeit one whose effects have been unevenly distributed. Cheap money and the depreciating effect it has had on the yen have encouraged investors to pile into shares of big manufacturing companies like Toyota and Hitachi. Those companies\u2019 profits have risen with the currency\u2019s fall because they do much of their business outside Japan in currencies like the dollar and the euro. The markets are likely to get another lift next year, as the government\u2019s giant pension fund moves more aggressively into stocks. The Government Pension Investment Fund said on Friday that it would aim to hold 50 percent of its assets in stocks, up from 24 percent now. The announcement by the central bank amounted to an acknowledgment that the economy needed even more help. Consumer spending has slipped since the sales tax increase of three percentage points in April. Falling oil prices, too, have had an inflation-dampening effect. While prices have been rising, the Bank of Japan\u2019s favored measure of consumer inflation, which excludes the price of fresh food, has been stuck at just over 1 percent for months. The bank also said that its stimulus measures had had a smaller-than-expected effect on growth, cutting in half its estimate for expansion in gross domestic product in the fiscal year ending in April, to 0.5 percent.Uncomfortably for policy makers, the recent bout of mild inflation has also been uneven. Exacerbated by the sales tax increase, prices have been going up faster than incomes, in effect making many people poorer. Adjusted for inflation, average incomes for working households were down 6 percent in September, according to government data released on Friday. \u201cIf you\u2019re a small business, or if you\u2019re working a part-time job, you feel that nothing has come your way,\u201d Kathy M. Matsui, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said, though she added that she supported Mr. Abe\u2019s fight against deflation, as well as other goals like deregulation and corporate governance reform.Beating deflation has long been a goal in Japan, one that has eluded successive prime ministers and central bank chiefs. Mr. Kuroda\u2019s efforts have been the most successful so far, yet not everyone is comfortable with his headlong approach to creating money. As in the United States and elsewhere, critics in Japan have warned that quantitative easing encourages the government to pile up debt and could one day lead to runaway inflation. And in a country that still feels the effects of a disastrous land and stock bubble that burst more than 20 years ago, fears of undue asset-price surges remain.The central bank\u2019s decision to ramp up its bond purchases was contentious. Four out of nine of the policy board members voted against it \u2014 a far closer margin than for any other decision by the central bank since Mr. Kuroda took over.But Mr. Kuroda, at a news conference, said that the central bank had an \u201cunwavering commitment to escaping deflation.\u201d In addition to increasing the scale of its bond market intervention, the central bank backed away from its previously specific timetable.

But voters surveyed after casting their ballots, both at the polls on Tuesday and by phone for those who voted early, signaled deep dismay with both parties and were at least as negative about Republican congressional leaders as about President Obama. Mr. Obama was at the center of the campaign debate, if not on the ballot, as Republicans sought to exploit his unpopularity by tying Democratic candidates to him, especially in the fight for control of the Senate. A majority of voters said they disapproved of how the president was doing his job, and about eight in 10 of those who disapproved supported Republicans.As bleak as Democrats\u2019 prospects were, the party succeeded to some degree in its strategy of focusing on female voters, especially minorities and single women, by attacking Republicans for their legislative actions to limit access to abortion and birth control.Democrats won a majority of women, a traditionally supportive group but one that sided with Republicans by a single percentage point in 2010, the previous midterm election year. That setback four years ago was a big factor in enabling Republicans to win control of the House and of many state legislatures and governorships. On Tuesday, single women supported Democrats over Republicans by more than 20 points. In Senate battlegrounds like Colorado, Georgia, Iowa and North Carolina, Democratic candidates also won a majority of women. But it was not enough to avert losses, given the overwhelming support male voters provided for the Republicans.Yet political independents \u2014 a group that six years ago helped propel Mr. Obama to the presidency \u2014 once again supported Republicans, though by a smaller margin than in 2010. Democrats also failed again in other ways to rebuild Mr. Obama\u2019s broad coalition of 2008, losing among middle-aged voters, suburbanites and Catholics, though not as badly as in 2010.Democrats did hold onto groups that form their base: union households, gays, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, younger voters, lower-income Americans, political moderates, Northeasterners, city dwellers, Jewish voters and both those without high school educations and those with graduate degrees.The surveys of voters showed that Republicans also won their core supporters: whites, men, older voters, Southerners, white Protestants, veterans, higher-income people, weekly churchgoers, white evangelical Christians and rural residents. Edison Research conducted the surveys for a consortium of news media organizations. As was true in polls throughout the year, the economy was the top issue on most voters\u2019 minds. Nearly half selected this issue as their top concern \u2014 nearly double the number that picked health care, the next most pressing issue. Fewer than one in five voters named foreign policy or immigration as their primary concern.Despite a range of good economic news of late, including a declining unemployment rate, many voters are not believers.More than three-quarters said they were worried about where the economy is headed in the next year; a majority of those supported Republicans. Voters split evenly on whether the economy is getting better, worsening or staying the same; those who see it getting better backed Democrats by a three-to-one margin while those who foresee conditions getting worse similarly supported Republicans.But perhaps the most telling sign of Americans\u2019 downbeat state of mind was the measure of their confidence \u2014 or lack of it \u2014 in the American dream: About half the voters said they expect that the next generation will not enjoy a better life than Americans today. That was a significant increase from 2010. The pessimistic voters backed Republicans two to one, while the half of Americans who believe the next generation will enjoy the same or better lives voted by a similar margin for Democrats. Over all, more than half of voters expressed negative feelings toward both the Democratic and Republican parties. In a cautionary note for Republicans about reading too much into their victories, one-quarter of the voters who supported the party\u2019s candidates did so despite harboring bad feelings about the party. Among voters who backed Democrats, a significantly smaller share was negative toward that party.Voters\u2019 stances on a number of issues emphasized the stark differences between Democrats and Republicans, and suggested why it has been years since many Americans claimed they saw no difference between the parties. Voters closely split on whether same-sex marriage or marijuana should be legal, for example, with those in favor overwhelmingly supporting Democrats and those opposed supporting Republicans by similar margins.On several issues, majorities expressed views in sync with Democrats. A slim majority said abortion should remain legal; supporters favored Democrats and opponents Republicans. A larger majority agreed that climate change is \u201ca serious problem,\u201d and those who did overwhelmingly supported Democrats, while those who disagreed backed Republicans. And most voters favored allowing immigrants here illegally to have a chance to seek legal status \u2014 a position at odds with Republican opposition that hardened in the course of the year\u2019s campaigns.Voters remain evenly divided over Mr. Obama\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act, which Republicans sought for a third election cycle to make an albatross around Democrats\u2019 necks. On that issue, too, voters who support the law or say it should have gone farther overwhelmingly went for Democrats while opponents chose Republicans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finishing Asia Tour, Obama Promotes More Ambitious Foreign Policy", "Date": "2014-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byListening PostBRISBANE, Australia \u2014 When President Obama ended his last trip to Asia in the Philippines in April, he delivered a defense of his foreign policy as a slow, steady pursuit of American interests \u2014 casting himself as a batter who hits singles and doubles, but avoids reckless errors.As he finishes another tour of the region in Australia this weekend, Mr. Obama seems to have found a formula for a more ambitious approach overseas, built around two issues that only recently climbed to the top of his agenda: trade and climate change.Some of the difference is merely a question of timing. Negotiations with the Chinese on the climate and trade agreements had been underway for months. The prospects for a Trans-Pacific Partnership deal improved in recent months, and may actually be helped further in the United States by the Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. These issues do not come without traps of their own. Republicans immediately condemned Mr. Obama\u2019s climate agreement with China. The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said it would require China to do nothing for 16 years while \u201ccreating havoc in my state and other states across the country.\u201dBut administration officials said the accomplishments of the trip exemplified what Mr. Obama hopes will be an \u201caffirmative agenda\u201d in foreign policy \u2014 one that will offset the relentless stream of crises he has confronted, including the Islamic State militant group, the Ebola outbreak and Ukraine.\u201cEven as we have to manage crises, we want to make sure we\u2019re focusing on an affirmative agenda,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser. \u201cI think that\u2019s the common thread on this trip.\u201dMr. Obama clearly relished having momentum as he arrived in Brisbane for a meeting of the Group of 20, the organization of 19 industrial and emerging-market countries plus the European Union. Speaking at the University of Queensland on Saturday, he drew noisy applause when he talked about how the climate deal with China could galvanize efforts to negotiate a new global climate treaty in 2015.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to overcome old divides, look squarely at the science and reach a strong global climate agreement next year,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIf China and the United States can agree on this, then the world can agree on this. We can get this done.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s words carried an extra edge in Australia, where Prime Minister Tony Abbott is a blunt skeptic about the science behind climate change. He boasted to the leaders gathered for the meeting that his government had repealed a tax on carbon emissions \u2014 a key tool to curb the greenhouse gases that heat up the atmosphere.The timing was clearly intended to prod other would-be donors, like Japan, which was expected to announce a contribution of up to $1.5 billion toward the fund\u2019s total goal of $10 billion.Mr. Obama seemed well aware of what he was doing. Australia and the United States, he said, both have bad track records on carbon emissions because they share a frontier tradition and an abundance of fossil fuels \u2014 \u201cwhich means,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to step up.\u201d That line drew a burst of applause from the audience. Australian officials listened respectfully but left little doubt where they stood afterward.\u201cAustralia is a resources-exporting economy: coal, gas, uranium,\u201d said Tim Nicholls, the treasurer and minister of trade of the State of Queensland. \u201cWe think a sensible debate is absolutely necessary, but we also think there is a future for coal, as there is for gas.\u201dMr. Obama came to the meeting with another advantage: The American economy is growing more rapidly than most others, especially Japan\u2019s and Europe\u2019s. He said the United States would push for countries to pursue more expansionary economic policies to stimulate demand and create jobs.\u201cOver the last few years,\u201d he said, \u201cthe United States has put more people back to work than all other advanced economies combined. But America can\u2019t be expected to just carry the world economy on our back.\u201dSome economists predicted that Mr. Obama\u2019s words would carry weight in a way that they did not in previous years because the United States is so obviously outperforming its peers.\u201cThe rest of the world is looking at the United States with a degree of envy,\u201d said Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard. \u201cThe way that the U.S. has recovered, the way it relatively quickly handled its banking crisis, the shale revolution and so on.\u201dStill, it is not clear how long the afterglow from Mr. Obama\u2019s trip will last. He must deal with Republicans who have pledged to fight him on issues from an immigration overhaul to the Keystone XL pipeline. Many Democrats will not cheer his success if he manages to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Mr. Obama will also have to deal again with the crises in Syria and Iraq, where the Pentagon is sending more American troops, and in Ukraine, where there are new reports of Russian troops fighting inside the country.Even in Brisbane, where he spoke hopefully of the reinvigorated American role in Asia, Mr. Obama referred to the other headaches he faced, singling out the international response to the \u201cappalling\u201d downing of a Malaysian jetliner in Ukraine, which killed 38 Australian citizens and residents.

{"Headline": "Will Texas Meet Budget? It Is All in the Math", "Date": "2014-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 A small group of Texas legislators will meet this week to decide how much they think the state\u2019s economy will grow in the next two years.The growth rate adopted two years ago was 10.71 percent. Two years before that, it was 8.92 percent. This year, the Legislative Budget Board will choose from four growth forecasts ranging from 11.68 percent to 15.71 percent.This is dry stuff, but it carries a potent political charge. Whatever number is picked will effectively set the upper limit on state spending in the next budget, which lawmakers will write during the session that begins in January.It is known as the cap, and the phrase to watch for is \u201cbusting the cap\u201d \u2014 what lawmakers and others call it if and when they exceed the spending limit, or think about it, or want to block some program that would force them to spend beyond it.Busting the cap is a matter of getting enough lawmakers \u2014 a simple majority, in fact \u2014 to vote to spend more than is allowed to keep pace with the state\u2019s adopted growth limit.Because they are experienced with budget arithmetic and because they are (and this is intended in the most positive way) scheming politicians, there are ways to cheat. Those could come into play later in the session \u2014 in late April or early May \u2014 if the people in charge decide to push the limits set this week.Conservative groups have tried to get rid of loopholes in the spending limits by applying them to the budget as a whole instead of to parts of it, and limiting the total to what is needed to cover inflation and population growth. The current cap does not apply to federal funds, or even to all state money, but only to growth in spending from tax revenue that is not dedicated by the state Constitution. In plain language, that means more than half of the state budget operates outside the cap. Expect those groups to be back next year with harder limits in mind when the full Legislature returns.In the meantime, the cap will serve as a warning sign for agencies and others coming to budget writers looking for money. It makes denial a bit easier to take, if you think about it. Without a cap, budget people deciding not to spend money on a particular project have nothing to soften the blow.This time around, it appears that there will not be a shortage of money. A booming economy and energy industry have made the state government prosperous. The comptroller will put actual numbers to the revenue forecast soon, and the spending limit has not yet been set, but it seems safe to say that more money will be available to lawmakers than the spending cap will allow them to spend.Unresolved litigation over state financing for public schools offers one reason to keep the doors to the state treasury closed. A state district court ruled earlier this year that Texas lawmakers have not put enough money into public schools to reach the standards they themselves set, and have not ensured each student a shot at the same quality of education. The state appealed to the Texas Supreme Court. Depending on the outcome, lawmakers could be called upon to spend some money on schools.In the long term, that could strain the budget. In the short term, it offers a handy excuse for budget writers trying to explain why they will not open the treasury while the state is so flush. Between that and the spending cap, they have the brakes they need, should they wish to use them.Unless, of course, somebody wants to bust the cap.rramsey@texastribune.org Ross Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a regular column for The Tribune.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Strategy for Rich Countries: Absorb More Immigrants", "Date": "2014-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewEconomic debate since the financial crisis and Great Recession has often focused on issues like monetary policy, fiscal stimulus, unemployment and financial regulation. Yes, these are all important, but in the future we will need to pay much more attention to a relatively neglected field: population economics. It\u2019s an area that will prove central to understanding whether nations will grow richer \u2014 or will stagnate and lose global importance. To the contrary, they see an 80 percent probability that the world\u2019s population, now 7.2 billion, will rise to as much as 12.3 billion by 2100. One reason, they say, is that a decline of Africa\u2019s fertility rate is proceeding at a slower pace than had been expected.Unfortunately, regions with rapidly growing populations, like Africa and South Asia, often have lower living standards. In our likely global future, these regions will have more people than they can comfortably support, while many countries in the West and in East Asia will have too few young people for prosperous economies.As an economist, I see an obvious solution: Relatively underpopulated and highly developed countries could profitably take in young Africans and South Asians \u2014 and both sides would gain. Yet it\u2019s far from clear that all nations that could benefit from this policy would entertain it, partly because of persistent racial and cultural bias. There is also the legitimate question of how quickly immigrants can adjust to new environments, especially if they are arriving with weak educational backgrounds as the job market demands ever-stronger skills. Developed countries that can absorb new immigrants at a modest cost should have relatively bright futures. They will help enable a rebalancing of population that will help the entire planet. In contrast, developed countries with relatively inflexible notions of national identity, and thus with strict immigration policies, may shrink in population and lose influence. Of course, immigration is only one potential remedy. If countries can create flexibility in working conditions, and make living expenses reasonable enough, their families may wish to have more children. Japan now has two main options: encouraging more childbearing and learning how to accept and absorb more immigrants. But it does not seem close to managing either task. Japan isn\u2019t the only nation facing this quandary; it just happens to be experiencing the problems first. Also heading toward population decline are China (with its heritage of a one-child-only policy) as well as South Korea and parts of Mediterranean Europe. It\u2019s hard to see in Italy, for example, how a shrinking population will handle its debt burden \u2014 or, in China, how a working couple will be able to support four parents as well as its own offspring. On the positive side, a country facing a population decline may have an easier time alleviating environmental woes. But dynamic, growing countries are more likely to pursue environmental innovation and tackle the problem. Fortunately, the United States has been on a path of at least moderate population growth. But it also faces some major problems. For instance, there is no guarantee that the nation\u2019s relatively high fertility rate will continue. Workplace policies that discourage child-rearing are certainly no help. Ensuring\u00a0a growing\u00a0American population will probably require\u00a0immigration reform, which has not been a high priority for Republicans, who gained full control of Congress in last week\u2019s elections. And while American leaders rarely talk openly about it, they may have geopolitical reasons for not wanting this country to be too much smaller, population-wise, than China. That concern could require accelerating rather than just steady population growth.France, Israel and Singapore are three countries where population issues are being discussed quite frankly; all have explicit public policies to encourage more births. And more countries will probably go down this route. Encouraging people to have more children, and generally bidding for human talent, may characterize the economic policies of the future, just as cities and states today bid for football stadiums and factories.Many economists are uncomfortable with population issues, perhaps because they aren\u2019t covered in depth in the standard graduate curriculum, or because they touch on topics that may be culturally controversial or even politically incorrect. That\u2019s unfortunate. In the future, population economics \u2014 and associated social issues \u2014 are likely to be at front and center of our most important policy concerns.TYLER COWEN is professor of economics at George Mason University.

{"Headline": "U.S. Oil Prices Fall Below $80 a Barrel", "Date": "2014-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe lower oil prices are bringing relief to consumers at the pump in time for the holiday shopping season. The national average price for regular gasoline has fallen below $3 a gallon for the first time in four years, and experts say it could easily drop 25 cents more over the next month.A sustained drop in oil prices could also eventually affect investments in domestic drilling. Most analysts do not think the rise in domestic oil production \u2014 an increase totaling more than a million barrels a day over the last year alone \u2014 will be interrupted anytime soon unless the American benchmark drops to $70 a barrel and stays there for several months. Then less efficient or highly indebted smaller producers would probably have to slow drilling in at least some fields.The cut in Saudi prices for various grades of crude to the United States was modest \u2014 roughly 45 cents a barrel. But the move was viewed by many energy experts as a sign that the kingdom was trying to compete with American oil to protect its market share.Saudi Arabia considers its relationship to the United States to be a cornerstone of its foreign policy and its security, and it is a partner with Royal Dutch Shell in owning several refineries on the Gulf of Mexico coast \u2014 in part to assure that the Persian Gulf kingdom will remain an important supplier to the American market.The price cut came as Saudi Arabia raised its selling prices in Asia, confusing many experts about its intentions. The move in Asia reversed Saudi cuts in oil prices there in recent months to compete with oil from Nigerian and other African suppliers, which helped push down world prices early last month.Saudi Arabia has been competing vigorously in Asia against an influx of African oil that had once been pumped for the American market. That oil has recently been pushed almost completely out of the American market because of the increased United States production of similar grades of shale oil.Several oil analysts said the reaction to the Saudi move, which many characterized as otherwise modest, demonstrated the skittishness of commodity traders over the slowing European and Asian economies.The American West Texas Intermediate benchmark price had been moving modestly higher in the early part of the day until the new Saudi prices were reported. Light, sweet oil for delivery in December quickly fell $1.76, to $78.78 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a decline of more than 2 percent. It was the lowest settlement price recorded since June 2012.\u201cThe price is going to continue to go down because the market continues to be oversupplied,\u201d said Lawrence Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, which is partly financed by the oil industry. \u201cThe Saudi move today doesn\u2019t address the fact that there is too much supply chasing too little demand.\u201dBrent crude, which was also higher for parts of the day, fell along with the American benchmark by $1.08, to $84.78 a barrel. That represents about a 25 percent drop since the early summer, when oil prices soared as fighting intensified in Iraq, a critical member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.OPEC is scheduled to meet Nov. 27 in what could become a power struggle between members that are comfortable with lower prices and others, like Venezuela, that seek a cut in production to shore up prices.Many analysts say that oil prices might recover by then, at least somewhat, if the Islamic State forces reinvigorate their offensive in Iraq or if competing militias interrupt renewed exports of Libyan oil, which have unexpectedly added more than 600,000 barrels of oil to the world market in recent months.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Work-for-Welfare Gains a Foothold in Hungary", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHalmaj JournalHALMAJ, Hungary \u2014 The big sow nearest the barn door looked especially frisky this chilly morning. About the size of a Dumpster, and nearly as fragrant, she poked her speckled snout through the bars of her pen and snorted happily as Jeno Baba, 27, stroked her bristled head.\u201cEverything is looking good,\u201d said Jozsef Toth, making a late morning inspection. Mr. Baba nodded, cap in hand.Mr. Toth is the boss here, as he is in pretty much every functioning facility in the village, from the pasta factory to the produce stand to the flat fields of vegetables and the nearby horse corrals. He is also the mayor.Mr. Baba, laid off from his job assembling BlackBerry devices at a now defunct factory, is glad to have the work, even if he is required to do it to qualify for public assistance.\u201cEverybody knows you can\u2019t get money if you don\u2019t work,\u201d he said.Under a program instituted by the right-wing government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the unemployed must take jobs in \u201ccommunal work programs\u201d to get more than the bare minimum in public assistance. Hundreds of thousands of Hungarians have been given work in the program, including Mr. Baba.If all of this sounds a little, well, generous for a leader accused of authoritarian leanings, Mr. Orban\u2019s supporters say that just shows a misunderstanding of the different way that former Communist countries like Hungary develop.\u201cThere are between 300,000 and 500,000 people who are able to work, but their socialization to work is very weak,\u201d said Lajos Kosa, the executive vice president of Mr. Orban\u2019s governing Fidesz party. \u201cThey need to be led back to the world of employment, but they are lacking fundamental skills.\u201dThose fundamental skills include showing up for work on time or finishing an assigned task, he said.Halmaj, with its 1,800 residents, is a small grid of streets lined with one-story homes with peaked, red-tile roofs beside the narrow trickle of the Barsonyos River. It lies just out of sight of the main highway connecting dour, industrial Miskolc, Hungary\u2019s third-largest city, with the nearby Slovak border. Passing motorists hardly know it is there.Yet in many ways, Halmaj is representative of the forces at work in the poor, rural parts of Hungary under Mr. Orban\u2019s tenure.There is the struggling economy, the endemic unemployment that the government combats with public works projects, and the desire to assimilate poor villagers into a life of working for a paycheck.But not least, there is also the yearning for a Hungarian identity in a country where many residents feel it is under threat from immigrants, emigration and a creeping, Pan-European lifestyle that softens the edges of their national identity. Mr. Orban has made this nationalistic yearning the cornerstone of his appeal.\u201cWe are losing touch with our past, we are losing touch with everything,\u201d complained Mr. Toth, a member of the Fidesz party. \u201cBut now, I think, people understand that it is important, and they are collecting old family photographs and pieces of the past, before it disappears.\u201dHe walked over and ran his hands along the ornate, wooden fence surrounding an old churchyard, freshly built by city workers using a traditional design. \u201cA country that loses touch with its past has lost its soul,\u201d Mr. Toth said.To receive more than the bare minimum of public assistance, about $90 a month, residents must take one of these communal jobs. If they do, they can make anywhere from $180 to $285 per month, depending on the skill level of their job and the number of children they have at home.At the moment, Mr. Toth is employing 140 to 150 people \u2014 a few are unreliable on showing up every day \u2014 and they work on seven projects. One crew digs ditches, cuts weeds and performs other village improvements. Another tends pine trees, chopping the trees for firewood and grinding them to feed a biomass boiler that heats a few of the public buildings. Some tend pigs and chickens, others manage a growing herd of horses. A handful of village women work in a pasta factory, sorting 10 shapes of noodles on a broad butcher block snowy with flour.The largest team cultivates vegetables and grains on 110 surrounding acres owned by the village, food that is used to feed schoolchildren or is sold in a small market by a plump, cheerful woman in a flowered apron \u2014 beans, beets, potatoes, cucumber, peppers and celery.A few residents still refuse to take part in the communal work, but not many. Before the program, unemployment in the village was 20 percent, Mr. Toth said. Now, it is 4 percent.\u201cThe idea,\u201d Mr. Toth said, \u201cis to create projects that add value to the village, that will become self-sustaining, and to build the self-esteem of the unemployed and to lead them back to work.\u201dThe village also passed a law requiring every homeowner to maintain their property, and to cultivate their back gardens rather than letting the weeds take over. If they do not, public assistance is cut off.He proudly displays a glossy book published by the government called \u201cBest Practices in Communal Work.\u201d Halmaj is one of the three dozen towns featured.Critics sometimes compare the system to a form of forced labor.\u201cPublic work is not real work,\u201d scoffed Janos Orsos, who volunteers with a religious group to work with Roma. \u201cPublic salary is not real salary.\u201dFor Mr. Toth, though, the whole program is a pure win-win.\u201cSome of the people welcomed the idea, and it was easy to get them involved,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cOthers, who did not like the work ethic, didn\u2019t welcome the idea in the same way.\u201dEventually, though, they came around, he said. There was no choice, really.The Halmaj Journal article on Tuesday, about a Hungarian work program for the unemployed, and how it has taken effect in the village of Halmaj, misspelled the given name of the village\u2019s mayor. He is Jozsef Toth, not Jozef. The article also transposed the given and family names of a communal worker. He is Jeno Baba.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": " Another Widening Gap: The Haves vs. the Have-Mores", "Date": "2014-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside WealthPhilip Rushton has been selling private jets to the global rich for more than three decades. In just about every economic cycle, sales of small jets and big jets tended to move together \u2014 rising and falling with financial markets and fortunes of the wealthy. Now, however, the jet market is splitting in two. Sales of the largest, most expensive private jets \u2014 including private jumbo jets \u2014 are soaring, with higher prices and long waiting lists. Smaller, cheaper jets, however, are piling up on the nation\u2019s private-jet tarmacs with big discounts and few buyers.The wealthy now have a wealth gap of their own, as economic gains become more highly concentrated at the very top. As the top one-hundredth of the 1 percent pulls away from the rest of that group, the superrich are leaving the merely very rich behind. That has created two markets in the upper reaches of the economy: one for the haves and one for the have-mores. Whether the product is yachts, diamonds, art, wine or even handbags, the strongest growth and biggest profits are now coming from billionaires and nine-figure millionaires, rather than mere millionaires.Of course, the lesser 1 percenters are still doing just fine. But a closer look at the divergence at the very top rungs of the ladder offers a more detailed view of the drivers of inequality today. And the divide is reshaping the luxury end of the consumer economy. The wealth of the top 1 percent grew an average of 3.9 percent a year from 1986 to 2012, though the top one-hundredth of that 1 percent saw its wealth grow about twice as fast. The 16,000 families in that tiptop category \u2014 those with fortunes of at least $111 million \u2014 have seen their share of national wealth nearly double since 2002, to 11.2 percent.\u201cWealth is getting more concentrated in the United States,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBut this phenomenon largely owes to the spectacular dynamics of fortunes of dozens and hundreds of million dollars, and much less to the growth in fortunes of a few million dollars.\u201dDr. Saez and Dr. Zucman wrote that a \u201csnowballing effect\u201d was creating extravagant wealth at the very top. Outsize incomes \u2014 fueled in part by stock \u2014 are put into savings and investments, which generate more income, which creates even more wealth.Mr. Rushton, the jet broker, has seen that snowball up close. During the financial crisis in 2009, the market for virtually all private jets collapsed. Yet, in a contrast to earlier recoveries, the demand for new, large-cabin jets has staged a much stronger comeback while the supply of new and used smaller and midsize jets is piling up.According a jet market report from Citi Private Bank, deliveries of new so-called light jets \u2014 the smaller, cheaper models \u2014 were down 17 percent last year from 2012 and 67 percent from their 2008 peak. But deliveries of the biggest new private jets jumped 18 percent last year.Sales of personal, V.I.P. jetliners are also strong. Boeing has received several orders from individuals for its 777-300ER (which normally carries 400 passengers) and its even bigger 747-800. \u201cThe really top guys are insulated from fluctuations in the economy,\u201d Mr. Rushton said. \u201cThey\u2019ve always got money, and they have even more today.\u201dFor decades, a rising tide lifted all yachts.

{"Headline": "Why 2014 Isn\u2019t as Good as It Seems for the Republicans", "Date": "2014-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMidterm CalculusThe Republicans are looking forward to having a good week. They are favored to win the Senate, and they could pick up enough House seats to finish with their largest margin since 1928.But perhaps more important to the party\u2019s long-term prospects than Tuesday\u2019s results is what unfolds in the presidential battleground states. If the night ends with tight races in Iowa, North Carolina, Colorado and Georgia, as the polls suggest, then the results will not be as great for Republicans as many analysts will surely proclaim.Even if the Republicans win these states, which would all but ensure Senate control, it will probably be mostly because of low midterm turnout among Democratic-leaning young and nonwhite voters. The implication would be that Republican Senate candidates did not win many voters who supported President Obama in 2012. And it would suggest that Republicans have made little progress in attracting voters they would need to take back the White House.If there were a time when the Republicans ought to be making inroads into the Obama coalition, this should be it. The economy remains mediocre in many respects; there is turmoil in much of the world; and the American public is decidedly downbeat about the state of the country under Mr. Obama. His approval ratings have sagged into the low 40s. A significant proportion of Democratic-leaning voters say they disapprove of his performance.Historically, presidential ratings like these have permitted the party that does not hold the White House to make substantial gains. This year, however, Democratic Senate candidates in the battleground states have largely reassembled the coalition that supported Mr. Obama two years ago. Democratic candidates would probably win Colorado, North Carolina, Iowa and Georgia \u2014 along with control of the Senate \u2014 if those who vote were as young, diverse and Democratic as they were in 2012 or will be in 2016.This is not to say that the Democratic coalition is invulnerable. Polls suggest that the party is not faring as well among young or Hispanic voters as in years past. But the inability of Republicans to secure additional gains is a telling indicator of how hardened political sentiments are in the post-Bush, late Obama era. It also shows the limited appeal of Republican candidates to the voters who supported Mr. Obama in 2012 but are dissatisfied with him now. Mr. Obama and his low approval ratings won\u2019t be on the ballot in 2016; the Republican Party and its even lower approval ratings will be.Above all, the pattern is a reminder of how difficult it will be for Republicans to overcome the demographic and generational changes that have marginalized their traditional coalition in presidential elections. Republicans fare poorly among every large demographic group that is a growing share of the electorate, including Latinos, Asian-Americans and young adults.To a certain extent, the Republicans are already compensating. They remain competitive nationally, despite the large demographic changes, because the Democrats have lost a huge share of support among white Southerners over the last decade. These losses have given the Republicans a decided advantage in the House, and are giving them an opportunity to win the Senate this year. But the Republican gains have done little good in the presidential battleground states, which are largely outside the South, putting Republicans at a slight disadvantage in the Electoral College.The fact that the races in all of the presidential battleground states stayed close, despite an older and whiter electorate, suggests that Mr. Obama is not yet so unpopular as to cause the voters who remained Democratic-leaning through 2012 to vote Republicans into federal office.This is perhaps most evident in Iowa, an overwhelmingly white state. It has tilted just slightly Democratic. If Republicans were going to gain voters who used to lean Democratic, Iowa would be the place where we would see it. Mr. Obama\u2019s approval ratings in Iowa are particularly weak, in part because the state is full of white voters without college degrees \u2014 the group where Mr. Obama\u2019s support has always been weakest.The Democratic Senate candidate in Iowa, Bruce Braley, has not run a great campaign. He committed one of the more cringe-worthy gaffes of the cycle when he belittled Senator Charles E. Grassley for being \u201ca farmer from Iowa who never went to law school\u201d at a fund-raiser with a group of lawyers. Yet Mr. Braley is locked in a tight race with his Republican opponent, Joni Ernst. If Ms. Ernst wins by a margin of a point or two, that suggests she probably would have lost with a presidential-year electorate.The story is perhaps even more troubling for Republicans in the South, where Democratic candidates are doing well among white voters.If Republicans cannot maintain their exceptional margins among Southern white voters in the post-Obama era, their path to victory will get very narrow in states like Georgia and Florida. In both, the white share of the electorate has dropped by more than 10 percentage points since 2000.The Republicans have their best shot at a breakthrough in Colorado, where polls show Cory Gardner, the Republican candidate, ahead by a modest margin in a state President Obama won comfortably in 2012. As in the other states, the off-year voters will probably be more favorable to Mr. Gardner than presidential-year voters, but the state now has universal mail voting, which should encourage more Democratic voters.If turnout is high and Mr. Gardner wins by a modest margin, it will be a sign that he won voters who did not support Mitt Romney in 2012. That would be an impressive and important accomplishment against a Democratic incumbent in a state that the Democrats will be counting on to get to 270 electoral votes in 2016.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Enduring Republican Grip on the House", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical CalculusWhatever doubts existed about the Republican grip on the House should now be gone.By picking up at least a dozen House seats in the elections last Tuesday, the Republicans cemented a nearly unassailable majority that could last for a generation, or as long as today\u2019s political divides between North and South, urban and rural, young and old, and white and nonwhite endure.Democrats might well reclaim the Senate and hold the presidency in 2016. But any Democratic hopes of enacting progressive policies on issues like climate change and inequality will face the reality of a House dominated by conservative Republicans. The odds that the Republicans will hold the Senate and seize the presidency are better than the odds that Democrats will win the House, giving the Republicans a better chance than Democrats of enacting their agenda.The median House seat is held by a Republican who represents a district that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, even in a year in which President Obama won by four percentage points nationally. The Republicans hold only 28 seats in districts that were carried by Mr. Obama. Many of these seats would fall to the Democrats in an anti-Republican year. The 12 newly elected Republicans who won seats in districts carried by Mr. Obama in 2012 are particularly vulnerable; many of these freshman Republicans could lose re-election in 2016.Yet Democrats will have a struggle to win all of the seats held by Republicans that voted for Mr. Obama in 2012. The benefits of incumbency will allow many of these Republicans to defy even the most inhospitable conditions. And some of these Republicans, like Dave Reichert of Washington or Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey, are survivors of the 2006 and 2008 waves.To gauge the problem for Democrats, look at the Cook partisan voting index, which measures districts by presidential votes. (A district with a D+5 P.V.I., for instance, has offered the Democratic presidential candidate a share of the popular vote 5 percentage points higher than the national average over the last two presidential elections.) If a future Democratic wave were to flip Republican-held seats at the same rate as the Democratic wave in 2006 or the Republican one in 2010 (that is, win about 30 percent of the R+3 seats, and 25 percent of the R+4 seats), they would gain about 27 seats \u2014 short of the 32 necessary to retake the House.Democrats could do even better in the D+1-or-better seats than this scenario projects, but they could also do worse among the seats with a P.V.I. of R+6 or more Republican, where the estimate assumes the Democrats would win four seats. Republicans didn\u2019t win a single seat that was so Democratic in 2010, and the big gains that Democrats made among these seats in 2006 were driven by problems among Republicans who were accused of corruption.In other words, a Republican president is probably a prerequisite to a Democratic House. And even a Republican president might not assure another wave like 2006 or 2010, which itself would not even assure a Democratic House.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Believe the Hype: Holiday Sales Won\u2019t Make or Break the Economy", "Date": "2014-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryday EconomicsIf there\u2019s one thing that the news media across the country can agree upon every November, it is this: The holiday sales season is a time of huge stakes for the economy.And there\u2019s no doubt that retailers themselves (and their shareholders) have a lot riding on their holiday selling season. But the truth is, if you take a more careful look at the numbers, the breathless hype over holiday sales is misleading. In fact, the question of whether this turns out to be a bright holiday sales season or a dull one matters only a little bit for overall measures of the nation\u2019s economic health.To show why, we took the monthly retail sales numbers published by the census and turned to numbers that have not been adjusted to account for seasonal variations. We took out sales at gasoline stations (a tank full of gas makes a terrible Christmas present), but left in all other categories of retail and food services sales.Using this approach, we capture most of what might be plausibly considered holiday-related sales: not just purchases of gifts at Best Buy or Target, but also groceries for a Thanksgiving feast, or the restaurant tab at an office holiday party, or a new car if you happen to listen to the omnipresent commercials this time of year insisting that a car with a big bow on the roof makes a great Christmas gift.There\u2019s no question that December is the strongest month for retail sales. From 1992 to 2013, December retail sales averaged 23 percent higher than the rate from January through October. November was also a good month, averaging 4 percent higher than January through October.But what the retail trade groups are doing when they give big estimates of holiday spending is taking the entirety of retail sales during November and December and chalking them up to the season. That seems just wrong; after all, people have to buy things all the time. The cup of coffee I bought this morning shouldn\u2019t count as holiday shopping just because the calendar happens to say November.So we can get a better picture of the economic impact of holiday shopping not by looking at total retail sales in those two months, but by looking at just the net increase compared with a normal month. Using this measure, if retail sales in November and December of this year exceed normal months this year by the long-term averages, a reasonable forecast for holiday shopping in 2014 would be $16 billion in November and $90 billion in December.In other words, for the last two months of the year, Americans are on track to spend $106 billion more than they would if these were any old months, not the $617 billion that the retailers\u2019 association projects.But even that overstates the degree of mystery surrounding the outcome of this holiday season. Because people spend more money in November and December than in normal months every year, the uncertainty isn\u2019t really over whether spending will increase but by how much. To capture that, we can look at how much holiday spending varies between years and see what the difference looks like between a very good year and a very bad one.In data back to 1992, the worst year for holiday sales is 2008, by a wide margin. If we treat 2008 as an outlier \u2014 the problem that year was not a disappointing holiday sales season, but rather an economy on the verge of collapse \u2014 the range of possibilities for the holiday sales season isn\u2019t that great. Excluding 2008, the year with the worst holiday sales season was 2007, when retail sales were 11 percent higher in November and December than they would have been had they been normal months. The best was 1993, when sales were 20 percent higher.If we treat those as the best-case and worst-case possibilities for the retail sector in 2014, what would that mean in terms of the economy? If this holiday sales season is a disappointment of 2007 caliber, this year\u2019s holiday sales will be a mere $86 billion, not the $106 billion forecast. If it is a giant success of the 1993 variety, that number will move up to $153 billion.In other words, the gap between what holiday sales will be this season in the best and worst cases is a mere $67 billion. That\u2019s all of about 0.4 percent of our $17.6 trillion economy.So when you read eager speculation about whether this holiday sales season will be good or bad, whether shoppers are feeling jolly or not, keep this in mind: The stakes for the overall economy are certainly real, and measurable \u2014 but not quite the make-or-break situation that news media hype might make you think.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Obamacare Do-Over ", "Date": "2014-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMANY political analysts were surprised by how close I came to winning the Virginia Senate race earlier this month. I received more than a million votes running on a five-point plan for economic growth, and the first point was a specific proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act.In a purple state like Virginia, I could not have gotten so close to defeating Mark R. Warner, a popular incumbent, by talking only about \u201crepeal.\u201d But while I wasn\u2019t elected to the Senate, those who were might find these reforms worthy of their support, in part because they were well received in a swing state of considerable importance in the Electoral College.My plan, based on one developed by a public policy group called the 2017 Project, enabled me to rebut the charge that all I wanted to do was go back to things as they were before. Although Obamacare is unpopular, a plan that takes us forward is essential.We need to get rid of Obamacare instead of attempting to fix it because it is fundamentally flawed, cleverly designed to lead us over time to a single-payer system. This will become clearer when the employer mandate provisions kick in next year, with their incentives for companies to dump workers from their employer plans into government-run exchanges. As the exchanges swell and become more costly to taxpayers, we\u2019ll be told that a government monopoly would be more cost-effective.To push back against the bill\u2019s gravitational pull toward a single-payer system that would essentially supplant private insurance with a government program, Republicans must have a plan that addresses the concerns that led to Obamacare\u2019s enactment in the first place: rising costs, too many uninsured people and a lack of protection for patients with pre-existing conditions.My plan begins by addressing an anachronistic aspect of the tax code that\u2019s rooted in World War II wage and price controls. Those who get health insurance through their employer get a tax break, but those who purchase it on their own generally do not.While preserving the tax break for employer-based insurance, my plan would offer health-insurance tax credits for all individuals and families who buy insurance on their own. The tax credit would be $1,200 per year for those under 35 years of age, $2,100 for those 35 to 49, and $3,000 for those 50 or older, plus $900 per child. For a family of four headed by two 40-year-old parents, the tax credit would be like having $6,000 in cash to spend on health insurance. If the family found a plan they liked for less, they could put the difference in a health savings account to help cover out-of-pocket expenses.These tax credits would benefit everyone, whereas under the Affordable Care Act premium assistance almost exclusively benefits the near-poor and the near-elderly, at great cost to the middle class and the young. A household in Virginia of two 36-year-olds making $63,000 a year gets no subsidy under Obamacare, but under my plan, they\u2019d get a tax credit worth $4,200. And those with policies covering adult children up to their 26th birthday could keep them.This plan also has protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Parents with newborns would have six months to buy insurance for the baby without having to pay more for pre-existing conditions, as would young adults who went off their parents\u2019 plans. Anyone who was insured for a year through an employer but lost that insurance would have two months to buy an individual-market plan, using the tax credit, without having to pay more for a pre-existing condition. No one with continuous coverage could be dropped from his or her insurance, or be re-priced, because of a pre-existing condition.My plan would also allocate $7.5 billion a year for state-run \u201chigh risk\u201d pools. People who couldn\u2019t afford insurance on the open market because of a pre-existing condition could not be turned away from these pools or forced to pay more toward their premiums than they could afford. These reforms provide consumer protections but prevent people from gaming the system by going without insurance until they get a costly diagnosis. Repealing Obamacare\u2019s mandates and letting people shop for value as they do when they buy auto insurance would lower health care costs. So, too, would encouraging states to enact sensible medical-malpractice reforms and capping the tax break on employer-based insurance at $20,000 per family plan.Under my alternative, Medicaid would revert to pre-Obamacare eligibility levels. Anyone who was added to Medicaid under Obamacare would be free to buy personal insurance with their new tax credits. Those who remained on Medicaid could voluntarily switch to them.Such reforms would lower premiums, increase consumer choice and not disrupt doctor-patient relationships. According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Center for Health and Economy, the very similar 2017 Project plan was estimated to save $1.1 trillion in federal spending over 10 years versus Obamacare, while reducing insurance premiums and enhancing access to doctors. Rolling back the irresponsible expansion of Medicaid would raise the number of uninsured, but this plan would increase the number of people with private insurance by six million, a better model for sustainable growth.Obviously, enacting legislation along these lines will require a Republican president. That will be more likely if over the next two years the Republican majorities in Congress pave the intellectual way through hearings and committee reports for a positive Obamacare alternative that the Republican presidential nominee can take to the electorate.Ed Gillespie was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate in \nVirginia.

{"Headline": "Republicans Hold the Top 2 Prizes in Governor Races", "Date": "2014-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublicans won the two most intensely followed, high-stakes governor\u2019s races of the year as Rick Scott of Florida and Scott Walker of Wisconsin won re-election on Tuesday in states that both parties are looking to as a gauge of voter sentiment in the run-up to the 2016 presidential campaign.Their victories were part of a sweeping tide of Republican victories in governors\u2019 races. With Republican control of a majority of legislatures, the party was left in firm control of the nation\u2019s state capitals.Republican winners included John Kasich of Ohio and Rick Snyder of Michigan, incumbents who held on in Rust Belt states captured in the Tea Party wave four years ago; Greg Abbott, who easily defeated Wendy Davis in Texas; Gov. Nikki Haley, who won decisive re-election in South Carolina; and Nathan Deal, who beat back a challenge from Jason Carter, a grandson of former President Jimmy Carter.Surprise winners for the Republicans included Bruce Rauner, a money manager who defeated the Democratic incumbent, Pat Quinn, in Illinois, and Larry Hogan, who defeated the current Democratic lieutenant governor of Maryland, Anthony Brown.In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback, on the defensive because of the state\u2019s embattled fiscal situation, turned back his Democratic challenger, Paul Davis. In Maine, Gov. Paul R. LePage, a staunch conservative, defeated Mike Michaud, a Democrat.And in Massachusetts, Martha Coakley, the Democrat, lost a close race to Charles Baker, the Republican.There were a few reasons for Democratic cheer. Gina Raimondo won in Rhode Island, the first Democrat to move into the governor\u2019s mansion there in two decades. Gov. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire was re-elected in her swing state, and in Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf, a businessman, turned out Gov. Tom Corbett. Andrew M. Cuomo and Jerry Brown, as expected, were easy winners in New York and California.The tossup contests included perennial battlegrounds that President Obama won in 2012, like Colorado, Florida and Wisconsin. And there were also unexpectedly close campaigns in states that one party has traditionally dominated, including the Republican strongholds of Kansas and Georgia and the Democratic fortress of Maryland.The many razor-thin contests reflected the sour mood of voters, who have turned against incumbents of both parties, sometimes because of ideological overreach, but more often because of fears of economic insecurity.While the slow recovery gave governors some right to boast \u2014 the employment picture is far better than it was four years ago \u2014 voters were in no mood to give them credit.Many still feel insecure about their own families\u2019 prospects. Only 27 percent of Americans believe the nation\u2019s economy will be better a year from now, a figure that is lower than it was before the elections of 2012 and 2010, according to the Pew Research Center.On paper, this year\u2019s political landscape favored Democrats \u2014 the opposite of the situation in Senate races. While Mr. Obama\u2019s party was trying to hold Senate seats in states he lost in 2012, eight Republican governors who won four years ago were seeking re-election in states the president won twice. Three of those incumbents in particular \u2014 Mr. Scott, Mr. Walker and Mr. Snyder \u2014 were seen as testing Republicans\u2019 ability to deepen their appeal in swing states, with important consequences for the 2016 presidential race.Mr. Walker, who is weighing a run for president, won a second term over Mary Burke, a political novice, in a race in which he made little effort to move to the center. Mr. Snyder seized a second term by taking credit for moving Detroit through bankruptcy, even getting trash picked up, appealing to the heart of Democratic support for his opponent, Mark Schauer.The fortunes of each Republican incumbent in a left-leaning state will be parsed in the days ahead as part of the party\u2019s internal debate over whether it does better by appealing to moderates, or by hewing to conservative fundamentals. Mr. Snyder carved out a moderate profile by expanding Medicaid in Michigan and aiding Detroit. Mr. Walker refused the Medicaid expansion, an option under the federal health care law, and argued that what independent voters crave is leadership.In Maine, Mr. LePage, one of the most conservative governors, vetoed the Legislature\u2019s expansion of Medicaid five times while becoming a lightning rod over his incendiary statements.Going into Election Day, Republicans held 29 governorships and Democrats 21.Mr. Obama, whose unpopularity kept him away from some crucial Senate races, hit the campaign trail for Democratic governors in states where his undimmed popularity with black voters was called on to lift turnout. He made election-eve visits to Wisconsin, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maine and Michigan.Unlike the Senate races, national politics and a referendum on the president rarely animated the campaigns for governor. They followed their own scripts, some with unexpected, even startling turns. Mr. Kasich, once thought to be vulnerable in pro-union Ohio, watched from the sidelines as the Democratic nominee, Ed FitzGerald, all but self-destructed after the revelation that he had driven for years without a valid license.In Pennsylvania, Mr. Corbett, a Republican who was seen as the most vulnerable incumbent in the country for most of the year, never recovered from cuts to education in his first year that lowered classroom spending, which emerged as voters\u2019 top issue. His Democratic opponent, Mr. Wolf, promised to tax the booming natural gas industry to increase school funding.In reliably Republican Kansas, Mr. Brownback, who was elected four years ago with 63 percent of the vote, faced some moderates unhappy with aggressive tax cuts that threaten state support of schools, and at the same time have not produced a jobs boom as promised.Similarly, some Colorado voters have pulled back from Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, for pushing the state leftward on gun issues as well as for his personal opposition to the death penalty.In Georgia, where Republicans control every statewide office, Mr. Carter ran an unexpectedly tight race against Mr. Deal.And in Maryland, where Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley is leaving office after enacting a checklist of progressive priorities, his lieutenant governor, Mr. Brown, nominated to succeed him, lost to Mr. Hogan, who tapped into dislike of high taxes.In Illinois, Mr. Rauner, a Republican private equity executive, poured over $27 million of a personal fortune into his campaign, arguing that he could manage the state better than Mr. Quinn and the entrenched Democrats in the legislature. Mr. Rauner was the top self-funded candidate of 2014, though still not close to the previous record-holder \u2014 Mr. Scott of Florida, who spent about $75 million in 2010.There were some expected results that nonetheless established new milestones. In Iowa, Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican, won a sixth term, which will make him the longest-serving governor in American history. And the Democratic governor of California, Jerry Brown, who at 76 is the nation\u2019s oldest governor, won a fourth term, a state record, after fixing a deeply unbalanced budget by forcing cuts through the Legislature and persuading voters to raise taxes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Federal Reserve Selects New Top Officials, Coalition Calls for Public Input", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A coalition of community groups and labor unions wants the Federal Reserve to change the way some Fed officials are appointed, criticizing the existing process as secretive, undemocratic and dominated by banks and other large corporations.The Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, has agreed to meet on Friday with about three dozen representatives of the groups to hear their concerns.A spokeswoman for Ms. Yellen confirmed the meeting but declined to comment on the issues raised by the groups.The Philadelphia Fed said in an email that the institution \u201cis conducting a broad search for its next president and will consider a diverse group of candidates from inside and outside the Federal Reserve System.\u201dJames Hoard, a spokesman for the Dallas Fed, said the bank\u2019s board would meet on Thursday to discuss the search process.The campaign is part of a broader increase in political pressure on the Fed, which is engaged in a long-running campaign to stimulate the economy that some liberals regard as insufficient and some conservatives see as both ineffective and dangerous. Mr. Barkan led a picket line in support of the Fed\u2019s efforts in August outside the annual monetary policy conference at Jackson Hole, Wyo.House Republicans, meanwhile, have passed legislation that seeks to reduce the Fed\u2019s flexibility in responding to economic downturns, arguing that such efforts are destabilizing.The Fed acts like a monolith, but it has a complicated skeleton. Most power rests with a board of governors in Washington, who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. But operations are conducted through 12 regional banks, each of which selects its own president. And those presidents rotate among themselves five of the 12 seats on the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy.Their replacements will be selected by the board of each reserve bank. Each board has nine members, including three bankers, but under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, only the nonbank members can participate in the process. The banks in each reserve district, however, still elect three of those six nonbank members. The other three, including the chairman and vice chairman, are appointed by the Fed board in Washington.By law, the boards are supposed to represent a diverse set of viewpoints, including \u201clabor and consumers.\u201d But the 72 nonbank board members are predominantly corporate executives. Just eight are leaders of community groups; two more are leaders of labor groups.Corporate executives exclusively make up the boards of the St. Louis and Richmond regional banks. The Dallas Fed\u2019s board includes the presidents of the Houston Endowment \u2014 a charitable organization \u2014 and the University of Houston. The Philadelphia Fed has five executives and the president of the University of Delaware.\u201cI look at that list and it doesn\u2019t strike me that most of those folks are representing the public,\u201d Kati Sipp, director of Pennsylvania Working Families, a nonprofit advocacy group that is one of the signatories of the recent letter, said of the Philadelphia Fed\u2019s board. \u201cWe believe it is important for the people who are making economic policy to hear from the regular folks on the ground who are being affected by those decisions.\u201dThe two dozen signatories also include the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO, New Jersey Communities United and W. Wilson Goode Jr., a Philadelphia city councilman. The letter asks for the Fed to disclose basic information about the selection process, including the timetable, criteria and, eventually, names of candidates. It also seeks search committee seats and opportunities to question the candidates publicly.The selection process is secretive, but control has increasingly shifted from the regional banks to the board of governors. Beginning under the leadership of Alan Greenspan, a former Fed chairman, the central bank has sought presidents who can contribute to making monetary policy. The board provides informal guidance during the winnowing process, and candidates travel to Washington to meet with the governors.As a result of that trend, 10 of the 12 sitting presidents are former Fed staffers, economists or both. Mr. Fisher, a former investor, is one exception. The other is Dennis P. Lockhart, a former banker who leads the Atlanta Fed \u2014 and is the next president who will reach retirement age.An article on Tuesday about a push by a coalition of community groups and labor unions to get the Federal Reserve to change the way some Fed officials are appointed misstated the timing of the retirement of Charles I. Plosser, the president of the Philadelphia Fed. He has announced that he will leave on March 1, not at the end of March.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed and Full Employment ", "Date": "2014-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialJoblessness is now 5.8 percent and has been below 6.5 percent for most of this year, but the Fed, under its current chief, Janet Yellen, has not yet begun to raise rates. That restraint is sensible because despite the drop in unemployment, evidence of labor-market weakness still outweighs signs of progress. Restraint at this time is an easy call for the Fed, because markets have generally focused not on its jobless-rate benchmark, but on the projected start of interest rate increases in mid-2015. The danger is that having created an expectation of higher rates next year, the Fed may justify a premature increase by overstating the progress in the job market. That danger is intensified by pressure to raise rates, mainly from financial firms that cater to bondholders. It has long been apparent that in today\u2019s economy, a falling unemployment rate, on its own, is a misleading measure of job-market health. Much of the drop from the high of 10 percent in October 2009 has been because of a shrunken labor force. Some of that shrinkage is from voluntary retirements, but even by conservative estimates, the unemployment rate today would be 7.2 percent if it counted jobless working-age adults who would be seeking jobs if conditions were stronger. And that is only one of many signs of labor market weakness. Seven million people, 4.5 percent of the work force, are employed part time but need full-time jobs. That is better than 9.2 million \u201cinvoluntary\u201d part-timers in March 2010 but still very high by historical standards.Another sign of weakness is poor wage growth. For several years, hourly wages have barely kept up with prices. Equally troubling, labor\u2019s share of income \u2014 basically, the share of the economic pie that goes to wages as opposed to profits \u2014 remains depressed. The job market is improving. But absent a surge in the pace of improvement, it will still be too weak to withstand tighter monetary policy in the coming year. Advertisement"}

He also emphasized that the exercise was aiming to \u201cconsolidate a doctrine of jungle combat.\u201d The drill aims to prepare soldiers to respond to a foreign military force larger than Brazil\u2019s armed forces, officials said. While Brazil has long been at peace with its smaller neighbors in the Amazon and no country was specified by name in the preparations for the exercise, some military strategists in Brazil have long focused on the United States as a potential threat. Brazil expanded its military presence in the Amazon during the dictatorship that held power from 1964 to 1985, when generals offered incentives to settlers to occupy the frontier. While some political analysts contend that potential invasions belong in the realm of conspiracy theories, others delve into history to show that foreign designs on the Amazon are not so far-fetched. Brazil\u2019s army also drew inspiration from history in naming its latest military exercise, which involves 550 troops here in Manaus, the Amazon\u2019s largest city, and outposts like Santa Isabela do Rio Negro and Caracara\u00ed. Machifaro is a region of the Amazon where in the 16th century resistance coalesced against Spain\u2019s attempts to gain control of large portions of the rain forest held then by the Portuguese empire.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Timepieces That Connect With a History of Exploration", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 A rowboat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean is not the most festive place to celebrate a 30th birthday, but Alex Bellini made the most of it. \u201cI enjoyed a full panettone by myself,\u201d he said, recalling the sweet bread from his native Italy that helped distinguish Sept. 15, 2008, from the 293 other days he spent alone at sea.Mr. Bellini, a professional adventurer and motivational speaker, had to abandon his solo rowing journey from Lima, Peru, to Sydney, Australia, just 60 miles from his destination because of hazardous weather, but not before he learned a few lessons about time.\u201cIf you ever happen to row an ocean, you will soon discover there\u2019s no difference between days, no difference between seasons, between winter or spring \u2014 there is nothing but yourself, so you have to measure time by what you have within yourself,\u201d Mr. Bellini said during a recent Skype interview from his home in Britain. \u201cBut keeping track of your time is very important because it gives you the magnitude of your adventure \u2014 because the longer you stay alone, the closer you get to yourself,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes the adventure extreme \u2014 not exploring remote areas. It\u2019s just a way to face yourself, to accept your strengths, your weaknesses.\u201dCome fall 2015, Mr. Bellini will once again put his strengths and weaknesses to the test when he embarks on a mission to spend a year alone on a melting iceberg off northwest Greenland. Dubbed Adrift, the project aims to draw attention to macro issues like global warming and climate change, as well as individual challenges, such as how a person copes with being confined to a gradually diminishing environment.Like his hero, Sir Ernest Shackleton, the polar explorer who in 1909 ventured further south in Antarctica than anyone had ever been, Mr. Bellini will keep time using a mechanical watch by Waltham. The company, founded in 1850 in Roxbury, Mass., was a favorite of adventurers of the early 20th century, including the North Pole pioneer Robert Peary and the aviator Charles Lindbergh. Like most American watchmakers, the company saw its business decline in the post-World War II economy. In 1981, a Japanese company purchased the brand. Soon after, its watches fell from favor. Earlier this year, Waltham\u2019s new owner, Antonio DiBenedetto, reintroduced the brand to the American and European markets as a Swiss-made timepiece for men who aspire to the same ideals that drove Shackleton and Peary to the ends of the earth \u2014 chief among them, nonconformity.When Mr. DiBenedetto learned about Adrift, he said, he realized that partnering with Mr. Bellini would be an authentic way to tie the brand\u2019s history to an unconventional modern-day adventure. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful occasion for Waltham to return to the ice,\u201d he said.Throughout history, timepieces ranked with compasses and sextants as critical tools for explorers seeking to define the contours of the earth. But in an era of digital maps, satellite-powered phones and GPS-enabled devices \u2014 all of which have reduced the difficulties of exploration \u2014 a mechanical timepiece, not to mention the exploring effort behind it, may seem irrelevant. That\u2019s what makes the clutch of contemporary watch brands that have partnered with latter-day adventurers an intriguing coda to the age of exploration.\u201cWatches were vital equipment to guys like Hillary climbing Everest,\u201d said Jason Heaton, a Minneapolis-based travel writer who reviews watches for sites such as Gear Patrol and Hodinkee. \u201cThey had to be mechanical, waterproof, reliable and self-winding. Nowadays, a watch is a talisman or memento. It connects the wearer to a whole history of adventurers.\u201dTo the polar explorer Ben Saunders and his teammate, Tarka L\u2019Herpiniere, the connection to history couldn\u2019t be more literal. In February, the British pair completed a four-month journey that retraced the exact route that Capt. Robert Falcon Scott and his companions made in 1911-12 on their ill-fated Terra Nova expedition, which aimed to be the first to reach the South Pole. A Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen beat Scott to the pole. Scott and his crew perished on the return journey.\u201cThere is perhaps a misconception that it\u2019s all been done nowadays,\u201d said Mr. Saunders. \u201cPeople will say, \u2018My granny\u2019s going on a cruise to Antarctica.\u2019 But I\u2019m trying to explain that the journey Scott died trying to achieve still hadn\u2019t been finished.\u201dWhen Mr. Saunders and Mr. L\u2019Herpiniere set off on their 1,800-mile Scott Expedition, they pulled about 440 pounds of food, fuel and other essentials. \u201cWe cut the handles off our toothbrushes, the labels off our clothes. Everything had to be super lightweight,\u201d Mr. Saunders said.That also was true for the timepieces they carried. The British watch brand Bremont created the limited-edition Terra Nova, an ultralight titanium wristwatch, to accompany Mr. Saunders and Mr. L\u2019Herpiniere. Another requirement was that its movement be mechanical. \u201cThe polar regions are so extreme \u2014 particularly the temperatures \u2014 that a lot of electronic gadgets can be unreliable, certainly things with LCD screens,\u201d Mr. Saunders said. \u201cOn very cold days, we had problems with GPS units. A mechanical timepiece is the ultimate when it comes to reliability.\u201dFor Bremont\u2019s part, having Mr. Saunders field-test the watch offered the brand an invaluable opportunity to see how its products hold up under extreme real-world conditions.\u201cWhen we started the brand back in 2002, we were testing the watch in the workshop till our faces turned blue,\u201d said the Bremont co-owner Nick English. \u201cWe used a new type of steel. How\u2019s it going to react in Antarctica, on top of Everest? You just don\u2019t know. So working with someone like Ben Saunders is immensely useful. How else would you get your watch in that situation?\u201dAt Kobold Expedition Tools, an American watch brand founded by Michael Kobold in 1998, the feedback he received on his signature timepiece, the Kobold Polar Surveyor Chronograph, preceded the expedition stage, thanks to a unique partnership with the esteemed British explorer Ranulph Fiennes \u2014 \u201cUncle Ran\u201d to Mr. Kobold \u2014 who co-designed the watch prior to its debut in 2002.\u201cIt\u2019s the world\u2019s first watch that has the functions of a polar explorer\u2019s watch: local time, second time, day/night indicator, stopwatch and date, and it\u2019s all mechanical,\u201d Mr. Kobold said.Having scaled Mount Everest with Mr. Fiennes in 2009, Mr. Kobold is intimately familiar with how timepieces function at the top of the world \u2014 and how precarious the effort to get there can be. He was so grateful to Namgel Sherpa and Thundu Sherpa, the guides who assisted him and his wife, the mountaineer Anita Kobold, on a return journey to Mount Everest in 2010 \u2014 an expedition that nearly cost Mrs. Kobold her life \u2014 that he opened a subsidiary in Katmandu to ensure that they would no longer need to do the dangerous work required of them as guides on Everest. Since 2012, they have assembled the brand\u2019s Himalaya, Soarway Transglobe and Himalayan Lynx timepieces.Unlikely as it sounds, they are not the only Sherpas to figure prominently in the annals of watchmaking. In 1953, Tenzing Norgay reached the summit of Everest with Sir Edmund Hillary, who famously carried an Oyster Perpetual timepiece by Rolex, the watchmaker most closely associated with adventurers.The iconic Swiss brand has accompanied exploration\u2019s bold-faced names from the peaks of the Himalayas to the depths of the Pacific Ocean. In 2012, for example, the filmmaker James Cameron affixed an experimental Rolex timepiece to the hull of his submersible and plunged 35,787 feet below the surface, where he took samples from the ocean floor and captured images of the never-before-seen species that live under the crushing pressures in the Mariana Trench.In August, Mr. Cameron screened the American premiere of National Geographic\u2019s \u201cDeepsea Challenge 3D,\u201d his documentary about the expedition, at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. To mark the occasion, Rolex released a new version of its Deepsea timepiece equipped with a \u201cD-blue\u201d dial bearing a dark blue to pitch black gradient designed to evoke the last rays of light disappearing into the oceanic abyss that greeted Mr. Cameron.For divers accustomed to more reasonable depths, there is Doxa. The brand\u2019s best-known timepiece, the Doxa Sub, was produced in 1967 and endorsed by the ocean explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau, whose company, U.S. Divers, imported the wristwatch into the United States as part of an effort to promote diving as a leisure sport.\u201cHours were never relevant for divers, so we dwarfed that hand to make the minute hand very legible,\u201d said Rick Marei, marketing manager for Doxa. The model also assumed its signature orange color \u201cbecause that was believed to be the most legible color underwater,\u201d Mr. Marei added.In June, Doxa resumed its partnership with the Cousteau family when it teamed up with Mr. Cousteau\u2019s grandson, Fabien Cousteau, on the Mission 31 expedition, in which he lived in an underwater marine laboratory off the coast of southern Florida for 31 days.\u201cBasically, we lived in a house at the bottom of the sea,\u201d Mr. Cousteau said. \u201cI brought down scientists, two engineers and a cameraman to help me document what was happening. We were able to do three years\u2019 worth of science in 31 days.\u201dAs the official watch of the mission, the Doxa Mission 31 SUB Professional helped Mr. Cousteau and his colleagues keep track of time in an environment that often lacked good lighting. Plus, said Mr. Cousteau, wearing a watch was force of habit.\u201cI\u2019ve always had a watch around my wrist,\u201d Mr. Cousteau said. \u201cIt\u2019s the comfort of knowing that, if all else fails, my watch is powered by my movement. Some people go the digital route, but I still love the nice heavy well-crafted jewelry that\u2019s also bulletproof.\u201dFor seasoned divers, the ubiquity of sophisticated dive computers does not eclipse the need for a traditional dive watch. But they acknowledge that sentimental value plays a big part in their choice of timepiece. \u201cI started with an old diving watch my mom gave me when I was 18,\u201d said Enric Sala, an explorer in residence at the National Geographic Society, whose Pristine Seas project \u2014 aimed at protecting marine reserves around the world \u2014 has been sponsored by the Swiss watch brand Blancpain since 2010. Today, a wristwatch may be superfluous, but Mr. Sala continues to wear his Blancpain Fifty Fathoms chronograph everywhere \u2014 even in the shower. \u201cIt takes me back to my childhood when I was dreaming about being an ocean explorer and a diver,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel part of that history, and it makes me feel connected to the ocean wherever I go.\u201dExplorers of the final frontier \u2014 outer space \u2014 are no less enamored of their timepieces. For Felix Baumgartner, the Austrian daredevil who parachuted from a helium balloon over the desert of New Mexico in 2012 and broke the sound barrier during his freefall, the Zenith El Primero Stratos Flyback Striking 10th was, he said, a key piece of equipment.\u201cIt was over my suit, with a special strap,\u201d Mr. Baumgartner said. \u201cI did not really have time to check it during the jump itself. However if all my instruments would accidentally shut down, I could always rely on my mechanical watch that would work in any condition.\u201dIn the event of a catastrophic instrument failure, it\u2019s doubtful that the retired astronaut Mark Kelly, who\u2019s worked with the Swiss brand Breitling since 2011, could have functioned in outer space with just his wristwatch, but he\u2019s devoted to it anyway. \u201cThe one I would certainly wear for a combat or space mission is the new Breitling Cockpit B50,\u201d Mr. Kelly wrote in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s very readable, has display backlighting that I can activate just by turning my wrist\u201d and a mission elapsed time feature \u201cthat is critical in spaceflight.\u201d\u201cOne feature I especially like is that the watch can be set to vibrate when the alarm is activated,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis can be really helpful in the loud environment of a spacecraft or fighter airplane.\u201dThere are, of course, other practical considerations when the explorer ventures beyond the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\u201cIn space, it becomes difficult to tell time based on your environment, so a watch becomes very handy,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cAnd when they are strapped to your wrist, they don\u2019t float away.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Asia Pushes Hard for Clean Energy", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Even as China\u2019s economy begins to cool, its hunger for energy is still climbing.So also is its capacity to generate power from multiple sources, ranging from coal and nuclear to wind, solar and hydroelectric.Those trends look similar across Asia, where soaring energy needs are outpacing the expansion of climate-friendly renewable power.Yet the use of fossil fuels like coal and oil is growing too, meaning Asia\u2019s emissions of climate-warming gases are also on an upward trend.\u201cIt is a story about growth,\u201d said Justin Wu, lead Asia analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Asia, he said, \u201cis going to add a lot more power of all kinds.\u201dChina is the region\u2019s energy behemoth, accounting for almost half of global coal use while also leading the world in its installation of solar, wind and other renewable technologies.Its political leaders take clean energy seriously, and they are driving a huge expansion, with China\u2019s wind turbines alone expected to produce nearly two and a half times the entire power generating capacity of Britain by 2020, said Xin Li, a fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.Last year, for the first time, the amount of newly completed zero-carbon-emission energy sources in China exceeded the new coal capacity that was built, said Michal Meidan, an associate fellow at Chatham House, an international affairs think tank in London.Mr. Wu, of Bloomberg New Energy, said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard people say a new coal plant gets built every week\u201d in China. \u201cThat\u2019s probably still true. But for every coal plant that\u2019s built, a lot more solar and wind are built as well, and a lot of old coal plants are probably shutting down, the less efficient ones.\u201dCoal accounted for 69 percent of China\u2019s energy use in 2010. That share is projected to fall to 55 percent in 2040, but it is still expected to be five times bigger than the total for renewable energy, Ms. Doman said. She noted, though, that the agency\u2019s projections do not include small-scale renewable sources unconnected to the grid, a category that is significant in some places.\u201cWe\u2019re still talking about 800 million tons of coal; that\u2019s a lot of coal capacity,\u201d said Ms. Meidan, of Chatham House. \u201cAll over the world, people have invested in mines, assuming that China will continue to consume coal.\u201dOil use is also increasing, by about 2.5 percent a year, Ms. Doman said.These and other factors are driving China\u2019s renewables push. But China\u2019s push for more renewable energy has not always been smooth.Politicians have sometimes responded to pollution worries by moving sooty coal-fired plants away from big cities rather than replacing them with cleaner energy. Poor planning and inadequate transmission lines, meanwhile, have left many large wind and solar farms without the connections necessary to send the energy they generate to the places where it is most needed.\u201cI am not really sure if these different plans are coordinated or consistent or even coherent,\u201d and a lot of power ends up unused, Mr. Li said.Officials are addressing the issue, and the amount of wasted power has begun to decline, Mr. Li said. But, \u201cI still haven\u2019t seen anything like the European countries are doing, making some projections of which area needs how much electricity and what sort of links can be built between regions,\u201d he said.In India, energy is high on the agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose government hopes to improve the country\u2019s patchy provision of electricity and expand access for the 300 million people who lack power. That is likely to cost $750 billion in the coming decade, Mr. Wu said. Coal provides the overwhelming majority of India\u2019s energy.Mr. Modi campaigned in part on his track record of overhauling the electricity sector in Gujarat State, and pushing a big expansion of solar power. He has begun opening coal mining to private firms, but experts say other plans remain unclear.One thing that is clear, though, is that inadequate infrastructure is a serious obstacle to any improvement in energy supply, said Vandana Hari, editorial director for Asia at Platts, the energy analysis firm.Problems \u201crange from poor port facilities to poor inland transportation, so even if coal ends up at a port, it takes a long time, goes through very inefficient systems to be transported all the way to where it is to be consumed,\u201d Ms. Hari said. The same is true for natural gas, she added. \u201cIndia could be consuming much more gas, but it simply doesn\u2019t have a good network of gas pipelines.\u201dJapan, meanwhile, is struggling with different problems. Before the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, it relied on nuclear for a quarter of its electricity. But safety worries have closed all its atomic plants, and as a result, Japan has ramped up its use of coal and natural gas. Even if old nuclear plants are reopened, \u201cthey\u2019re never going to go back to the level of nuclear they had before,\u201d Mr. Wu said.In Southeast Asia, energy demand is increasing, but the construction of renewable sources is slower than in China.Outside China, India, Japan and South Korea, renewable power capacity in Asia is expanding about 5 percent a year, Ms. Doman said. But it starts from such a low base that by 2040, clean sources will provide only about 3 percent of the region\u2019s electricity, she said.And across Asia, for all the investment in renewable resources, carbon emissions are sure to keep on rising, driven by population growth and an expanding middle class. For both China and India, according to projections by the United States Energy Information Administration, annual emissions are expected to reach twice their 2009 levels by 2040.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Election Was Rough for Democrats. It Was Worse for West Virginia Democrats.", "Date": "2014-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState in TransitionElection night was bad for Democrats all over the country, but arguably there were few states where it was worse for their future \u2014 and better for Republicans \u2014 than in West Virginia.Like Arkansas in 2010, West Virginia seems to have turned a corner from being a Democratic-dominated state to a Republican one. The switch started years ago, when Republican presidential candidates were able to win the state by appealing to its socially conservative voters, regardless of their party affiliation. But in state politics, Republicans struggled to win key offices, or even to field candidates. As recently as 2008, two statewide posts held by Democrats, auditor and treasurer, were uncontested in the general election.Republicans deserve much of the credit for the current situation: They had a strong, popular candidate for this year\u2019s Senate race, Shelley Moore Capito, who represents the state in the House of Representatives and is the daughter of a former governor. Evan Jenkins, the candidate they fielded against Nick Rahall II, the longtime Democratic congressman from the southern portion of the state, was a former Democrat who represented part of the area in the state Senate.In addition, Republicans capitalized on an electorate resentful of President Obama\u2019s environmental policies, which have received little support in a state where coal mining has long played a big part in the economy and in politics. Even with an open race for the presidency in two years, it\u2019s doubtful that any Democratic hopeful could sway a large number of voters in state contests.In her 2012 election, she got nearly as many votes, 398,463, as Joe Manchin, a popular Democratic senator and former governor, who got 399,908 on his way to victory. But on Nov. 4, Ms. Tennant got 155,396 votes in her losing Senate race. That vote total is the lowest for a Democrat running statewide in recent West Virginia history, although most statewide elections have occurred in presidential years.That Ms. Tennant would not come close to her 2012 vote total was no surprise. Without a presidential election at the top of the ballot, turnout would be lower, and Ms. Capito was a seasoned and well-funded opponent. But she fell 127,962 votes shy of Mr. Manchin\u2019s 2010 vote total, while Ms. Capito nearly equaled Mr. Manchin\u2019s total. In Kanawha County, home to the state capital, Charleston, and partly represented by Ms. Capito, Ms. Tennant received 12,195 fewer votes, or 37 percent less, than Mr. Manchin did four years ago. In Mingo County, where registered Democrats account for 80 percent of voters, she got fewer than half the votes Mr. Manchin did in 2010.The decline in Democratic loyalty also spelled trouble for Mr. Rahall, who had represented a congressional district in Southern West Virginia since 1976. He routinely faced token opposition during his career, but saw his margin of victory go from 33 percentage points in 2008 to eight in 2012.His Republican opponent this year, Mr. Jenkins, did much better than Mr. Rahall\u2019s previous challengers. In eight of the district\u2019s 18 counties, Mr. Jenkins came within 10 percentage points of the vote share earned by Mr. Rahall\u2019s 2012 opponent, Rick Snuffer, during a presidential year. In two counties, Webster and Mingo, Mr. Jenkins exceeded Mr. Snuffer\u2019s 2012 vote total, on the way to a 10-point win. This suggests not only that Republicans have become adept at winning votes for offices below the presidential level, but also that they are building a more reliable electorate.Ms. Tennant could run for re-election, for a congressional seat or perhaps one of the other statewide offices once her current term as Secretary of State ends in 2016, too, but as Republicans occupy more elected positions they will produce better candidates to run against.There is one factor that may help Democrats stave off defeat in statewide elections in the near term: All of West Virginia\u2019s statewide officers are elected on a schedule that coincides with presidential elections, and so Democrats are able to benefit from higher turnout than in off-years. But now that Republicans have shown that they can win in individual districts around the state and statewide, it is difficult to see an immediate route to victory for Democrats at the congressional level, and unless the candidate\u2019s name is Manchin, their hold on the governor\u2019s seat may be tenuous as well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexican Leader, Facing Protests, Promises to Overhaul Policing", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto delivered a 30-minute, wide-ranging televised address meant to pull himself out of the lowest point of his two-year tenure and respond to mass demonstrations expressing frustration with the political class and demanding action.The more than 1,800 municipal police forces would effectively be disbanded and come under the control of state governments, and the federal government would have the power to dissolve municipal governments found to be corrupt. The public would have more opportunity to review government contracts. A national 911 system would be installed, and jurisdiction confusion among the nation\u2019s police, which often hampers investigations, would be clarified.The president also proposed measures to address poverty and the economic disparity between the northern and southern parts of the country, though even affluent states have had serious organized crime problems.Some of his proposals never made it out of Congress under predecessors, including putting local police under state authority. Yet he has had success pushing through other broad changes designed to improve the economy, and as much as anything he aimed to restore the public\u2019s flagging faith in his governance.\u201cThese acts of violence demand that we redouble efforts to achieve the full application of rule of law,\u201d he said.The case has pushed Mexico\u2019s chronic problems with organized crime, impunity and lawlessness back to the forefront and forced Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who had tried to prioritize the economy, to act.But Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto faces a doubting, and in some cases hostile, public accustomed to grandiose speeches and lofty promises from leaders.\u201cThe real question is whether the Mexican people, who have been promised investigations, overhauls, special commissions, anti-corruption campaigns and institutional reorganizations by this president \u2014 and nearly every other authority since the Mexican Revolution \u2014 will believe these latest promises,\u201d said Eric L. Olson, who studies Latin America security at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.Analysts said many of the proposals, if not new ideas, were needed, but questioned whether Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto had the credibility to pull them off because of scandals under his watch.The government rescinded a $3.7 billion bid to a Chinese-led consortium to build a high-speed rail line after critics accused the administration of favoring it because the parent firm of a company in the deal won several contracts from Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto when he was a state governor. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, whose aides have insisted that there was no conflict of interest in either case, mentioned the need to address corruption several times but never referred to the deals.\u201cYou can\u2019t announce credible strategies to deal with corruption without facing his own scandal of his wife\u2019s white house, whether the conflict of interest is real or not,\u201d said Fernando Dworak, a political analyst and columnist. \u201cHe needs to give the message, it starts with himself.\u201dThe proposals would initially focus on four troubled states: Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoac\u00e1n and Tamaulipas. The announcement comes a few days before another round of demonstrations are planned on Monday, when Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto will formally submit his proposals to Congress.Some analysts saw reining in municipal police as a crucial step but questioned whether state forces were any more up to the task, given their own histories of corruption and drug ties.\u201cState police are not much better than municipal ones,\u201d said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst and former Mexican intelligence official.The security problems show little sign of letting up.On Thursday, the decapitated bodies of 11 young people were found in Guerrero State, the same state where the students went to school and disappeared. The governor also said reports of a mass abduction before the one in Iguala would also be investigated.Paulina Villegas contributed reporting from Mexico City.\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "UKIP Wins 2nd Seat in the British Parliament, Dealing a Blow to David Cameron", "Date": "2014-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The populist U.K. Independence Party won its second seat in the British Parliament early Friday with a striking victory that threatened to destabilize the Conservative Party of Prime Minister David Cameron.The right-wing party, known as UKIP, won a parliamentary by-election in Rochester and Strood in southern England, in a contest prompted by the defection of a lawmaker, Mark Reckless, from the Conservatives.Early\u00a0Friday\u00a0Mr. Reckless, who contested the seat under the colors of his new party, was declared the winner, with 16,867 votes, ahead of the Conservative Party candidate, Kelly Tolhurst, who had 13,947 votes.The by-election victory had been widely expected and was not by as emphatic a margin as some had predicted.\u00a0Nevertheless, it delivered a blow to the governing Conservatives in a constituency they would normally expect to hold.Mr. Cameron, who had promised to throw everything at the contest, campaigned himself several times in Rochester and Strood and ordered ministerial colleagues to do so, too. The victory suggests that UKIP has the staying power to damage mainstream parties, particularly the Conservatives, in the general election, scheduled for next May.The by-election result could also encourage more defections from the Tories, potentially undermining Mr. Cameron just as the British economy is recovering.\u00a0On Wednesday,\u00a0Mr. Reckless claimed that he had held talks with two other Conservative lawmakers who were considering switching to UKIP.\u00a0Matthew Goodwin, professor of politics at the University of Nottingham, described a UKIP triumph as \u201cvery significant because it is six months out from a general election and in a pretty middle-of-the-road constituency.\u201d\u201cTwelve months ago, the consensus was that they couldn\u2019t win a seat at Westminster. Now they have two. People have not understood the strength of the forces driving this insurgency, built up over decades among certain groups of voters who feel they have been cut adrift,\u201d he added.The Conservatives appear most at risk from the populist party, whose success could cost Mr. Cameron crucial seats in May, but the opposition Labour Party is losing some support to UKIP, too.Labour finished third in the by-election and had a miserable night after one senior Labour lawmaker, Emily Thornberry, was accused of snobbery when she posted on Twitter a picture of a house in the Rochester and Strood constituency with three English flags of St. George and a large white van. Critics seized on the episode as evidence that Labour was losing touch with its traditional working-class supporters, and Ms Thornberry resigned late\u00a0Thursday\u00a0from her position as Labour spokeswoman on legal issues.Geoff Juby of the Liberal Democrats, who govern in coalition with the Conservatives,\u00a0won just 349 votes, finishing fifth, and lost\u00a0the cash deposit forfeited by candidates who fail to win 5 percent of the vote.In response to the rise of UKIP, Mr. Cameron has already toughened his position on immigration and the European Union, the two main issues on which UKIP campaigns.Last year, Mr. Cameron promised that, if re-elected next year, he would hold a referendum in 2017 on whether Britain should stay in the European Union.But last month another former Conservative lawmaker, Douglas Carswell, became UKIP\u2019s first elected member of Parliament after he, too, quit the Conservatives to join the populists following their striking gains in local and European elections.Mr. Cameron now plans to announce new proposals to curb immigration into Britain from within the 28-nation bloc even though it guarantees free movement of people.The issue of immigration dominated the final days of the by-election campaign, and Mr. Reckless courted controversy by appearing to suggest that some Eastern European immigrants should be forced to leave Britain after a specified period.\u00a0Speaking after being elected Mr. Reckless told supporters, \u201cIf we can win here, we can win across the country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Gang That Always Liked Ike", "Date": "2014-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHistorySourceFor a window into a president\u2019s soul, look at his closest personal friends. Dwight D. Eisenhower liked to decompress with a circle of wealthy businessmen who sometimes called themselves \u201cthe Gang.\u201d Among these friends were William E. Robinson, a New York Herald Tribune executive and later president of Coca-Cola; Ellis D. Slater, president of Frankfort Distillers; Clifford Roberts, an investment banker and Augusta National Golf Club chairman; W. Alton Jones, head of the Cities Service oil company (now Citgo); and George E. Allen, a lawyer-financier-lobbyist. The Gang was ready to travel on short notice \u2014 often commandeering a corporate plane \u2014 to the president\u2019s side at the White House; at Camp David; at his home adjoining the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pa.; or at his cottage at Augusta National in Georgia. The Gang played bridge, golfed and shot skeet together, ate steaks barbecued by the president, offered advice on politics and the economy and chuckled at his private aphorisms. (He maintained, for example, that the \u201ctwo professions in which amateurs excel\u201d are \u201cprostitution and the military.\u201d)Early on, Slater \u2014 known as Slats \u2014 asked Eisenhower how he would handle the presidency financially. Eisenhower replied, \u201cHell, this job is no easy touch.\u201d\u00a0Referring to his predecessor, he added, \u201cTruman says I\u2019ll be lucky if I don\u2019t use $25,000 a year of my own money.\u201d In recognition of this, some members of the Gang and other friends gave him gifts, such as cattle for his Gettysburg farm. They also helped finance his Augusta golf cottage \u2014 called \u201cMamie\u2019s Cabin,\u201d in the first lady\u2019s honor.Eisenhower later boasted that no one in his personal circle ever \u201cuttered a word that could have been embarrassing to me.\u201d Slater, for one, dodged the public eye to spare Ike political trouble from those who might recoil at seeing their president palling around with a liquor baron.Some looked askance at Eisenhower\u2019s choice of companions. In 1959, Senator John F. Kennedy acidly told the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. that he would have expected Eisenhower, the World War II hero, to be playing golf with his old Army friends, but carped that \u201call his golfing pals are rich men he has met since 1945.\u201dEisenhower did keep up with his Army comrades, but after V-E Day he was susceptible to the allure of the financial power elite.\u00a0Having grown up on what was considered the wrong side of the tracks in Abilene, Kan., he clearly enjoyed being around such moguls. But, like him, most of his new friends had not been born into rich families.\u00a0In fact, after meeting an heir of a family famous for its wealth, Eisenhower said he would hate to have to go through life with a name like his.In February 1952, Eisenhower\u2019s cronies helped organize a wildly successful midnight rally at Madison Square Garden, which nudged him toward the presidency.\u00a0Serving in Paris at the time as supreme commander of NATO, he viewed a film of the two-hour spectacle, then told a friend, with tears in his eyes, \u201cYou can go tell Bill Robinson that I\u2019m going to run.\u201dOnce in the White House, Eisenhower leaned on his business pals to help him remedy the gaps in a lifelong soldier\u2019s understanding of economics, saying, \u201cI must learn the value of a dollar.\u201d\u00a0But by no means did the president uncritically accept their exhortations.\u00a0During an Oval Office visit in 1959, one chum complained about high taxes and scrawled out his previous year\u2019s income: $913,000 (more than $7 million in today\u2019s dollars). \u201cStop right there,\u201d said Eisenhower, who went on to chide \u201canyone feeling sorry for himself who makes that kind of money.\u201dThe president\u2019s business chums dominated the guest lists for the small, all-male \u201cinformal stag dinners\u201d he staged.\u00a0Some of the diners hailed from the white Deep South.\u00a0Eisenhower supported racial integration \u201cas a matter of decency,\u201d but, drawing in part on his Army experience in the South, privately expressed doubts that such a goal could be achieved quickly, even with government action.\u00a0Warren said in his memoirs, published after his death in 1974, that during the meal Eisenhower \u201cwent to considerable lengths to tell me what a great man Mr. Davis was.\u201d The president, Warren wrote, assured him that white Southerners\u00a0were \u201cnot bad people,\u201d but simply wanted to make sure that \u201ctheir sweet girls\u201d did not sit in classes alongside \u201csome big overgrown Negroes.\u201d (While writing his book, Warren may have been feeling especially bitter toward Eisenhower, who had been quoted as saying that Warren\u2019s appointment was one of his biggest mistakes as president.)Eisenhower might have developed a wider understanding of the human experience had his inner circle been more diverse. But, as with most presidents, he needed to have friends with whom he could let down at least some of his guard. In a rare confession of his own fallibility, he thanked Slater during the 1959 Christmas season for being one of those friends \u201cwho know well my faults\u201d and were \u201cso understanding and so generous as to forgive\u201d the \u201cmany errors I have made.\u201d MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, a presidential historian, is the author of nine books and a contributor to The Upshot.

{"Headline": "For Israel, Two-State Is No Solution", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorJERUSALEM \u2014 Recent events in the Middle East are a reminder of how the old models of peace between Israel and the Palestinians are no longer relevant. The time has come to rethink the two-state solution.This past summer, Hamas and its allies fired over 4,500 rockets and mortars at Israel, demonstrating once again what happens when we evacuate territory to the so-called 1967 lines and hand it over to our adversaries. Peace is not obtained. Rather, we are met by war and bloodshed.The rise of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, and other extreme elements in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, make the risks just as clear. Israel cannot afford to gamble with its security. There are no second chances in the volatile Middle East.That is why, for its security, Israel cannot withdraw from more territory and cannot allow for the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank. If we were to pull out of the West Bank, the entire country would become a target for terrorists who would be able to set up rocket launchers adjacent to the Old City of Jerusalem and on the hills above the runways of Ben-Gurion International Airport and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.Take the Jordan Valley. The Palestinians demand that Israel withdraw from this narrow piece of land, which borders Jordan. But if we do so in today\u2019s climate, we potentially open the door for the Islamic State and other extremists to flood into the new Palestinian state. We cannot take that risk.How do I know? Because it happened. Not once, not twice, but three times.In the mid-1990s, we pulled out of Palestinian cities as part of the Oslo agreement. In 2000, the second intifada erupted and over 1,000 Israelis were killed in attacks carried out by terrorists, many of whom came from the very cities we had evacuated.When we pulled out of Lebanon in 2000, we saw a significant strengthening of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia. During the second Lebanon war six years later, Hezbollah fired more than 4,300 rockets at our cities.And in 2005, we withdrew from the Gaza Strip and handed it over to the Palestinian Authority. We were told that Gaza would turn into the Singapore of the Middle East and that peace would grow out of the greenhouses the Jewish residents had left behind.Instead, those greenhouses were used to cover up terrorists\u2019 tunnels dug across the border into Israeli towns and villages. Gaza quickly turned into a fortress of terror.But this does not mean all hope is lost. There is still much we can do to improve ties with our Arab neighbors, to generate peace and to cultivate economic prosperity for all people who live in this land.The secret is bottom-up peace. After more than two decades of working on a single solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \u2014 the establishment of a Palestinian state \u2014 it is time to realize that coexistence and peaceful relations will not be obtained through artificial processes imposed on us from above. Instead, I propose a four-step plan.First, we would work to upgrade the Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank, in the areas largely under Palestinian control (known as Areas A and B, according to the Oslo Accords). Ideally, this will be done in coordination with the Palestinian Authority.The Palestinians will have political independence, hold their own elections, select their own leadership, run their own schools, maintain their own social services and issue their own building permits. They should govern themselves and run their day-to-day lives. Israel should not interfere. Much of this already exists, but we can do better.This Palestinian entity will be short of a state. It will not control its own borders and will not be allowed to have a military.Gaza already functions like a state, but the Hamas government in control there is bent on Israel\u2019s destruction. As long as Gaza remains on this path, it cannot be a party to any agreement.The second step will see the massive upgrade of roads and infrastructure, as well as the removal of roadblocks and checkpoints throughout the West Bank. The objective will be to ensure freedom of movement for all residents \u2014 Palestinian and Israeli \u2014 and to improve their quality of life.No peace, though, can last without economic viability. So the third step will be to build economic bridges of peace between Israelis and Palestinians.In my former career as a high-tech entrepreneur, I saw how diverse people from different backgrounds could learn to work together in pursuit of economic prosperity. Already, there are 15 industrial zones in the West Bank where Israelis work alongside about 15,000 Palestinians. These zones pump about $300 million a year into the Palestinian economy. Imagine what another 15 industrial zones could do.Lastly, I propose applying Israeli law in Area C, which is the part of the West Bank controlled by Israel under the Oslo agreement. The Palestinians who live there would be offered full Israeli citizenship. We can start with the known settlement blocs that everyone agrees will remain part of Israel even under a final status agreement. By applying Israeli law and asserting national sovereignty in those blocs, while upgrading Palestinian autonomy in Areas A and B, we will reduce the scope of territory in dispute, making it easier to reach a long-term agreement in the future.I am aware that the world will not immediately accept this proposal. It seems to go against everything Israel, the Palestinians and the international community have worked toward over the last 20 years. But I will work to make this plan government policy because there is a new reality in the Middle East, which has brought an end to the viability of the Oslo peace process.The regional upheaval and disintegration of nation states oblige us to act responsibly. We must work toward realistic goals that are capable of providing real security and economic prosperity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mark Udall of Colorado Loses Senate Seat to Cory Gardner, a Republican", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byColoradoDENVER \u2014 Colorado voters elected Representative Cory Gardner, the Republican challenger, as their new senator on Tuesday, rejecting the incumbent Mark Udall as a Democrat too closely tied to President Obama and as a candidate who ran a one-note campaign focused on the politics of abortion.Mr. Udall\u2019s campaign echoed what Republicans called a \u201cwar on women\u201d strategy, casting Mr. Gardner as a rigid opponent of abortion who supported legal rights for embryos and whose positions could outlaw some forms of birth control.Mr. Gardner\u2019s camp did everything possible to weld Mr. Udall and Mr. Obama together in voters\u2019 minds, focusing in particular on Mr. Udall\u2019s support for a health care overhaul. Ad after ad by Republicans and outside conservative groups declared that Mr. Udall voted with the president 99 percent of the time.\u201cThis guy just follows in lock step with the president,\u201d said Dustin Zvonek, of the Colorado chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a group funded by the conservative Koch brothers. \u201cColoradans, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat. They want someone who\u2019s independent, who\u2019s there for them. It\u2019s really a Western thing.\u201dFew Republicans doubted Mr. Gardner\u2019s conservative credentials, which allowed him to quickly pivot to the center to court the unaffiliated voters who make up a third of Colorado\u2019s electorate. He announced his support for providing birth control pills without a prescription and promised that he would stand up to fellow Republicans when he disagreed with them.Democrats scoffed at the claims as hollow, election-year feints toward bipartisanship. But in the end, it was the Republican from the eastern farming town of Yuma, not the fence-post-slender Democrat who climbs mountains, that Colorado believed would provide a new, more independent voice.Early Wednesday morning, Gov. John W. Hickenlooper edged slightly ahead of his Republican challenger, Bob Beauprez, as the last several thousand votes from Democratic-friendly bastions like Denver and Boulder were counted. But the two men remained separated by less than a percentage point, and it was uncertain whether any winner could be declared or whether the race would head toward an automatic recount.The governor\u2019s race has focused more on the state\u2019s economy. A drilling boom, construction downtown and new waves of mountain-loving migrants have helped lower unemployment in Colorado to 4.7 percent.The race also hinged on whether Democratic-supported laws expanding background checks for firearms, limiting the size of ammunition magazines and expanding renewable-energy standards were turning away from Colorado\u2019s older values, or simply extending them into a new era.At times, both parties treated the election as a battle for the soul of a Western bellwether.Urban growth and the rapidly swelling number of Hispanic residents have helped hand control of the governor\u2019s mansion and state legislature to Democrats in recent years, and many liberals had hoped that victories this year could help give Colorado new stature as a reliably Democratic foothold in the Mountain West. After years of defeats in statewide races and self-inflicted wounds, Republicans here were desperate for a win demonstrating that \u2014 despite the state\u2019s embrace of legal marijuana, civil unions for same-sex couples and new gun restrictions \u2014 Colorado was still a moderate place that would punish politicians who lurched too far leftward.Conservatives, in particular, cast the races for senator and governor as battles between the rural values of ranchers and farmers and the urban leanings of a growing number of constituents living in the suburbs. At a campaign stop earlier this summer, Mr. Beauprez told a group of civic officials from the northeastern corner of the state, \u201cRural Colorado, I think, probably determines the outcome of this election.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turmoil Over Immigration Status? California Has Lived It for Decades", "Date": "2014-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 There may be no better place than California to measure the contradictions, crosswinds and confusion that come with trying to change immigration law.For 30 years, California has been the epicenter of the churn of immigration \u2014 legal and not \u2014 in the nation. It was California where Pete Wilson, the Republican governor, championed in 1994 a voter initiative known as Proposition 187, which severely restricted services to immigrants here illegally. And it was California where just last year, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, held a celebratory, dignitary-filled signing of legislation permitting unauthorized workers to obtain driver\u2019s licenses.One-third of the undocumented workers in the country live in California, which has a 125-mile border with Mexico, much of it guarded by long stretches of border fence. They work on farms in the Central Valley, in manufacturing jobs in Los Angeles, and as housekeepers and gardeners in Silicon Valley, alongside a steady stream of young legal immigrants who hold high-skilled jobs in Northern California\u2019s critical tech industry.They come mostly from Mexico but also from Central America, the Philippines, South Korea and Japan. Commercial boulevards in the heart of Los Angeles are a riot of Korean-language signs, and in many neighborhoods in San Francisco the talk on the street is as likely to be in Spanish or Chinese as it is English.And while many undocumented immigrants take pains not to draw attention to their status, California nonetheless offers the prospect of a more open existence than much of the country does, albeit in an ask-no-questions fashion. Given the way many of these immigrants are already treated by the state, be it with the issuing of driver\u2019s licenses or some health insurance, President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration was almost anticlimactic to many people here.\u201cWe are the state that has the most settled immigrant population in terms of people who have been in the country for 10 years,\u201d said Manuel Pastor, a co-director of the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration at the University of Southern California. \u201cWe went through our Prop. 187 moment. We are at the other end. People will be eager to make this happen, because they realize we are going to get comprehensive immigration reform at some point.\u201dIndeed, more than half the undocumented immigrants in California have lived here at least 10 years \u2014 far more than anyplace else in the country \u2014 and one-sixth of the children in California have at least one parent here illegally, according to Mr. Pastor\u2019s center. That was illuminated by Mr. Obama\u2019s expansion of the deportation protection program, since it was based largely on how long immigrants have resided here and whether they have American-born children.\u201cMy parents are going to be able to qualify under this program,\u201d said Paola Fernandez, 28, a representative of the Service Employees International Union who lives in Bakersfield. She was brought here as a child and got permission to stay under Mr. Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. She has two younger siblings who were born here, which bodes well for her parents.\u201cWe\u2019ve been here close to 25 years,\u201d Ms. Fernandez said. \u201cOn a very personal level, this is a very amazing moment.\u201dAt the same time, the extent of the illegal immigrant population here spotlighted limitations in what the president had to offer last week. Most notably, farmworkers in the Central Valley found themselves divided between those whose children were born in the United States or who are permanent legal residents \u2014 and thus eligible for the blanket of Mr. Obama\u2019s action \u2014 and those who had children in their home country or not at all.\u201cI\u2019m scared that my family will be torn apart,\u201d said Maria Ramos, 21, who moved here from Zacatecas, Mexico, in 1994 and was granted a deferral in 2012 while her parents remained here illegally. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to think my mom could get deported. They\u2019re going to tear our family apart. I wouldn\u2019t want that for other people to experience.\u201dThere are few states where immigrants are as integral to the economy, whether in farming, manufacturing or basic services. And many analysts suggested that those different forces were reflected in the White House\u2019s attempt to parse the differing demands of, in particular, Silicon Valley, with its thirst for high-end technology workers, and the Central Valley, with its overwhelming demand for inexpensive labor to work on the farms.In Silicon Valley, Mr. Obama offered a limited promise to open the doors to high-skilled legal immigrants brought here by technology companies, while making it slightly easier for those already here and eager to switch jobs without putting their immigration status in jeopardy.Sujoy Gupta, an Indian immigrant who came to the United States in 2003 to study and now works at a start-up called AppDirect in San Francisco, said the current visa rules made it difficult for him and his wife, Pooja Madaan, who works in marketing, to change employers, travel or buy a home.\u201cSo every time I change my job, I have to reapply for my visa,\u201d he said in an interview in his San Francisco home on Friday. That is likely to change now.These changes were less than what Silicon Valley business leaders wanted but stood in contrast with agriculture, where the White House resisted requests to create a waiver for farmworkers. Half the agriculture workers in the Central Valley have immigrated here illegally.\u201cA major part of the work force that harvests the crops is undocumented, and it\u2019s time we just recognized that,\u201d said Greg Wegis, the president of the Kern County Farm Bureau.Esther Cervantes, 53, who came here illegally nearly 20 years ago and packs the grapes her husband picks, paid to have her children brought over in 2000; they all received deportation deferrals under Mr. Obama\u2019s earlier act and are thus assured a future here.\u201cI was expecting this to help me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for me, there\u2019s nothing. I don\u2019t have children who are citizens or residents.\u201dThere has been a thriving underground economy across the state involving undocumented immigrants: the child care workers for wealthy software developers in Silicon Valley, where 8 percent of the work force is unauthorized, or the gardeners for estates in Beverly Hills. Presumably, that will come more into the open and, with it, promises for more job stability, an increased ability to change jobs and less fear of harassment by employers taking advantage of their vulnerability, said Reshma Shamasunder, the executive director of the California Immigrant Policy Center.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an important contribution to the California economy both in terms of raising revenues, but also the security of the work force,\u201d she said.While other states may resist Mr. Obama\u2019s initiative, California officials are already looking to expand existing programs to help immigrants here illegally. At La Raza Community Resource Center in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, which instructs immigrants on what kinds of documents they may need to apply for legal status, officials are preparing to help people take advantage of the new policy.\u201cOnce people know more about it, there will be a lot of interest,\u201d said Carl Larsen Santos, the center\u2019s immigration program coordinator. \u201cThe psychological impact of having a work permit and not living in fear will be a huge boon to the community.\u201dCalifornia has had some notable pockets of resistance to immigrants, most recently over the summer when protesters carrying signs and American flags met three buses of immigrant mothers and children in the city of Murrieta. But over all, this is a state that has embraced measures intended to make it easier for immigrants to live and work within its borders. A survey by the Pew Research Center last week found that of the 11.2 million illegal immigrants in the United States, 2.5 million live in California.\u201cCalifornia is more politically and emotionally evolved on this topic than the rest of the country,\u201d said Bill Whalen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and a former long-term aide to Mr. Wilson. \u201cWe have been through this for 20 years now. It\u2019s the California existence: You are familiar with illegal immigration, you probably tapped into it in some way \u2014 hiring someone illegally to look after your children or tend your lawn.\u201dMatt A. Barreto, a professor of political science at the University of Washington in Seattle, said that even before the president\u2019s action, California held itself forth as a model on immigration. \u201cAcross a variety of issues and policies, California has been a laboratory for the nation, forecasting and foreshadowing what might happen nationally,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about California\u2019s experience with the turmoil of immigration described incorrectly a group of immigrants living in the state. It is one-third of the undocumented workers in the country who live in California, not one-third of all illegal immigrants.A picture caption on Nov. 23 with the continuation of an article about California as the epicenter of immigration misspelled the given name of a Border Patrol agent on duty near San Diego. He is Jacopo Bruni, not Jacobo.Adam Nagourney reported from Los Angeles; Ian Lovett from Bakersfield, Calif.; and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Wreck the Iran Talks", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsWASHINGTON \u2014 Iran and the international community are approaching the finish line in negotiations to roll back Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program. Even at this late hour, however, American officials are far from unified on Iran policy, with members of Congress communicating deep concern that President Obama\u2019s negotiators will settle for an inadequate deal. Many members of Congress and others are therefore pushing for tough new sanctions that they believe could compel Iran\u2019s capitulation in the next several weeks.Such a move, however, would be self-defeating. Tougher United States sanctions at this juncture would nearly eliminate Iran\u2019s remaining commerce with Asia and Europe, exacting a significant financial toll on America\u2019s allies in those regions. That could destroy the international coalition that has so successfully isolated Iran, and erode the leverage it derives from presenting a unified front.It would also be unnecessary. The 25 percent decline in oil prices over the last four months, to about $82 a barrel, has already given Iran a stinging taste of how much worse off its economy could be if it fails to reach a deal. If negotiations were to fail definitively, the international community would be likely to condone sanctions that would squeeze Iran\u2019s oil revenues to nearly zero. And Iran, which requires oil prices of $140 per barrel to balance its budget, is already experiencing shortfalls in the billions.There is little doubt that sanctions helped bring Iran to the negotiating table. But it was the multilateral nature of those sanctions, rather than the severity of American sanctions alone, that delivered results. The United States first froze Iranian government assets after the seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979. Since 1987, the United States has made restrictions on trade increasingly comprehensive, in reaction to Iranian attacks on neutral shipping during the Iran-Iraq war, Iran\u2019s support for terrorism, its steps pointing to nuclear proliferation, and other unlawful acts. As a result of these prohibitions, American companies have been sidelined from business in Iran for decades.In 2006, concerns about Iranian nuclear activities prompted the United Nations Security Council to begin its own sanctions campaign, setting off a cascading series of penalties by member countries. And, in 2010, Congress adopted significantly more restrictive legislation that forced many foreign companies to stop doing business with Iran. The European Union, Japan, South Korea, Australia, the United Arab Emirates and others soon adopted complementary sanctions, closing down even more business.It is hard to overstate the significance of this multilateral effort. Iran\u2019s oil revenues have plummeted more than 40 percent over the past two years, as its major oil buyers in Europe and Asia have pulled back. Additionally, banking restrictions, in which the European Union and East Asian countries like Japan and South Korea joined, left Iran handcuffed when it tried to find trade financing or export markets abroad. Indeed, many of the most powerful sanctions on Iran came from outside the United States. Examples included the European Union\u2019s move to throw Iranian banks out of the Swift global financial payment messaging system, and Japan\u2019s restrictions on Iranian use of its capital markets and banking services.The new sanctions on Iran that Congress is considering would come down hard on the very allies that make the international coalition strong. They would penalize those allies for what little trade they still have with Iran, and risk fracturing the international alliance that has been indispensable in keeping pressure on Iran for concessions in nuclear diplomacy. Indeed, they could cause Iran to walk away from the negotiations, convinced that Congress will never tolerate a negotiated deal on its nuclear program.That could only reduce American leverage with Iran toward getting the result we need, which is to see Iran curb its nuclear program.We need a better policy \u2014 one that would prepare plans for further sanctions as options, but keep them in reserve until Iran rejects nuclear diplomacy or cheats on a deal. That alone would strengthen the international coalition and maximize leverage with Iran. Meanwhile, Congress would be better served by focusing on domestic energy policies that would help keep global petroleum prices low and oil revenues sparse in Tehran. Specifically, it should promote responsible shale oil production and lift the ban on exporting American oil to the global market.Punishing our allies now in a vain unilateral attempt to force Iran to capitulate is not smart policy. Causing major diplomatic crises and economic problems with the European Union, China, India and Turkey, which would all feel the pain of new sanctions, and whose presence we need among our greatest strategic partners in years to come, is unnecessary and will seriously undermine American interests.If a satisfactory deal proves unattainable, further sanctions may eventually become necessary. But at this moment, they would be premature and dangerously counterproductive. An undermining of our own national interests would be among their first consequences.Advertisement"}

Summers, the former United States Treasury secretary, has warned that Europe risks \u201csecular stagnation,\u201d a long-term, self-perpetuating slump similar to the one that followed the Great Depression in the 1930s.France\u2019s economy is stagnant, Italy\u2019s has fallen back into recession, and both countries are failing to cut their budget deficits and debt in line with European Union rules, causing tension with Brussels and Berlin.Herman Van Rompuy, the departing president of the European Council, cautioned last week that \u201cwithout jobs and growth, the European idea itself is in danger.\u201d Mr. Van Rompuy\u2019s successor, Donald Tusk, formerly the prime minister of Poland, will have the task of trying to forge an agreement on new economic initiatives.In August, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, set out the agenda for what might become a European New Deal in a speech to global central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo.Mr. Draghi called for a combination of national budget measures to bolster demand, greater public investment by the European Union and growth-friendly economic changes alongside the European Central Bank\u2019s monetary stimulus.On Friday, he highlighted the scale of the challenge, painting a gloomy outlook and promising to act \u201cas fast as possible\u201d to combat worryingly low inflation.Yet despite a show of unity this month, Mr. Draghi is struggling to overcome opposition led by Jens Weidmann, the president of the German central bank, to bolder stimulus measures such as having the European Central Bank buy government bonds, which the Federal Reserve did in the United States in a process known as quantitative easing.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has promised to push through an investment program that would focus on public works like transport, energy and digital telecommunications networks. But that program, with 300 billion euros, or about $370 billion, is expected to involve largely recycling existing European Union budgets and European Investment Bank funds with little if any new public money.The French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, said last week that an investment program based on \u201cfake money\u201d without at least \u20ac80 billion in new funds would be underwhelming. Germany, aiming to balance its budget, has rebuffed calls to stimulate domestic demand and made only a token gesture toward more investment in public infrastructure, promising a paltry extra \u20ac10 billion over three years.At the same time, France and Italy, the second- and third-largest economies in the eurozone, are balking at structural changes that would free up rigid labor markets and open their economies to more competition.Barring a last-minute surprise, European Union leaders are heading into the December meeting with a hollow agreement that once again will fail to reignite growth.\u201cThe architecture of the eurozone doesn\u2019t make it easy to provide the radical policy solutions that depression requires,\u201d said Nicholas Crafts, professor of economic history at the University of Warwick. \u201cI can\u2019t see supply side reforms delivering enough in the short term to help. That means the E.C.B., a fair weather central bank, is going to be tested in a storm.\u201dDomestic constraints, divergent economic philosophies and mutual mistrust make a disappointing summit meeting outcome likely.Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is convinced that growth based on borrowed money is not enough to pull Europe of its crisis. Ms. Merkel has also been critical of the slow pace of economic change in France and Italy. One hope may lie in a French-German study to be presented this week that will identify priorities for structural changes and public investment in both countries.Paris and Berlin may yet act on recommendations by the economists Jean Pisani-Ferry and Henrik Enderlein as the basis of a grand bargain in which France would agree to deeper economic changes if Germany agreed to step up investment.Otherwise, the weight of the European crisis will again fall on the shoulders of the European Central Bank.But \u201cno amount of fiscal or monetary accommodation,\u201d Mr. Draghi warned in his Jackson Hole speech, can make up for a lack of \u201cnecessary structural reforms in the euro area.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gazprom Makes a New Gas Deal With China", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEventually, the deal means Russia could ship more natural gas to China than to Germany, now its largest customer. The pipeline, in theory, could also be used to divert energy supplies, currently headed to Europe, to Asia.\u201cWe\u2019re putting ambitious goals before us, and are sure they will be fulfilled,\u201d Gazprom\u2019s chief executive, Aleksei B. Miller, said in a statement on Sunday announcing the deal, adding that the \u201cwide-ranging work with our Chinese colleague is developing very dynamically.\u201dIn a sign of the mounting problems, the Russian central bank, which has spent about $30 billion in a month defending the ruble, announced Monday it would allow the currency to float freely, rather than maintain trading bands with the euro and dollar. The bank had planned to eliminate the trading corridors by the end of the year but sped up the policy shift as the economy has weakened.The gas deal is the latest example of the Kremlin\u2019s deft use of pipeline politics. The design of Eurasian pipelines to strengthen Russia\u2019s geopolitical position, sometimes compared to a slow-motion chess match, has been a strong suit for President Vladimir V. Putin since he first took office more than a decade ago.Gazprom and the China National Petroleum Corporation signed a framework agreement to build the pipeline along a so-called western corridor, which would cross into China over the Altai Mountains, between Kazakhstan and Mongolia. The deal signed in May, soon after tensions with the West spiked over the Ukraine crisis, foresees exporting Russian gas from gas fields in eastern Siberia (not yet completely developed) to China, along a route called the Power of Siberia pipeline. Gazprom said it was worth $400 billion over the decades-long lifetime of the planned project.Energy analysts, though, have been skeptical the politically hued deal announcements this year will smoothly translate into a real natural gas market in eastern Eurasia.\u201cIt\u2019s still a very, very long process,\u201d said Fereidun Fesharaki, chairman of Facts Global Energy, a market research firm. The pipelines require a decade or more to build. \u201cThe best thing for the Russians is to supply Europe because the capital is already sunk,\u201d he said. \u201cEurope can\u2019t do without Russia and Russia can\u2019t do without Europe. If you want to do away with dependence on Russia you need a 20-year plan.\u201d For now, the Chinese deals are for Russia, \u201ca way of saying we have other options.\u201dMore broadly, testing the commercial prospects in China has been a slow and politically fraught exercise.Since the Ussuri River border skirmishes that marked the Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s, the Kremlin has perceived its long border with China as a security challenge as much as a commercial opportunity. The border was only fully demarcated in 2009. Despite the warm rhetoric, even simple infrastructure such as a planned new railroad bridge over the Amur River has been repeatedly delayed.Deals are picking up, though. In another agreement announced in Beijing, the China National Petroleum Corporation agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in the giant Vankor Siberian oil field, which is majority owned by Rosneft.The new pipelines will take years to build. If completed as planned, they would export 68 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year to China. Today, Germany is Russia\u2019s largest customer buying 40 billion cubic meters annually. Still, the European Union as a whole would remain Russia\u2019s largest customer, buying about twice as much as China would under the new deals.\u201cThis is just business as usual,\u201d Yan Vaslavski, an associate professor of political science at Moscow State Institute of International Relations, said in a telephone interview of the gas deals. Russia has no intention of diminishing gas shipments to Europe, integrally important for the Russian economy as they are. Instead, the China deals are insurance, he said: Should Europe squeeze Russian energy companies, they ensure revenue from west Siberian petroleum fields.\u201cRussia is not turning its back on Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if Russia doesn\u2019t turn to the East in time, this train will leave without Russia.\u201dStanley Reed contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Shift in Focus for Asian Art Sales", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 At the time, the price was so mind-bogglingly large that the auctioneer, in his excitement, broke his wooden gavel as he hammered down the lot. \u201cThe crackdown has got to have made a difference,\u201d said the Mayfair dealer John Berwald. \u201cA few years ago people were buying everything. Now we have a more discerning market with proper unsold lots at auction.\u201dMr. Berwald was one of 62 dealers and auction houses to collaborate on the 17th annual Asian Art in London, which ran from Oct. 30 through Saturday. Though this year\u2019s event coincided with the British Museum\u2019s exhibition \u201cMing: 50 Years That Changed China,\u201d and highly regarded dealers like Eskenazi and Marchant put on their own mini-blockbuster shows, there were not as many Asian buyers in town as in recent years. Dealers said this November\u2019s sales at Sotheby\u2019s, Bonhams and, above all, Christie\u2019s were short of star lots, reflecting a shift in the auction market to Hong Kong and the shortage of quality material in Britain and Europe.That said, the English regions continue to unearth desirable Chinese artworks. On Oct. 22 the Cheltenham auctioneers Mallams sold a Ming dynasty jade horse to a Hong Kong dealer on the telephone for about \u00a3205,000. The seller\u2019s late husband bought the piece in Hong Kong in 1962 for 900 Hong Kong dollars, about $115 today.Back in November 2010, Sotheby\u2019s, Bonhams and Christie\u2019s all sold individual lots priced at more than \u00a32 million each. Though historic Chinese pieces now rarely sell for seven figures at London auctions, the Asian visitors who attend these sales can still generate a tidy total.Sotheby\u2019s offering of 336 lots on Wednesday took in \u00a38.9 million with fees against a low estimate of \u00a35.4 million, based on hammer prices. Sixty-three percent of the entries were successful, including a top price of \u00a3782,500 \u2014 far above the \u00a3300,000 high estimate \u2014 paid by an Asian collector for a pair of Qianlong green-ground \u201cfamille rose\u201d vases fresh to the market from an Irish collection. The price typified the prevailing Chinese taste for polychrome 18th-century wares, or Qing bling, as some Westerners rudely call it.Christie\u2019s, by contrast, was only prepared to test the market with a two-day auction of Chinese pieces valued up to \u00a330,000 at its South Kensington salesroom on Tuesday and Friday. Its decision not to hold a sale in its St. James\u2019s headquarters during Asian Art in London angered participating dealers.\u201cI think they\u2019ve behaved very badly,\u201d said Giuseppe Eskenazi, who was showing 22 museum-quality Chinese sculptures from A.D. 500 to 1,500 in his Mayfair gallery. One of those was an imposing Northern Song or Jin period wooden statue of a seated Guanyin, the Buddhist goddess of Mercy, priced at $25 million. \u201cHong Kong has been built up to the detriment of London for years. Dealers and auction houses should have a symbiotic relationship, but Christie\u2019s aren\u2019t supporting the London market.\u201d A letter of complaint also went out from the British Antique Dealers\u2019 Association.Jonathan Stone, the chairman of Asian art at Christie\u2019s, had said in a statement that Christie\u2019s was \u201credefining\u201d its calendar of Chinese art sales in Europe, \u201cto meet the demands of a strong and sophisticated market, and to serve best our clients\u2019 changing needs.\u201d He said there would be just one main auction in London and one in Paris each year. As before, New York and Hong Kong would each stage two auctions a year.Mr. Eskenazi came up with a marketing initiative of his own by opening his Chinese sculpture exhibition on Oct. 15 to coincide with the Frieze Art Fair in Regent\u2019s Park, two weeks before Asian Art in London. The show was visited by several collectors of big-ticket contemporary art, including a New Yorker who bought a 1,000-year-old marble head of a monk priced at $380,000. A pair of Northern Song or Jin polychrome wood Bodhisattvas, marked at $3.5 million, was the most valuable of 16 sculptures that had been sold at the time of writing.The Kensington dealer Marchant\u2019s encyclopedic exhibition of 132 Chinese monochrome blanc-de-chine wares from the late Ming and early Qing dynasties made more than 40 sales within the first week of opening on Oct. 30. Two white porcelain figures of Guanyins by the late Ming master potter He Chaozong sold for about $200,000 each.More and more Chinese antiques are being sold at auctions in Hong Kong. With its outstanding museum collections and scholarly dealers, however, London continues to be a draw for anyone who is serious about Chinese art. The problem for Asian Art in London is that being serious about art, and being serious about making money out of art, can be two very different things.Advertisement"}

But her city-issued identification card \u2014 her badge of shame \u2014 makes it clear that she stands apart.In bold, black letters, the ID card describes her as a \u201cNon Employee,\u201d proof that she is not on a career track. She is a 48-year-old welfare recipient, working for her benefits and \u201cgoing nowhere,\u201d as she puts it.But these days, Ms. Schliefer-Tobias is hopeful that her ID card is destined for the trash bin. Across New York City, she and other workfare participants are abuzz about news from City Hall.Mayor Bill de Blasio is revamping the city\u2019s welfare program, vowing to dismantle what was once the largest workfare program in the nation and to embrace new strategies for moving thousands of people off the welfare rolls and into jobs.Workfare? Do you remember workfare? It is the program that ballooned during the administration of Rudolph W. Giuliani, with 36,224 people working in it or assigned to it by the year 2000.The program mostly dropped out of the headlines after Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, left office, but his work-first ethos still prevails: In April, 9,194 welfare recipients participated in or were assigned to workfare, and thousands more were required to engage in job-search programs that de Blasio administration officials have described as largely unsuccessful.Now, Mr. de Blasio says, it is time for change.Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, plans to prioritize education and training for able-bodied welfare recipients instead of automatically assigning them to workfare positions \u2014 cleaning parks and subway platforms and performing clerical duties \u2014 that have been described as dead ends by advocates for impoverished families.Over the next two years, city officials say, those workfare jobs will vanish completely and be replaced by transitional employment programs, internships and community service positions in growing sectors of the economy to ensure that more welfare recipients find paying jobs.Ask the liberals and conservatives who have sparred over this issue for decades and they retreat to their familiar corners. Absolutely, many welfare recipients and their advocates say. Absolutely not, say supporters of the work-first approach, which was also embraced by former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an independent.The truth is: It is far too early to say.He says that expanding access to education, without insisting on work first, and easing some administrative requirements necessary to get and keep welfare will send the wrong message.Some welfare recipients may decide to coast instead of finding work, Mr. Doar warned. That could lead to rising caseloads. No mayor \u2014 regardless of his political stripes \u2014 wants that.But de Blasio administration officials insist that theirs is no knee-jerk liberal proposal. They say they have absorbed the lessons of the past and will avoid its pitfalls.So, under Mr. de Blasio\u2019s plan, welfare recipients will be allowed to attend college full time for a year; after that, they will have to work part time.Recipients up to 24 years old will be allowed to study full time in high school or in programs for general equivalency diplomas. Those older than 24 will have to study part time as they search for work or participate in internships. Attendance and academic progress will be monitored.City officials plan to gradually redirect the $200 million they spend annually on employment-related services toward improved training, back-to-work programs and on better assessments that tailor assignments to the needs of clients.The challenges involved in reshaping a vast bureaucracy are enormous. But the status quo, city officials say, is unsustainable.About 25 percent of people who are placed in jobs by the Human Resources Administration return to the welfare rolls within a year, city statistics show. About 60 percent of able-bodied welfare recipients lack a high school diploma, a significant barrier to employment.Ms. Schliefer-Tobias still has no idea what the future holds. But for the first time in months, her spirits are lifting. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tepid Thumbs Up Is the Best Many Can Muster for Cuomo", "Date": "2014-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe\u2019re Republicans, but we\u2019re not ultraconservative.\u201d Bruce Brenner, a retired city worker, 71, with Alita Kleiner, 66, retired legal secretary, both of Forest Hills, Queens. They said they planned to vote for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Tuesday.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo gets strong marks for his aggressive response to the Ebola virus. But some voters are unsettled by what they view as his back-room, bullying style and by a federal investigation into an anti-corruption commission he established.Few New Yorkers say the governor inspires them in the way that the mere mention of his father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, still does. At least, they say, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has not embarrassed the office, unlike his immediate predecessors.New Yorkers have had four years to size up the policies, personality and governing tendencies of Mr. Cuomo, a 56-year-old former state attorney general and Clinton administration housing secretary. And by all measures, they appear ready to give him a comfortable re-election victory on Tuesday over his Republican challenger, Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive.Still, New Yorkers\u2019 relationship with their governor is hardly warm or enthusiastic, despite broad agreement with his policies, according to more than three dozen interviews conducted over the past week in New York City and on Long Island.Maybe a collective shrug, or a begrudging thumbs up, would be a more apt description. \u201cI don\u2019t like Cuomo \u2014 I just think he\u2019s an opportunist, and I haven\u2019t seen him take a stand that\u2019s risky at all,\u201d said Steve Fromhart, a 47-year-old freelance writer, as he dropped off his children at school in Park Slope, Brooklyn. \u201cBut I guess I\u2019ll vote for him. It\u2019s a sad state of affairs.\u201dWhile several people said they were unlikely to vote at all, only a handful who said they had backed Mr. Cuomo in 2010 said they would vote for someone else this time.Then again, a good number of people who spoke at length about Mr. Cuomo (as opposed to the dozens more who said they were indifferent, or uninformed) also struggled to identify any of his specific policies or actions.On Sunday, both the governor and Mr. Astorino spent much of their time north of the city. Mr. Cuomo visited Baptist churches in New Rochelle and Mount Vernon in Westchester County before holding a rally in West Haverstraw, in Rockland County. He chronicled his efforts to reform state government, criticized Mr. Astorino as intolerant and urged voters to turn out as if the race were close. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t get complacent,\u201d he said.Mr. Astorino wooed black and Hispanic voters at churches in New Rochelle and the Bronx, where he urged congregants to vote based on values, rather than party, and accused Mr. Cuomo of attacking his faith. \u201cWhen he attacks me for being a Christian, he is attacking all of you,\u201d Mr. Astorino said at Heavenly Vision Christian Center in the Bronx, where he spoke in Spanish to the largely Latino congregation.In conversations with voters last week, though, one thing that people seemed to agree on, from Rockville Centre in Nassau County to Pelham Parkway in the Bronx to Chelsea in Manhattan, was that the Cuomo name remained golden.\u201cCuomo has the experience, he has the family background \u2014 reminds me of the Kennedy family,\u201d Mr. Brenner said. \u201cAstorino, I don\u2019t like. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be right for New York. We\u2019re Republicans, but we\u2019re not ultraconservative.\u201d\u201cHis brother is good on TV,\u201d Ms. Kleiner added, referring to Chris Cuomo, the CNN news anchor.The governor benefited, too, from having succeeded David A. Paterson (labeled \u201chapless\u201d by one person) and, before him, Eliot Spitzer (whose fall from grace still stings for many).\u201cI think he\u2019s the best,\u201d said Om Verma, 51, an immigration paralegal in Hollis, Queens, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s childhood neighborhood. \u201cHe\u2019s smart, he\u2019s educated, and his father is great.\u201d He added, shaking his head, \u201cIf you compare to other governors, well, you saw what that guy was doing in Washington, D.C.\u201d Mr. Cuomo\u2019s brash style, though, polarizes many New Yorkers. \u201cInitially, I had a good impression of him \u2014 he\u2019s a Democrat, I\u2019m a Democrat,\u201d said Jamie Pagirsky, 22, a recent graduate of the State University of New York at New Paltz who lives in Rockville Centre. \u201cBut over time, that changed.\u201d\u201cWe were all in disbelief \u2014 Is this real? Is this happening to my close friend? Is this how his administration operates?\" he said. \u201cThis is supposed to be a healthy democracy, and this was completely obstructing that process. After that incident, I was just completely turned off by him.\u201dJulia Beardwood, a branding and marketing executive from Park Slope, said Mr. Cuomo had been a \u201cdisappointment\u201d because \u201cthe whole corruption issue seems to be something he dealt with inappropriately.\u201dMs. Beardwood said she also did not like the governor\u2019s reluctance to embrace the prekindergarten expansion that was the signature issue of her former neighbor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat. As a result, she said, she voted for Ms. Teachout in the primary because she seemed \u201cmore honest and less political.\u201dStill, she said she would vote for Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday \u201cbecause I don\u2019t have a better option.\u201d\u201cIn the long run,\u201d she added, \u201cI hope that he will see the light.\u201dSuch criticisms were not universal, especially among New Yorkers who said they admired the bluntness of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, both Republicans.Lisa Catanzarite, 38, a home health care worker from Gravesend, Brooklyn, said she liked what she called Mr. Cuomo\u2019s \u201ciron fist\u201d persona, and rolled her eyes when asked about the Moreland Commission. \u201cFind me a clean politician,\u201d she deadpanned.Ms. Catanzarite was one of dozens interviewed who praised Mr. Cuomo\u2019s decision, with Mr. Christie, to impose tougher quarantines on people returning to New York and New Jersey after coming into contact with Ebola patients. Many people said they felt the governor should not have backtracked in the face of pressure from medical professionals and the White House.Maureen Anzalone, 63, a health care eligibility liaison in Pelham Parkway, shared that opinion, and even invoked Kaci Hickox, the nurse placed under quarantine in Newark. \u201cHe gave in a little to the nurse about the Ebola hoopla \u2014 she should\u2019ve bitten the bullet,\u201d said Ms. Anzalone, 63, speaking about a block from the campaign headquarters of State Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, a Democrat. \u201cBut I\u2019m mostly satisfied. I think he\u2019s a little rough around the edges, like, in a \u2018Don\u2019t mess with me\u2019 kind of way.\u201d\u201cI was going to vote for him, but I\u2019m not going to now,\u201d said Mr. Lowe, 70.Only a handful of people mentioned one of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s hallmark achievements: the legalization of same-sex marriage.In Chelsea, the political base of one of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s most ardent supporters, Christine C. Quinn, the former City Council speaker, Eddie Jacobs, a 48-year-old financial services salesman, said he did not care for the governor\u2019s Ebola response (an overreaction, Mr. Jacobs said) or handling of the Moreland Commission (an overreach). To Fred Carbo, owner of Fortunata\u2019s Fine Foods, in Rockville Centre, the ad encapsulated much of what he had come to appreciate about Mr. Cuomo.And now, as the owner of a business in Nassau County, just down the block from the campaign headquarters of State Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Republican, Mr. Carbo said he was reminded of the governor\u2019s efforts to cap property taxes. \u201cI think he\u2019s tried his best,\u201d Mr. Carbo said. \u201cHow do you please everybody? You can\u2019t.\"A picture caption on Monday with an article about some New Yorkers\u2019 less-than-enthusiastic support for Gov. Andrew M.

{"Headline": "Argentina\u2019s Case Has No Victors, Many Losers ", "Date": "2014-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceThe winners have gained nothing.The losers have lost nothing.The innocent bystanders are worried and are scrambling to avoid becoming the real losers.The United States judicial system may turn out to have greatly overreached its authority and be forced to back down.His decision was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which turned aside pleas by the Justice Department and the International Monetary Fund that the decision be reversed. In June, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case. The judge\u2019s ruling stood.Five months later, Argentina has not paid any money to the hedge funds. The judge has succeeded in blocking it from paying any money to holders of other bonds, but that just increases the number of losers.In a way, the current fight is reminiscent of the battles more than 300 years ago in the American colonies over debtor\u2019s prisons, which were widespread. Such punishment might have made sense for deadbeats, and it presumably had a deterrent effect, but prisoners were unable to earn the money needed to pay their creditors even if they wished to do so.As the Rhode Island General Assembly reported in 1747, \u201cmen of honest minds and virtuous dispositions have been reduced by misfortune (notwithstanding their utmost care and diligence) and thrown into prison, where they have been closely confined in scanty little rooms, under lock and key, to the prejudice of their health and ruin of their families, many of them being of such occupations, that if they had the liberty of the house, they could at least support themselves and families by their business.\u201dThe solution adopted by the assembly was not to get rid of debtor\u2019s prisons. Instead, it allowed prisoners to leave each day to work. Not until 1898 was a nationwide bankruptcy system established.More than a decade ago, after the Asian financial crisis, the International Monetary Fund proposed a sovereign debt restructuring mechanism for countries, but the United States and other countries rejected the idea as a violation of sovereignty. In the wake of the Argentine ruling, the United Nations General Assembly tried to revive the effort, passing a resolution by a seemingly overwhelming vote of 124 to 11, with 41 countries abstaining.The catch is that the countries that matter the most, including the United States, opposed the resolution even after it was watered down. In terms of voting power at the International Monetary Fund, the vote was 35 percent in favor, 39 percent against and the remainder abstaining. The idea is going nowhere.For international bonds issued under New York law, as many are, it used to be that a country that defaulted could be sued and the courts would order it to pay. But sovereign immunity meant that decision could not be enforced. So most bondholders would eventually agree to some sort of debt restructuring, often involving the International Monetary Fund.The Argentine ruling has clearly given bondholders an incentive to hold out in future international restructurings. Under Judge Griesa\u2019s ruling, holdouts could do much better than those who agreed to the restructuring, and could not do worse.If, that is, the decision can be enforced.The judge, aware of that problem, has barred banks and other financial firms from doing anything to help Argentina evade the ruling. That has meant extending the ruling to cover not only bonds issued under New York law but also those issued under English and Argentine laws.Argentina has tried to pay interest on the new bonds, but banks unwilling to violate the judge\u2019s orders have refused to do so in London as well as in New York. In Argentina, the local Citibank branch has persuaded the judge to agree to allow three interest payments on those bonds, but he has not promised to allow future payments.Owners of the English-law bonds are trying to persuade a British court to order the banks to pay the money. If that happens, the banks could be in a position of having to decide which court order to obey. Argentina says it will try to exchange the New York-law bonds \u2014 over which Judge Griesa clearly has jurisdiction \u2014 for new bonds issued under Argentine law. But some bondholders fear that by accepting such an exchange they might be deemed in violation of the judge\u2019s order. We could have the spectacle of a bondholder being held in contempt of court for accepting an interest payment.In corporate bankruptcies, creditors that must lose money on their loans are often given equity in the company that will emerge, offering at least a possibility of a better recovery if the restructured company prospers.You can\u2019t get stock in a country, but Argentina tried something similar. Its exchange bonds included provisions increasing the return if the country\u2019s economy grew rapidly enough. It did, and bondholders have done better than it appeared they would initially.It is not clear how broadly the Argentine precedent will be applied in future cases. The appeals court, in upholding Judge Griesa\u2019s ruling, listed several actions taken by Argentina that it considered outrageous. But it did not clarify whether a country that committed only some, or even none, of those acts could be sure that it would not be treated in the same way.Those who back Judge Griesa tend to see the issue as a matter of black and white. Argentina promised to pay, and it must honor its promises. Those appalled by the judge\u2019s decision are more inclined to, in effect, worry about those Rhode Island \u201cmen of honest minds and virtuous dispositions\u201d who were suffering through no fault of their own.At a conference at Columbia University this week, Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Columbia economist who was previously the chief economist of the World Bank, said fairness required that all creditors, not just bondholders, be considered when weighing what should happen to a country that cannot pay its bills. That list of creditors would include pension recipients in the country, who might have to go hungry so that a hedge fund could make a large profit on bonds it bought at a deep discount after the country defaulted.With no international bankruptcy law in the offing, the United States government has encouraged countries to change the terms of new bonds they issue. Bonds recently issued by Vietnam, Kazakhstan and Mexico have included language aimed at avoiding a similar interpretation of the law and have clauses that would allow a supermajority of bondholders to force holdouts to accept a restructuring.But it will be decades before all outstanding international bonds mature and can be replaced by bonds with the new provisions, and it is not certain those provisions would be sufficient to keep holdouts from blocking a needed restructuring.At first glance, Judge Griesa\u2019s ruling might be seen to promote financial rectitude by deterring countries from taking on debt they might not be able to repay. But the reverse could be true if lenders decided that the legal protection assured that even bad loans would eventually have to be repaid.Something like that seems to have happened in the United States after Congress amended the bankruptcy law in 2005 to make it much harder for bankrupt consumers to cancel credit-card debts. Standards for lending declined, and banks suffered large losses on loans given to consumers who could not pay, no matter what a judge might say.Judge Griesa has said repeatedly that Argentina should simply negotiate a settlement with the hedge fund holdouts. But even if the country were willing and able to do so, it is hard to see how such a deal could bind other holdouts, who could file their own legal actions seeking full payment.The courts have ruled. So far their decisions have accomplished nothing other than enriching a lot of lawyers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lessons for Obama\u2019s Final Two Years From Reagan, Clinton and Bush", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBeyond the MidtermsA president in the final two years of an eight-year run in the White House. Congress held by an opposing party that loathes the occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. A staff that is depleted and exhausted by six-plus years of governing.That is the situation that Barack Obama will face in the final two years of his presidency, with, we learned Tuesday, a Congress now controlled by Republicans in both houses. But it is not particularly uncommon. Three times in the last 30 years it has occurred: with Ronald Reagan in 1987 and 1988, Bill Clinton in 1999 and 2000, and George W. Bush in 2007 and 2008.So what can we learn about what Mr. Obama \u2014 and the country \u2014 is in for these next two years? The president has wide latitude to lead foreign policy, but in the domestic sphere achievement generally means getting Congress to pass laws he is willing to sign. So is this destined to be a time of partisan rancor and little accomplishment? Or could there be room for some actual, gulp, lawmaking, in contrast with the last couple of years in which no major legislation has found its way to the president\u2019s desk?The historical record actually points to some intriguing possibilities for pragmatic action if President Obama is able to put aside his own ambitions and vision and find some less polarizing, below-the-radar issues where Republicans are more eager for change than his Democratic allies.As you might guess, those historical episodes offer no reason to think that the president has any hope of signing major legislation of his own initiative and design. It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone would dare tackle something like immigration reform, which has attracted bipartisan support in the past but is the subject of a deeply polarized political debate.Instead, the kinds of legislation that are passed during the tail end of two-term presidencies usually fall into two buckets: things that were forced upon Congress by emergency circumstances; and things that were more eagerly supported by members of the opposition than the president\u2019s own party.When Democrats took charge of both houses of Congress after the 2006 elections, George W. Bush\u2019s popularity was already in a deep dive amid debacles around the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina and an early second-term effort to add private accounts to Social Security.But even a domestic policy initiative that both the president and Congressional Democrats were enthusiastic about, immigration reform, didn\u2019t go anywhere. Republicans in Congress revolted and President Bush no longer had the clout to bring them on board.Even though the table, in theory, seemed nicely set for a bipartisan achievement that might have helped George W. Bush\u2019s standing in history, the actual realities of being an unpopular president in the back end of eight years in the Oval Office meant that it wasn\u2019t to be.By contrast, the domestic legislation that did come out of Mr. Bush\u2019s final two years was of the emergency response variety. The financial system and the economy began teetering in late 2007. The Bush administration pushed \u2014 and Democratic leaders agreed to with varying degrees of enthusiasm \u2014 a fiscal stimulus package in early 2008; a reform of the law overseeing the housing finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that summer; and, most controversially, the $700 billion bank bailout bill known as TARP in the fall.There was little enthusiasm among Democrats for the enterprise. But there was a feeling that they had to act simply because the consequences of not doing so would be too grave.We can all hope that the remainder of the Obama administration will not feature a global financial crisis or other emergency situation that might make Republicans willing to approve laws they would otherwise despise. So what kind of lawmaking is possible in more normal circumstances? A common thread is that the president embraced policies that the president\u2019s party felt ambivalent about at best.After the 106th Congress took office in January 1999, it moved to hold an impeachment trial of Mr. Clinton, hardly an auspicious beginning for a productive relationship. But there actually were a couple of significant bills that wound up becoming law.In November 1999, Congress passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to deregulate the financial industry, which among other things freed large banks from Depression-era rules preventing securities firms and commercial banks from being part of the same company.The bill, which many view as a contributor to the deregulatory fervor that helped leave banks vulnerable to the financial crisis nine years later, was strongly supported by the banking industry and business groups. While it received overwhelming support from both parties, to the degree there were objections, they were on the left, not the right. The bill, for example, received \u201cyes\u201d votes from all but five Republican members of the House and all but one Republican in the Senate; 51 House Democrats and seven Senate Democrats voted against it.The pattern was even more pronounced with another law of Mr. Clinton\u2019s late second term that stands out for being consequential. In 2000, he signed a law that permanently normalized trade relations with China. It opened an era in which China has become more integrated into the global economy. At the time, business interests eagerly sought the deal to gain better access to the fast-growing Chinese market. But labor and human rights groups were opposed, since they thought it could mean opening American workers to more low-wage competition and leave the United States with fewer levers to encourage the Chinese government to respect human rights.It was an even more lopsided vote than the one for financial deregulation, with 70 percent of House Republicans voting \u201cyes\u201d and only 29 percent of House Democrats doing the same.By the final two years of the Clinton presidency, dreams of a single-payer health care were a distant memory, but he was able to get things done by going along with policies that annoyed some allies but were supported by the more pro-business wing of the Democratic coalition.A close analogue occurred near the end of Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency. With the Iran-contra affair swirling and late-administration fatigue setting in, there was little meaningful domestic policy in 1987 and 1988. One key exception was the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, a broad law that included job training, food stamps, mental health treatment and more.Activists had long sought something along these lines, while conservatives had urged local responses and expressed no desire to expand federal social welfare programs. But amid a spate of attention focused on homelessness nationwide, Mr. Reagan set aside ideology and signed the law in July 1987.As Mr. Obama plots how he hopes to spend the remainder of his presidency, the lessons from these three periods carry one combined message: What will prove to be in the realm of possibility in domestic lawmaking depends less on what you might want to do, and more on what circumstance puts in front of you that you are willing to sign your name to.An earlier version of this article misstated when the 106th Congress took office.

{"Headline": "As Japan Falls Into Recession, Europe Looks to Avoid It", "Date": "2014-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Japan looked like the model for economic revival. Growth was back on track. The stock market was surging. Inflation, which had eluded Japan for decades, was even returning.But Japan\u2019s grand economic experiment, a combination of fiscal discipline and monetary stimulus, is collapsing. On Monday, the country unexpectedly fell into recession, a downturn that has painful implications for the rest of the world.Japan\u2019s unorthodox strategy was supposed to offer a road map for other troubled economies, notably Europe. Fiscal belt-tightening and tax increases, while leaning on the central bank to pump money into the economy, was expected to help overcome a malaise.\u201cThe United States is about the only growth beacon in the global economy right now, and that is not a very nice place to be,\u201d said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cAn American growth pickup is positive, but it looks like the rest of the world is again going to be relying on the U.S. as a consumer of last resort.\u201dMr. Abe\u2019s program, called Abenomics, at first relied on a one-two punch of government spending and financial support from the Bank of Japan, the country\u2019s central bank. The bank sharply increased its program of buying government bonds and other assets, similar to the stimulus effort recently ended by the United States Federal Reserve.In some ways, Japan has been more aggressive than the United States. Its bond-buying program, which was expanded last month, is now bigger relative to the size of its economy than the Fed\u2019s was at its peak.Much of the enthusiasm for Abenomics has evaporated, however. Some economists blame a lack of action by Mr. Abe\u2019s government in areas beyond pump-priming stimulus, such as deregulation and trade.A turn toward tighter fiscal policy has taken the majority of the blame. Government data released on Monday showed that the country unexpectedly fell into recession in the third quarter, hampered by rising sales taxes that have discouraged consumers from spending. Mr. Abe is expected to shelve a second tax increase, lest the Japanese economy and consumer confidence erode further.\u201cWhat Japan shows is that if you have longstanding economic stagnation, having an aggressive monetary policy and even sizable fiscal reform is not going to work without deep-rooted structural reform,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard said. \u201cThe experience of Japan must be at the top of the minds of European leaders.\u201d High on the agenda is whether Europe should pursue large-scale purchases of government bonds, so-called quantitative easing.The European Central Bank recently said it was prepared to take additional steps to revive the struggling economy, by lending more to banks and buying bonds backed by mortgages and other assets. Critics say the bank has not acted nearly aggressively enough to help revive growth, which has essentially stagnated.The similarities between the two places is strong, which has prompted some economists to wonder whether Europe will turn into another Japan.Europe and Japan have stuck with various versions of austerity, neither pushing ahead with deep-seated changes to their economy that analysts say are needed to revive long-term growth. Europe is also increasingly facing down the Japan-like specter of deflation as a recovery lags.The political debate is also developing along the same lines.A number of countries, led by France and Italy, recently balked at European Union requirements to doggedly adhere to fiscal targets and eschew stimulus spending that some economists say is critical. Some economists say that Japan\u2019s situation only adds to the argument that fiscal belt-tightening, while sometimes needed to mend a country\u2019s finances, hurts growth when an economy is in decline.\u201cThe main implication is we are beginning to see what it might look like in Europe if we go down that road,\u201d said Bart van Ark, chief economist for the Conference Board, referring to Japan\u2019s recession.\u201cEurope has the potential to become a second Japan in terms of significantly slowing demographics, and weak per capita income growth,\u201d he said. The Japanese experience shows that efforts to keep the economy afloat with more inflation and growth don\u2019t help sustain higher growth in the long term. What\u2019s needed, he said, is a \u201creform agenda, and that is a very difficult strategy\u201d for politicians to pursue in any country.The problems in Europe and Japan put additional pressure on the United States and China, which face their own headwinds.The United States increased at a healthy 3.5 percent annualized pace in the third quarter, and unemployment has fallen below 6 percent. But troubling signs remain, including less-than-robust consumer spending and a lift from military spending that may be temporary.China, too, is under pressure. Growth in China has cooled to 7.3 percent. While that is the envy of many countries, a slow clip by Chinese standards has raised questions about the nation\u2019s economic health.The disparate issues \u2014 a weak recovery in Europe, slowing growth in China and other emerging markets, as well as Japan\u2019s failure to sustain any sort of a turnaround \u2014 have rung alarm bells in Washington.Last week, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in a speech in Seattle that the United States was increasingly being relied upon to perform as locomotive for a global recovery. \u201cBut the global economy cannot prosper broadly relying on the United States to be the importer of first and last resort, nor can it rely on the United States to grow fast enough to make up for weak growth in major world economies,\u201d he said.Liz Alderman reported from Paris and Jonathan Soble from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eurozone Eked Out Growth in Third Quarter", "Date": "2014-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The European economy is barely managing to pull out of a rut, raising concern among global policy makers that continued sluggishness in the eurozone\u2019s richest countries may begin to ripple beyond the Continent\u2019s borders and pose risks to the recovery in the United States.The 18-nation euro economy grew 0.6 percent in the third quarter on an annualized basis, Europe\u2019s statistics agency said Friday, well below its precrisis growth rate of around 2 percent. The big drags were the eurozone\u2019s largest economies, as a slowdown in Germany, a weak recovery in France and a triple-dip recession in Italy weighed on the region.In a surprising role reversal, countries that were hardest hit by Europe\u2019s debt crisis have started to rebound faster than the biggest economies, especially Greece, which grew the fastest of any eurozone country and officially exited a wrenching six-year recession. Ireland and Spain, which had struggled to recover from major housing busts, also performed well.Still, it was hardly a relief. Nor was it enough to offset the slowing of Europe\u2019s core economies, or to reverse the stark reality of high unemployment, sluggish job creation and ultralow inflation that have become embedded across large parts of the region.\u201cWhat\u2019s of concern to people when they look at Europe is that the weakness is now coming from the big three countries,\u201d said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at the German insurer Allianz, referring to France, Germany and Italy. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a story about the periphery; the core is now weakening.\u201dThe failure to generate a European revival six years after the global financial crisis broke out has stoked alarm elsewhere, including Washington, where there are concerns about collateral damage to the American recovery.\u201cThe world cannot afford a European lost decade,\u201d he added.Concerns about the Continent have also been building in Britain, which this week lowered its growth and inflation forecasts. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, warned on Wednesday that moribund growth in Europe could menace Britain\u2019s fledgling economic recovery. \u201cA specter is now haunting Europe \u2014 the specter of economic stagnation,\u201d he said.Fears of stagnation may ratchet up pressure on Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, to do more. But this week, Mr. Draghi essentially said the bank did not have the power to propel a recovery on its own. In a speech in Rome, he warned that European growth would not pick up unless banks started lending more and governments encouraged investment, improved national competitiveness and took steps to lower unemployment.Support by the central bank has become more urgent amid signs that ultralow inflation is settling in across the eurozone. Lowflation, as some economists call it, makes it harder for households and governments to pay off debts, and it could further crimp Europe\u2019s recovery prospects.On Thursday, a European Central Bank survey showed that inflation would remain at worrisomely low levels before picking up slightly next year. The annual inflation rate in the eurozone was near a five-year low of 0.4 percent in October, and the central bank now expects a rate of 0.5 percent for 2014 \u2014 well below the target of close to 2 percent.The gloomy outlook has been mitigated by signs of better performance in the countries on the periphery of the eurozone.Greece, which became the epicenter of the euro crisis in 2010, grew 0.7 percent on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the fastest pace in more than six years. \u201cGreece is back,\u201d Prime Minister Antonis Samaras declared Friday. He has overseen a steady recovery and a marked improvement in the nation\u2019s fiscal performance after two multibillion-euro international bailouts. This year, he led Greece\u2019s return to borrowing in financial markets.Still, Greeks are grappling with more than 25 percent unemployment, and a wrenching austerity program has compromised Mr. Samaras\u2019s popularity before a crucial election in February that could destabilize his government.The Spanish economy, which was in recession a year ago, grew 0.5 percent on a quarterly basis from 0.6 percent between April and June. Ireland, which has not yet calculated third-quarter economic figures, grew by 1.5 percent in the second quarter, down from a 2.8 percent pace in the first quarter but still much better than the contraction it experienced at the end of last year.In France, where a languishing economy has pushed President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s political popularity to new lows and propelled gains for the far-right National Front party, growth expanded in the third quarter for the first time this year, by 0.3 percent, after contracting in the second quarter and failing to grow at all in the first. But the French finance minister, Michel Sapin, acknowledged that the increase was \u201ctoo small for the job creation necessary for our country.\u201dItaly, for its part, slid into yet another recession despite pledges from Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to eschew austerity and turn the economy around. Growth shrank 0.1 percent in the third quarter from the second, when the economy contracted 0.2 percent.Germany has been the biggest concern. The German economy, typically an engine of growth, only narrowly escaped recession, expanding 0.1 percent from the previous quarter, when output contracted by a revised 0.1 percent.\u201cGermany\u2019s virtuous circle is coming to an end,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING Bank, said in a note to clients. He said it was \u201cthe first time the German economy underperformed the rest of the eurozone in two consecutive quarters since the doomy days of the crisis.\u201d These days, he added, Germany is more of \u201ca one-eyed king in the land of the blind than an economic superman.\u201dEconomists say the region is flirting with entering a triple-dip recession, especially if national governments do not move quickly to create growth and jobs, like making hiring conditions easier for businesses and investing in major public works projects.Unemployment in the euro area is stuck near a record high of 11.3 percent \u2014 in contrast to the jobless rate in the United States, which has fallen to 5.8 percent from 10 percent at the height of the crisis.As if that were not enough, Europe\u2019s recovery could be further menaced by renewed tensions between Russia and Ukraine, should a conflict lead to a new round of sanctions by Western countries and retaliatory sanctions by Moscow toward Europe.\u201cWe are at most one or two rounds of sanctions and countersanctions away from pushing Russia into a deep recession, and Europe into a recession,\u201d Mr. El-Erian of Allianz said.Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stalin, Father of Ukraine?", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEight years ago, on Nov. 28, 2006, the Ukrainian Parliament officially designated the famine of 1931-33, which killed 5 to 7 million Soviets during Stalin\u2019s rule, a genocide. On Saturday, Ukraine\u2019s president, Petro O. Poroshenko, accompanied by other officials and by his wife, laid a jar of seeds of grain near the Dnieper River in Kiev to mark the anniversary.Stalin\u2019s rule is rightly associated with two of the most horrific episodes in Ukraine\u2019s history: the famine and the 1937-38 mass executions of Ukrainian intellectuals and political figures, both of which took place across the Soviet Union. Both tragedies have been invoked regularly in the months since Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, seized Crimea and sent forces into eastern Ukraine.But there is an underappreciated aspect to this tangled history: Stalin\u2019s rule saw the formation of a land with strong Ukrainian national consciousness. Yes, he was a murderous tyrant, but he was also a father of today\u2019s Ukraine.Ukraine emerged out of czarist Russia as a separate country as a result of World War I, the revolutions of 1917, German military occupation and the efforts of Ukrainian nationalists. Against the wishes of other early Soviet officials, who wanted to suppress nationalism, Stalin strongly advocated recognizing \u2014 and using \u2014 it. \u201cClearly, the Ukrainian nation exists and the development of its culture is a duty of Communists,\u201d Stalin told the 10th Party Congress in March 1921. \u201cOne cannot go against history.\u201dStalin knew from his Georgian homeland that national sentiment was too strong to suppress. He also knew that the Communists could use it to win loyalty and achieve economic modernization.Ukraine had remained effectively independent even after being reconquered by the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War of 1918-1921 and rechristened the Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine. Through late 1921, Soviet Ukraine signed a plethora of state-to-state treaties \u2014 with newly independent Poland, Austria, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia \u2014 and maintained diplomatic missions abroad. Ukraine had a diplomatic office in Moscow, too. At the 10th Party Congress, Stalin argued for an integrated Soviet state. But the form of that integrated state would carry fateful consequences.In 1922, Stalin proposed folding Ukraine, Byelorussia and the Caucasus into Soviet Russia (formally known as the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic) while allowing them to retain substantial autonomy, a proposal that initially elicited Lenin\u2019s support. But Lenin soon changed his mind, and demanded a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, in which Ukraine and Russia would hold ostensibly equal status.Lenin\u2019s counterproposal was based not on a commitment to self-rule but, like Stalin, on tactics. He argued that as other countries underwent socialist revolutions \u2014 a Soviet Germany, a Soviet Hungary, a Soviet Finland \u2014 they, too, could join the new Soviet Union. Stalin was not so na\u00efve. \u201cThese peoples would scarcely agree to enter straight into a federative bond with Soviet Russia\u201d on the Ukrainian model, he told Lenin. Lenin scorned Stalin\u2019s realism, insisting that \u201cwe need a centralized world economy, run from a single organ.\u201dStalin bowed to Lenin\u2019s authority, and loyally and skillfully implemented the Bolshevik leader\u2019s vision to form the Soviet Union in late 1922. Lenin\u2019s vision amounted to an overconfident bet on world revolution. Stalin also believed in world revolution, but his proposal \u2014 annexation into Russia \u2014 would have been a hedge on that bet.In 1991, of course, the Soviet Union dissolved. Ukraine, having avoided absorption into Russia thanks to Lenin, became independent. But the new nation encompassed as much land as it did thanks to Stalin.When it was first formed, Soviet Ukraine had no natural border in the east with Soviet Russia. The demarcation disappointed all sides \u2014 and it is the site of today\u2019s separatist rebellion. In the west, as a result of his 1939 pact with Hitler, Stalin seized eastern Poland and joined it to Ukraine. The city today known as Lviv was then a largely Polish- and Yiddish-speaking community, surrounded by a Ukrainian-speaking countryside; under Stalin and his successors the city would become predominantly Ukrainian-speaking \u2014 and the center of western Ukrainian nationalism.With the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, Stalin annexed Transcarpathia, formerly part of Czechoslovakia, and now the southwest corner of Ukraine. Finally, Crimea, at the time a predominantly ethnic Russian territory, was transferred to Ukraine from Russia in a decision taken under Stalin but implemented only after he had died, in 1954, on the 300th anniversary of the Cossack request for imperial Russia\u2019s protection against the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth.Except for Crimea, today\u2019s nationalist Ukraine is a bequeathal of Stalin. It\u2019s true that he executed countless officials of Ukrainian (and every other) ethnicity. But as the Soviet state expanded, he promoted still more Ukrainians to take their places. Even when he belatedly made study of Russian language a requirement in all Soviet schools, he did not discontinue instruction in national vernacular languages.Of course, in helping to enlarge and consolidate Soviet Ukraine, Stalin never imagined that the Soviet Union would someday disappear. And so Mr. Putin faces a formidable obstacle.He is said by diplomats to have told President George W. Bush, at a NATO summit meeting in Bucharest, Romania, in 2008 that \u201cUkraine is not even a state.\u201d And in claiming territory from Ukraine, Mr. Putin has cited Catherine the Great\u2019s Black Sea conquests and creation of \u201cNew Russia\u201d in the late 18th century. But Mr. Putin cannot escape more recent history.Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea has rendered Ukraine even more ethnically Ukrainian, and helped elect Ukraine\u2019s first ever pro-European parliamentary majority. One does not have to take sides over the human tragedy unfolding in eastern Ukraine to grasp that, whether Mr. Putin does or does not have clear strategic goals, he cannot wipe out the fruits of the Soviet period.Mr. Putin cannot simply swallow Ukraine \u2014 it is no longer \u201cNew Russia.\u201d And unlike Stalin \u2014 indeed, because of Stalin, and because of his regime\u2019s own behavior \u2014 Mr. Putin cannot entice Ukraine back into a new \u201cEurasian\u201d union with Russia either. Ukrainians have little affection for Stalin\u2019s dictatorship, but their struggle for statehood owes much to his legacy \u2014 a legacy that, for different reasons, neither they nor Mr. Putin like to think about.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Trouble With Campaign Volunteers", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStranger at the DoorFor decades, idealistic and young college-educated volunteers joined political campaigns and were promptly sent off to canvass voters in factory towns and inner cities who were nothing like them.Two political scientists say their research suggests that the mismatch between volunteers and voters could be a problem for today\u2019s data-driven campaigns, which are having more direct conversations with more voters. As campaigns increase the volume of in-person visits and phone calls made by volunteers, they risk that those interactions could turn away voters from the candidates they are promoting.When campaigns were mostly focused on television advertising, they could present a single message to voters on air, one that was typically less extreme than that espoused by its most fervent supporters. But the increased emphasis during the last two elections on directly contacting voters makes it more important for campaigns to send not just the right message but one delivered by the right messenger.Who performs these fundamental campaign tasks matters, the authors say. Campaigns can tightly control messages in broadcast advertisements and speeches. But they have much less control over the activities of their volunteers. In the past, campaigns would skip entire neighborhoods considered to be unfriendly, but the ability to target smaller groups of voters from information in voter files and other sources of information means that in many races volunteers are talking to more individuals than they ever have.That\u2019s important for campaigns because it could have consequences for the effectiveness of such work; canvassing was a major focus for both Democratic and Republican campaigns, as well as outside groups, in the 2014 elections. Although the study does not assign a cost to mismatching volunteers with voters, it suggests that campaigns could better utilize their volunteers to reduce the risk that they inadvertently turn voters away.\u201cThe most liberal people \u2014 young, from out of state \u2014 are the ones who are spending their time out knocking on doors,\u201d Mr. Enos said in a telephone interview. He described seeing many of his own government students from Harvard volunteer for field work in the Obama campaign in blue-collar or inner-city areas in other states. The Obama campaign at times encouraged volunteers to veer from the scripts it provided for such interactions, which may have resulted in volunteers\u2019 own interests superseding those of the campaign.He said campaigns might not be thinking about the full range of volunteers available. \u201cOlder volunteers are at the office entering data\u201d when some of them might be better matched with voters more like them, he said.Although the paper looked only at Obama campaign volunteers, there are implications for other campaigns and parties. The authors conclude that parties and campaigns tend to attract highly ideological volunteers who are driven mainly by a single issue like health insurance or abortion rather than broader issues like the economy or education. Midterm elections, which don\u2019t have the broad appeal of a presidential election, might even exacerbate this condition because they tend to attract partisan loyalists.The authors got permission from the Obama campaign to have their survey of ideology randomly appear as part of the software that volunteers used when contacting voters. The survey was taken by 3,095 volunteers, some more than once, and showed that \u201cObama\u2019s 2012 campaign workers were extremely liberal, even relative to strong Democrats who match the observable demographic profile of the workers.\u201dMr. Enos said the imbalance most likely extended to Republican campaigns as well.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Love With a Priest: Support Groups Spread ", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 They had not planned on falling in love, but they did.\u201cSome people see me as a devil, something dirty,\u201d said the woman, who, along with the priest she is involved with, agreed to discuss their situation, sitting for an interview at a hotel in a city far from his parish.They asked to remain anonymous, fearing further disapproval from their parents, who know, and the disdain of friends and parishioners, who already suspect that their friendship is more than platonic.\u201cI risk losing everything if it were to come out into the open,\u201d the priest said. Yet they agreed to speak, his partner said, \u201cbecause suffering pushes you to do something, to try and change this injustice.\u201dAn online search using \u201cin love with a priest\u201d produces blog after blog about church-crossed lovers, in any number of languages. There are support groups on social media, including Facebook groups for women. One group of 26 women even petitioned Pope Francis to change the church\u2019s requirement of celibacy for priests, and relieve their suffering.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to explain this relationship to someone who hasn\u2019t gone through it,\u201d said one of the women who signed the letter to the pope but did not want her name printed because she, too, is romantically involved with a priest. \u201cWe wanted to let the pope know that the suffering is widespread.\u201dShe again wrote to the pope in September just before the Synod of Bishops, a Vatican gathering of some 200 clerics convened to discuss issues faced by families in contemporary society.It was the most closely watched synod in decades, and some Vatican experts drew parallels with the synod convened by Pope Paul VI in 1971, where the celibacy requirement for priests was the hot-button issue.At that time, after heated discussion, the synod reaffirmed the obligation of celibacy, and there has been no official review of that position for 40 years. Those who were hoping the issue would be revisited during October\u2019s synod were disappointed again.Yet a growing number of priest organizations in the United States, Austria, Ireland and elsewhere continue to press for change.Challengers to clerical celibacy point to the shortage of priests worldwide and to studies that show celibacy is a significant deterrent for young men wanting to enter the priesthood.While no numbers are authoritative, Advent, a support group for priests who have left the ministry in Britain, estimates that about 10,000 men have left the priesthood to marry in the past 50 years in England and Wales alone.The shortage has had significant impact in parishes around the world, said Alex Walker, the leader of Advent, who left the priesthood to marry.\u201cBishops can keep praying for vocations, or look at what can be done about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf celibacy is causing a problem they\u2019ll have to allow optional celibacy, and even recall those priests who have been dispensed.\u201dThat group was founded eight years ago by the charismatic former archbishop of Lusaka, Emmanuel Milingo, who grabbed headlines in 2001 when he was married in a group wedding presided over by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the leader of the Unification Church.In a letter sent to the pope in September 2013, Married Priests Now praised the \u201cnew wind blowing in the Church,\u201d after Francis\u2019 election that year, and noted that: \u201cIt would be nice if the new spirit of reconciliation would include the married priest.\u201dOrganizations of liberal Catholics have also been calling for a change to the celibacy rules, arguing that clerics routinely married in the early centuries of the church.\u201cWe know that St. Peter was married,\u201d said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a senior analyst at The National Catholic Reporter. \u201cAll the apostles were married, so celibacy isn\u2019t intrinsically connected to the priesthood.\u201dThe debate took a turn when Pope Benedict XVI decided in 2009 to create a mechanism for welcoming priests from the Anglican Communion to the Roman Catholic church, opening the door to clergy with families.\u201cIt proves that married priests can exist in the church, it doesn\u2019t mean the world is going to end,\u201d Mr. Walker said.Those hoping for a change of heart by the church were encouraged last May when Pope Francis told reporters that clerical celibacy was an issue open to discussion.\u201cCelibacy is not a question of dogma, but rather a rule of life that I greatly appreciate, as I believe it is a gift for the Church,\u201d the pope said during a return flight from the Middle East. \u201cBut, since it is not a dogma, the door is always open.\u201dHe expressed similar sentiments in a 2010 book, \u201cOn Heaven and Earth,\u201d written three years before becoming pope, even as he expressed his personal support for celibacy.\u201cEvery time he endorses celibacy, he qualifies it with a \u2018for now,\u2019 or \u2018for the moment,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Father Reese said. \u201cAt one point he even writes of a hypothetical review of celibacy. These are all strong signals that he thinks that optional celibacy could happen.\u201dWhile seeming open to a change in policy, the pope has also exhorted priests to take their celibacy seriously, and to leave the church if they can\u2019t, in particular if they have fathered a child.But for many priests in serious relationships, leaving the priesthood is a tormented option. Some priests spoke of the demeaning procedures they must go through to \u201cdefect\u201d from the ministry, made worse by unsupportive bishops who often try to get them to change their minds, and allow them to transfer to a different parish.\u201cThe idea is to recover the priest, in part to avoid scandal, in part because the clergy is getting older and a bit thin in the ranks,\u201d said Ernesto Miragoli, a priest who married in 1986 and provides support for other priests pondering leaving the church.In conversations with church experts, priests and the women in relationships with them, many also pointed to financial uncertainties as a major deterrent to leaving the ministry.Some noted that a theology degree doesn\u2019t have much market value in Italy\u2019s depressed economy. And others said that in many cases priests who defected found little financial support from their families, Italy\u2019s de facto welfare system.Francesco Brescia, a Naples-based former priest who provides support to defectors through Vocatio, an Italian association for married priests, said priests who want to leave for love frequently contacted him \u201cbecause returning to civilian life isn\u2019t easy.\u201d\u201cAnd if it\u2019s hard finding work, it\u2019s twice as hard for a priest who doesn\u2019t have a trade or usable skills,\u201d he said.The priest who agreed to discuss his relationship in the hotel interview conceded the same concern. \u201cWhat would I do, unload fruit from a truck?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere\u2019s a crisis and then I am too used to being a priest. I like being a priest and I think I do it well.\u201dIn fact, he said he believed his relationship improved his ministry. \u201cSince I am with her, I am a better priest, because I am calm, relaxed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only problem is having to sneak around.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New England Delegation Acquires a Tinge of Red", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 New England states have not voted for a Republican for president in years, even spurning one of their own, Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, in 2012. But in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, New England, long considered a bastion of liberalism, proved friendly territory for Republicans. The region\u2019s all-Democratic House delegations will have two Republican members, one from New Hampshire and one from Maine.In Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, the Republican nominee for governor, inched past Martha Coakley, the Democrat, who conceded on Wednesday. In Vermont, the Republican Scott Milne came out of nowhere and nearly toppled Gov. Peter Shumlin, who, because of a quirk of Vermont law, will have to be formally named governor by the Legislature because he did not get 50 percent of the vote. Two other Democrats, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy in Connecticut and Senator Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire, barely held their seats against Republican challengers. In Maine, the Republican governor, Paul LePage, won re-election despite deep unhappiness with him, and the State Senate flipped to Republican control.It is not that Republicans are unknown in New England. Massachusetts has a history of electing Republican governors like William F. Weld and Mr. Romney to serve as a check on the Democratic legislature. Susan Collins, the moderate Republican from Maine, was elected to the Senate in 1996, and Kelly Ayotte, of New Hampshire, in 2010. But taken together, Tuesday\u2019s results were a setback for Democrats in this six-state region, which has not gone for a Republican for president since 2000, when New Hampshire voted for George W. Bush. New England, analysts said, is not immune from the discontent that has swept much of the country, though the visceral dislike of President Obama that is evident elsewhere is not as potent here. Beyond that, analysts cited several reasons for the poor Democratic outcomes and near misses. One is that moderate Republicans like Mr. Baker, who supports abortion rights and gay rights, have blurred the lines with their opponents. And Mr. Baker knows that to be successful, he has to work with the Democratic legislature.Asked Wednesday at a news conference what message he took from his narrow victory, Mr. Baker said that voters \u201cwant us to work collaboratively and across the aisle to get stuff done.\u201dBut analysts cautioned that, Mr. Baker\u2019s election aside, the results did not signal a resurgence of the moderate New England Republican.\u201cIt\u2019s extinct,\u201d declared former Representative Barney Frank, once a liberal member of the Massachusetts delegation. \u201cLePage is a strident right-winger, and so are the two House members who were just elected.\u201d He called Ms. Collins of Maine \u201ca survivor,\u201d an exception that proves the rule.Others said that the receptiveness to Republicans in New England was more of a comment on failed Democratic performance than on anything positive about the Republicans.The Republicans took control of the Senate on Tuesday, picking up at least seven seats, and expanded their majority in the House. Their victory in the Senate was significant but not the largest historically \u2014 though it could rank among the top five election year swings since 1946.Mr. Berry put it this way: With Democrats in power, \u201cif you want to throw the rascals out, there\u2019s only one alternative.\u201dVoters across New England told pollsters that the economy was their biggest concern, particularly job shortages and income inequality. Yet few of the candidates emphasized these issues, even as much of the region faced the continued loss of manufacturing jobs, soaring energy costs and the\u00a0aging\u00a0of its populations. In Rhode Island, where high unemployment has bedeviled the state for years, both major candidates for governor did focus on the economy \u2014 and a Democrat, Gina Raimondo, won, the first to be elected in two decades.Another factor is that while outsiders think most voters are Democrats, many are registered as independents.Of course, not everyone thinks Tuesday\u2019s outcomes spelled anything of larger significance. Deval Patrick, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, shrugged when asked what it said that voters had elected a Republican to succeed him, telling reporters, \u201cI think it said he got more votes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fellowship or Internship? In Media, the Definition Has Become Fluid", "Date": "2014-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince graduating from Wesleyan University last year, Rachel Pincus has completed two journalism internships and one in publishing. But now Ms. Pincus is pursuing fellowships.\u201cI\u2019m trying at this point to move beyond internships into entry-level jobs,\u201d Ms. Pincus said. \u201cWith a fellowship, maybe you get a little bit more like clout or something, so you could take on bigger projects.\u201dMaybe. Maybe not. In what appears to be largely a semantic shift, media outlets including BuzzFeed, Gawker, The Huffington Post, Mic, Outside magazine and nearly a dozen others have taken the role of internships and repackaged them as fellowships.\u201cThe internship slash fellowship lines have completely blurred,\u201d said Arielle Dreher, a student at Columbia University\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism.On the career website Glassdoor, one aspiring applicant described receiving an offer for a fellowship with The Huffington Post, then learning the pay was $10 an hour.\u201cBeware, the fellowship is just an internship. Had the initial interviewer paid any attention to my age and experience or asked me what kind of money I was already making, he would have known I was the wrong candidate,\u201d the reviewer wrote.\u201cThey\u2019re embracing \u2018fellowship\u2019 because it seems less tainted with all of the harms and the exploitation people associate with internships now,\u201d Mr. Glatt said.Fellowships vary by industry but they often involve academic research or professional development completed over a set period of time with a stipend. The Nieman fellows at Harvard University, for example, are journalists with at least five years of full-time experience who spend two semesters auditing classes. They receive $65,000 to do so.Internships are often undertaken by students in exchange for school credit, as well as by recent graduates looking to gain experience to position them for a full-time job. The responsibilities of a journalism internship can range from errand-running and personal assistance to fact-checking, reporting and writing.Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed, said that his company\u2019s internships and fellowships were in fact different. Interns work for three months and make $12 an hour. Fellows work for three months and make $12 but follow a \u201cstructured curriculum.\u201d\u201cThey learn kind of like a different BuzzFeed form, whether it\u2019s lists, or quizzes, or news and storytelling, but also why people share those things and why they work,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Many fellows are ultimately hired, Mr. Smith said, so the program is a pipeline for talent at the company.At The Huffington Post, a devaluing of the word internship partly led to the creation of a fellowship program, said Ryan Grim, the site\u2019s Washington bureau chief. He said internships had become too ambiguous and could mean anything from fetching coffee to doing real journalism. Fellows at The Huffington Post are given that title to signify they are doing the latter.\u201cWhat this does is it signals that this is a position that has actual responsibility with it,\u201d Mr. Grim said. \u201cAnd I would hope that companies going forward don\u2019t abuse that and end up tarnishing the title fellow, too.\u201d\u201cIf this is the new status quo \u2014 cheap but not free labor for media companies, low but real pay for fellows, a nontrivial chance at employment \u2014 it\u2019s an upgrade,\u201d he said.Ross Perlin, author of \u201cIntern Nation: How to Earn Nothing and Learn Little in the Brave New Economy,\u201d said in an email that internships, too, were initially billed as ways to identify full-time employees. Given the way companies are defining fellowships now, he predicted a fall in the prestige of the word.Whatever the nomenclature, employers and job consultants agree on what recent graduates really need more of \u2014 full-time, entry-level jobs.\u201cI think this question of internship and fellowship kind of dodges that, and in fact creates more preliminary levels and hoops to jump through before saying, \u2018O.K., she\u2019s ready for that full-time reporter gig,\u2019 \u201d said David C. Yamada, an employment law professor at Suffolk University Law School.Ms. Pincus, for her part, is freelancing. She is paid per blog post and has picked up some work as a personal assistant. She moved out of her parents\u2019 home last month and applied for a fellowship with BuzzFeed, yet she\u2019s still not entirely optimistic about finding steady employment.\u201cI\u2019m going to keep applying for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I just don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m any closer than I was even when I first graduated.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a fellowship program at Harvard University.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Rise as Arms Supplier Is Put on Display", "Date": "2014-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byZHUHAI, China \u2014 Queen Bee anti-tank rocket system. Halberd supersonic target drone. Sky Dragon 12 surface-to-air missile system.Those were among the many weapons on display in the past week at Airshow China here in this southern city adjacent to Macau, and exhibitors included an array of new and established manufacturers as China expands its arms industry to bolster its military as well as exports.China is the world\u2019s fourth-largest exporter of arms, having overtaken France last year, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Ten large state-owned defense manufacturers dominate the sector, but the government is encouraging smaller, private companies to enter the field.\u201cThe Chinese authorities have been encouraging nonstate firms to take part in the defense business in order to encourage competition and innovation in a policy known as civil-military integration,\u201d said Tai Ming Cheung, director of the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation, at the University of California, San Diego.One of the new entrants is the Xi\u2019an Tianhe Defense Technology Company, founded in 2010. The company focuses on civilian and defense electronics, including continuous-wave radar systems and advanced ocean communication. \u201cOur boss is just a businessman,\u201d as opposed to a former People\u2019s Liberation Army officer, said Guo Yamei, a saleswoman.Tianhe\u2019s president, He Zenglin, escorted an entourage of Myanmar military officials by the displays of radar systems for regional air defense. \u201cWe came here to introduce our company,\u201d Ms. Guo said.From 2009 to 2013, China\u2019s top arms customers were Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar, according to the institute\u2019s data. In that period, China\u2019s share of the global arms trade jumped to 6 percent from 2 percent, while the total international arms market grew 14 percent. China is a leading supplier of major arms to sub-Saharan Africa, a relatively small but growing market.Chinese arms makers, whose products are in competition with low-cost Russian equipment in many categories, want to move up the value chain.In the past, because the Chinese military was unwilling to export advanced technology, Mr. Cheung said, the Chinese arms industry could offer only products with aging designs, which few countries wanted. An improvement in the offerings and a willingness by China to sell up-to-date products like those on display at the air show have led to the increase in arms sales.Making its debut as an exhibitor at the air show, Armor China displayed a poster of Hu Jintao, who was the country\u2019s president from 2003 to 2013, riding in a black armored vehicle in front of line of saluting soldiers in Tiananmen Square. \u201cProudly Produced Vehicle Armor for President of China,\u201d it read.Armor China, reaching beyond its origins as a parts supplier, began selling a microdrone this year that has a range of up to seven miles and can be used for military or police surveillance, as well as for forestry and agriculture. Because the microdrone has civilian uses, the $20,000 price was publicly advertised.\u201cAll the technology is designed in China,\u201d said Charles Cao, managing director of Armor China. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper to manufacturer in China because a lot of the suppliers are here.\u201dDrones, which combine aerodynamics and remote-sensing technology, are a fairly new product area, and Chinese companies are near the leading technological edge instead of playing catch-up, as they do in other fields of aviation, experts say.Norinco, the maker of the Queen Bee anti-tank rocket system, is one of China\u2019s leading arms manufacturers. At the air show, a cavernous display hall was taken up almost entirely by the company. Potential customers \u2014 from Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East \u2014 wearing red V.I.P. lanyards paraded between the displays, accompanied by Norinco translators and sales staff members explaining equipment specifications.Like other Chinese arms makers, Norinco benefits from economies of scale that allow it to offer competitive export prices.\u201cBy mass-producing for its internal market, the People\u2019s Liberation Army, Norinco is able to sell its wares on the global market by presenting itself as a cost-friendly alternative \u2014 basically the Walmart of ground defense systems for purchasers without a lot of expendable funds and uneager to meet all the political conditions required of a Germany, U.S. or United Kingdom,\u201d said Daniel Darling, who analyzes international military markets at Forecast International, an American market research company.Because China will not restrict its companies from selling to so-called rogue nations, he said, \u201cthe entire globe is its market.\u201dThe Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, known as Comac, announced the sale of 30 C919 jetliners to the leasing arm of China Merchants Bank. It also signed a deal to sell three of its ARJ21 regional jets to the Republic of Congo\u2019s Ministry of Transportation, its first sale of the model to Africa. Both Comac planes are still under development.The top attraction at the show was not for sale, at least not yet. It was the J-31 stealth fighter, which impressed crowds of aviation professionals and amateur fans with aerial maneuvers. He Shiwen, a representative of the jet\u2019s manufacturer, AVIC, said that the airplane\u2019s development was \u201cnot finished\u201d and that no sales could be confirmed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "John Lobb Spruces Up Its Classic Footwear", "Date": "2014-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Well AppointedShe has never before designed shoes.As the market for men\u2019s wear has exploded \u2014 with growth, by some estimates, now outpacing women\u2019s wear \u2014 companies have sought to attract new customers and galvanize existing ones, often by refurbishing once-staid images.To its admirers around the world, the Lobb name denotes tradition and heritage in men\u2019s formal and custom-made footwear. (Its bespoke studio in Paris also has a small clientele of women.) The company, its collections, its factory in Northampton, England, and its Paris studio have been owned since 1976 by Herm\u00e8s, but the original London bespoke workshop operates independently and is family owned.For well-paid executives who appreciate footwear priced in four figures, John Lobb is a benchmark, which is why Ms. Gerbase\u2019s appointment has drawn attention.\u201cI\u2019m not surprised you are surprised,\u201d Renaud Paul-Dauphin, the chief executive of John Lobb, said the other day. The point of hiring Ms. Gerbase, he said, was \u201cto bring modernity and, really, a creative vision to John Lobb, which is not traditional for a classic British brand.\u201dThe business shoe as embodied by Lobb has been about craftsmanship and luxury. Its leather is cut in large pieces; the less expensive method is to stitch together small ones. And Lobb\u2019s blocked heel is also a seamless design.While such details scarcely register with the untrained eye, to connoisseurs, they justify the Lobb price tag, which can run into five figures for shoes made with exotic skins. The company says that 190 manufacturing steps are required for each pair of shoes.With her label, 1205, Ms. Gerbase made her name as the designer of a highly regarded niche collection of men\u2019s and women\u2019s wear.She creates beautifully cut jackets and trousers in unusual fabrics that she personally develops with the textile mills that are her suppliers. Wearing a workman\u2019s jumpsuit of her own design, Ms. Gerbase received a reporter this fall at the tucked-away gallery space in Paris that she reserves each fashion week to show her clothing to buyers.Ms. Gerbase cited quality and understatement as \u201cthe things that attract me to John Lobb,\u201d adding that \u201celegance can be translated in lots of different ways that aren\u2019t necessarily a business shoe.\u201dAs businesspeople are changing, so are their fashion preferences, shoes included. As with other parts of the wardrobe, the boundary between formal footwear and more casual styles is more porous than it once was.Ms. Gerbase, who will continue to design the 1205 label, said she had no interest in creating a clothing collection for John Lobb \u2014 or in feeding the growing market for luxury sneakers.But she has been given the task of modernizing Lobb, implicitly to compete for the same customers who flock to Berluti. The two companies have stores some five blocks away from each other on Madison Avenue in New York.Ms. Gerbase now shows her 1205 collections each February and September during London Fashion Week. Last month, she was nominated for a British Fashion Award for emerging women\u2019s wear designer.For John Lobb, she has chosen to look forward by looking back.John Lobb, born in 1829, was a farmer\u2019s son. He left his native Cornwall \u2014 on foot \u2014 for London, and eventually Australia, before wending his way back to Europe.Mr. Lobb\u2019s peripatetic career resonated with Ms. Gerbase, who was born in Brazil and lived in the United States and Switzerland before settling in London. She visited Cornwall and made part of Mr. Lobb\u2019s walk to London, more than 200 miles northeast, to put herself, literally, in his shoes.Her first Lobb collection, to be shown in January in London during men\u2019s fashion week, was inspired by the sights and colors she saw along the way.Details of the new collection are still closely guarded. But Ms. Gerbase said a number of casual shoes in the Lobb archive \u2014 a tennis shoe from the 1920s, a walking boot from the 1940s \u2014 informed her direction. She said the company had given her \u201ccomplete freedom, which is pretty much unheard-of.\u201dMerchants predict that Ms. Gerbase\u2019s changes will be more evolutionary than revolutionary.\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to do anything to upset the apple cart,\u201d said Mr. Taffel of Leffot in New York.Ms. Gerbase, for her part, sees it all as part of the evolving 21st-century economy.\u201cJobs are changing, the uniforms are changing as well,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving modernity in a more formal shoe \u2014 I think that\u2019s quite exciting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A further tax increase is planned for next year. \u201cIt has me worried,\u201d Mr. Hara says.Japan\u2019s audacious campaign to reinvigorate its economy is entering a make-or-break phase.After nearly two years of aggressive stimulus under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, joblessness has plunged, big companies like Toyota are earning record profits and corrosive price declines have been replaced by something Japan has rarely seen in decades \u2014 inflation.Yet the benefits of Abenomics, as the program is known, have been unevenly distributed. Many consumers and businesses simply don\u2019t feel better off.The problem threatens to undermine support for the effort at a critical juncture. Economic output fell sharply in the second quarter, immediately after April\u2019s sales tax increase \u2014 evidence that consumer confidence remains fragile. Mr. Abe will soon have to decide whether to move forward with the next tax increase or table it.\u201cThere is a spreading sense of disappointment with Abenomics,\u201d says Masazumi Wakatabe, an economics professor at Waseda University in Tokyo. The fact that prices are rising is not, by itself, a bad thing. Just the opposite: The government and most economists see it as preferable to the deflation that has dogged Japan since the late 1990s.When prices fall, it encourages households and businesses to squirrel away cash, holding back growth. Deflation also makes it difficult for central banks to rally an economy by cutting interest rates, which in Japan have been stuck at zero for years.Yet the public is showing clear signs of inflation fatigue. In a poll published on Monday by the Tokyo Broadcasting System, a national television network, nine in 10 respondents said they had no \u201creal feeling\u201d that the government initiatives were improving living standards.Instead of the balanced rise in prices and wages that Mr. Abe promised, pay has lagged, in effect making workers poorer. Adjusted for price changes, household incomes were down a full 6 percent in September compared with a year earlier.Kathy M. Matsui, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, says sluggish wage growth is partly the flip side to Japan\u2019s protective employment practices. \u201cThe social contract is what? It\u2019s when times are tough, unlike in the West, we\u2019ll keep you on the payroll, although we\u2019ll slash your wages,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then when times get good, you don\u2019t get as much of what you might get elsewhere.\u201dRather than ease efforts to create inflation, the central bank has redoubled them. In an unexpected decision, the Bank of Japan said on Friday that it would expand its program of buying government bonds and other assets to the equivalent of more than $700 billion a year. The move, intended to stimulate borrowing and spending, spurred a rally in global stocks.\u201cWe are at a critical point for escaping deflation,\u201d Haruhiko Kuroda, the central bank governor, said, adding that \u201chalf measures\u201d would only bring back Japan\u2019s \u201cdeflationary mind-set.\u201d Hinting at what could be more stimulus to come, he added that the Bank of Japan would do whatever it took to meet its official target of 2 percent \u201ccore\u201d price increases, a measure that excludes the effect of taxes and other items.But the aggressive stimulus, which has pushed down the value of the yen, is only complicating matters. At the outset, the currency\u2019s retreat was universally embraced as a relief for Japan\u2019s many exporters. Now it is feeding concerns that imports are too expensive. The value of the yen is down more than 30 percent against the dollar since 2012. Exports were supposed to flourish in response, but the trade balance has instead been stuck in deficit.\u201cIf the yen weakens any further, it would be bad for Japan\u2019s economy as a whole,\u201d Genichi Tamatsuka, the president of Lawson, one of Japan\u2019s biggest convenience store chains, told reporters this week.In parliament on Tuesday, Mr. Abe was forced to defend the central bank actions that have depressed the currency. \u201cWhen the yen falls, there are issues that go with that fall, and we have to deal with them,\u201d he said, though he gave no sign that he would pressure Mr. Kuroda to reverse course.The sales tax increase has drawn the most intense opposition. The two-stage rise was authorized by a previous government, as a means of tackling Japan\u2019s vast public debt. The second part, which is scheduled for October, will take the rate to 10 percent \u2014 double what it was before the first increase.Mr. Abe has the authority to stop it if he judges the economy too fragile. But he must make his choice by next month to get a revised tax law through parliament in time. So far he has been coy, saying only that he wants to make a \u201ccoolheaded decision.\u201dSome lawmakers and economists close to the government have urged the prime minister to postpone, by perhaps 18 months, thus, giving time, they hope, for wages to catch up to prices and create a less painful kind of inflation. \u201cWe need to prioritize economic growth,\u201d Kozo Yamamoto, a lawmaker in Mr. Abe\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party who helped plan the stimulus policies, said in an interview.Most of Japan\u2019s business and political leaders are lined up on the other side of the debate, citing potential danger to the country\u2019s creditworthiness if financial markets conclude the country is turning away from fiscal discipline. The powerful finance ministry, corporate executives, bankers and even the largest opposition party favor going ahead as planned. Sadayuki Sakakibara, chairman of Keidanren, the lobby group that represents Japan\u2019s biggest companies, has called the tax increase a \u201cnational issue\u201d that \u201ccan\u2019t be avoided.\u201dEven Mr. Kuroda, the Bank of Japan governor, is pushing for the tax rise to go ahead. He is doing so despite complaints that it will widen the gap between wages and prices and discourage the precise thing he is trying to foster, consumer spending.A finance ministry official before he became a central banker, he views the tax as essential to addressing the debt, which relative to the size of the economy is the largest in the world. By printing money freely, he is creating what he hopes will be a cushion against its economic impact.\u201cIf there were a loss of confidence in the government\u2019s finances,\u201d Mr. Kuroda said last week, \u201cit would be extremely difficult to deal with.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mayor\u2019s Race Could Alter Balance of Political Power in Taiwan", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 A doctor and political novice is favored to win Taipei\u2019s mayoral election on Saturday, one of many races in which Taiwan\u2019s governing party faces the prospect of its most serious setback in years.A victory for the blunt-talking, 55-year-old physician, Ko Wen-je, would be a sharp defeat for the governing party in a city long considered its stronghold, and in a job that often becomes a springboard to the presidency.The local elections come halfway through President Ma Ying-jeou\u2019s final term as president, during a year in which his governing Kuomintang, or Chinese Nationalist Party, has faced large-scale protests over its pursuit of closer ties with China, and food-safety scandals that have inflamed antigovernment anger.In the race for Taipei mayor, the governing party\u2019s candidate is Sean Lien, a 44-year-old former investment banker whose father, Lien Chan, served as Taiwan\u2019s premier and vice president. While his connections helped him win the party\u2019s nomination, they have done little to bolster his standing against Mr. Ko.Mr. Ko is running as an independent, though his political views generally align with the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, the main opposition party. The D.P.P. is not fielding a candidate in the race and has thrown its support behind him. His campaign has focused on encouraging civic participation and trying to transcend the divide between the Kuomintang and those who favor closer ties with China, and the D.P.P. and others who support an independent Taiwan.Accentuating his image as an outsider, Mr. Ko eschews a suit and tie for a collared shirt in most campaign appearances. His inexperience in government led many to believe that his lead in opinion polls would eventually evaporate in the face of the Kuomintang\u2019s well-developed party apparatus.But Mr. Lien, who also lacks government experience, has failed to capitalize on his opponent\u2019s weaknesses, despite his political pedigree.He has emphasized economic themes, touting his investment experience and work as chairman of the company that manages Taipei\u2019s smartcard system for public transit and other services. But his family connections and personal wealth have hurt him at a time when the public is increasingly concerned about the gap between rich and poor, said Lin Jih-wen, a political scientist at Academia Sinica, a state-funded research institute in Taipei.\u201cHe\u2019s too young, too inexperienced and doesn\u2019t seem to understand the ordinary lives of people in Taipei,\u201d Mr. Lin said.Elections in Taiwan can be difficult to predict, with opinion polls sometimes overstating the support for the D.P.P. and other pro-independence parties. Nonetheless, Mr. Ko has consistently maintained a double-digit lead.The race has implications beyond Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital and largest city. Each of the last three presidents has previously served as mayor of Taipei, and the election has included national concerns, especially Taiwan\u2019s relationship with China, which claims Taiwan as its own.Mr. Lien, who met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in Beijing last year, has been attacked by the opposition for favoring stronger ties with China.\u201cLien is simply unable to convince that he is anything but what he is, a privileged princeling from one of Taiwan\u2019s richest and politically powerful families,\u201d said Jonathan Sullivan, a China scholar at the University of Nottingham. \u201cLien\u2019s halfhearted attempts to appear down to earth have been followed by gaffes revealing his status and thinking.\u201dAfter coming under repeated attack for his family\u2019s wealth, Mr. Lien responded in a campaign brochure that the Buddha \u201cwas a prince who enlightened people.\u201d While his point was that family background did not predetermine policy, his comparing himself to the Buddha was seen as grandiose.Mr. Ko is not immune to similar criticism. As chairman of National Taiwan University Hospital\u2019s traumatology department, he too is a member of Taiwan\u2019s elite. And he has been gaffe-prone in campaign appearances, notably when he said one young female candidate\u2019s appearance made her better suited to working as a receptionist. He later apologized for the comment.\u201cAlthough he is not a seasoned politician, Ko has deftly rolled with the punches and has shown an innate skill in turning Lien\u2019s attacks against himself,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.During a televised debate, when asked whether a candidate who had pro-independence leanings could serve as a high-level state official, Mr. Ko responded that it was the \u201ccross-strait compradors,\u201d the Kuomintang officials pursuing closer ties with China, whose patriotism should be questioned.\u00a0Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Final Dash on an Iran Deal ", "Date": "2014-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAfter a year of work, the major powers and Iran face a Nov. 24 deadline for completing an agreement that would limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions. While a final round of negotiations is set for this week, high-level talks in Oman last week apparently failed to achieve a breakthrough on important issues, leading to growing speculation that the deadline will not be met. Since nobody wants to see the process collapse, there is talk about extending the negotiations and even codifying, in broad terms, the considerable progress that has been achieved already. A successful agreement offers benefits for both sides. Sanctions on Iran would be lifted gradually, bolstering the country\u2019s economy and opening the door to Iran\u2019s reintegration into the international community. With proper verification, an agreement would reassure the world that Iran is interested only in nuclear energy, not in a nuclear weapon, and could make possible cooperation on other challenges, including the fight against the Islamic State.The diplomatic obstacles lie mainly with Iran and its refusal to reduce its ability to produce enriched uranium, which is used in power reactors and medical research and, in higher concentrations, in nuclear weapons. The consequences of failure to reach an accord would be serious, including the weakening of President Hassan Rouhani of Iran and his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who count as moderates in Iran, and who, like President Obama, have taken a political risk to try to make an agreement happen.

{"Headline": "Obama Aims to Lift the Global Economy, and Maybe Himself", "Date": "2014-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Facing a Republican resurgence that is blocking virtually every policy move, President Obama will arrive at an international economic meeting in Australia this weekend hoping to press European and Asian leaders to get their economies moving again \u2014 and perhaps buoy his own foundering presidency.But allies may be less than open to that message if they question Mr. Obama\u2019s ability to deliver his own promises in a reordered Washington.Administration officials understand that a strengthening economic recovery at home could lift the president\u2019s approval ratings \u2014 and his power \u2014 as he faces a fully Republican Congress for the first time next year. Economic issues where there is some common ground between the White House and Republican lawmakers \u2014 particularly trade agreements, a tax code overhaul and a budget deal \u2014 offer the brightest possibilities for achievements in the president\u2019s final two years. All three would be far easier to achieve if the economic recovery gathers steam.But faltering growth in Europe and marked slowdowns in Japan and China are the latest dark clouds on a horizon that never seems fully clear for Mr. Obama.\u201cWe\u2019re not about to have a meltdown that will spill over into the United States and bring us into recession,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said on Wednesday in a telephone interview on his way to the summit meeting of the Group of 20 largest economic powers. \u201cOn the other hand, the global economy is highly interconnected, and if things are really bad in Europe and Japan, if there\u2019s a real slowdown in China, that\u2019s a headwind in the United States that we don\u2019t need.\u201dMr. Lew and Mr. Obama will arrive at the G-20 meeting in Brisbane in a familiar position: pressing nations to raise their spending and monetary levers while struggling to secure their own economic policies. The president\u2019s first G-20 summit \u2014 in London in 2009 \u2014 was dominated by a push for fiscal stimulus and monetary easing.This weekend, he will be back at it.\u201cThe world is counting on the U.S. economy to drive the global recovery,\u201d Mr. Lew said in an address on Wednesday in Seattle to the World Affairs Council. \u201cBut the global economy cannot prosper broadly relying on the United States to be the importer of first and last resort, nor can it rely on the United States to grow fast enough to make up for weak growth in major world economies.\u201dThe question is, will they listen, especially in light of Mr. Obama\u2019s electoral rebuke this month and the coming Republican Senate?\u201cPart of his task is to persuade his G-20 colleagues that he will be successful in adopting a pro-growth agenda in the United States,\u201d said Dan Price, who was President George W. Bush\u2019s liaison to the G-20. \u201cAnd there will be questions put to him as to how the recent elections play to that agenda.\u201dMr. Price said that Mr. Obama\u2019s progress on trade this week with leaders of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and an agreement with China on information technologies \u201care certainly cause for optimism.\u201dMr. Lew was clear that times have changed. In 2009, the global economy was sliding further into the Great Recession, led by the United States\u2019 financial crisis. Would-be allies in the president\u2019s pitch for stimulus were fuming that Washington dared dictate a policy response to a crisis of Wall Street\u2019s making.This year, he said, \u201cthat has flipped dramatically.\u201dMoreover, there is no economic crisis driving action, only political bickering at home and abroad, Mr. Bergsten said.Mr. Lew laid out the president\u2019s plan to keep America\u2019s recovery on track: more spending on education, job training, research, manufacturing and infrastructure; a hike in the minimum wage; an expansion of the earned-income tax credit for low-wage workers; and a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system. None of that is new, and none of it was adopted, even in a Democrat-controlled Senate.For Republicans, the Treasury secretary did nod to conservative priorities in his Seattle speech and reiterated the administration\u2019s pledge to \u201cmodernize our broken business tax system\u201d and \u201cshore up our retirement and health care security programs to make sure they meet the obligations of future generations.\u201dIn his interview, Mr. Lew pointed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade accord and a business tax overhaul as areas where the administration will seek \u201cserious negotiations.\u201d He said he had already reached out to the incoming Republican chairmen and ranking Democrats on key Senate committees.\u201cI\u2019m optimistic,\u201d he said.But his choicest words in the Seattle speech were for Europe and Japan. He pressed for \u201cresolute action\u201d by Europeans \u2014 fiscal stimulus, looser monetary policy and structural reforms to their economies \u2014 \u201cto reduce the risk that the region could fall into a deeper slump.\u201d\u201cThe world cannot afford a European lost decade,\u201d he said.He also took a jab at Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan for stepping back from his fiscal stimulus, implicitly urging him to back away from a sales tax increase looming over Japan just as the United States is imploring governments to raise domestic consumer demand. Mr. Abe has to decide in the coming weeks whether to move forward next October with a second sales tax increase, which was approved by a previous government. The first increase in April crimped the economy, with Japan\u2019s gross domestic product contracting by more than 7 percent in the second quarter.Opposition to the tax increase is mounting, with economists and lawmakers close to the government urging its postponement. \u201cWe need to prioritize economic growth,\u201d said Kozo Yamamoto, a lawmaker in Mr. Abe\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party.Just off his bruising losses in this month\u2019s midterm elections, Mr. Obama appears eager to get the credit for a quickening economic recovery on the international stage that voters appear loath to give him back home, in large part because the vast majority of Americans have not enjoyed much of the bounty since the economy began growing again more than five years ago.Mr. Lew, focusing on the more positive developments, boasted of private sector job growth that has added 10.5 million new jobs over four and a half years of unbroken growth.\u201cWe have created more jobs since the pre-crisis peak than Europe and Japan combined,\u201d he said in Seattle.Jonathan Soble contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ed Miliband, British Labour Party Leader, Denies Rumblings of Discontent", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Ed Miliband, the leader of Britain\u2019s center-left opposition, should be looking forward to the general elections six months from now: His Labour Party holds a narrow lead in most opinion polls over the Conservatives, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, who have lost two lawmakers in defections to a populist right-wing party.Instead, after a series of political missteps, Mr. Miliband finds himself confronting mounting discontent within his party and widespread reports of a plot against his leadership.No Labour lawmakers have called publicly for him to step down yet, and there is no obvious potential successor. But several days of unfavorable newspaper headlines reflect growing disappointment with the performance of a politician who is consistently less popular than his party, according to opinion surveys.After the BBC reported on Thursday that his leadership had been questioned at a meeting of Labour lawmakers from northwest England, Mr. Miliband dismissed the rumblings of internal unrest, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t accept that this matter arises.\u201dThe reports of a crisis of confidence in the Labour Party come at a time of unusual flux in British politics, with all three mainstream parties on the defensive. The populist U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP, is making inroads on the right, gaining its first seat in Parliament, and perhaps a second later this month, in by-elections caused by defections of Conservative lawmakers.UKIP, which wants to restrict immigration and withdraw Britain from the European Union, is a direct threat mainly to the Conservatives, but it is also beginning to erode the traditional support for Labour in some working-class areas.Equally worrying for Mr. Miliband is the rise of the Scottish National Party. Though its energetic referendum campaign for Scottish independence ultimately fell short, the party is threatening to capture some of Labour\u2019s 41 parliamentary seats in Scotland. Labour\u2019s leader in Scotland, Johann Lamont, resigned last month, a sign of turmoil in the ranks.Discontent has been growing since the party\u2019s fall convention, where Mr. Miliband\u2019s speech was considered a flop. Last year, Mr. Miliband had a big success when he spoke to the convention without notes and set the political agenda for weeks. This time, again speaking largely without notes, he forgot crucial passages of the speech, and his performance was mocked by critics.Some of the internal opposition to Mr. Miliband dates from his election as party leader in 2010, when he challenged and narrowly defeated his older brother, David Miliband.Ed Miliband positioned himself to the left of his brother, raising concerns among critics that he had drifted too far from the centrist, election-winning instincts of one of his predecessors as Labour Party leader, Tony Blair.The critics say Mr. Miliband is concentrating too much on the party\u2019s core voters and is hoping that, because of how Britain\u2019s electoral system favors parties whose supporters are concentrated in certain areas, Labour can win a majority in the House of Commons with about 35 percent of the total vote.The catalyst for the latest round of back-room bickering seems to have been an article in the left-leaning magazine New Statesman. The editor, Jason Cowley, wrote that Mr. Miliband is \u201cvery much an old-style Hampstead socialist,\u201d a reference to an affluent neighborhood in north London.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t really understand the lower middle class or material aspiration,\u201d Mr. Cowley wrote. He added that for Mr. Miliband, politics must seem like seminars at Oxford University, which he once attended, full of \u201celevated talk about political economy and the good society.\u201dLate on Thursday, Douglas Alexander, the party\u2019s general election coordinator, called for unity. Mr. Miliband has \u201cgot challenges,\u201d he told the BBC, \u201cbut all of us have got challenges in every political party, and every one of us in the Labour Party has to reflect the reality that divided parties lose elections.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Road Test of Alternative Fuel Visions", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Remember the hydrogen car?A decade ago, President George W. Bush espoused the environmental promise of cars running on hydrogen, the universe\u2019s most abundant element. \u201cThe first car driven by a child born today,\u201d he said in his 2003 State of the Union speech, \u201ccould be powered by hydrogen, and pollution-free.\u201dThat changed under Steven Chu, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who was President Obama\u2019s first Secretary of Energy. \u201cWe asked ourselves, \u2018Is it likely in the next 10 or 15, 20 years that we will convert to a hydrogen-car economy?\u2019\u201d Dr. Chu said then. \u201cThe answer, we felt, was \u2018no.\u2019\u00a0\u201d The administration slashed funding for hydrogen fuel cell research. Attention shifted to battery electric vehicles, particularly those made by the headline-grabbing Tesla Motors. The hydrogen car, it appeared, had died. And many did not mourn its passing, particularly those who regarded the auto companies\u2019 interest in hydrogen technology as a stunt to signal that they cared about the environment while selling millions of highly profitable gas guzzlers.Except the companies, including General Motors, Honda, Toyota, Daimler and Hyundai, persisted.After many years and billions of dollars of research and development, hydrogen cars are headed to the showrooms.Hyundai has been leasing the hydrogen-powered Tucson sport utility, which it describes as the world\u2019s first mass-produced fuel cell car, since June, for a $2,999 down payment, and $499 a month. (That includes the hydrogen. A lease on a gas-powered Tucson is about half as much.) This week, Toyota is introducing a sedan called Mirai, which means \u201cfuture\u201d in Japanese. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer that I think the next evolution is to go to fuel-cell based technologies,\u201d said Nihar Patel, the vice president for North American business strategy at Toyota, at a conference here last week.California is spending millions of dollars to build hydrogen fueling stations, aiming to increase the network from nine today to 50 by the end of next year, mostly around Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. Japan and Germany, two other early markets for hydrogen cars, are building a similar number of stations.\u201cWe really believe that we\u2019re at a turning point here,\u201d Mr. Patel said.Battery electric cars and fuel cell cars are, at their cores, both electric cars with the inherent advantages of electric motors \u2014 jack rabbit acceleration, near silence and zero tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases. The difference is where the electricity comes from.Instead of storing their charge in batteries, the fuel cells in hydrogen cars are miniature power plants, generating a flow of electricity in the chemical reaction of combining hydrogen and oxygen into water. The oxygen comes from the air; the hydrogen, compressed at 10,000 pounds per square inch, is stored in tanks.The exhaust from the tailpipe? Water that is clean enough to drink.Toyota officials talk of selling a \u201cportfolio\u201d of vehicles that includes hybrids and battery electric cars. But hydrogen fuel cells are front and center. Not surprisingly, the strategy has its critics, particularly from competing Tesla. Elon Musk, the billionaire chief executive of Tesla, mocks fuel cells as \u201cfool cells\u201d that will lose in the marketplace to battery electric cars like his. Battery electrics are more efficient than fuel cells and are cheaper to operate. And there are currently many more places to plug in than places to top off a tank of hydrogen.But battery electric cars have major technological shortcomings, too. They take time to recharge, they do not go as far as hydrogen cars between refueling, and the batteries required for larger vehicles make building them impractical, because the current lithium-ion batteries simply cannot hold enough energy to take larger vehicles over longer distances. In California, Toyota sells an electric Rav4 sport utility vehicle that is powered by Tesla batteries and has a range of only 103 miles. That collaboration was limited to 2,600 vehicles and ends this year. After a point, adding more batteries has diminishing returns; the additional power just goes to lugging the additional weight.That is why most battery electric cars have been small, like the Nissan Leaf, aimed at commuters. For batteries to be practical in minivans, pickup trucks and larger S.U.V.s, \u201cthe next chemistry has to be better,\u201d said Craig Scott, the manager of advanced technologies at Toyota USA. \u201cNo one even knows what that chemistry is.\u201dHydrogen fuel cells readily scale up, even to trucks and buses.A kilogram of hydrogen contains as much chemical energy as a gallon of gasoline, but fuel cells are more efficient than internal combustion engines, so fuel-cell cars like the Mirai have a 300-mile range, comparable to present-day gasoline cars. Filling up at a hydrogen pump takes about the same few minutes as filling a tank of gas, instead of hours plugged in to an outlet. Even Tesla\u2019s high-powered superchargers need 20 minutes to give a Model S half a charge.\u201cIt\u2019s the technology that lets people act the way they normally drive without making any compromises,\u201d Mr. Scott said.The questions surrounding hydrogen fuel cells have always been \u201cHow expensive?\u201d and \u201cWhere does the hydrogen come from?\u201dBuilding a fuel cell small enough to fit in a car, operate for years and not cost a million dollars posed challenges that the carmakers say they have conquered.A fleet of 119 fuel cell-powered Chevrolet Equinoxes that General Motors introduced as a demonstration project in 2007 has covered more than three million miles, with the odometers on some of the vehicles passing 120,000 miles.\u201cSince 2010, we\u2019ve gotten to where we\u2019ve checked off most of the technological challenges,\u201d said Charles E. Freese, the head of G.M.\u2019s fuel cell efforts.The cost has come down, too, in large part from reducing the amount of expensive platinum required. The platinum is used as a catalyst to bring the oxygen and hydrogen together. Mr. Patel said the fuel cell in the Toyota Mirai was smaller than the previous generation and 95 percent cheaper. Nonetheless, Toyota likely will lose money on each Mirai it sells, but it also initially lost money on the Prius, its now-successful electric-gasoline hybrid. The fuel-cell market will start small. Toyota said it could build 700 Mirais next year. Hyundai said its production line has the capacity to build a few hundred fuel-cell Tucsons a year. About 60 Tucsons will be leased in Southern California by the end of the year. As economies of scale grow and the technologies improve, the hope is that fuel cell cars will follow the trajectory of the Prius, which evolved from a money-losing oddball to a profitable mainstream offering. \u201cIf that\u2019s an example of a test, we want to repeat that test going forward,\u201d Mr. Patel said.Some of the most vociferous objections to hydrogen cars have been made over environmental concerns.Hydrogen advocates say that in California, where a large percentage of electricity already comes from solar and wind, hydrogen cars would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But electric-battery supporters dispute that analysis and say bigger gains would come from putting the electricity directly into batteries. Skeptics also doubt that billions of dollars would be spent building a nationwide hydrogen infrastructure.Dr. Chu, now a professor at Stanford University, is still among the skeptics \u2014 he, like Mr. Musk, sees electric batteries as the more promising path. But he said advances in solar and wind technologies made producing hydrogen by splitting water more economical. \u201cI began to see more possibilities of clean hydrogen production,\u201d he said in an interview last month.Other technologies could emerge, too. A hydrogen station in Fountain Valley, about 45 minutes from downtown Los Angeles, is in front of a wastewater treatment plant, because the hydrogen comes from human waste.

{"Headline": "At Spain\u2019s Door, a Welcome Mat for Entrepreneurs ", "Date": "2014-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast year, after more than a decade in Silicon Valley, Stacia Carr helped sell the company she was running and went looking for a change of pace.\u201cThe Bay Area is supersaturated,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very expensive; it\u2019s hypercompetitive.\u201d After a friend connected her with I\u00f1igo Amoribieta, a former chief executive of Groupon Spain, Ms. Carr and Mr. Amoribieta started talking about creating an online video business together that would be based in Madrid, his hometown.Ms. Carr, 42, a Californian who has traveled extensively in Europe, long dreamed of living and working there. But as the founder of a start-up company and as an American citizen, she assumed that it would be \u201cnext to impossible\u201d to get a work permit at a time when many European economies were struggling to rebound from the financial crisis.Then she learned of a law that Spain\u2019s government passed in September 2013 to help domestic businesses and to woo foreign talent and investment. It included a visa category for foreign entrepreneurs, requiring them to have little more than a government-vetted business plan, health insurance and enough money to support themselves while living in Spain.\u201cI thought the entrepreneurship visa was exactly what I needed,\u201d she said.Vidnex offers an online tool that allows fitness instructors to teach classes remotely, streaming live video to their students. The classes are interactive, not prerecorded, with the student and the instructor able to see each other and talk in real time. Students can\u2019t see their classmates.Setting up the business in Spain, Ms. Carr said, was more challenging and required more formal documentation than she had expected. And getting residency presented challenges. One of the first applicants to try to use the law\u2019s new entrepreneur visa, she found government workers unprepared to answer her questions. It was harder because she didn\u2019t speak Spanish, but Mr. Amoribieta helped her navigate the bureaucracy by preparing paperwork and scheduling appointments, including one meeting in which officials assumed that Ms. Carr was a personal trainer using the Vidnex service rather than a co-founder.Still, she managed to gain approval for her renewable, two-year entrepreneur residency permit in March, about a month after she applied under the new rules. Ms. Carr acknowledged that Spain, a country where unemployment reached a record high of about 27 percent last year, might seem an unlikely place to start a business. But when compared with European start-up magnets like London and Berlin, Spanish cities like Madrid and Barcelona have lower costs and fewer competitors \u2014 and still have sufficient talent to get started, she said. Technical expertise can cost a quarter of what it would in Silicon Valley, Mr. Amoribieta said.The new law, known as the Ley de Emprendedores, is Spain\u2019s latest effort to help domestic businesses and make the country more attractive to wealthy and talented people outside the European Union who want to start businesses, invest or work in the country. Billed by the government as reforms that would help create jobs at a time of high unemployment, the legislation created five visa categories, covering investors who buy at least 500,000 euros (about $625,000) of real estate; entrepreneurs who plan to establish businesses; highly skilled professionals; researchers, scientists and teachers; and employees and trainees. Once approved, recipients are allowed to move freely through most European Union countries.Visa decisions are promised within 10 working days, and residence permit decisions in 20. Processing is combined for married couples and their children.\u201cThe Spanish law is much more inviting and much simpler than England\u2019s law, Canada\u2019s law and France\u2019s law,\u201d Mr. Novo said. \u201cFor example, entrepreneurs don\u2019t need to show a minimum investment in their business.\u201dYet so far, even though the law has been in effect for more than a year, fewer than 100 foreign entrepreneurs have been granted residency through it. Some critics have questioned both its impact and whether its measures go far enough. There is also a possibility its appeal could be diminished by tax reform legislation that was approved last week by Parliament and is scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 1 after King Felipe VI signs it.But the exit tax will apply to entrepreneurs only if they stay for 10 years and then claim tax residency in a different country. \u201cThis should not hamper entrepreneurs from coming to Spain,\u201d said \u00c1lvaro de la V\u00eda, a professor of tax law at IE University, adding that the United States and some European countries had similar laws and that more were considering adopting them.In total, about 3,800 foreigners, including investors, professionals and their family members, have received residency via the new immigration rules, according to the Economy Ministry, and more than \u20ac280 million has been invested, primarily in real estate. An additional \u20ac265 million has been pledged for business projects.Jaime Garc\u00eda-Legaz, the Spanish secretary of state for the economy, said that the immigration reforms were working as intended and that he expected the number of investors and entrepreneurs to increase gradually, \u201cas it has in other countries which put similar rules in effect.\u201dChile\u2019s effort, started as a pilot program in 2010, has attracted nearly 2,000 entrepreneurs, whose businesses have raised more than $100 million in financing. The Chilean government has not yet conducted a study of the program\u2019s economic impact, but Sebasti\u00e1n Vidal, executive director of Start-Up Chile, explained that while its short-term mission was \u201ccultural,\u201d he expected the long-term effects to improve the economy significantly. Mr. Wadhwa described Chile\u2019s initiative as the world\u2019s most aggressive effort to lure entrepreneurs and said it was putting Chile on the map as a destination for start-ups.And so did Ms. Carr and Mr. Amoribieta. They applied to Enisa in May and received approval in early October for up to \u20ac75,000. Vidnex, they said, was released to the public in September and is gaining traction among dozens of fitness instructors, mostly in Spain, who use the service to teach their classes online. Yet no matter where it is and how much help it gets, a start-up company still has to prove that its business model works, and Mr. Amoribieta acknowledged that the sales process had been slow. \u201cWe are starting to realize,\u201d he said, \u201cthat while the technology is here to work out remotely, it will take time for people to come around to this concept.\u201dBut based on its expenses, he said, Vidnex has \u201cplenty of financial runway\u201d and a plan for future hiring, contingent on sales growth. Some of those new employees, he said, may come through the new law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Same Candidates as in \u201910, Race for Connecticut Governor Is Again Tight ", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bitter race for governor of Connecticut was too close to call early on Wednesday, but Gov. Dannel P. Malloy appeared to open a lead against the Republican challenger, Thomas C. Foley, with results still coming in from the state\u2019s heavily Democratic cities.Speaking in Hartford after midnight, Mr. Malloy said he was confident of victory.If he succeeds in defeating Mr. Foley, Mr. Malloy, a Democrat, will have staved off a Republican advance on a heavily Democratic state still struggling to emerge from one of the worst economic contractions in the country. A win for Mr. Malloy in the often nasty rematch of a razor-thin 2010 contest with Mr. Foley would lift the national profile of an incumbent who has emerged as a stalwart champion of liberal initiatives like a raised minimum wage and mandatory paid sick leave.The governor\u2019s prospects were aided by the sometimes listless campaign of Mr. Foley, a former private-equity executive whose business experience and opposition to gun control resonated with some discontented voters but ultimately failed to offset a dearth of policy proposals.In a repeat of ballot problems in 2010 at polls in Bridgeport, some residents trying to vote on Tuesday morning in Hartford, the state capital, were turned away when polls opened as much as 90 minutes late. Calling the delays \u201cintolerable,\u201d a Superior Court judge ruled that two Hartford precincts could keep polling stations open until 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday, an extra half-hour.Soon after, the secretary of the state, Denise Merrill, filed a complaint with the State Elections Enforcement Commission that alleged \u201cgross misconduct\u201d by the Hartford registrars of voters and raised the possibility of criminal charges.In a reminder of the high stakes of the race for Democratic Party leaders, President Obama called in to a local public radio program on Tuesday afternoon to try to stoke turnout for Mr. Malloy. The governor has emerged as one of the president\u2019s strongest statehouse allies this term. On Tuesday, he depended on winning over the kinds of disaffected Democrats and independents who were undoing Democratic candidates in many other states.Mr. Malloy sought to cast himself as a sensible steward of a stalled economy who, despite inheriting a $3.7 billion deficit, saved jobs for state employees and increased financing for low-performing schools. His stature grew after the mass shooting in a Newtown elementary school, which prompted him to seek and sign a gun control bill in 2013 that banned many models of assault-style weapons and large ammunition magazines and required background checks.Toni Lupinacci, a registered Republican and mother of two from Stamford, crossed party lines to vote for Mr. Malloy because of his gun control stance \u201cfirst and foremost,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cNone of us want to see any more tragedies.\u201dEven beyond the gun control bill, Mr. Malloy, the state\u2019s first Democratic governor since 1986, made Connecticut a laboratory for progressive policy. Connecticut became the first state in the country to heed Mr. Obama\u2019s call for a higher minimum wage, enacted mandatory paid sick leave and ended the death penalty.But quarrels between Mr. Malloy and Mr. Foley over the state\u2019s economic growth pushed many of those priorities to the margins, and often gave way to a sense of personal animosity between the candidates. Despite strong job growth in recent months, Mr. Malloy struggled to dispel the sense that he had failed to revive the economy in a state whose unemployment rate still surpasses the national average. His often dour manner, combined with Mr. Foley\u2019s plodding style, left some voters resigned to a halfhearted choice.Frances Little, a school bus monitor in Hartford, called Mr. Malloy \u201cthe lesser of two evils.\u201d Referring to the governor\u2019s efforts to keep a stalled economy afloat, Ms. Little added, \u201cI guess they do the best they can and it doesn\u2019t always work out.\u201dMr. Malloy, an energetic and occasionally combative former Brooklyn prosecutor, seemed to complicate his re-election prospects soon after taking office by fighting for a historic tax increase and $1.6 billion in concessions from public-sector unions in 2011. Those measures earned him constant derision from Mr. Foley, who battered the governor as a stiff and dogmatic incumbent who had gotten his chance and did not deserve another. For his part, Mr. Foley appealed to voters struggling to reconcile themselves to lowered economic prospects, by promising tax cuts and a friendlier climate for businesses. To the end, he often avoided sketching out the details of how he would pay for those proposals, prompting charges that he was unprepared for the job.Roughly $15 million in outside spending flowed into the state, much of it in advertising that intensified the negative tone of the race. The wrangling veered into topics as varied as the names given to each candidate\u2019s boat and the amount of taxes each one paid. Unfazed, Mr. Malloy often hit back, drawing attention to Mr. Foley\u2019s handling of unions during his private-equity career.As voters grew more bored of Mr. Foley\u2019s campaign and averse to his past business practices, Mr. Malloy clawed back from a significant deficit in the polls. He weathered frequent visits to the state by national Republican leaders, like Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who were eager to show their clout among the state\u2019s moderate voters. In pushing for a long series of debates, Mr. Malloy took an unusual step for an incumbent. But it seemed to pay dividends for the governor, as he nimbly turned attacks back on Mr. Foley and elicited damaging answers on issues like gun control and climate change.Mr. Malloy was also bolstered by a robust get-out-the-vote effort by union members, who came back to the governor\u2019s side after tense negotiations over wage freezes in 2011.

{"Headline": "Florida Election Highlights", "Date": "2014-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn national contests, Florida is the purplest of states: It has been carried by the winner in five straight presidential races, and it was the most closely contested state in 2000 and 2012. But at the state level, Republicans have had the upper hand for years, and they won every statewide race this year and kept control of the Legislature.Four years ago, Mr. Scott made his first run for public office as a fiscally conservative technocrat, with experience as a venture capitalist and an executive of a hospital chain, and in a boon year for Republicans, he eked out a narrow win.Polls showed that in the final weeks, when the race was too close to call, many voters were unhappy with their choices and unsure of their allegiances.Each party knocked off one incumbent, further reinforcing Florida\u2019s status as an unpredictable swing state.A large majority of voters supported a measure that would have made Florida the first Southern state to legalize marijuana for medical use.

{"Headline": "Five Economic Trends to Be Thankful For", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWelcome SignsThey say the news media likes to dwell on the bad, swapping silver linings for dark clouds. And in this miserable year of the Islamic State, Ebola and Ferguson, Mo., there have been plenty of dark clouds for us to report about.But Thanksgiving is a time to look at happier trends, and fortunately the flow of economic news has offered quite a few of those in 2014.That is translating into cheaper gasoline, with average prices down 24 percent, or 89 cents a gallon, since late April.Americans are also enjoying cheaper natural gas, fuel oil and electricity, which have common roots in the falling commodity prices.This savings will tend to flow directly into other forms of consumption, much as a tax cut would. Every dollar not spent to keep cars filled up is available to buy something else, which is helping prop up spending and economic growth in the final months of 2014.Employers added 2.64 million jobs to their payrolls in the year ended in October, compared with 2.2 million in the year ended in February. For years, the story of the economy has been one of steady improvement at a slow rate. But this year, the job market is showing genuine acceleration, which has helped push the unemployment rate to 5.8 percent in October, from 6.7 percent last December. The improved job market isn\u2019t showing up in significantly higher wages for now, but there are some signs that may soon change, including \u2026In other words, Americans appear more confident that they can find a better job than they did even a few months ago, giving them more freedom to escape terrible hours, an obnoxious boss or a too-low salary for something else. That could be a harbinger of workers having stronger leverage in pay negotiations in the months ahead.The good news is that it didn\u2019t continue. The Case-Shiller index of home prices in 20 major metropolitan areas was up 4.9 percent in the 12 months ended in September, compared with more than 13 percent in 2013.That\u2019s bad news for anybody looking to flip their house but is more in line with the type of home appreciation that is sustainable in the longer run \u2014 higher than inflation, but only slightly.Also nice to see: There are big differences between different metro areas, with Miami-area home prices rising 10.3 percent and Cleveland prices rising 0.8 percent, with the rest somewhere in between. That\u2019s a sign that prices are being driven by local market conditions, not broad forces of boom and bust like those from 2000 to 2013.Across the major categories of debt, including mortgages, credit cards and the like, debt levels are now rising again. Not at the kind of rapid rates that would signal a buildup of major new risks, but decisively upward.Total household debt levels are at $11.7 trillion in the third quarter, the economists write, up 0.7 percent from the third quarter but still well below the $12.7 trillion peak in 2008.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Olafur Eliasson on How to Do Good Art", "Date": "2014-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the eve of his exhibition at the new Fondation Louis Vuitton, the artist discusses his work \u2014 which includes a school, an architecture practice, a charity, a cookbook and a herd of Icelandic sheep, and which is meant to make the world a better place. Really.A lot of Eliasson\u2019s works are like this: irruptions of the elemental into a museum setting, as if the building had sprung some mythic leak. Others are harder to convey in a high-concept pitch. When I visited the studio, Eliasson was working on a commission for the Fondation Louis Vuitton, a major new museum that opened in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris last month. In addition to taking over the ground floor for the Fondation\u2019s inaugural temporary show, he would be constructing a permanent \u201cgrotto\u201d from which the Frank Gehry-designed building could be flatteringly viewed. Although Eliasson showed me plenty of sketches and models for the exhibition, I never quite formed a clear idea of what he was planning to do, apart from that it involved mirrors and curves and tinted glass. This side of Eliasson\u2019s practice takes the form of a highly refined fun house, subjecting you to experiments in human perception that don\u2019t sound like much until you see them firsthand. The intended effect often seems to be a pre-intellectual wonder, so that you will have basically the same experience as the 5-year-old next to you. There\u2019s a reason why Eliasson feels an imperative to appeal to the broadest possible audience. He believes that in normal life we have a tendency to hurry along on autopilot, seldom questioning our deeper assumptions. Art, by goosing the senses, can make us more conscious of our positions in time, space, hierarchy, society, culture, the planet. In the long run, this heightened consciousness will result in change for the better \u2014 emotionally, socially, politically.In other words, Eliasson has a faith in the improving power of art that has been out of fashion since Victorian times. But his ambitions aren\u2019t bounded by his studio. He is on friendly terms with Bill Gates, Kofi Annan and Michael Bloomberg, and regularly attends the World Economic Forum in Davos to discuss public policy with the people who make it. \u201cI don\u2019t go there to meet world leaders,\u201d he joked. \u201cI go to become a world leader!\u201d In fact, he already talks like a politician much of the time, with a habit of disappearing into a haze of generalities and wonk-speak and anecdotes of uncertain relevance. The concepts he draws on \u2014 inclusivity and engagement and trust and so on \u2014 seem to have been filtered to ensure that you could no more be offended by his statements than you could be offended by the colored lights he puts in museums. Yes, he has given a TED talk.And yet the longer I spent with Eliasson, the harder I found it to cling to my cynicism, because he\u2019s such a good advertisement for sincerity. One of Eliasson\u2019s friends, the author Jonathan Safran Foer, told me over the phone that he found spending time with Eliasson \u201coverwhelming, whether overwhelming in the sense of at times feeling almost too much, or overwhelming in the sense of being really moving. You sit down with Olafur for a meal and he picks up the fork and stares at it for a moment and you think, Oh my god, he\u2019s either inventing a new fork or wondering how to get forks to people who don\u2019t have forks. \u201d He added: \u201cAfter I\u2019ve spent an hour with him I feel like I need a nap, but it\u2019s because he has more curiosity than anyone I\u2019ve ever met, and a greater belief in a person\u2019s ability to be useful and to change things. Somehow he lives his entire life with the urgency of someone who just walked out of the doctor\u2019s office with a dire prognosis.\u201dEliasson has 90 people working for him. Few of them have job titles. Four days a week they all eat a healthy vegetarian lunch together in the light-filled canteen upstairs, with a rotating schedule for washing the dishes afterward. Initially, I found the atmosphere at the studio rather too good to be true, like a hippie cult before night falls. But when I joined Eliasson for lunch on my second day at the studio, I sat there eating my roasted carrots and enviously contemplating how much better my life would be if I, too, received that bounty of vegetables and sunlight and intelligent chatter. Sebastian Behmann, who heads Eliasson\u2019s architecture practice, told me that you can track how long someone has worked at Studio Olafur Eliasson by how much healthier they look every year (and indeed many people have stayed on for a decade or more). Last year, Studio Olafur Eliasson published its own 368-page cookbook of sustainable vegetarian recipes.This is just one of the unpredictable byproducts of the studio, which often resembles a sort of ongoing Apollo project. Others have included the art school, a full-scale architecture practice, a series of publications, a charity and a herd of Icelandic sheep. As motley as these pursuits may sound, Eliasson would argue that they all emerge from a single mind-set, and that they\u2019ve all been made viable by his years of practical experience as an artist. \u201cIf you can make a show in Venice, which is the most difficult damned thing one can do, not just because working with Italians is a mess, but also because you\u2019re in a city on water in the middle of nowhere and getting a hammer and a nail is impossible . . . you can make a show on the moon,\u201d he told me. \u201cSo as an artist, you become an entrepreneur by definition. . . . The art world underestimates its own relevance when it insists on always staying inside the art world. Maybe one can take some of the tools, methodologies, and see if one can apply them to something outside the art world.\u201dFor instance, sheep. \u201cIt started with the financial crisis,\u201d Eliasson told me when I asked about his herd. \u201cBj\u00f6rk said everybody must think innovatively. So we started buying up lambs to rescue the Icelandic economy \u2014 but I think we ended up burdening it! My mistake was I wanted to turn it into an art project. Still, it was a nice excuse to go to the countryside and drink vodka and play with the sheep.\u201d Eliasson began breeding lambs whose meat would be particularly well-suited to Moroccan tagines, with the intention of selling diced, marinated lamb to delis in Iceland. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t convince my partners that people in Iceland would eat tagine.\u201d In the end, the lambs were slaughtered, their meat frozen and their wool knitted into 20 \u201csecular prayer mats.\u201dIf there isn\u2019t much irony at Studio Olafur Eliasson, I came to feel, it\u2019s not because irony is proscribed. Irony doesn\u2019t offend anyone and it doesn\u2019t go over anyone\u2019s head. Irony is simply not required, because the things you can achieve with crusading sincerity are self-evidently so much better. At worst, you could argue that Little Sun makes Eliasson\u2019s talk about the power of museum art look a bit vaporous by comparison. But at Studio Olafur Eliasson the distinction between art and direct intervention is barely even recognized. Hallwachs told me: \u201cOlafur\u2019s work uses media from photography to oil paint to all kinds of installations and architecture. Now business is part of the range of media as well.\u201d Eliasson told me that he was hoping to present a work at the next G7 conference that would evaluate the German public\u2019s degree of trust in Chancellor Angela Merkel and perhaps in the process inspire a renewal of the European relationship with Africa. I asked him whether, in order to achieve such an ambitious and specific political objective he would need to make a new type of work, something more targeted, more explicit. Possibly, he replied \u2014 but he would be just as likely to bring along something like \u201cRiverbed,\u201d which consists of a riparian landscape constructed inside the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art near Copenhagen from 180 tons of Icelandic bluestone. For Eliasson, art need never be marginal, and art need never be just a carrier for a message. Art can change the world with the sheer intensity of its art-ness. Or, perhaps, by helping to get the artist in a room with the energy minister of Nigeria.If Eliasson had his way, the same \u201ceveryone\u2019s invited!\u201d quality that makes his work so appealing to institutions might sometimes be pushed to extremes that would leave even those institutions flustered. Before I left the studio, I related to Eliasson something that happened to me in July last year at Warm Up, the Saturday afternoon dance party held in the courtyard of MoMA PS1. It was oppressively hot and muggy on the outdoor dance floor, and halfway through the afternoon I had the idea of going inside to spend a few minutes with \u201cYour waste of time,\u201d the piece with the chunks of ice, to cool off. Arriving at the gallery, however, my friends and I found that it had been locked for the duration of the event, so we could do no more than press ourselves against the chilly door. When I told Eliasson this story, he looked genuinely pained. \u201cWhat a pity!\u201d he kept saying. \u201cWhat a pity! I would have left that door open.\u201d But would he really have wanted drunken revelers slithering over this ancient ice that he\u2019d imported from thousands of miles away? \u201cIf the ice melts and disappears \u2014 well, maybe it\u2019s beautiful that there was once an iceberg, and then there was a party and now the iceberg is gone.\u201d He pointed out that this would have been an excellent metaphor for man-made climate change. \u201cPeople underestimate how robust art is.\u201d He added: \u201cIf we don\u2019t believe that creativity as a language can be as powerful as the language of the politicians, we would be very sad \u2014 and I would have failed. I am convinced that creativity is a fierce weapon.\u201d\u201cInside the Horizon,\u201d a specially commissioned grotto by Olafur Eliasson, is now on view at the Frank Gehry-designed Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. An exhibition of Eliasson\u2019s work, the inaugural show at the Fondation, will open on Dec. 17 and run until Feb. 16, 2015Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Immigration Fight, Republicans Explore Alternatives to a Shutdown", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Americans for Prosperity, a group founded by the billionaire Koch brothers, has held informal conversations with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill in recent weeks, cautioning them against fighting President Obama\u2019s promised executive order on immigration with a strategy that could lead to a government shutdown. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey echoed that sentiment on Monday in a private meeting of newly elected House members. And in an op-ed article, Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, urged Republican lawmakers to \u201ccarefully develop a strategy\u201d for the areas that most directly affect the economy and Americans.On Tuesday, House Republicans emerged from a closed meeting coalescing around two plans that would fight an expected executive order on immigration from Mr. Obama without fully shutting down the government.\u201cWe went down the government shutdown route a year ago. It didn\u2019t work, and I think a lot of people that recall that don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to repeat that exercise,\u201d Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot more than just a sledgehammer in the toolbox, and so let\u2019s use some of these other weapons that we have.\u201dOne option floated by Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, calls for passing his committee\u2019s broad spending bill by a Dec. 11 deadline, and then rescinding funds for Mr. Obama\u2019s executive action.The other option, proposed by Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, calls for passing most of the broad spending bill but taking out money for programs specifically related to Mr. Obama\u2019s planned immigration action and fighting the president with a short-term stand-alone measure for those particular funds.Mr. Obama could announce as soon as this week an executive order that would allow up to five million unauthorized immigrants to remain in the country and work without fear of deportation.\u201cWe want the government fully funded, but that particular area needs to be defunded,\u201d Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a government shutdown at all, but we\u2019re going to super-scalpel on that area where the president is acting illegally.\u201dRepresentative Matt Salmon, Republican of Arizona, said that his House colleagues were considering a range of options that would avoid a shutdown while fighting the president on immigration. \u201cEverything is on the table, and the speaker has committed that we\u2019re going to come up with a plan that does not allow the president to have the funding to do this,\u201d Mr. Salmon said.Their collective voice carried an unmistakable message for the more conservative Republicans in Congress: Shutting down the government would be a terrible way for the party to start its time in power.The 16-day government shutdown in 2013 over the Affordable Care Act badly damaged the Republicans\u2019 standing, and many party elders and strategists want to avoid a repeat.Speaking on the Senate floor on Monday, the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said he had been having \u201cproductive, bipartisan conversations\u201d with Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, and Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, about passing the spending bill.Some Republicans, however, including Mr. Boehner, have left the possibility of a shutdown on the table. Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, an outspoken opponent of an immigration overhaul, is readying legislation to undo whatever action the president takes, as well as to undo the protected status the president has already provided to young immigrants brought here illegally as children.\u201cI\u2019d like to find a way we can keep as much of the government operating as possible, but there\u2019s no way that this Congress should go forward with any appropriations that goes into any department that reacts to the command of the president when he commands that they violate the law or the Constitution,\u201d Mr. King said last week. \u201cSo that means that we can\u2019t fund the branches of government that would be executing his lawless, unconstitutional act, should he commit it.\u201dOn Tuesday, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, echoed a concern among his colleagues, who believe that they have a chance of passing their own immigration legislation once Republicans control both chambers next Congress \u2014\u00a0but that any unilateral action by the president would torpedo that hope.\u201cI hope he will reconsider, decide to work with us in a bipartisan, bicameral way to fix our broken immigration system,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said. \u201cIf he proceeds forward with his executive order, it will squander the best opportunity we\u2019ve had in a long time to make progress.\u201dBut even Republicans who have been outspoken critics of what they view as \u201cexecutive amnesty,\u201d as well as what they say is the president\u2019s general overstepping of his constitutional authority, said that a government shutdown was not a savvy move for the party.\u201cI\u2019m just unalterably opposed to another government shutdown. I\u2019m not going to do that to my state, and I will do everything in my power to see that we don\u2019t shut down the government,\u201d said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. \u201cThere are lots of ways we can respond, including going to court, including appropriations bills, including the Budget Act. There are lots of the things we can do. Shutting down the government should not be one of the options.\u201dEmmarie Huetteman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Government Shows Growth, After Years of Shrinking", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsTHE government is growing. Finally.Preliminary figures on the size of the United States economy indicate that in the first three quarters of 2014, the government grew at an annual rate of 1.8 percent, after adjusting for inflation.That is hardly rapid growth, but it is nonetheless a milestone. Assuming that the government sector does not shrink significantly in the current quarter, this will be the first year since 2009 that real government gross domestic product has risen at all. The figures include spending by federal, state and local governments. Government employment is also rising, albeit at a slow pace, but that is mainly because local governments are rehiring some workers laid off during the recession. Federal government employment has been basically static in recent months, and the October jobs figure was just 21,000, or 0.8 percent, lower than the year-earlier total. A major reason for the government sector\u2019s shrinking after since 2009 was a retreat in investment spending by governments since the end of the stimulus program, which pumped money into road and school construction early in the Obama administration.In each of the first three quarters of this year, government spending classified as investments amounted to 3.4 percent of G.D.P., as can be seen in the accompanying charts. Not since 1948 had there been a single quarter that low. Federal government investment in nonmilitary programs \u2014 on things like highways \u2014 fell to a 54-year low in the third quarter, at 0.63 percent of G.D.P. Military investment \u2014 on building weapon systems and military bases \u2014 fell to a 13-year low of 0.81 percent. State and local government investment, on such things as schools and sewers, edged up in the third quarter, but at 1.94 percent, it is lower than in any quarter from 1984 to 2013.Government consumption \u2014 that is, operating expenses \u2014 has fallen below 15 percent of the economy in three of the four most recent quarters. It had not been that low since 2002. Given the economic slack in the construction sector, and the decaying infrastructure in much of America, many economists have called for an increase in spending on roads and sewers. But it has not happened. In a time of austerity, delaying or canceling investment projects may be much easier politically than laying off workers or otherwise reducing current operations.The government G.D.P. figures include all the costs of operating government agencies, ranging from building schools and paying teachers to building bombs and rockets and regulating banks. They do not include government transfer payments in programs like Social Security, unemployment insurance and welfare benefits. Those payments are expected to rise during recessions, and they did.Until the Great Recession, the only times that government investment spending declined in consecutive years, after adjustment for inflation, were in the early 1950s as the country demobilized after the Korean War, and in the late 1960s, as the Vietnam War spending on weapons began to decline. In the 1950s, however, the decline in military spending was largely offset by investment in civilian projects like highways and schools. In the late 1960s, there were also declines in investment in civilian programs, as the government struggled to avoid tax increases even as war spending remained high. Because of an editing error, a summary with an earlier version of this column misstated the trend in the government sector from the end of the stimulus program of the early Obama administration until recently. It was shrinking, not rising.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Voting in the New York Region After a Dispiriting Campaign ", "Date": "2014-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySetting up the prospect of a bitter end to an already bitter contest, the Connecticut vote was complicated by reports of polling irregularities in Hartford, a city that is a key base of support for Mr. Malloy, a Democrat. The governor filed a petition to keep the polls open an extra hour, arguing that scores of people had been turned away in the morning because polling stations were not ready to open. A judge ordered that two polling places be kept open an extra half-hour. In addition to the selection of the governors in the two states, voters across the region went to the polls to decide a host of other contests that could shift the balance of power both locally and nationally. The issues driving the campaigns have ranged from serious concerns about public corruption and environmental policy to more esoteric debates, like whether the nation should return to the gold standard. The unhappy national mood, over concerns about issues like the economy and national security, was evident in dozens of interviews with voters in the New York area. Even as campaigns spent millions of dollars to blanket the airwaves with ads, many people said they were voting out of a sense of duty rather than excitement.\u201cIt\u2019s going down, the whole country,\u201d Margaret Casey, 84, said outside a polling station in Howard Beach, Queens. Ms. Casey took a dim view of the current political leaders. \u201cThey are filling their pockets with money and telling you lies,\u201d she said.Still, she voted.\u201cI\u2019m going to do my best to keep going, to do the right thing,\u201d she said. \u201cGot to have some honest people out there.\u201dHis Democratic challenger, Domenic M. Recchia Jr., has run a campaign plagued by gaffes and missteps.Suzette Salmeron, who was voting in the St. George neighborhood of Staten Island, said that despite the poor campaign run by Mr. Recchia, she could not vote for Mr. Grimm. \u201cWe have a lot of issues on Staten Island, and we need someone we can trust,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can you support an individual under that much investigation?\u201dBut others said that they would stick with Mr. Grimm. \u201cI know he\u2019s a crook, but he\u2019s good in the office,\u201d Ali Ramovic said. \u201cPlus, we\u2019ve had sleazier politicians in this borough.\u201dIn New York\u2019s race for governor, Mr. Cuomo, the Democratic incumbent, had maintained a healthy lead against his Republican challenger, Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive, in a race distinctly lacking in drama. Rosemary DeGennaro, 57, an assistant principal at a Long Island school and a Republican, said she had voted for Mr. Cuomo, but without enthusiasm.\u201cNot that I like him either,\u201d Ms. DeGennaro said. But she said she felt that Mr. Cuomo had not done a bad job and she did not want to risk change. Mr. Cuomo, who arrived with his girlfriend, Sandra Lee, to vote at the Presbyterian Church of Mount Kisco, in Westchester, sought to play down expectations for an overwhelming victory.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many people come up to me and say: \u2018I\u2019m not going to vote. You\u2019re so far out ahead,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he told reporters. Mr. Astorino kept up his criticisms of Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday as he cast his ballot at an elementary school in Hawthorne. He said the Cuomo campaign had shown itself to be \u201cvile,\u201d \u201cdesperate\u201d and \u201cpanicked.\u201dMr. Cuomo ran a relatively sedate campaign, which was cause for concern among Democrats worried that a low turnout by the party faithful could bolster the chances of Republicans running for Congress. The New York State Senate was also in play, with Democrats hoping to take back control of the legislative body, giving them even more control in deciding the agenda in Albany.Perhaps the most compelling race in the region was run in Connecticut, where Governor Malloy was engaged in a fierce battle with Thomas C. Foley, the Republican challenger.This election was expected to be similarly close, and the early problems at polling stations in Hartford were particularly worrying for Mr. Malloy. \u201cIn a community where we get 90 percent of the vote, that\u2019s concerning,\u201d he said. The importance of the race to Democrats was highlighted when President Obama called in to a Connecticut radio show on Tuesday afternoon urging people to go back to the polls if they had been unable to vote earlier.The governor has tried to cast Mr. Foley, a former private-equity executive from Greenwich, as detached from residents\u2019 economic anxieties and in thrall to right-wing interest groups, like the National Rifle Association.But despite strong job growth in recent months, Mr. Malloy continued to be received tepidly by many voters. The opportunity for Republicans to retake Mr. Malloy\u2019s seat in a deeply Democratic state drew national party leaders like Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey to Connecticut. In New Jersey, Democrats have had a hold on the Senate seats since 1978, and Senator Cory A. Booker, a former Newark mayor, looked likely to extend that record. His Republican challenger, Jeff Bell, called for a return to the gold standard, a message that did not seem to have resonated widely with voters.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a voter on Staten Island.

{"Headline": "Militant Group in Egypt Vows Loyalty to ISIS", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 They have slaughtered hundreds of Egyptian soldiers and police officers, recruited experienced fighters and staged increasingly sophisticated raids from the Western desert to the Sinai Peninsula. They have beheaded informants and killed an American in a carjacking, say Western officials familiar with intelligence reports.The affiliation could pull the militant group away from its current, almost exclusive focus on attacking Egyptian military and security forces toward the Islamic State\u2019s indiscriminate mass killings of civilians. The pledge alone could undermine the government\u2019s efforts to win the trust of Western tourists, a vital source of hard currency.The decision injects the Islamic State into the most populous and historically most influential Arab nation, a milestone weeks into an American-led bombing campaign against its strongholds in Syria and Iraq. The endorsement is a major victory for the Islamic State in its rivalry with Al Qaeda \u2014 a group with deep Egyptian roots \u2014 and could now help recruit fighters and affiliates far beyond Egypt. The link is also the latest manifestation of a swirling descent into violence around the region amid the dashed hopes for democracy of the Arab Spring uprisings three years ago.In recent weeks, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis has come under a withering crackdown by the Egyptian military, which has begun the evacuation and destruction of hundreds of homes in an attempt to eradicate the group from its havens in northern Sinai. But at the same time the group has confounded the confident predictions of Egyptian officials that it would soon be defeated, raising fears that the fight may just be beginning.\u201cThe organized army is in confrontation with a group of disorganized ghosts,\u201d said Ahmed Sakr, a government official working on economic development in Sinai, who said that the military\u2019s \u201cbrute force\u201d there was alienating the population while scattering fighters across the country. \u201cI am very worried that there is now going to be more instability in the west, and Ansar Beit al-Maqdis will make inroads into Cairo and the big cities.\u201dHaving killed hundreds of soldiers and police officers in a rampage of violent retaliation for the military ouster of the Islamist president last year, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis has more recently carried out a handful of increasingly sophisticated and deadly attacks on military camps at both the eastern and western extremes of the country, according to Western officials and Egyptian analysts familiar with intelligence reports on militant activity in the region.An attack in the Western desert on July 19 killed at least 21 soldiers, and another on Oct. 24 in Sinai killed at least 31, the officials say, and both demonstrated that Ansar Beit al-Maqdis has now recruited more skilled and experienced fighters.Most alarmingly for the Egyptian military, Egyptian leaders believe the group has developed military informants with inside information about army deployments, according to several Western and Egyptian officials.In the Oct. 24 attack, for example, the militants appeared to know about the confidential movements of senior officers and reinforcement routes, the officials say. The fighters also displayed skill at targeting mortar fire as well as the confidence to continue their operation even under gunfire during a prolonged firefight, they say.\u201cThis is not just planting a bomb and running,\u201d said Diaa Rashwan, a researcher on Islamist groups at the Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies here. \u201cTo be able to keep attacking, that means you have real experience.\u201dAnsar Beit al-Maqdis fighters were also behind the killing of an American during a desert carjacking in August and may have been linked to other attacks targeting desert-ready, four-wheel drive S.U.V.s, according to Western officials \u2014 a development that has prompted the Egyptian government to order international energy companies to restrict their fleets of sport utility vehicles. Apache, British Petroleum and British Gas have all complied with the measure; spokesmen for all three companies and the Egyptian government declined to comment.Some Western officials question the evidence linking the group to other carjackings besides the killing in August of the American, an Apache employee named William Henderson, 58. But there is a consensus that the group has confounded attempts by Egyptian security officials to contain it by tightly controlling the limited transit points across the Suez Canal into the Sinai Peninsula.In Sinai, the suspicion that critical aid has flowed through the network of smuggling tunnels into Gaza is one reason that the Egyptian government took the drastic step of evacuating and destroying the homes of more than 1,100 families, all in a zone near the border.In an audio statement on Monday pledging to \u201cobey\u201d Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State\u2019s leader and self-proclaimed caliph, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis also repeated a call to rise up against Egypt\u2019s military-backed government \u2014 a trademark of its previous statements.\u201cTo our people in Egypt, what are you waiting for after the violation of your dignity?\u201d the statement asked. \u201cAfter shedding the blood of your sons on the hands of this reckless tyrant and his soldiers? When will you take out your swords to face your enemies?\u201dIt also added a familiar slap at the Muslim Brotherhood, the mainstream Islamist group that dominated Egypt\u2019s free elections and backed the deposed president, Mohamed Morsi, only to end up crushed by the military takeover. \u201cShameful peace will do you no good, nor will blasphemous democracy,\u201d the statement said, \u201cand you have seen how it has claimed its upholders and their masters.\u201dDetails about Ansar Beit al-Maqdis are scarce, in part because the Egyptian military limits access to the areas of Sinai that are the front line of its battle against the group. Its name means Supporters of Jerusalem, and Western officials estimate that it includes only hundreds or perhaps a few thousand fighters.Western officials familiar with intelligence reports on the group\u2019s internal communications say that a faction of Ansar Beit al-Maqdis based in the Nile Valley opposed the affiliation with the Islamic State. They worried that its reputation for careless violence will alienate other Egyptians, especially the disaffected Islamist youth that Ansar Beit al-Maqdis has sought to enlist.Some Nile Valley leaders of Ansar Beit al-Maqdis also appear to remember the lessons of an earlier Islamist insurgency, centered in Upper Egypt in the 1990s. Mass killings of tourists and others backfired, damaging the economy, alienating the Egyptian public and increasing support for the government\u2019s security forces. Ansar Beit al-Maqdis\u2019s previous statements have also looked to Al Qaeda for leadership, and some of the Nile Valley faction remain loyal to Al Qaeda as it has become a rival to the Islamic State for pre-eminence in the jihadi world.The Sinai-based leadership of Ansar Beit al-Maqdis has leaned toward an affiliation with the Islamic State for months, said several other Western officials. In October, two envoys of Ansar Beit al-Maqdis traveled to Syria to meet face-to-face with Islamic State leaders, pressing for money and weapons and discussing a pledge of loyalty. The dispute in Ansar Beit al-Maqdis over its affiliation with the Islamic State could yet split the group into two wings, with the Nile Valley leaders remaining apart, Western officials say. As recently as last week, the group formally denied published reports that the affiliation had already taken place, a possible indication of the internal divisions. Some Egyptians, including supporters of the government, argue that the heavy-handed approach to the Sinai uprising may further inflame it, especially after the forced evacuation of the border areas. \u201cIf there are three young people in each home, you guarantee that two of them would turn into Ansar Beit al-Maqdis militants,\u201d said Abdel Rahim Ali, an analyst with close ties to the Egyptian intelligence services.Reporting was contributed by Mark Mazzetti and Eric Schmitt from Washington, and Kareem Fahim, Asmaa al-Zohairy and Mohamad Adam from Cairo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protect Those Who Protect Our Food", "Date": "2014-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsThis is just one example of the critical role that food workers play in our nation\u2019s economic and public health systems. And yet, while we often tailor employment rules for work that has a special impact on the public, the law has yet to recognize food workers as a distinct class \u2014 an approach that harms consumers, the economy and the workers themselves.Sick restaurant workers provide a particularly vivid example of the kind of legal reform that\u2019s needed. Until recently, very few restaurant workers had the legal right to paid sick time, which meant that many of them went to work very ill (last week voters in Massachusetts and three cities passed paid-sick-leave laws). Federal law can fix this problem by requiring employers to provide their workers with paid time off.But restaurant workers aren\u2019t the only ones who need special treatment. All food workers are on the front lines of the vast food-production industry, and regularly witness dangerous breaches in safety procedures. Take farm workers who witness the processing of infected (or \u201cdowner\u201d) cows \u2014 an illegal but, unfortunately, not uncommon practice that risks spreading a host of diseases to humans. Or workers in poultry-processing facilities, where safety and hygiene regulations are flouted, thus increasing the risk of salmonella, which every year results in more than one million illnesses, more than 350 deaths and over $3 billion in health care and lost productivity costs. Unless we offer specific legal protection for all food workers who come forward to expose such practices \u2014 something the law does not do now \u2014 we all are at risk. We should also adjust many of our standard workplace rules to take account of the special nature of food production. To avoid the transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, which causes mad cow disease, workers involved in the processing of beef must fully and carefully remove the dorsal root ganglion, a part of the spinal nerve, from all cattle that are 30 months old or older. That\u2019s because these dorsal root ganglia can contain the infective agent behind B.S.E. This is high-stakes stuff, and we should make absolutely sure that the workers responsible for doing it aren\u2019t too worn out, or working too fast, to do it right. That means rethinking rules about line speeds, paid break time, union-organizing protections, vacations and, of course, training requirements. The same is true for agriculture workers who are ultimately responsible for making sure that we don\u2019t get salmonella, or for workers in supermarkets who monitor refrigeration protocols. The basic problem is, neither state nor federal law today recognizes \u201cfood work\u201d or \u201cfood workers\u201d as legal categories. The Food Safety Modernization Act, which President Obama signed in 2011, gave whistle-blower protections to some food workers, but not to those who work in critical areas like beef and poultry. At the same time, many states have so-called ag-gag laws, which criminalize audio and video recording of agricultural production facilities, making it harder for certain food workers to blow the whistle. In any case, none of these laws recognize food work and food workers as distinct, comprehensive legal categories.Once federal law recognizes food workers as a distinct legal category, it could then regulate food work and offer distinct protections to food workers. Such a move would not be entirely unprecedented in the law: We already treat nuclear workers, airline pilots and truck drivers differently because of the special nature of their work. When it comes to food workers, some of the new protections would extend to everyone in the industry: Whistle-blower protections, for example, should be available to all food workers who report on practices related to food safety. Other protections might be more relevant to some food workers than others: Paid break and vacation time along with maximum hours, for example, seem potentially more critical in slaughterhouses than in restaurants, while paid sick leave might be more relevant in restaurants than in slaughterhouses. Food workers are distinct from other workers in ways that are critical to food safety and public health, and they ought to be protected by the law in new ways. Otherwise, we run the risk that workers \u2014 charged with producing our food \u2014 will be unable to protect public safety.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Draghi, Promises Are Still His Main Policy Option", "Date": "2014-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe governing council is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.Two years ago, Mr. Draghi turned the tide in the eurozone crisis merely by promising to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to preserve the currency bloc. He is now soothing the markets again with the promise of stronger economic medicine. He also addressed concerns about the divisions in the E.C.B. over its next steps.But the question remains: How long will Mr. Draghi be able to appease the markets with incremental measures and updates that end with the effective equivalent of \u201ctune in next month.\u201d Even if markets remain calm, the larger issue is whether the E.C.B. will be able to reverse the worrisome deflationary trend that has plagued the economy.Mr. Draghi offered little specifics about how the E.C.B. would inject more stimulus into the economy. A large bond-buying program \u2014 like the six-year campaign the Federal Reserve just ended \u2014 faces significant legal and political challenges in Europe.\u201cAs far as verbal intervention by central bankers is concerned, Mr. Draghi has no equal,\u201d Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London, wrote in a note to clients. \u201cYet the reality is that the only thing that changed today is market perceptions of the E.C.B.\u201dIf the economy continues to sour, the markets may lose faith. Many economists and policy makers remain frustrated by the E.C.B.\u2019s reluctance to do what the Fed, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan have already done without any sign of the inflation that critics had predicted. On Thursday, \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, the secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, joined those advocating a more aggressive approach.\u201cThere is an increasing risk of stagnation in the euro area,\u201d Mr. Gurr\u00eda said at a news conference in Paris. \u201cCountries must employ all monetary, fiscal and structural reform policies at their disposal to address these risks and support growth.\u201dRecent economic data has added pressure on the European Central Bank to begin more aggressive stimulus measures. The annual rate of inflation in the eurozone was 0.4 percent in October. That was up from 0.3 percent in September but still dangerously low in the eyes of many economists. Eurozone unemployment, meanwhile, remained at a stubbornly high 11.5 percent, according to data for September.The eurozone is not officially in deflation, a destructive downward spiral in prices. But even the current low level of inflation can cause consumers to delay making purchases, companies to lose revenue and unemployment to soar above its already high levels.Even if European Central Bank policy is still doing little to lift inflation to a healthier level \u2014 the bank\u2019s target is just below 2 percent \u2014 there is a method to Mr. Draghi\u2019s approach.To avoid alienating Germany, Mr. Draghi must first try everything short of large-scale government bond purchases. There is widespread fear in Germany that central bank bond-buying would amount to a transfer of wealth from better-off countries to poorer ones. Many Germans worry that they would have to pick up the tab if some countries defaulted on bonds owned by the European Central Bank.Mr. Draghi must also take care to avoid an open split on his governing council with Jens Weidmann, the president of the German central bank, who is a vocal opponent of government bond-buying.The European Central Bank has already been buying private-sector assets since early October \u2014 4.8 billion euros, or about $5.9 billion, in total so far. But J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, and other analysts say there is no way the central bank can hit the \u20ac1 trillion target without resorting to purchases of government bonds.To paraphrase Winston Churchill, Mr. Draghi will do the right thing only after exhausting all the alternatives.\u201cI\u2019m quite sure in the end Draghi will say, \u2018Jens, we have to buy government bonds,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Kr\u00e4mer said, referring to Mr. Weidmann.There was more than just rhetoric in Mr. Draghi\u2019s appearance at his news conference after Thursday\u2019s monthly meeting of the governing council.Mr. Draghi has said on previous occasions that the central bank would increase its balance sheet to the same level as at the beginning of 2012. That had implied that the central bank would spend \u20ac1 trillion by buying bonds or issuing cheap loans to commercial banks.On Thursday, the central bank solidified those commitments and set a deadline. In its official statement, the E.C.B. indicated that it would aim to increase its balance sheet by \u20ac1 trillion by 2016.\u201cWe\u2019re one step closer to full-blown sovereign Q.E.,\u201d Luke Bartholomew, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said in a statement, referring to quantitative easing.This stimulus goal was also signed by all members of the governing council. The unanimous endorsement erased doubt that Mr. Draghi might have been promising more than the rest of the council was prepared to deliver. And it also helped quash speculation of dissension within the council.\u201cIt\u2019s fairly normal to disagree about things,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. At their customary dinner on Wednesday night, he said, members of the council had \u201cperhaps the best discussion we ever had.\u201dCarsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING Bank, wrote in a note to clients, \u201cIf there was any internal conflict within the governing council, Mario Draghi hushed it.\u201dThe central bank\u2019s statement also said that its staff and committees had begun preparing additional policy measures, should they be needed. While Mr. Draghi gave no deadline for them to present the plans, the statement was intended to show that groundwork was being laid.\u201cThis is the main message: The balance sheet will continue to expand,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

He sees economic disaster ahead.A spokesman for Mr. Singer declined to confirm the report and said Mr. Singer would not agree to be interviewed.I cannot recall an economic recovery that was more widely doubted than the current one. On the left, the response has often been to cite statistics indicating that benefits have largely gone to the wealthy and not spread down the economic ladder. There is something to that, but it is always true that recoveries, like recessions, are spread unevenly throughout the economy.On the right, the claim has more often been that the numbers are manipulated by the Obama administration to fool the public.Is that true? I doubt it. The idea that politicians could force government bureaucrats to fake the statistics, and do so without any leaks, is hard to believe. Such a conspiracy, if it managed to exist for long, would be a marvel of organization. But those who believe in the conspiracy theory also tend to subscribe to the theory that governments are generally incompetent and unable to do anything right. Those two beliefs do not correspond.That is not to say that governments cannot lie about numbers. Greece used phony economic numbers to qualify for the eurozone. It is too bad for everyone, including the Greeks, that the deception succeeded. And the Soviet Union\u2019s economic growth figures seem to have been considerably exaggerated. One reason may be that lower-level officials were under pressure to report good numbers to show they were doing a good job.Anyone who has ever studied corporate accounting frauds will recognize that problem.But the people who collect the figures that go into economic statistics are not under that pressure. They will not lose their jobs if the economic statistics look bad. They will lose their jobs if they do not collect enough data, and there have been cases where government interviewers were said to have faked survey responses to cover up the fact that they had not done enough work.Nonetheless, government statistics are often questionable and sometimes turn out to have been highly misleading.Unfortunately for policy makers, such errors are most likely to be severe at precisely the time that the economy is turning around. Estimates are included in most economic statistics, and those compiling the figures tend to assume that previous trends will continue. We now know the economy was much worse off in early 2009 than the economic statistics indicated at the time.By the time Mr. Welch voiced his doubts in 2012, the figures showed that a recovery, though not a particularly strong one, was underway. It turns out the numbers were wrong, but not in the way Mr. Welch believed. Employment was growing more rapidly than the initial figures indicated.The numbers on jobs and unemployment have become the most-watched statistics of this era, but they can be among the most confusing. That is because the figures come from two different surveys, each with its own problems. The job numbers come from a survey of employers. The unemployment numbers come from a survey of households. Sometimes they can radically disagree, with one survey showing an increase in employment and the other a decline. Both surveys have problems. The job numbers are revised twice after they are released, as late responses to the survey are tabulated. They include an estimate \u2014 known as the birth-death model \u2014 reflecting the number of jobs created at companies too new to be eligible for the survey and the number of jobs lost when existing companies go out of business. Then, more than a year later, the numbers are completely revised to reflect how many workers companies said they had when they paid premiums for unemployment insurance.Those revisions can be drastic. In the 10 months from April 2008 through January 2009, the current estimate is that the economy lost 1.9 million more jobs than the initial reports indicated.The figures in the household survey are rarely revised, but they are subject to significant sampling errors. For the total number of people working, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says that there is a 90 percent probability that the correct number is within 400,000 of the number reported and that the unemployment rate is within 0.2 percentage point of the reported figure. What that means in practice is that month-to-month fluctuations may be meaningless. To possibly make things worse, more people decline to be interviewed now than in years past. That may make the numbers less reliable than they used to be. The survey questions are complicated. It is not simply a matter of whether a member of the household was working during the week covered by a monthly survey. Was a person without a job looking for work? If so, that person is counted as unemployed. If not, the person is deemed not to be in the labor force. Further questions are meant to determine if that person was not looking because he or she was discouraged about the chances of finding a job. If so, that person goes into a category that is included in a different indicator of unemployment.In the current recovery, that latter index has not declined nearly as much as the regular unemployment rate. That fact has been noted by Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, as an indication the job market is not as healthy as the unemployment rate might make it appear.The government figures that may be least believed by the public are the inflation calculations. Since mid-2012, the index of prices for personal consumption expenditures \u2014 the index most closely watched by the Fed \u2014 has consistently risen by less than the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent. But consumers, as reflected in the Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence Survey, have always forecast annual inflation of at least 5 percent.Why the discrepancy? It is possible that people are more likely to notice goods whose prices have risen than those whose prices have dropped. Mr. Singer, in his denunciation of official figures, questions adjustments that are made for the quality of goods and argues that government indexes understate the costs for the wealthy because prices of things like luxury real estate and art have increased far more than the prices of goods purchased by the middle class. And some people subscribe to a conspiracy theory that the Consumer Price Index figures are deliberately held down so the government can avoid paying richer Social Security benefits.So what are people to make of the blizzard of economic statistics? First, be suspicious of rapid changes in any indicator, particularly if other indicators do not show similar changes. Look for trends that continue. And pay attention to the real world around you. The chaos in the financial world in late 2008 should have warned Obama administration economists that the official statistics might be overstated.And try to separate reality from ideology. In 1983, when the economy accelerated after the early 1980s recessions, some liberals were sure the numbers had to be wrong, given that it was obvious nothing good could come from the policies of President Ronald Reagan. In 2010, there were widespread forecasts by conservatives that the economy could not improve, that inflation was bound to accelerate and the dollar would collapse if the Fed foolishly pursued its policy of quantitative easing.All those forecasts turned out to be wrong. Does that mean the forecasters were mistaken? Some would rather think it shows the statistics are being faked.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Signs Point to an Extended Bull Market", "Date": "2014-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconoclastLONDON \u2014 Back in mid-October, as stock markets around the world fell faster than at any time since 2011, many investors and economists feared a meltdown. But with the United States economy steadily expanding, monetary and fiscal policy becoming more stimulative in other parts of the world, and the autumn season for financial crises over, a melt-up now seems more likely. There are many fundamental reasons for believing that stock markets may have embarked on a long-term bull market comparable to those of the 1950s and 1960s or the 1980s and 1990s and that this process is nearer its beginning than its end. Such arguments have been discussed repeatedly in this column over the past 18 months, ever since the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, the world\u2019s most important stock market index, broke out of a 13-year trading range and started scaling new heights in March 2013. Wall Street has been setting records ever since. These are the four most important arguments for a structural bull market:First, the worst financial and economic crisis in living memory has now ended, and most parts of the world are enjoying decent growth. Second, economic and financial policies around the world, though they are far from perfect, are predictable and unlikely to cause further market disruptions. Third, technology is advancing and this innovation is creating new products, services and processes that stimulate investment and consumer demand. Finally, inflation is almost nonexistent, at least in the advanced economies, implying that interest rates are guaranteed to stay low for a long time. Minor corrections and panics are bound to happen, since financial markets move in boom-bust cycles as greed alternates with fear. This happened in early October, when Wall Street fell 10 percent in three weeks and stock prices in Europe dropped almost 20 percent in terms of dollars. Such setbacks tend to reinforce the upward trend if the fears that triggered them turn out to be illusory or much less daunting than they appeared. That is exactly what has happened. There were two catalysts for last month\u2019s stock market decline: a sudden drop in oil prices and a run of dismal economic figures from Europe and Japan. The first of these problems was never likely to prove more than a hiccup, since falling oil prices are on balance beneficial to consumption and corporate profits, even though they hurt energy-producing companies and countries. By contrast, the second problem \u2014 slumping economies in Europe and Japan \u2014 threatened investors with a genuine nightmare. No matter how well the United States economy might perform, global businesses could not shrug off a possible recession in Europe and Japan, especially if their governments or central banks refused to follow the American model of fiscal and monetary stimulus to revive growth. Luckily, the policy paralysis in Europe and Japan has been broken and that means that the risk that these vital regions will fall back into recession is much smaller than it was a month ago. The most impressive sign of new policy dynamism came from Japan, with its dramatic announcement on Oct. 31 that the central bank would substantially increase its already enormous monetary expansion, while the $1.2 trillion Government Pension and Investment Fund would more than double its allocation to equities and foreign bonds. These stimulus measures have now been supplemented by reports that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe might delay the tax increase planned for next October and could even call an early general election to give himself more freedom to pursue additional reforms. In short, Mr. Abe now seems to have reverted to full-scale stimulus policies after his misguided effort at fiscal tightening last April. As a result, the favorable economic conditions of 2013 are likely to be restored in Japan next year. The investor pessimism caused by April\u2019s tax increase has become bullishness \u2014 and rightly so. When the facts change, people should change their minds. An equally surprising, though less decisive, shift toward active policy stimulus is taking place in Europe, evidenced by two recent events: the European Central Bank meeting Nov. 6 and the previous week\u2019s announcement that the French and Italian governments would run bigger budget deficits than the European Commission had previously demanded under eurozone fiscal rules. The commission, by accepting these budget plans and ignoring German demands for tougher austerity, signaled the end of the fiscal tightening that has been a major obstacle to European economic recovery. The E.C.B.\u2019s announcement was even more significant. Mario Draghi, the central bank president, committed himself explicitly for the first time to expanding by 1 trillion euros, or $1.25 trillion, the E.C.B.\u2019s balance sheet and promised that the central bank would take whatever measures were necessary to achieve this.This statement effectively meant that the E.C.B. had finally agreed to implement large-scale quantitative easing \u2014 the purchase of debt with new money \u2014 albeit using different techniques than the United States, Japan and Britain. The fact that Europe and Japan are finally ready to follow the United States\u2019 monetary and fiscal road map will not suddenly remove all the structural obstacles to growth in these economies, but it will make structural reforms much easier to accomplish and more effective. The prospects for a sustainable global expansion are now much brighter than expected a month ago. This improvement in the global economic outlook is more than enough to justify the powerful rebound in stock markets since mid-October. Even if economic conditions continue improving, stock prices are bound to fall sharply at some point, inflicting painful losses on investors. This is what happened in 1987, about five years into the last structural bull market. Boom-bust cycles are inevitable because improving economic conditions encourage speculative excesses, which are then blown away as greed gives way to fear. But the bust cannot come before the boom, and global economic conditions suggest that a full-scale stock market boom may be just starting. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Military\u2019s Rough Justice on Sexual Assault", "Date": "2014-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCol. Don Christensen, the chief prosecutor of the United States Air Force, sat in economy class on a flight to Venice and studied the folder of the sexual-assault case that would ultimately end his career. It was August 2012, and he was en route to Aviano Air Base to try a court-martial. Looking over the case, he could see why the judge advocate general, or JAG, at the base had requested him. Christensen had prosecuted more sexual-assault courts-martial than any other lawyer in the Air Force, and this case called for someone with experience. There would most likely be generals testifying. The accused himself was a senior officer. Even Christensen had seldom handled cases involving men of high rank. There was a simple reason for this: Victims were reluctant to report such officers, who enjoyed their own set of rules in the military justice system.The officer in question was Lt. Col. James Wilkerson, Aviano\u2019s inspector general and a highly regarded F-16 fighter pilot. Five months before, following a U.S.O. concert at the base, Wilkerson, who was 43, and his wife, Beth, hosted a small party at their house. One guest, a 48-year-old civilian named Kim Hanks, was stranded without a ride home. She accepted the Wilkersons\u2019 offer to stay in their guest bedroom. According to Hanks, she was dead asleep at 3 in the morning when she felt a sudden discomfort. Wilkerson was in bed with her, pawing at her body, digitally penetrating her. She was struggling with him when someone appeared in the doorway. It was Beth Wilkerson. \u201cGet the hell out of my house,\u201d the wife told the guest. Hanks scrambled out of the house and into the darkness without her shoes.Thumbing through the folder\u2019s contents, Christensen reviewed Hanks\u2019s written statement. There didn\u2019t appear to be anything obvious that would lead him to question her integrity. A physician assistant at the base, she had met the Wilkersons only that evening and had no reason to be defaming the pilot. Christensen found her credible and suspected that Wilkerson and his wife had not told investigators the truth about what happened that night. The prosecutor studied the transcript of the pilot\u2019s videotaped interview with Air Force investigators, in which he insisted he never left his own bedroom. The prosecutor also had the results of Wilkerson\u2019s polygraph, which he failed. As with most sexual assaults, there was no physical evidence to buttress the case against Wilkerson. Unlike most such cases, however, there was a witness: Wilkerson\u2019s wife. Christensen read the statement Beth gave to the investigators. He knew that she would be the key to the case. After all, she had only one reason to be untruthful: to cover up her husband\u2019s guilt.Christensen was 51, very tall and bald, an intimidating presence with a raspy voice. But he possessed a shy, boyish smile and a soft handshake that suggested a self-consciousness about his own strength. He was a sixth-generation military man; his great-great-grandfather survived the Battle of the Little Bighorn. In 1991, Christensen began his own military career as a lawyer at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, 30 miles from where he grew up on a dairy farm. Though strippers no longer entertained at the officers\u2019 club \u2014 as had been the case when Christensen\u2019s father served at Ellsworth \u2014 at the time Christensen began there, it was still legal in the military to rape your wife. That year, 1991, was also when dozens of women reported that they were sexually assaulted by more than 100 Marines and Navy men at the Tailhook Symposium in Las Vegas, but the airmen at Ellsworth ridiculed the allegations as a tale trumped up by a bunch of female complainers.Christensen\u2019s early experience in a military courtroom was primarily as a defense attorney, with most of his early cases involving drug possession or use. During that time, he also represented nine men accused of rape. He won acquittals for six of them \u2014 the other three cases were thrown out before trial. Christensen developed an expertise in unraveling a victim\u2019s testimony by, among other things, questioning her demeanor before and after the assault. He kept to himself how distasteful he found these moments \u2014 how he imagined taking the women aside after the whole thing was over and whispering, I believe you.But his obligation was to his clients, and so he did what professional ethics demanded of him. The Air Force\u2019s prosecutors and judges were inexperienced \u2014 moving on to other areas of the law after a few years \u2014 and seldom objected to Christensen\u2019s line of questioning. The jury members, usually men of senior rank, had little sense of the counterintuitive behavior that victims often display. How she might go back to the house where a man attacked her to retrieve her sunglasses, so that he could not hold onto something of hers. How she might still talk to her attacker on the base, even with a smile, so as not to damage her military career. How her heart rate might have been normal during the medical examination following the assault, because, well, the body sometimes behaves strangely. Consistently he exploited the jurors\u2019 ignorance on such matters to win acquittals of men he often suspected of being sexual predators.Word began to spread: If you were caught assaulting a woman, your best hope was to request Don Christensen as your defense counsel. After one not-guilty verdict, the defendant, a huge man, wrapped Christensen in a bear hug and lifted the 6-foot-3 lawyer off the ground. Another soldier he set free vowed on the spot that he would be sending Christensen a Christmas card every year. The lawyer preferred to view his courtroom victories as testaments to his technical and persuasive skills rather than as possible miscarriages of justice \u2014 though his wife, Debbie, would tweak his conscience by asking: \u201cGood for you. But what about her?\u201dChristensen often dwelled on the same question, and when the opportunity came in 2000 to switch sides, he took it. As a prosecutor, at Ahmed Al Jaber Air Base in Kuwait, Christensen immediately felt a weight on his conscience slip away. Though his new job would include court-martialing thieves, drug dealers and murderers, he became especially drawn to cases involving men who had forced themselves on women (and occasionally men) they usually outranked without fear of retribution. Christensen proved to be an empathetic advocate for the women he once sought to defeat. \u201cYou have to gain the trust of the victim in order for them to be comfortable telling you the facts of the case and retelling them on the stand,\u201d an Air Force lawyer who has worked with Christensen (and insisted he not be identified, for fear that it might jeopardize his career) told me. \u201cAny lawyer can know the forensics. What you can\u2019t get out of a book is how you interact with a victim. I learned by watching how he treated them.\u201dOver the next 12 years, Christensen personally tried roughly 40 sexual-assault cases and supervised the prosecution of another 300. His decision to focus on sex crimes was unconventional in the military. A JAG was expected to be a generalist \u2014 to learn about environmental and labor law, about contracts and medical malpractice claims \u2014 and to spend only a few years trying cases. But Christensen liked the challenge of helping victims who had no one else in their corner. He knew the base commanders often did not have their best interests at heart. Instead commanders worried that a court-martial could lead to the loss of a prized fighter pilot. It could create turmoil at the base and produce a blemish on their own records. These pressures, Christensen had come to learn, all conspired to upset the scales of justice. Time after time, he witnessed commanders demonstrating their support for the accused by sitting behind him in the courtroom; in one case, after a pilot was found not guilty of rape, the commander leapt from his perch and yelled, \u201cYeah!\u201d Commanders selected the jury, which sometimes issued sentences far lighter than those meted out in civilian courtrooms. He saw one commander withdraw an airtight rape case days before trial, without explanation. He saw another commander testify at sentencing that the noncommissioned officer who had just been convicted of sexually molesting his daughter, a 13-year-old with a developmental disability, was nonetheless of great value to the unit and should therefore be retained. The judge granted his request.And now Don Christensen would be trying to persuade a jury that a popular lieutenant colonel had sexually assaulted a houseguest and that his wife was covering for him. Still, the prosecutor was confident. When it came down to it, someone had to be lying, and he believed he could show that it wasn\u2019t Kim Hanks.Christensen and his two deputies filed into the Aviano courtroom on Oct. 29, 2012, to begin their case. It was easy for him to pick out Wilkerson\u2019s supporters. The aviators stood in the back, arms folded across their chests, glowering at the prosecutors and the victim. Christensen proceeded through a litany of witnesses: other guests at Wilkerson\u2019s house that night; individuals Hanks had called to try to get a ride home; and Hanks herself. After two days, the prosecutor rested his case. The defense then called Beth Wilkerson to the stand. She testified that her husband remained in his bed throughout that night. Two aspects of her testimony surprised Christensen. Previously the pilot\u2019s wife said that she had thrown out Kim Hanks after being awakened by Hanks\u2019s loud cellphone conversation. Her new story, created after Christensen handed over phone records showing no such call had been made, was that she had been awakened by Hanks\u2019s pacing noisily around the room. Additionally, she originally told investigators that Hanks was very drunk that evening \u2014 which would mean that the pilot\u2019s wife, known for her charitable spirit, had thrown an intoxicated woman out into the streets in the dead of night. Now her testimony was that the houseguest was sober. Christensen knew then that he was going to win the case.During cross-examination, he asked Beth Wilkerson whether she had changed her story about Hanks\u2019s condition that evening. Yes, she acknowledged. Had she also changed her story about what sound compelled her to go into the guest bedroom? Yes, she said. Christensen led her through several other instances in which the wife\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with either her previous statements or those of her husband. The witness began to slouch in a posture of defeat, according to several people who were in the courtroom. The prosecutor concluded his 45-minute interrogation by standing over the pilot\u2019s wife and asking, \u201cDo you know of any reason Kim Hanks would have to falsely accuse your husband of having put his finger in her vagina?\u201d Beth Wilkerson responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dAfter three and a half hours of deliberations, the jury found Wilkerson guilty and sentenced him to a dishonorable discharge and a year\u2019s imprisonment. Christensen saw the relief on Hanks\u2019s face, even as groans of dismay pervaded the courtroom. This was not the place for the prosecution team to be celebrating. Christensen immediately ushered his deputies out of the courtroom.Wilkerson was sent to jail in Mannheim, Germany, and Christensen returned to his family in Virginia. Over the next three months, the prosecutor began work on other cases while, unknown to him, dozens of letters \u2014 many from high-ranking officers \u2014 poured into the office of General Franklin, not only attesting to Wilkerson\u2019s character but also claiming that Christensen had suppressed key evidence and that Hanks was a liar. On the afternoon of Feb. 26, 2013, Christensen was returning from lunch with a deputy at Andrews Air Force Base when an email appeared on his BlackBerry. It took him a moment to comprehend what he was reading. General Franklin, the commander stationed at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, had overturned the verdict: Wilkerson was to be released from prison and reinstated at full rank.Christensen was stunned. He knew that the military justice system allowed Wilkerson to request clemency from Franklin, the convening authority. He\u2019d seen cases in which sentences were reduced or benefits reinstated. And he knew that under Article 60 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the convening authority even had the power to dismiss the sentence entirely. But he had never heard of that happening. It hadn\u2019t occurred to him that a commander might simply ignore a jury\u2019s verdict. But Franklin did. Amid Christensen\u2019s astonishment, one thought took shape: The general\u2019s brazenly autocratic decision would not pass unnoticed in Washington.It took a day before the legal office at Aviano could locate Hanks and get her on the phone with Christensen. The normally composed woman sobbed as he delivered the bad news.\u201cKim,\u201d he grimly told her, \u201cI have no explanation. The only thing I can tell you is that you\u2019re about to become an agent for change. This will never happen again.\u201dThe looming question today is whether these changes have actually reduced the number of sexual assaults, encouraged victims to come forward and ensured justice when they did. In December the Pentagon will release to the president and Congress the 2014 gender-relations report \u2014 a biennial in-depth and anonymous survey that is supposed to capture true numbers of sexual assaults. Military officials hope it will reflect significant improvement resulting from last year\u2019s reforms. But several vocal skeptics on Capitol Hill doubt that these measures will prove sufficient. Many of these lawmakers are women \u2014 Representatives Niki Tsongas and Jackie Speier and Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Claire McCaskill and Barbara Boxer \u2014 who became engaged with the issue after viewing \u201cThe Invisible War,\u201d a revealing 2012 documentary on the subject, as well as having numerous private meetings with women and men in uniform who had been sexually assaulted. The stories the military officers have told tend to feature a common element \u2014 namely the favoritism that commanders exhibit toward the accused and a lack of sympathy toward those who report such offenses.For this reason, Senator Gillibrand has led a legislative effort to remove prosecutorial authority from the military in sexual-assault cases and place it instead with an independent body. After consulting with Christensen, among many others, she wrote the Military Justice Improvement Act earlier this year; it came within five votes of passage in the Senate in March. Gillibrand expects that the new Pentagon statistics will persuade more senators to reconsider their trust in the military\u2019s ability to police itself.\u201cFor the past 25 years, going back to when Dick Cheney was defense secretary, we\u2019ve had the military telling us that there\u2019s zero tolerance for sexual assault,\u201d Gillibrand said in October in her Washington office. \u201cAnd all we\u2019ve seen is zero accountability.\u201d Gillibrand pointed out that the last gender-relations survey from 2012 indicated that there had been 26,000 cases of sexual assault, rapes and unwanted sexual contact in a year\u2019s time. Only 3,300 of them were actually reported, roughly one in eight. \u201cAnd so when you speak to the survivors, they\u2019ll tell you they won\u2019t report because they don\u2019t believe the chain of command will do anything or they fear witness retaliation. Of the brave souls that did report these crimes, 62 percent were retaliated against. So you have a culture where rapists go free, there\u2019s no accountability for sexual assault, there\u2019s a climate where everything is shoved under the rug and people are actually punished for reporting sexual assault.\u201dProposals like Gillibrand\u2019s bill are viewed by military officials as intolerable, a subjugation of a commander\u2019s authority, which they say would erode order and discipline within the ranks. The Pentagon has countered with an onslaught of new programs designed to lend comfort to victims, to discourage predation, to keep commanders better informed and, above all, to prove to lawmakers that the military understands there is a problem. In May, Gen. James F. Amos of the Marine Corps vowed to a House subcommittee, \u201cI\u2019m determined to change our culture.\u201d Earlier this year, Army Secretary John M. McHugh told an audience of military-sexual-assault experts that they were \u201cchanging the culture.\u201d Not long after, the director of the Pentagon\u2019s sexual-assault-prevention efforts known as Sapro, Maj. Gen. Gary Patton, also promised new programs that \u201cwill make a difference and change the culture.\u201dWhen I visited the prevention and medical facilities at Fort Bragg a few months ago, a senior officer involved in the sexual-assault-reform effort also assured me that things were different. \u201cThere is a change going on, quality and quantity \u2014 and soldiers are getting it,\u201d the officer said. Fort Bragg happened to be the same Army base where Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair underwent a much-publicized court-martial earlier this year. Sinclair acknowledged a three-year adulterous relationship with a female subordinate but denied her claims that he twice sexually assaulted her. The general also confessed to using his superior rank to direct two other young female officers to furnish him with naked photographs. Ultimately Sinclair pleaded to lesser offenses and was allowed to retire at reduced rank. During roughly the same period, Defense Secretary Hagel ordered a systemwide \u201cstand-down day\u201d devoted to sexual-assault-prevention seminars. I later spoke with a seminar attendee, a female lieutenant who told me she was sexually assaulted on an Army base two years earlier.\u201cThe presenters asked us if we felt things were improving,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all laughed. Sinclair was happening then. He proved that it was a joke.\u201dCritics in Congress are skeptical too. In May 2013, two months after General Franklin dismissed Wilkerson\u2019s verdict, Representative Jackie Speier complained to Hagel about a Facebook page apparently put up by Marines called \u201cF\u2019N Wook,\u201d depicting women being tied up, beaten and shot. The Marines assured Speier that the situation was being investigated but would not say whether anyone had been disciplined. In September, an Army drill sergeant pleaded guilty to sexually abusing several female trainees at Fort Leonard Wood, the same base where the Army was teaching its criminal investigators the latest techniques in identifying sexual predators. Lawmakers like Senators Gillibrand and McCaskill expressed particular alarm at the allegation made by one trainee, who testified at the court-martial that the women were warned that they might not graduate if they reported any assaults. The Army responded that it had investigated the matter but would not disclose its findings.Lack of transparency is not the only reason that the military\u2019s promises of change have been hard to accept. It\u2019s difficult to be sanguine when the supposed enforcers of change have themselves exhibited bad conduct. In June, the Army\u2019s top sex-crimes prosecutor, Lt. Col. Jay Morse, received a reprimand after molesting a female officer at a sexual-assault-prevention conference. That same month, the Air Force\u2019s sexual-assault-prevention director, Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, was also reprimanded for drunkenly fondling a woman in a bar against her will. When the civilian authorities did not bring a charge of sexual battery against Krusinski, Don Christensen strongly recommended to his superiors that he be court-martialed. The convening authority in the matter elected to keep Krusinski in the Air Force.In February, on a flight from Frankfurt to Baltimore, Christensen noticed a familiar face on the airplane. It was Gen. Craig Franklin, the convening authority in the Wilkerson case. After his verdict reversal caused an uproar on Capitol Hill, Franklin was forced to retire as a two-star general rather than a three-star general, and he was now on his way home. Upon clearing customs in the airport, Christensen approached Franklin and asked if he could have a word with him.\u201cYou blew it,\u201d he told the former commander. \u201cWilkerson was guilty. Everything you wrote in your memo was wrong. I would have told you \u2014 you should have called me.\u201d Christensen added that the victim, Kim Hanks, had been needlessly retraumatized by the ordeal.Franklin, noticeably startled by this outburst, replied that the outcome had not been rosy for him either. \u201cI lost a star,\u201d he said.Christensen left the airport and gave no thought to whether it had been imprudent to scold a general. Nor had he reflected on how his now-frequent visits to the Hill to discuss his views with legislators and their staff would be viewed by his superiors. And though he was surprised and offended to learn some months before that Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, the commander of the United States Air Forces in Europe, had condemned the prosecution of Wilkerson while addressing several hundred officers, Christensen did not worry that his career was in jeopardy.But a month after his run-in with Franklin, Christensen says he received his annual performance review and found that he was downgraded for the first time. His superiors informed him that he would soon be assigned to be a judge on the appellate court. Christensen nearly laughed when he learned of this \u201cpromotion.\u201d The appellate court was widely understood to be the Air Force\u2019s dumping ground for JAG misfits.The veteran prosecutor had no intention of submitting to such a fate. As he thought about what might come next, he threw himself into one last sexual-assault case \u2014 involving an incident near Ellsworth, the Air Force Base where Christensen began his military career.On Friday, April 12, 2013, about two dozen male officers of the 37th Bomb Squadron gathered at a strip club just west of the base. After spending less than an hour there, they took a bus to Sally O\u2019Malley\u2019s and then to Joe\u2019s Place. At Joe\u2019s, an officer named Kris \u2014 the only woman in a squadron of 70 aviators \u2014 caught up with them. She was a major, a lean and athletic B-1 weapon-systems officer in her mid-30s who had flown nearly 2,000 hours in combat zones, more than anyone else in the 37th. Often the others referred to Kris (who requested that her nickname be used to protect her privacy) as \u201cone of the guys,\u201d which she took as a point of pride, and it was only later that she would wonder whether, in simply rolling with the daily macho crudeness in the Air Force, she herself had been part of the problem.Kris was just coming in that night from a nearly monthlong assignment at another air base. Her squadron greeted the major with high-fives and hugs, she said, and told her that she had some catching up to do. She drank two shots of tequila and put on a pub crawl T-shirt like the others were wearing. Then they left for another bar, and then another. It was getting close to 2 in the morning when the bus headed back to the base, but four officers \u2014 Kris and three men \u2014 decided to close down one last bar. She was quite drunk by the time they hailed a cab. While she slept in the taxi, the other three determined that they had enough money among them for only two stops. One airman, Capt. David Brooks, volunteered to take her back to his place and drive her home. Kris had flown sorties with him, and they were professionally cordial, though they rarely socialized. Without Kris noticing, Brooks snatched her iPhone and sent some crude texts to a squadron buddy who had left earlier, including one that used symbols to apparently replicate an erect penis.According to Kris, she had not been inside Brooks\u2019s apartment for more than a few minutes when he suddenly pushed her onto the couch. Stunned, she jumped back up, then promptly became sick. The reaction took Brooks aback. He cleaned up the mess while she staggered to the couch and fell asleep. Perhaps two hours later, she woke up, feeling not quite right. Her pants were undone. She felt hands groping inside her underwear, touching her vagina and her anus. It took her a while to understand what was happening. She could feel someone breathing heavily into her hair. The groping continued. Kris, now awake, reached down and pulled up her pants. Brooks stumbled away from the couch and retreated to his bedroom.For hours she was alone. She had no cab money and didn\u2019t know what address to give a dispatcher anyway. When Brooks finally emerged, late in the afternoon, she asked him to take her home. \u201cSee you at work,\u201d she found herself saying as she got out of his car.For weeks, Kris tried to get over it. She kept seeing Brooks at the unit. It seemed to her as if he were everywhere, bossing people around, strutting about as if nothing had changed, as if what he tried to do to her was a triviality, something he could repeat whenever he so chose and she would simply have to accept it. She could not. Rage consumed her. Six weeks after the assault, she filed a report. The base investigators interviewed her and had her write a statement about what occurred. Then they asked Kris to call Brooks, and they listened in while she confronted him for the first time about what he did to her that night when she was passed out. Brooks immediately apologized but said that he had been drunk himself and had no memory of doing such a thing. The investigators filed their report, which eventually made its way up to the Government Trial and Appellate Counsel Division at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington and landed on the desk of the division chief, Don Christensen, nearly a year after the incident.What Kris encountered since reporting the assault was the same kind of cold-shouldered skepticism on the part of her commander that Christensen had seen in a vast majority of sexual-assault cases \u2014 behavior that was supposed to have changed with the military\u2019s recent vows to support those who reported sex crimes. After Kris reported Brooks, the commander, Lt. Col. Stuart Newberry, who also was there during the night of drinking, issued a no-contact order specifying that Brooks stay at least 300 feet away from Kris \u2014 a standard procedure, except that the commander also issued the same order to her, which was something Christensen had never seen happen. Newberry agreed to move Brooks out of the squadron office where Kris worked, then decreed that out of fairness, Kris would have to be reassigned as well \u2014 though he backed down when she tearfully argued that this would be universally interpreted as punishment for having said that she had been assaulted. Still Brooks continued to show up in the office. \u201cI need him here to do his job,\u201d Kris said the commander told her. More than once Newberry told Kris that, just as in corporate America, his hands were tied. \u201cIf this were IBM, they wouldn\u2019t be able to move him,\u201d he said. When Kris told Christensen what Newberry said, he told her that Newberry\u2019s analogy was wrong: It was hard to imagine a modern-day company in which someone accused of sexual assault would be permitted to continue to work alongside the woman he was said to have attacked.Newberry, she said, also told her, \u201cIt\u2019s illogical for you to think that there won\u2019t be negative consequences to your reporting.\u201d What the commander had not done was warn the rest of the 37th Bomb Squadron that he would not tolerate \u201cnegative consequences\u201d for her. Instead, during one meeting, Colonel Newberry volunteered that throughout his experience in the Air Force, he knew of only one report of sexual assault, and it turned out to be false. (Newberry declined to comment for this article.) From what Christensen had seen over the years, this behavior was depressingly common. As he put it, \u201cCommanders would much rather believe they have a woman who\u2019s lying and crying rape than that there\u2019s a sex offender in their midst.\u201dBut Christensen knew that the story did not end for the victim even after a guilty verdict. In August he returned to South Dakota to attend a discharge-board hearing in which Brooks petitioned to be reinstated into the Air Force. Several officers came to testify on his behalf. And though Colonel Newberry had recently left the unit to accept a one-year fellowship at Harvard, he testified by speakerphone on behalf of Brooks. Christensen\u2019s disgust was evident. The prosecutor reminded the board that Brooks was now a felon who had lost his security clearance. Did the Air Force intend to keep him around as a mascot?The board sided with Christensen and issued Brooks an other-than-honorable discharge \u2014 the maximum it could assign, because the court-martial jury declined to issue the more punitive dishonorable discharge.Christensen stayed behind with Kris. She had just returned from deployment in Qatar, but her eyes conveyed a weariness deeper than jet lag. While Kris was gone, the wing commander visited Brooks in jail, as had several of his squadron buddies \u2014 a show of support that the victim herself had not once received. Kris was told that there had been an \u201call-operators\u201d meeting in her absence, in which the operations commander informed the squadron that Brooks was found guilty and sentenced to jail time. But, the commander added, there were two sides to every story, and people could continue to believe whatever they wanted, regardless of the jury\u2019s verdict.More important, Kris told Christensen that after years of glowing performance evaluations, she had recently been downgraded \u2014 Newberry wrote that she needed to keep her \u201cemotions in check.\u201d There was nothing Christensen could think to say. He had done his job. But this was not justice. As he would later remark: \u201cWhen the commander is so obviously supporting the accused over the victim, it sends a clear message that it\u2019s O.K. not to believe her and to shun her. And so why would a woman come forward, knowing what Kris has gone through?\u201dEfforts like Gillibrand\u2019s bill to reform the military judicial system, and the resistance by the military to those efforts, have produced sharply differing reactions in Congress. One group of senators, consisting of pro-defense stalwarts like Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Carl Levin, the Armed Services Committee chairman, responds to each sex-related scandal with momentary dismay followed by strong words of support for the Pentagon\u2019s efforts to self-police. At the opposite end are hard-charging reformists like Gillibrand and Speier, who do not even pretend to trust the military on this issue; as Speier (who has sponsored a bill in the House similar to Gillibrand\u2019s) puts it, \u201cThe Pentagon brass is really good at coming up to the Hill and saying, \u2018Zero tolerance,\u2019 which is completely meaningless when the conduct continues.\u201dIn the middle are two other distinct factions. Senator Claire McCaskill, an early denouncer of General Franklin\u2019s decision to overturn the Wilkerson verdict \u2014 but also a crafty Democratic survivor of electoral trench warfare in reddish Missouri \u2014 has staked out the moderate, cautiously optimistic position that, thanks to Congress\u2019s vigilant oversight in the past two years, the once-intransigent military is now chastened and reform is already occurring. She told me that the top levels of military leadership understand this. \u201cAmericans want to be proud of their military but can\u2019t be when we allow these crimes to go unpunished,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019ve come to the realization that they have to go after this a different way.\u201dMcCaskill has emerged as the most vocal critic of Gillibrand\u2019s approach to reform. Her alternative bill, the 2014 Victims Protection Act, keeps prosecutorial authority within the chain of command but establishes various review processes. It passed unanimously in the Senate just after the defeat of Gillibrand\u2019s bill and was subsequently sent over to the House in March, where no action has yet been taken.Above all, McCaskill and military leaders contend that commanders require such prosecutorial authority, both to maintain good order and discipline and to make sure that accusers will have their day in court, even in a losing cause. \u201cProsecutors are more interested in getting convictions than in cleaning house,\u201d says McCaskill, a former county prosecutor.That position is rejected by the fourth camp, led by the Republican senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, who are more trusting of the military than Gillibrand and Speier but less confident about the reforms in place than McCaskill. Cruz told me that he assumed the military was acting in good faith. \u201cBut what they\u2019re doing hasn\u2019t been working, and we need to take more serious steps. I approach this from the perspective of a father who has two young daughters \u2014 and I ask myself, When they come of age to join the military, what rule would I want in place to protect them from acts of violence from their fellow soldiers?\u201dCruz is a sponsor of Gillibrand\u2019s bill \u2014 one of the very few issues that the Texas conservative and the New York liberal agree on \u2014 and said that many of his colleagues who voted against it in March did so because they wanted to first see if the most recent reforms would have a significant impact. \u201cI think all of us will be looking closely at the new Pentagon data to see what it says. But assuming the problem persists, several senators have expressed a willingness to reconsider their vote.\u201dThus far the White House has appeared to be deferring to the Pentagon. When I spoke in August with Lynn Rosenthal, the White House adviser on violence against women who has been one of the president\u2019s point people on this issue, her observations hewed closely to the Defense Department\u2019s three main talking points. She said it was \u201cvery positive\u201d that in 2013, more women reported being sexually assaulted because it meant that victims are increasingly trusting the judicial process. But because the military does the gender-relations survey only every other year, there is no data on the total number of assaults last year, just on the number of those reported. There is not yet any evidence that the actual rate of reporting has changed for the better. She extolled special victims counsels as \u201cone of those landmark reforms\u201d that \u201cis really going to change things\u201d \u2014 despite the fact that they have very limited standing in court proceedings, according to three victims counsels with whom I spoke. And Rosenthal told me that from speaking with personnel throughout the armed forces, \u201cwe certainly hear that the climate has really changed and that the services have really taken this on.\u201d The White House adviser might have come to a different conclusion had she learned how a victim fared in the climate at Ellsworth Air Force Base.The following Monday, Christensen reported to his new job. He is now the president of Protect Our Defenders, a three-year-old nonprofit organization that has quickly become the nation\u2019s pre-eminent advocacy group on behalf of victims of sexual assault in the military, with an advisory board that includes Wesley Clark and several other retired generals, in addition to Magic Johnson, Sigourney Weaver and Garry Trudeau. He will be recruiting pro bono lawyers for victims, helping to write legislation and serving as the chief critic of the system in which he worked for the past 23 years.When I met with Kris three weeks later, she told me that she thought the loss of Christensen as a prosecutor would be felt among the women in the military. \u201cMeeting Colonel Christensen was my first experience seeing someone who outranked me and who was actually saying, \u2018We don\u2019t tolerate this stuff.'\u2009\u201d As we sat over coffee at a diner in Rapid City, S.D., Kris said she was still struggling in her unit. \u201cI hate being called \u2018the accuser,'\u2009\u201d Kris said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they called Satan in the Bible. Lieutenant Colonel Newberry told me, \u2018You\u2019ve accused Brooks of a very serious crime.\u2019 I said: \u2018I didn\u2019t accuse. I reported a very serious crime. This is me coming forward, telling you: You have a criminal working for you, and he does not belong in this squadron. He does not belong in the Air Force.'\u2009\u201dIt was October, two months after the conclusion of the major\u2019s case. Capt. David Brooks was still at Ellsworth Air Force Base, awaiting the final approval of his discharge. Kris had seen him once, coming out of a building. His presence on the base no longer made her fearful the way it did in the months after she reported the assault. Still, that a convicted criminal was allowed to linger on Air Force property infuriated her. Kris, meanwhile, wondered whether the Pentagon would even become aware of what happened to her. As did thousands of servicemen and servicewomen, she received the biennial survey of sexual harassment and unwanted sexual contact. It was soliciting information only for sexual assaults that had taken place beginning September 2013, five months after Brooks attacked her. It had now become a literal truth that she did not count.In the year since the assault, Kris had fallen into a kind of limbo. While most of her fellow aviators had been moved up to new positions, she was overlooked. She eventually requested a lateral move to another department to get away from her difficult situation. \u201cI was put on a shelf,\u201d she said, adding that she has been socially isolated. \u201cSince this happened, no one in the squadron invites me to do anything. And I don\u2019t think I ever will be invited.\u201dHer hurt was barely restrained as she continued in a jumble of thoughts: \u201cThey were my friends. We were family. It\u2019s like parents with two kids \u2014 how do you choose? A parent can\u2019t acknowledge that one of his kids did this. Doesn\u2019t want to have a daughter who\u2019s damaged goods. Doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge a failure in the family. My having brought this up is less than optimal. But this is the way these things happen. It\u2019s not going to be some stranger jumping out of the bushes. It\u2019s going to be someone you know. And there won\u2019t be witnesses and there won\u2019t be DNA. But there\u2019ll be a serious character flaw. And I\u2019m the one who saw it. And I hate that this happened to me. I hate that it\u2019s going to happen to other people.\u201dShe mentioned that she had recently spoken to her new commander about being given a job in the base\u2019s Sexual Assault Response Coordinator office. The commander, she said, said he would see what he could do. \u201cI\u2019d like to be able to help others,\u201d she told me. \u201cI\u2019d like to be part of the changes.\u201dKris remained hopeful, in spite of what happened to her, that reform could occur. For the first time in her life, she was following events in Congress. She told her story to Senator Gillibrand on the phone and expressed her support for the senator\u2019s legislation. But she also clung to the belief that there was an innate goodness in the Air Force that validated her dedication to the service. The military had seen something in her, as a Southern girl recruited out of college, and more than a decade later, she still saw something in it. She loved flying those 12-hour sorties over the desert, wedged into uncomfortable B-1 seats alongside three men, feeding intelligence and providing support to the soldiers on the ground. When they spoke back to her, she could hear in their voices that they felt safe with her overhead. As the weapon-systems officer on her plane, she dropped so many bombs during one period that an aviator took to calling her Bombshell, which she knew was meant out of respect.Just after the court-martial in April, she was deployed to Qatar for a couple of weeks. While at the base in al-Udeid, the wing commander held a briefing on sexual assault. As Colonel Newberry did the previous year, Gen. Roger Watkins placed a series of slides on a screen and read the required data word for word. But then he departed from the text. In a stern voice, the general told his troops that this matter was not a trivial one. \u201cThese little blue figures you see on the screen are more than little blue figures. They represent airmen working with us, every day. And sexual assault is not just blue on blue. It is fratricide.\u201dA crime against family. The words meant something to her. Whether they meant anything to her brothers \u2014 the young men in uniform sitting around her \u2014 she could not tell.An article on Nov. 30 about the military\u2019s prosecution of sexual-assault cases referred incompletely to the civilian authorities\u2019 handling of a case against Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski. While they did not go forward with a charge of sexual battery against Krusinski, they did charge him with assault and battery, for which a jury found him not guilty; it is not the case that they pursued no charges.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Cuban Doctors Are Lured to the U.S.", "Date": "2014-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetterTo the Editor:The editorial board would prefer that our government not help Cuban doctors defect to the United States because it causes a \u201cbrain drain,\u201d that is, a loss of human capital for the Cuban government. These defections are indeed costly to the Castro regime: Cuban doctors are essentially rented to foreign governments. The Cuban government pockets most of the money, leaving a much smaller amount for the doctors themselves.Cuban doctors are human beings, not an asset like a tractor or other machine. As such, they should be afforded the basic right to leave their country in search of better lives. The United States government should play no role in aiding a Cuban government program that for at least some doctors amounts to involuntary servitude.To the Editor:The archaic lack of normal relations and extremes of the Cold War are well represented by the United States policy that created a special Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program. That program entices medical personnel desperately needed in the developing world to defect while working overseas and provides taxpayers\u2019 money to help them establish new lives in the United States.Most of the world has tremendous respect for the Cuban medical teams, challenging death and epidemics in the worst of conditions. Immediately after the October 2005 earthquake in Kashmir, 1,000 Cuban doctors responded. In the same spirit, after Haiti\u2019s devastating 2010 earthquake, Cuba sent 1,200 people in medical teams, who were credited with treating about 40 percent of all cholera patients. Similarly, Cuban medical teams are working today in the midst of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.An island country of 11 million people, Cuba has 75,000 doctors. One-third of them, along with 10,000 other health workers, are providing health care in the very poorest countries. Many others work abroad in more favorable conditions.We in the United States should be deeply embarrassed that there were 188 votes at the 2014 United Nations General Assembly against continuing our embargo against Cuba, and only two votes in favor \u2014 and one of those was our vote!As an academic specialist on Cuba, I think it is high time to listen to global opinion and take the courageous and humanitarian step of normalizing relations with Cuba. To the Editor:It is remarkable how you were able to capture the real motivations behind the impasse between the United States and Cuba, and the frustration that many Cuban-Americans feel about the unjust 54-year-old economic embargo against Cuba.I left Cuba as a child through Operation Peter Pan, an exodus of more than 14,000 children during the 1960s. My journey began in 1962, but I still suffer the consequences of this traumatic experience. Like most Cubans then, I held resentment and tried every possible way to protest against the Castro regime, even belonging to some of the most fervent organizations in Miami.In time, I let go of that feeling, and was eventually able to understand how dreadful the economic embargo has been to the Cuban people and that confrontation is not the answer.As your editorial clearly pointed out, re-establishing diplomatic relations is overdue. It is time to give the Cuban government an opportunity to stimulate its economy, become more flexible and pave the way for the resurgence of Cuba, the Pearl of the Antilles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In France, Dam Is the Catalyst for a Flood of Young People\u2019s Anger ", "Date": "2014-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLISLE-SUR-TARN, France \u2014 The protests began a year ago in this quiet corner of southwestern France, as a small and peaceful gathering of hippies, environmental activists and utopians of all types set up tents to oppose the construction of a nearby dam.In August, after local authorities sent diggers and then crushing machines to level the soil and destroy trees, clashes erupted between protesters and the police, turning this vast stretch of woodland into what many here called a war zone.The death of Mr. Fraisse, which resulted in the temporary suspension of the construction work, has now turned what had been a local protest into a national drama, spawning vigils and front-page news coverage, while prompting criticism of the government of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande for its lack of response.But the death has also focused attention on the government\u2019s seeming failure to engage a broad segment of France\u2019s next generation, and the increasingly violent nature of protests inspired by antiglobalization movements, such as Occupy Wall Street, that have spread across France in recent years.Initially fueled by environmental concerns, the protests have come to embody the disenchantment and anger of young people who see few future opportunities and feel little kinship with the government.Many of those who gathered to oppose the dam call themselves \u201cZadistes,\u201d or partisans of the ZAD, the French acronym for zones \u00e0 defendre, or areas to defend. They say they have come to build an independent society. Increasingly, they are seen as environmental extremists, or \u201cgreen jihadists,\u201d as Xavier Beulin, the president of the main agriculture union, put it.\u201cFor once, we are fighting a project that represents symbolically what we reject,\u201d said Jordan Samson, a geography student in the southern city of Toulouse. \u201cOur movement is spreading to an entire generation.\u201dThe protests here are the latest aimed at a widening number of projects that the demonstrators criticize as monuments to the overweening ambitions of local politicians and their business connections.Last month, demonstrations in support of the Zadistes were held across France, including in Nantes, where more than a hundred protesters went on a rampage. In the nearby town of Gaillac, several shops and a memorial to war dead were vandalized. On Saturday, young protesters clashed again with the police in Nantes and Toulouse, in the south. Several years ago, the movement sprung up in Notre-Dame-des-Landes, near the western end of the central Loire Valley, where hundreds of young people and farmers gathered in a woodland outside Nantes to oppose government plans to build an airport. Clashes in Nantes left about a dozen protesters injured.The death of Mr. Fraisse has been subject to investigation and prompted the government to suspend the use of stun grenades against protesters nationwide.C\u00e9cile Duflot, a former environment minister and member of Parliament, called Mr. Fraisse\u2019s death a \u201cpermanent stain\u201d on the government, whose response was criticized as tardy and confused.The aftermath of the clashes in Lisle-sur-Tarn have spread fear among local farmers in one of France\u2019s most rural and poorest areas, where farming makes up about 88 percent of the local economy.The 8.4 million euro dam project here, designed by the local council of Tarn-et-Garonne, was aimed at creating an artificial lake to help irrigate lands for fewer than 100 local farmers.Protests against the project began in 2013, when a group of about 30 eco-warriors gathered in Lisle-sur-Tarn to oppose the dam on a river that flows through the forest of Sivens.But for many protesters here, the dam was designed to support the local corn farmers who practice what many here called \u201cintensive farming\u201d and would have threatened about 94 protected species of animals and plants.\u201cWe saw the trees falling one after the other,\u201d said Camille, 18, who would not give her last name for fear of running afoul of the authorities. \u201cIt was an environmental disaster.\u201dLike many others, Camille said she had come to the ZAD to denounce \u201cgrand projects that are useless and imposed.\u201d\u201cI have heard about the crisis ever since I was born,\u201d said Camille, who said she had just passed her final exams. \u201cAs long as there will be capitalist policies, there will be crisis.\u201dThe demonstrators felt vindicated last week when a report commissioned by the government found that the project was too expensive, that local needs for the dam had been overestimated and that alternative options had not been sufficiently explored. But the report also said it would be difficult to stop construction at this stage.On a recent morning, the atmosphere at the site where protesters set up tents was calm. Many gathered outside the \u201cM\u00e9tairie,\u201d an abandoned house that had been turned into a collective kitchen.Some sliced potatoes provided by farmers nearby, while others played a mouth harp. In one encampment, which protesters call the \u201cfront,\u201d because of its forward location near the proposed dam site, protesters replanted trees that had been bulldozed. Others were building a makeshift oven with a mix of water, sand and soil.The suspension of the dam project and the intrusion of protesters have angered many farmers who struggle to keep their businesses afloat in a poor land hit by frequent droughts in summer. Many fear the protesters will ultimately halt the construction of a dam that they see as necessary.\u201cHow do we live if we stop making corn?\u201d said Laurent, a local farmer who did not want to give his last name because he had been vandalized and feared retaliation. \u201cWhat do we want to create, a rural desert?\u201dOther farmers, too, reported that they had been recently vandalized, and had received anonymous, threatening letters.Since the protests erupted, Guy de Pierpont, 66, a local farmer who breeds partridges and pheasants, said he had been sleeping with a rifle and pepper spray by his window.A few days ago, the protesters opened his aviary illegally, and recently one of his two sons had spent time in a hospital after having fought with a group of protesters.\u201cThey don\u2019t come here for the dam \u2014 they come to fight,\u201d Mr. de Pierpont said. \u201cAnd they have massacred our forest.\u201dAurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Death by Data", "Date": "2014-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past decade or so, political campaigns have become more scientific. Campaign consultants use sophisticated data to micro-target specific demographic slices. Consultants select their ad buys more precisely because they know which political niche is watching which TV show. Campaigns trial test messages that push psychological buttons.Discussion around politics has also become more data driven. Opinion writers look at demographic trends and argue over whether there is an emerging Democratic majority. Pundits like me study the polling crosstabs, trying to figure out which way Asian-Americans are trending here and high-school-educated white women are trending there.Unfortunately, the whole thing has been a fiasco. As politics has gotten more scientific, the campaigns have gotten worse, especially for the candidates who overrely on these techniques. That\u2019s because the data-driven style of politics is built on a questionable philosophy and a set of dubious assumptions. Data-driven politics is built on a philosophy you might call Impersonalism. This is the belief that what matters in politics is the reaction of populations and not the idiosyncratic judgment, moral character or creativity of individuals.Data-driven politics assumes that demography is destiny, that the electorate is not best seen as a group of free-thinking citizens but as a collection of demographic slices. This method assumes that mobilization is more important than persuasion; that it is more important to target your likely supporters than to try to reframe debates or persuade the whole country. This method puts the spotlight on the reactions of voting blocs and takes the spotlight off the individual qualities of candidates. It puts the spotlight on messaging and takes the spotlight off product: actual policies. It puts the spotlight on slight differences across the socio-economic spectrum and takes the spotlight off the power of events to reframe the whole mood and landscape. This analytic method encourages candidates across the country to embrace the same tested, cookie-cutter messages.Candidates who have overrelied on these techniques have been hurt by them. One victim was Mitt Romney, who ran for president not as himself, but as a thin slice of himself. Another victim was President Obama. His 2012 campaign was legendary from an analytic point of view, and, of course, it was victorious. But it lacked a policy agenda and produced no mandate. Without a compelling agenda, the administration has projected an image of reactive drift and lost public confidence.The other victims include the Democratic senators in red states. Winning in a state that the other party dominates is a personal enterprise. It requires an ineffable individual connection with voters. It requires an idiosyncratic approach to issues. By eclipsing individual quirks with generic messages, the data-driven style deprives outnumbered candidates of precisely what they need to survive. The Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes could have made a real run at Senator Mitch McConnell in Kentucky if she\u2019d been a little more creative. Of course, data sets are important. Obviously demography matters a lot. But, at heart, politics is a personal enterprise. Voters are looking for quality of leadership, character, vision and solidarity that defies quantification. Candidates like Daniel Patrick Moynihan or Jerry Brown can arouse great loyalty in ways that are impossible to predict.In the midst of this scuffling economy, voters are thinking as Americans and not as members of a niche. They\u2019re asking: What can be done to kick-start America? They\u2019re not asking: How can I guarantee affordable contraception? People who are building campaigns on micro-targeting are simply operating on the wrong level of consciousness. The more you look at political history, the more you see that political imagination is the rarest and most valuable of qualities. Voters don\u2019t always know what they want, but they look to leaders to jump ahead of the current moment and provide visions they haven\u2019t thought of. Some politicians, like F.D.R. or Ronald Reagan, can reframe debates and envision coalitions that don\u2019t exist. Their visions emerge out of unique life experiences, which are unusual but have broad appeal. They build trust not through a few targeted messages but by fully embodying a moment and a people. They often don\u2019t pander to existing identities but arouse different identities. Today we have a lot of technical innovation, but not a lot of political creativity. The ecosystem no longer produces as much entrepreneurship \u2014 mutations that fuel evolution.Data-driven candidates sacrifice their own souls. Instead of being inner-directed leaders driven by their own beliefs, they become outer-directed pleasers driven by incomplete numbers. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Sales of Luxuries, Geography Matters ", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial SectionLuxury automakers from Audi to Mercedes-Benz reported record sales last year. Their vehicles made up more than one million of the 16 million sold in the United States in 2013, adding to the millions of older luxury vehicles already speeding along America\u2019s highways.So the question is, Who is buying all those very expensive cars? Perhaps surprisingly, the answer in many cases is people who are not all that well off, especially when regional income differences are taken into account.In data prepared for The New York Times, Kantar Media TGI, a market research firm, found that the income reported by people buying luxury goods \u2014 not just cars, but designer kitchen appliances and luxury vacations, too \u2014 was not particularly high compared with the price of these goods, and that purchases of specific luxury goods varied considerably by region.The median annual income of a luxury car owner in the United States, for example, is $99,364, while a Mercedes C-Class sedan, the carmaker\u2019s entry-level vehicle and its most popular model, starts at around $40,000.Leslie Albright, the head of TGI in the United States, said it was \u201cstriking\u201d that the median income of a luxury car owner was less than $100,000 a year. \u201cI know $99,000 is different in different parts of the country,\u201d she said. \u201cBut a luxury car could be half of someone\u2019s income. I would have thought that number to be a bit higher.\u201dOwners could, of course, be financing the purchases of those cars, but the payments would be far higher than for a comparable economy sedan. And while the price of such luxury items stays roughly the same across the country, the income of people buying them varies widely by state.\u201cWhere we live in the country impacts how we choose to spend our discretionary dollars,\u201d said Polly Flynn, a senior analyst at TGI and the person who analyzed the data. \u201cThe pursuit of luxury is perhaps most achievable, and in many cases most important, for consumers in the South.\u201dGeorgia led the TGI study in luxury car ownership \u2014 14.2 percent of people surveyed there owned one \u2014 but the median household income of the buyers was lower than the overall median, at $95,968. In Texas, the median income was the lowest for luxury car ownership \u2014 $83,891 \u2014 but in Ohio it was toward the upper end of the range, at $155,548.\u201cOwnership of luxury goods seems to be most unattainable for those living in the Midwest,\u201d Ms. Flynn said. She suggested this was because there was less willingness among people in those states to stretch themselves financially.Geographical differences showed up in other types of purchases, too. People in California, Florida and New York spent the most on vacations \u2014 about 25 percent more. And Californians and New Yorkers were also the most likely \u2014 at 8 percent and 9 percent of respondents \u2014 to have traveled to Europe in the last year.\u201cPeople living in the Northeast, where the incomes and cost of owning luxury goods are among the highest, are most confident when it comes to managing their spending sensibly,\u201d Ms. Flynn said. \u201cFor those in the West, experiences are what count, and they are more likely to prioritize their discretionary spending in this way.\u201dExplaining people\u2019s penchant for luxury goods \u2014 particularly people who are more aspirational than affluent \u2014 is trickier.When it came to smaller indulgences, income seemed less out of kilter with the indulgence, according to TGI. In Illinois, for example, the median income of someone who went to a coffee shop twice a week was $81,748 versus $65,423 for people who brewed their own. (Buyers of luxury cars in that state had a median income of $114,294.)Californians as a whole placed a higher priority on buying organic food, and the median income of someone in the state who shopped at Whole Foods Market was $90,000 \u2014 over $100,000 if that person lived in San Francisco. While the income of iPhone owners ranged from $65,000 in Texas to $85,000 in California, New York was the only state in the survey where the income of iPhone owners was not above the median. Ms. Flynn said the data suggested this was because an iPhone was seen as more of a necessity in New York. In Georgia, people who bought smart or 3-D television sets had incomes close to the median. That state also had the highest ownership level of those types of TVs, at 16 percent of respondents.The TGI survey was conducted among 20,000 adults across the country at all income levels and included questions about 3,000 brands in 17 product sectors. For The Times, TGI looked closely at eight states \u2014 California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas \u2014 to compare geographic differences. The company has been conducting similar surveys around the world since 1969.TGI\u2019s questions ventured beyond the quantitative in a few instances. It asked people in different states to agree or disagree with the statement, \u201cI am perfectly happy with my standard of living.\u201d Minnesotans topped the list, with 68 percent agreeing. But Connecticut, one of the wealthiest states in America by income, ranked 30th, with only 48 percent of respondents saying they were happy.\u201cI would have thought those numbers would have been higher,\u201d Ms. Albright said. \u201cForty-eight percent in Connecticut \u2014 that struck me, having lived there until recently. I wondered if that was the underlying angst in consumer society and wondering what is enough.\u201dDespite being happy with their living standards, only half of Minnesotans thought they were good at managing money. (They also came in first when asked to agree with the statement, \u201cI tend to spend money without thinking.\u201d)Yet it was Michigan, not New York, California or Washington, where the highest priority was placed on buying the newest technology, with 48 percent of respondents saying, \u201cI love to buy new gadgets and appliances.\u201d\u201cThe overall takeaway for me was it\u2019s expensive to own all of these luxury items,\u201d Ms. Flynn said. \u201cThe average American may not be able to own many of these things that other people take for granted, and there is a big difference depending on where you live in the country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Baseball Statistics Can Help Explain the Economy", "Date": "2014-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byObscure IndicatorsThere are some traditional, much-watched statistics people use to assess a pitcher: earned run average, for example, and win-loss record. Those are closely related to the team\u2019s overall goals: The idea is to allow the other team to score as few runs as possible and to win games. But they may not reveal as much about how good a pitcher will be in the future. For example, a pitcher who allows lots of long hits that fall just short of a home run may not be as good as his low earned run average suggests; those long hits could easily start going a little farther.Which brings us back to the economy. The core statistics we use to measure how the economy is doing are things like G.D.P. and job growth, both of which have been quite strong in recent months. That\u2019s good news, of course.But to predict whether the good times are set to last and whether the economy is accelerating, it can be more helpful to look at the economic equivalent of peripheral statistics: various surveys of businesses\u2019 incoming orders, the composition of recent growth and so on.Looking at these indicators, there are some definite reasons for optimism. Oil prices have been falling, which is a boon to consumers and should support continued growth in consumption spending, like that evident in the third quarter. An upward revision to third-quarter consumer spending strengthens the case for optimism on that front.Similarly, business investment contributed to third-quarter growth, and tends to persist over time.Then again, the growth rate of 3.9 percent looks unlikely to persist in the final months of 2014; the economy is not expected to receive the same boost from trade and from government spending that it did in the third quarter. Unlike with consumer and business spending, in those areas past performance does not generally foretell future results.Add it all up, and fourth-quarter growth is on track to be in the range of 2 to 2.5 percent (per the research firm I.H.S. Global Insight). For the full year, the United States also looks as if it will log another year of 2 percent-ish growth, about what it has experienced since 2010.\u201cHiring and investment intentions have also slipped to post-recession lows as U.S. companies worry in particular about the global economic climate,\u201d wrote Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.So celebrate the strong summer for American economic growth \u2014 but keep in mind that the recent economic performance may be the equivalent of a pitcher whose results between July and September were better than his underlying talent might suggest were warranted.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Brandy Gains a Foothold on American Cocktail Menus", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrance has done well by the American cocktail revival. French liqueurs, bitters and aperitifs that were gathering dust on the shelf (like Lillet and Benedictine) or weren\u2019t available in the United States (like Suze) now enjoy a renewed relevance.But France\u2019s big dog in the spirits world, brandy, has struggled for years to find a foothold in this country\u2019s cocktail culture. Cognac, Armagnac and Calvados come in as also-rans behind whiskey, gin, rum and tequila.The reasons for this are several. Some bartenders have perceived Cognac as being a bit old-fashioned, while others were put off by the overly sweet profile of the leading Cognac brands. But the main stumbling block is price; most French brandies are too expensive to be practical mixers. \u201cWe could have used a bourbon base or a rum base,\u201d Mr. Young said. \u201cBut I thought, why not use an Armagnac? We never see that in cocktails. And it\u2019s worked beautifully.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in spirits that have an appellation,\u201d Mr. Vogler said, \u201cwhere every aspect of production from the agricultural component to the bottling component has been considered.\u201dThat kind of attention and prestige often means prohibitive prices. Mr. Young said, \u201cIn the past, to put a brandy cocktail on the menu and have it be profitable, you\u2019d have to charge $18.\u201dMr. Vogler circumvented the cost issue another way. \u201cWhen we started thinking of opening a second place, we knew that was going to allow us much more economy of scale,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could buy barrels directly from producers and get pricing that would allow us to put the stuff in cocktails.\u201d Mr. Vogler is sitting on eight barrels of Cognac, Armagnac and Calvados. His cocktails sell for $12 to $14.Still, before you can sell it, you have to explain it. The first question you get when trying to pitch an Armagnac, Mr. Waugh said, is, \u201cWhat kind of Cognac is that?\u201d Mr. Vogler has had less trouble putting his brandy-heavy menu across. He credits the cocktail renaissance.\u201cOne thing it\u2019s accomplished is, in metropolitan areas, the consuming public is up for what\u2019s on the menu,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been amazed at how much brandy is selling.

And Harper\u2019s Weekly despairs that these immigrants are \u201csteeped in ignorance\u201d and account for a disproportionate share of criminals.Once again, the United States is split by vitriolic debates about how to handle immigrants, following President Obama\u2019s executive action to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. To me, the outrage seems driven by three myths:Many Americans see foreigners moving into their towns, see signs in Spanish, and fret about changes to the traditional fabric of society.That\u2019s an echo of the anxiety Theodore Roosevelt felt in 1918 when, referring to German and other non-Anglo European immigrants, he declared, \u201cEvery immigrant who comes here should be required within five years to learn English or leave the country.\u201d That\u2019s an echo of the \u201cyellow peril\u201d scares about Chinese and Japanese immigrants.It\u2019s true that undocumented immigrants may lower wages in some sectors, harming low-skilled native-born Americans who compete with them. One study suggests that a 10 percent increase in the size of a skill group lowers the wages of blacks in that group by 2.5 percent.Yet just look around. Immigration has hugely enriched our country. For starters, unless you are a full-blooded American Indian, we have you.Parasites? No, they\u2019re assets.Look, I\u2019ve reported in many dictatorships (and been detained in some of them). And Obama is no dictator.It\u2019s difficult for me to judge the legality of Obama\u2019s executive action, because I\u2019m not an expert on legal issues like prosecutorial discretion. But neither are critics furious at Obama. We have a broken, byzantine immigration system \u2014 anybody who deals with it is staggered by the chaos \u2014 because politicians are too craven to reform it. At least Obama is attempting to modernize it.We need empathy, and humility. My father, a refugee from Eastern Europe, was preparing a fraudulent marriage to an American citizen as a route to this country when he was sponsored, making fraud unnecessary. My wife\u2019s grandfather bought papers from another Chinese villager to be able to come to the United States.So remember: What most defines the 11 million undocumented immigrants in America is not illegality but undaunted courage and ambition for a better life.

{"Headline": "Cracks in the Stress Tests of European Banks", "Date": "2014-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameBut there is much more to the report than a pass/fail grade for Europe\u2019s banks. And some of the findings should trouble any investor interested in the accuracy and comparability of European banks\u2019 financial statements.A crucial aspect of the examination was an analysis of how each bank valued its assets, such as loans and interest-rate swaps and other derivatives holdings.The derivatives holdings on these institutions\u2019 books total hundreds of billions of euros. So it\u2019s critical that banks accurately assess the risks that arise in these holdings when a trading partner gets into financial trouble. (This assessment is called a credit value adjustment.)The analysis was discomfiting. The European Central Bank concluded that fully half of the sampled banks had inadequate practices when it came to calculating and adjusting their holdings for credit risks associated with derivatives trading partners.Here is another disturbing data point: More than one-quarter of the banks \u2014 28 percent \u2014 were found to be less conservative in their classifications of nonperforming loans than the central bank\u2019s definitions required. And roughly a quarter of the banks had substandard processes related to independent price assessments of assets. The problems were not inconsequential, the report concluded. Improper valuations of bank assets required adjustments of 48 billion euros ($60.5 billion) at the institutions, and the capital shortfalls identified at 25 banks under an adverse economic scenario totaled \u20ac25 billion as of year-end 2013. Twelve of the banks raised capital this year, reducing the shortfall figure.The integrity of large banks\u2019 financial statements could not be more important. Given the \u20ac22 trillion held in these banks and the vast interconnections among financial institutions, any missteps could disrupt world economies. (Mr. Papa said United States banks were better at setting money aside more quickly for loan losses and repairing their balance sheets than banks in many other regions.)The European Central Bank said its analysis was intended to strengthen banks\u2019 balance sheets, improve transparency in reporting and persuade investors that these institutions are sound.But the trillion-euro question remains for the future: What will financial supervisors do to ensure that banks report accurately on their assets and risk exposures? For the immediate future, banks with capital shortfalls have to submit plans detailing how those gaps will be covered. Shortfalls identified in an analysis of an \u201cadverse\u201d economic projection must be covered by the end of next July.But further regulatory policing will be necessary to assure investors that banks\u2019 assets are being properly valued year in and year out. \u201cIf this is a one-off exercise,\u201d Mr. Papa said, \u201cit is not sufficient to build investor confidence in the transparency of bank reporting.\u201dThe publication last week of the central bank\u2019s test results came ahead of its scheduled takeover of supervisory tasks this month, as part of the single regulator in the region. And in its report, the central bank said the results would be taken into account as it took up the supervisory role. Given the flaws in asset valuation uncovered by the study, the regulator has much work to do. Some banks, for example, were unable to assign proper values to the most basic assets. Accounting rules have three valuation buckets into which companies can put their assets. They are known as Levels 1, 2 and 3. Level 1 assets are typically the easiest to value, because they often trade on public exchanges or have otherwise observable prices. Assets assigned to Levels 2 and 3 do not trade regularly and are tougher to value. Assessing these holdings involves making estimates. Even though Level 1 assets are typically liquid and transparent, the European Central Bank disagreed with how the banks classified 13.5 percent of them in the study. This is a striking failure.The regulator also said that when reclassifying an asset\u2019s fair value, the banks erred on 10 percent of assets. One-third of the banks sampled did not have a clear policy or process for classifying assets traded in active markets, the report concluded.A report published in August by the CFA Institute presaged some of the central bank\u2019s findings. Over that period, Mr. Papa and his colleagues found wide variations in the way banks valued their assets. Yet these institutions\u2019 financial statements contained few details about the factors contributing to the valuation gaps.Most striking was the difference in how long it took for some institutions to recognize that a loan had become impaired and that setting money aside for a loss was necessary. That banks in different countries took such different approaches to write-offs raises questions about the accuracy of these institutions\u2019 financial statements, Mr. Papa said. \u201cThere was an indication within the E.C.B. report that there would be a follow-up on some of the areas of weakness,\u201d Mr. Papa said. \u201cClearly, some ground needs to be covered. Investors need a more active role by securities regulators and more robust disclosures.\u201dIn other words, the stress-test findings last week shouldn\u2019t be the end of a process. They should be the beginning. Advertisement"}

It has outlined a series of infrastructure investments in high-speed mobile and broadband networks to keep pace with rivals like Verizon Wireless in the United States and Vodafone in Britain.Deutsche Telekom is jockeying for position before expected changes in how Europe\u2019s telecom industry is regulated. That may lead to another round of consolidation between mobile carriers and cable operations as well as greater spending to keep pace with consumers\u2019 appetite for mobile access.These investments, coupled with continuing economic malaise in some of the company\u2019s European markets, led to a drop in its net profit for the three months through Sept. 30 to \u20ac506 million, or $633 million, compared with the same period last year. The figure included the sale of its Bulgarian assets.In Germany, where the likes of Telef\u00f3nica of Spain are also investing heavily in Europe\u2019s largest economy, Deutsche Telekom has been forced to keep pace with its own infrastructure upgrades.These investments and cutthroat pricing competition from rivals led to a 1.4 percent decline in the company\u2019s third-quarter pretax profit to \u20ac2.3 billion.

They also reflected $28 million in expenses related to the data breach.But the retailer is still tallying costs of the breach, said Carol B. Tom\u00e9, Home Depot\u2019s chief financial officer. She said known expenses related to the attack, including legal costs and spending on security technology, would cost $27 million more in the fourth quarter, or $6 million after an expected insurance reimbursement. For the year, Home Depot expects to pay $34 million in costs related to the breach outside insurance reimbursement, Ms. Tom\u00e9 said.Home Depot kept its outlook for the year unchanged, saying it expected diluted earnings per share to increase 21 percent, to about $4.54 a share, on sales growth of about 4.8 percent. That appeared to be a conservative estimate, given the executives\u2019 bullish tone before the holidays.Ms. Tom\u00e9 said that she was impressed so far by November sales, and that colder weather was helping to produce even more sales to consumers seeking to protect their homes from severe weather.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "First Aluminum-Body Ford F-Series Pickup Trucks Come Off Assembly Line", "Date": "2014-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite the timing, Ford is betting that its new aluminum-body F-series pickup truck will be a hit with consumers and an important step toward achieving new government fuel standards.\u201cEven with gas at $3 a gallon, fuel economy is still very important to people,\u201d William Clay Ford Jr., the automaker\u2019s executive chairman, said at the ceremonial introduction of the pickup at Ford\u2019s Dearborn Truck assembly plant.Mr. Ford said that gas consumption was the largest area of consumer dissatisfaction in the purchase of pickup trucks.And with Ford shooting for a 20 percent increase in fuel economy in the new truck over the current version of the F-series, the company hopes to get a jump on its hometown rivals General Motors and Chrysler in the pickup wars.But it is a big gamble, to make such a significant change to what has long been the best-selling vehicle in the United States.Ford has spent an estimated $1 billion overhauling its pickup plants in Dearborn and Kansas City to build the new vehicle, which is 700 pounds lighter than the previous model because of the use of aluminum body panels.It is the most extensive conversion to aluminum parts that Ford has ever taken on. But the company is confident that truck buyers will embrace the lighter truck and its plethora of new technology and features.\u201cIs this a risk? Yes,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a risk worth taking.\u201dAll automakers are scrambling to improve fuel economy throughout their lineups in an effort to meet new government rules that require their fleets to achieve an average of 54.5 miles a gallon by 2025.The average fuel economy in vehicles sold in October was 25.3 miles per gallon, according to the Transportation Research Institute at the University of Michigan.In addition to being the top-selling vehicle in the United States, Ford\u2019s F-series is also a huge source of profits for company, the nation\u2019s second-largest automaker behind General Motors.The current version of the truck gets a combined city-and-highway fuel economy of about 19 miles per gallon, when equipped with a standard V-6 engine.But by using aluminum extensively, the new model will achieve better results. The final mileage figures will be set by the Environmental Protection Agency before the new truck goes on sale next month.Mr. Ford and Mark Fields, the company\u2019s chief executive, said the truck would be just as reliable and powerful as previous versions of the F-series, which used steel for the body panels and pickup bed.Yet, the vehicle\u2019s capabilities still need to be proved under real-world conditions, particularly on construction sites. There are also questions as to whether dents and other damage in aluminum panels can be repaired as easily as steel.Still, the conversion to aluminum is seen within the industry as a critical development in the race by automakers to achieve significantly better fuel economy.\u201cIf it goes according to plan, Ford will have a substantial advantage in the area of lightweight materials,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.G.M. is expected to make greater use of aluminum in its next generation of pickup trucks. Mr. Ford declined to say what future Ford models might be next in line for a large conversion to lighter materials.The F-series event on Tuesday was a victory lap of sorts for Ford, which has managed to maintain its United States market share, for the most part, while introducing a blitz of new models in addition to the pickup.Ford is adding 850 jobs for the new truck at the Dearborn plant, which stopped production so employees could cheer as the plant\u2019s manager, Brad Huff, and a senior United Automobile Workers official, James Settles Jr., drove the first aluminum F-150 off the assembly line.Mr. Settles recalled darker times a decade ago, when Ford considered closing the historic plant in the heart of the Rouge assembly complex originally developed by Henry Ford.But sales of the F-series pickup not only sustained the plant, but also provided the profits that kept the company afloat financially.\u201cOver time, you will see that this is the one vehicle that saved the Ford Motor Company,\u201d Mr. Settles said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Builds Environmental Legacy With 1970 Law", "Date": "2014-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama could leave office with the most aggressive, far-reaching environmental legacy of any occupant of the White House. Yet it is very possible that not a single major environmental law will have passed during his two terms in Washington.\u201cIt\u2019s the granddaddy of public health and environmental legislation,\u201d said Paul Billings, a vice president of the American Lung Association. \u201cIt empowers the E.P.A. and states to be bold and creative.\u201dGina McCarthy, the E.P.A. administrator, credits the act for the authority that Mr. Obama claims in setting environmental policy. \u201cThe administration is relying very heavily on this tool that Congress provided us 44 years ago,\u201d she said.Jody Freeman, director of Harvard University\u2019s environmental law program, and a former counselor to the president, said Mr. Obama was using the Clean Air Act \u201cto push forward in a way that no president ever has.\u201dTaken together, the Clean Air Act regulations issued during the Obama administration have led to the creation of America\u2019s first national policy for combating global warming and a fundamental reshaping of major sectors of the economy, specifically auto manufacturing and electric utilities. The regulations could ultimately shut down existing coal-fired power plants, freeze construction of new coal plants and end demand for the nation\u2019s most polluting fuel.Republicans and the coal industry have attacked the new rules as a \u201cwar on coal.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s most recent regulation, proposed on Wednesday, would reduce ozone, a smog-causing pollutant that is created by emissions from factories and coal plants and is linked to asthma, heart disease and premature death. That regulation is the latest of six new rules intended to rein in emissions of hazardous pollutants from factory and power-plant smokestacks, including soot, mercury, sulfur and nitrogen oxide.The most consequential regulations are those that cut emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas dispersed from automobile tailpipes and coal plants and which contributes to global warming.More rules are on the way: By the end of the year, the E.P.A. is expected to announce plans for regulating the emission of methane at natural gas production facilities.Republicans and industry leaders have fought back against the rules, attacking them as \u201cjob-killing\u201d regulations. \u201cThe Clean Air Act is a direct threat,\u201d said Hal Quinn, president of the National Mining Association.Among the fiercest critics is Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, who is expected to take over as majority leader in the next Congressional term and whose home state is a major producer of coal. Mr. McConnell has vowed to put forth legislation to block or delay the administration\u2019s regulations.Although the E.P.A. regulations are today the target of Republican ire, in 1970 the Clean Air Act passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, clearing the Senate with a vote of 73 to 0. President Richard M. Nixon, a Republican, signed the bill into law. \u201cThe idea was to give E.P.A. broad authority, making sure that it had tools to exercise this authority,\u201d said Robert Nordhaus, an environmental lawyer who, as a staff lawyer in the House legislative counsel\u2019s office, helped draft the law. Today Mr. Nordhaus is a senior partner at the environmental law firm Van Ness Feldman.Another Republican president, the first George Bush, enacted a 1990 update to the Clean Air Act, which strengthened the E.P.A.'s authority to issue regulations. Mr. McConnell was among the 89 senators who voted for passage of the 1990 law. \u201cI had to choose between cleaner air and the status quo,\u201d Mr. McConnell said at the time. \u201cI chose cleaner air.\u201dThe 1990 iteration of the Clean Air Act also included requirements that the E.P.A. issue, and periodically update, regulations on pollutants such as ozone and mercury. Some of Mr. Obama\u2019s new regulations are a result of that requirement.Mr. Obama, however, is the first president to use the law to fight global warming. After trying and failing to push a new climate-change law through Congress aimed at curbing greenhouse gas pollution, the president went back to the Clean Air Act.The E.P.A. issued a Clean Air Act regulation in Mr. Obama\u2019s first term. The agency required automakers to comply with tough new vehicle fuel-economy standards of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. The regulations compelled the auto industry to research and develop hybrid and electric vehicles. Those requirements alone are expected to lead to a major reduction of carbon pollution in the coming decades.Next year, the E.P.A. is to finalize two regulations aimed at limiting pollution from new and existing coal-fired power plants. Once they are enacted, the regulations could eventually transform the way electricity is produced, transmitted and consumed in the United States, leading to more power generation from alternative sources like wind, solar and nuclear.But the regulations could also cause costly disruptions in power reliability and transmission, forcing companies to look for breakthroughs in technology to meet the requirements.Officials at the Edison Electric Institute, which lobbies for privately owned electric utilities, said the regulations were forcing the industry to drastically reshape the way it does business. \u201cHe\u2019ll have dozens of these rules under his watch,\u201d Quin Shea, vice president of the institute, said of the president. \u201cTaken together, they will have a far-reaching effect of transforming the electric power sector for the next 20 years.\u201dAn article on Thursday about President Obama\u2019s new environmental regulations misstated how ozone gets into the air. Ozone is a smog-causing pollutant created by emissions from factories and coal plants; it is not itself emitted into the air. The error also occurred in an article and headline on Wednesday about the announcement of the regulations.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Jesuit Inspiration", "Date": "2014-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSANTA CLARA, Calif. \u2014 At the age of 19 I left college at Stanford to become a Jesuit. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t love being a student there; I did. But somehow it wasn\u2019t enough. By contrast, the Jesuit high school I attended in San Francisco stressed a very clear educational objective: to form men and women for others. We learned, among other things, that an education not oriented toward justice for others was a farce. Despite Stanford\u2019s extraordinary resources and possibilities, I missed the clarity of purpose. I left to enter the Jesuit order. Never have I regretted the decision.That was in 1983. Since then I have spent most of my life in higher education. But as much as I love teaching and scholarship, my relationship with academia has been an awkward one. In many respects I find academic culture to have the same flaw that Catholic clerical culture does: the tendency to turn in on itself and guard its privileges rather than spend its energies in humbly serving the world.Occasionally, however, great leaders rise up and challenge us to be more.On Nov. 16, 1989, the Jesuit rector of the Universidad Centroamericana in El Salvador, the Rev. Ignacio Ellacur\u00eda, was dragged from his bed in the middle of the night and shot point-blank in his garden by an elite military squad. Five other Jesuit priests and educators, along with their housekeeper and her daughter, were ordered to lie face down on the lawn and were killed execution-style.The clear aim of the assassination was to silence Father Ellacur\u00eda. He was outspoken in his denunciation of atrocities on both sides of the Salvadoran civil war, which raged for over 10 years and claimed the lives of more than 75,000 people. At issue was a society in which a dozen or so families virtually owned the country and treated their peasant laborers as if they were feudal serfs. The Salvadoran military, materially supported by the Cold War foreign policy of the United States, felt compelled to protect the status quo by attempting to disable a university committed to being a positive social force.Trained as a philosopher, Father Ellacur\u00eda was known to be a tough thinker and natural leader, who persuaded his colleagues to embrace his vision of what a university should be. In his first year as rector, the university stated that as an institution it would offer a \u201cresponse to the historical reality of the country.\u201d The state of the country was judged to be \u201can unjust and irrational reality that should be transformed.\u201d Thus, the university\u2019s purpose was \u201cthat of contributing to social change in the country. It does this in a university manner and with a Christian inspiration.\u201dWhile Father Ellacur\u00eda has often been identified with \u201cliberation theology,\u201d that phrase is often mistaken as a cipher for Marxism. He was committed to what in larger Catholic circles has often been called a \u201cpreferential option for the poor\u201d \u2014 the principle that a society or an institution must ultimately be judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members, not those with access to power and privilege. In this analysis, the capitalist system does not emerge without criticism, but another Jesuit (who certainly does not identify as a liberation theologian), Pope Francis, has been advancing the same principle. To many, the pope\u2019s challenge is unsettling, but he is hardly a Marxist. In his own time, when Father Ellacur\u00eda was so accused, he replied, \u201cI am not a Communist; I am a Christian.\u201dThe other Jesuit scholars who were killed with him also applied their academic skills to real-world problems. For instance, the Rev. Ignacio Mart\u00edn-Bar\u00f3 was a social psychologist whose research focused on the psychic conditions of living in a context of structural violence. The Rev. Segundo Montes taught anthropology with a view to the effects of social stratification and the displaced victims of the civil war. The Rev. Amando L\u00f3pez Quintana was the chairman of the philosophy department but worked on weekends as a parish priest and championed a mass-literacy campaign.At the time, I was a young Jesuit studying classics at Oxford and worrying about the quality of the weekly essays I wrote for my tutor. The deaths in El Salvador reminded me that there were more substantive things in life. I was shocked and outraged by the news. But I also felt proud that scholars mattered so much that they could be a threat to the Salvadoran Army. I was deeply moved by the courageous example of Father Ellacur\u00eda, who saw the responsibility of his institution as lending intellectual support to those who did not have the academic qualifications to legitimize their rights. His life has challenged me to keep my sights not on conventional measures of success but on what really matters: the contribution I am making to the world.Even more, his vision of what a university could be has inspired me, especially at a time when education is increasingly treated as a commodity, rather than the cultivation of a moral vision. While students, more than ever, are anxious about economic concerns and rightly ask whether a university education will get them a job, economic satisfaction or the learning of a marketable skill set will not, ultimately, satisfy them. A strong sense of purpose and commitment to their community will.As the future of higher education remains so uncertain, and as the financial pressures of running universities increase, I find great courage in those schools that strive to be driven by something more than the market economy. Father Ellacur\u00eda championed the vision of a university that would be an \u201cinescapable social force\u201d for good. That is no less important in 2014 than it was in 1989. I still believe that an education not grounded in justice is a farce and that we desperately need wise, courageous, even heroic academic leaders to realize the highest purposes of education.Advertisement"}

One of the drags on growth in the September quarter was manufacturing output, which increased 0.1 percent, compared with 3.5 percent in the preceding quarter. Also, a delayed monsoon season and uneven rainfall caused agricultural output to slow to a 3.2 percent increase from a year earlier, from a 3.8 percent rise in the previous quarter.India has experienced a period of economic malaise, with the pace of growth below 5 percent for the past two fiscal years, the lowest since the 1980s. India\u2019s fiscal year begins in April.Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s landslide election in May was based largely on his promise to kick-start the economy, in part by increasing the ease of doing business and providing jobs to the young. India\u2019s business community regarded his victory with optimism, and the stock markets reflected the enthusiasm, rising to new highs.The euphoria was tempered after it became apparent that Mr. Modi\u2019s government was not going to rush to introduce big-bang reforms. In his first six months in office, Mr. Modi has announced some small measures aimed at improving business sentiment, like simplifying convoluted labor laws and deregulating fuel pieces.These steps have yet to have an effect on the ground, and economists and executives are looking for more sweeping reforms to reinvigorate capital investment, increase business confidence and encourage industry. Indian businesses are awaiting new legislation dealing with land acquisition, coal and power supply, transportation, simplification of taxation and foreign direct investment in the insurance sector, some of which might be taken up in the current winter session of Parliament.With weak economic growth in the last quarter and consumer inflation having slowed to 5.5 percent in October, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is expected to ask the central bank governor, Raghuram Rajan, to ease monetary policy and cut the benchmark interest rate from 8 percent. But most economists believe that the central bank will leave the rate unchanged at a policy meeting on Tuesday and wait to see if inflation rates can stay low even if global oil prices start rising again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As a Writer, What Influences You Other Than Books?", "Date": "2014-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBookendsEach week in Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. This week, Thomas Mallon and James Parker discuss what influences their work \u2014 aside from other books.By Thomas MallonI keep photos around me while I write the way other authors keep music on in the background, as a kind of atmospheric stimulation.A few months ago, on the 100th anniversary of Archduke Ferdinand\u2019s assassination, the dramatic photo of his killer\u2019s arrest was widely reproduced. I first came upon this picture \u2014 full of sabers, lungings and chaos \u2014 more than 50 years ago, in a book that sat in the back of my sixth-grade classroom. I looked at it repeatedly, not only because the event depicted seemed so hard to imagine (President Kennedy\u2019s killing was a year in the future), but also because I knew that 1914 was exceptionally early for such an on-the-spot, unposed news picture to have been taken.Decades later, when I wrote a novel that involved Lincoln\u2019s killing at Ford\u2019s Theater, I longed for an equivalent photo \u2014 something as sudden, kinetic and revealing. But neither Mathew Brady nor Alexander Gardner had any reason to set up his camera equipment that night; only John Wilkes Booth and his co-conspirators knew that history would be made. Three months later, after a military trial, Gardner had enough notice to train his lens on the scaffold in the yard of Washington\u2019s Arsenal Penitentiary. Swinging from nooses, the bodies of four of Booth\u2019s accomplices, writhing and dying, blurred some of the photographic results.I read old photographs for unexpected details, such as the faces in the crowd, the people witnessing what a historical novelist can only try to reconstruct. I keep photos around me while I write the way other authors keep music on in the background; they provide not only evidence but a kind of atmospheric stimulation. I don\u2019t think I could have written \u201cBandbox,\u201d a comic novel about the 1920s, without long exposure to that era\u2019s madcap tabloid photography, and I can\u2019t imagine \u201cFellow Travelers,\u201d a novel I set during the McCarthy period, without the flash-lit, noirish Weegee photo that went onto the cover of both the hard-bound and paperback editions. For \u201cWatergate,\u201d the details of dress and facial expression in a photo of \u201cthe Rose Mary Stretch\u201d \u2014 the president\u2019s secretary attempting to re-enact how a gap in one of the Nixon tapes might have been created \u2014 told me more about Rose Mary Woods\u2019s agonized embarrassment than any transcript of her testimony could.Because the historical novelist finally traffics in fiction, not history, it\u2019s his business to enhance and augment pictures, to Photoshop them verbally into a connected exhibition of plausible fakes. A few months ago, researching a novel-in-progress at the Reagan Library in California, I was perusing contact sheets made by a White House photographer on Monday, Oct. 13, 1986, just after the president\u2019s return from his Icelandic summit with Mikhail Gorbachev. Amid all the usual grip-and-grin photos, the moment-by-moment record of presidential bustle, I noticed a quick series of shots in which Nancy Reagan is having an animated and clearly unpleasant exchange with the White House chief of staff, Donald Regan. The pictures, which almost look as if they were captured by a security camera, practically invite the addition of a soundtrack.Photography hasn\u2019t made me a more visual or descriptive author. (One copy editor who worked on several books of mine pointed out that the only hair color I ever seem to mention is red.) But photographs have given me an energizing sense of verification, an almost childish reason to believe that whatever piece of the past I\u2019m thinking about has actually happened. When I was growing up, we sometimes made the Stations of the Cross during Lent, and it was the sixth of those that truly stopped me in my tracks, the moment when Christ imprinted the image of his face on Veronica\u2019s veil: a miracle. My biblical namesake is the apostle of doubt, and it probably says something that the earliest fictional scene I\u2019ve written takes place in 1845, a decade after the first daguerreotype portraits. Perhaps I\u2019ve gone no further back because I\u2019m afraid to do without photography\u2019s ability to prove the world.\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6By James ParkerFrom my fellow bakers, I learned about industry and cohesion and the moral obligation to be cheerful.My greatest nonliterary influence is John the Baptist. What an excellent line: How I wish it were true. John in his wild-beast jockstrap, with his desert stare, picking locust legs from between his teeth. . . . To enter the moral sphere of this guy would be like joining the French Foreign Legion. And I\u2019m not hard enough for that. So without (I hope) being too churningly autobiographical about it, I\u2019ll say that my greatest nonliterary influences have been drummers, comedians and bakers.Drummers first. Grant Hart from H\u00fcsker D\u00fc: the drummer as emotional integer. Thundering, bucketing, purely expressive, less a timekeeper than a blood supply, barefooted and singing beautifully as the band went into screaming Byrdsian overdrive. George Hurley of the Minutemen: superfluity of ideas, epigrammatic economy, held in paradoxical punk-funk tension. Reed Mullin from Corrosion of Conformity: the John Bonham of hardcore, a prodigy of feel and power. When American punk went metal in the mid-'80s \u2014 \u201ccrossover\u201d \u2014 and colorless pummeling became the norm for drummers, Mullin alone could make the new mixture swing. And swing is all. Swing is life. No heaviness without swing.So those are particular drummers, musicians whose playing patterned or conformed my teenage brain to a certain set of rhythmic expectations, of buildups and pressures and crashes/releases. Do I write prose the way George Hurley plays the drums? Jesus, if only. But he\u2019s in there \u2014 in here \u2014 somewhere.And finally, bakers. Nothing is more nobly nonliterary than manual labor, and the years I spent baking at Clear Flour Bread in Brookline, Mass., were sky-blue. What a great job. Startlingly physical, to begin with, with plenty of hauling and swabbing and rushing around; the bakery itself was like a ship in a Patrick O\u2019Brian novel, fierce and insular, microcultural, every moment accounted for, every inch of space pressed into service. You sweated and clanked, and the flour flew up in slow clouds, until everyone\u2019s face had received a kind of aristocratic powdering. The rewards were enormous: the fine, fuse-like crackle of a rack full of handsome brittle baguettes, which you have just pulled out of the oven \u2014 that\u2019s a beautiful sound. Television\u2019s \u201cMarquee Moon\u201d coming out of the bakery boombox at 1 in the morning, with your muscles so warmed up they seem to act as vibrational channels for the music \u2014 that too is a beautiful sound.

{"Headline": "Ukraine to Freeze Payments in Separatist Areas", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArseniy P. Yatsenyuk, the prime minister, said payments totaling $2.6 billion, mostly for public sector wages and pensions, would be withheld from separatist-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk Provinces. Formally shoving that obligation onto the separatist leadership has been the most significant response to date to rogue elections held over the weekend here, which President Petro O. Poroshenko called a \u201cfarce\u201d that violated a peace agreement.\u201cSo long as the territories are controlled by those who appointed themselves, the government will not provide subsidies,\u201d Mr. Yatsenyuk saidBefore the war, about 4.5 million people lived in territory now controlled by separatists. It is unclear how many remain. Still, this population would present a potentially large, off-the-books expenditure for the Russian budget, already strained by Western sanctions over Ukraine, falling oil prices and a declining ruble.Russia, having a population of 143 million and already sustaining the two million people living on the annexed Crimean Peninsula, has for now made no formal commitment to do so.Mr. Yatsenyuk said payments to Ukrainian pensioners and public sector workers would resume only after separatist leaders surrendered control over the territory. He said that Ukraine would pay \u201cevery person the social benefit he has a right to,\u201d but that transferring funds to the area now would be \u201cdirect support for Russian terrorism.\u201dUkraine on Wednesday also announced a morning and evening rationing of electricity provided from the mainland to the Crimean Peninsula.A paradox of the six-month war in the east has been that Russia and Ukraine are fighting for a region reliant on subsidies. Mr. Yatsenyuk\u2019s announcement forces Russia to confront the problem of what to do with eastern Ukraine, a rust belt of outmoded, inefficient and noncompetitive industries like coal mines, steel mills and rail car manufacturers that had survived the post-Soviet period on a patchwork of subsidies from Russia and Ukraine.\u201cFor those who want to punish Russia, and nothing else, that\u2019s the answer: Hand over Ukraine to the Russians,\u201d Clifford G. Gaddy and Barry W. Ickes of the Brookings Institution wrote last spring in a study of the eastern region\u2019s economies. \u201cIt would suck them dry.\u201dMr. Poroshenko foreshadowed the funding cutoff and electricity squeeze at a national security council meeting Tuesday, outlining Kiev\u2019s response to the rebel elections: \u201ceconomic pressure,\u201d tighter control of checkpoints, a suggestion that Parliament repeal a law granting greater autonomy to the separatist regions, and deployment of military reinforcements to the east.Neither side has formally withdrawn from cease-fire agreements signed in Minsk on Sept. 5 and Sept. 19, and Russian, Ukrainian and separatist military leaders met Wednesday in Donetsk under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to discuss ways to resolve disputes. But heavy fighting takes place daily along the front line nevertheless.On Wednesday, explosions near the airport rattled windows throughout the city, which is under the rebels\u2019 control and claimed as their capital even though the airport remains under Ukrainian control. The Donetsk city hall said that two teenagers were killed and three others wounded in a school sports field near the airport that was hit by a rocket.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Control, Republican Lawmakers See Budget as Way to Push Agenda", "Date": "2014-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Next year, House Republicans will try again to transform Medicare and Medicaid, repeal the Affordable Care Act, shrink domestic spending and substantially cut the highest tax rates through the budget process. Then they will leave it to the new Senate Republican majority to decide how far to press the party\u2019s small-government vision, senior House aides said this week.House Republican officials said the first budget blueprint of the 114th Congress will not stray far from the plans drafted by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and the departing Budget Committee chairman. Those plans, passed along party lines three times since Republicans took control of the House in 2011, were never going anywhere with the Senate in Democratic hands.With this month\u2019s Republican sweep in the midterm elections, the stakes have changed.\u201cThey\u2019re firing with real budget bullets,\u201d said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. \u201cReal people will get hurt.\u201dSenator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, a Budget Committee member, said Tuesday that House and Senate Republicans dealing with the budget would \u201ctry and coordinate as much as possible,\u201d and \u201chew to some basic principles,\u201d the first being achieving a balanced budget in 10 years.Congressional Republicans intend to present a plan to overhaul Medicare, calling for voucherlike \u201cpremium supports\u201d to steer people 65 and over into buying commercial health insurance, and to transform Medicaid, which would be cut and turned into block grants to state governments. They also intend to set up a new commission to study options on Social Security, while relying on what one House Republican aide called \u201cthe solid foundation\u201d of the Ryan budget plan.The fate of the effort will rest in the new Republican Senate. The incoming Senate Budget Committee chairman, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, has been a staunch defender of the Ryan plans, but after a speech Wednesday on Capitol Hill, the senator sounded a cautious note, suggesting he would not approach his new post the way Mr. Ryan has.He called it \u201can overreach\u201d to think the Senate Budget Committee would dictate the terms of an overhaul of the tax code, Medicare or other programs that drive the budget deficit.\u201cCongressman Ryan of the Budget Committee last year, really over the past several years, really used that position to advance his views about how Medicare ought to be fixed, and I thought they were very valuable and very thoughtful,\u201d he said. But, he added, that is not likely to be his approach.Beyond the Senate Budget Committee, the House\u2019s plans will immediately test the skills of the prospective Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, in balancing conservatives against moderate Republicans like Susan Collins of Maine and Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic states.For his part, President Obama has other plans. The deficit has fallen from $1.4 trillion in 2009 \u2014 or nearly 10 percent of the economy then \u2014 to $483 billion, or 2.8 percent of the economy, in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. Measured against the economy, the deficit is now below the average over the last 40 years, and as long as the debt continues to fall relative to the economy, Mr. Obama appears to be more concerned about other economic matters.The White House is sticking to its principle that any deficit reduction has to include tax increases to soften budget cuts, and that no belt-tightening should be undertaken that would jeopardize the economic growth just now picking up momentum.The president\u2019s real economic policy emphasis will be a broad overhaul of the corporate tax code to free up revenues for long-term spending on roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects. Mr. Van Hollen said Democrats would not bend in their opposition to spending cuts that they say would be largely used to cut taxes for the rich.And, Mr. Van Hollen said, those arguments will have resonance once Americans realize the fight has moved from symbolic to real.The Ryan budget faced a vote in the Senate in 2013, and five Republicans voted against it: Ms. Collins; Dean Heller, a moderate-leaning Nevadan; Mike Lee of Utah; Rand Paul of Kentucky; and Ted Cruz of Texas, who saw the plan as too timid. It failed on an advisory vote, 40 to 59.On the other hand, four Republican newcomers to the Senate \u2014 Representatives Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Steve Daines of Montana, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Cory Gardner of Colorado \u2014 are already on the record supporting the Ryan approach, with a fifth, Representative Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, in a runoff for the last outstanding Senate seat.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a strong commitment to get a budget done for no other reason than they\u2019ve made such a big deal about the other side failing,\u201d said Hazen Marshall, a former Senate Budget Committee staff director who has been consulting with the incoming committee leadership. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be easy. At the end of the day, you\u2019ve got to get a majority.\u201dThe budget, one of Congress\u2019s first orders of business, sets top-line spending limits, with advisory policy details. But it has one powerful mechanism, a parliamentary procedure called reconciliation that shields legislation from a Senate filibuster.In 2012, the House budget ordered six committees to produce policy changes that would save $261 billion over 10 years to avert automatic spending cuts at the Pentagon. The results would have pushed 1.8 million people off food stamps and cost 280,000 children their school lunch subsidies and 300,000 children their health insurance coverage.Elimination of the social services block grant to state and local governments would hit child abuse prevention programs, Meals on Wheels and child care.A quarter of the cuts in the bill would come from programs for the poor. Cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and subsidized insurance premiums under the health care law made up more than a third of the package\u2019s savings.Had the Senate gone along with the budget plan that ordered those cuts, the resulting bills could not have been filibustered by opponents.Mr. Johnson said the parliamentary tactic will be used next year. The question is how. Republicans could again use it to push through budget cuts and changes to entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid, or they could use it to advance changes to the tax code that cut revenue.\u201cThere\u2019s a very heightened focus on, \u2018The dog caught the bus. Now what are we going to do?\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said.Mr. Van Hollen said Republicans would have little choice but to push ahead with past budget plans. To do otherwise would indicate that earlier efforts were politics, not policy priorities.\u201cThey can\u2019t say now that they have the power to implement those budgets, they\u2019re not going to do it,\u201d he said.Chris Chocola, the president of Club for Growth, a political action committee that bankrolled many of the Republican campaigns, pointed to the tax cuts of Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas and the confrontations that Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan had with his state\u2019s public employee unions as models for the Republican Congress. Mr. Brownback is now dealing with budget deficits, but Mr. Chocola noted that the governor was re-elected.That is all well and good, said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, but even with the tool of reconciliation, congressional Republicans will face President Obama\u2019s veto pen.\u201cIf we need reconciliation instructions to pass it in the Senate, the chances the president would sign it into law are not very good,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reality.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Public Land Sale, Not All of Spain Is Buying ", "Date": "2014-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCASTELLAR DE LA FRONTERA, Spain \u2014 La Almoraima, a farming estate at the edge of a nature reserve, is prized by environmentalists. Home to one of Europe\u2019s largest cork forests, it is a rare place where deer and boar roam wild within sight of the Rock of Gibraltar.The Spanish government, which owns the land, wants to sell it for as much as 300 million euros, or about $376 million, pitching it as a perfect spot for a luxury resort, including a five-star hotel, a small airport, two golf courses and a polo grounds.The proposed sale is part of a rise in public land deals that politicians around the country are promoting in hopes of filling their treasuries and accelerating an economic recovery. But they are meeting strong opposition from environmentalists and others who say the deals evoke the kinds of excesses that got Spain\u2019s economy into trouble in the first place. After its real estate bubble burst in 2008, the country was littered with unsold condominiums, empty arts centers and unused highways.Now that the economy appears to be recovering, it is back to business as usual, the opponents say.\u201cThe government hasn\u2019t learned any lesson from the property bubble,\u201d said Alejandro S\u00e1nchez P\u00e9rez, one of the founders of Equo, a Spanish environmentalist party. \u201cIts goal is still to promote speculative property deals,\u201d he said, \u201cwith a strong focus on tourism, even if that involves handing over patrimony like La Almoraima that should clearly belong to all Spaniards, as it has genuine ecological rather than financial value.\u201d There have been no allegations of corruption in the proposed sale of the land. But opposition is fed in part by a proliferation of corruption cases in the aftermath of Spain\u2019s economic crisis that showed the real estate boom to be a result of more than just reckless investment. It was also fueled by a lucrative, three-way relationship in which builders acquired construction permits from politicians and financing from banks, often also supervised by the politicians.From 2000 to 2008, Spain added about four million houses along its coastline, despite accusations by environmental groups that the building frenzy amounted to an illegal privatization of Spanish shores. In addition to concerns about the new land sales, regional governments and the administration of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy are facing criticism for helping to regularize those deals, some of which violated regulations. The government of Andalusia, Spain\u2019s largest region, recently introduced legislation to adjust the status of as many as 25,000 houses built illegally before the crisis. Many of the houses were acquired by sun-seeking pensioners from Northern Europe, who claim to have never suspected irregularities.Spain\u2019s politicians see the new sales of public lands as a chance to shed unproductive assets, replenish their coffers, stimulate tourism and get the construction industry moving again.At La Almoraima, farming activities have been struggling, and Spain\u2019s government is hoping to auction off the estate by early next year. Last year, the government injected \u20ac2.3 million of subsidies to keep the place running.For now, La Almoraima, with its lake surrounded by a vast expanse of forest, stands in contrast to the extravagance of Marbella and other resorts along the Costa del Sol, about half an hour\u2019s drive away. Here, rather than shop, visitors come for the donkey rides or hunting season. The estate was expropriated from Rumasa, a collapsing conglomerate, by the government in 1983.Isabel Ugalde, the administrator of the property, said that turning the low-key estate into \u201ca trophy tourism asset\u201d would help attract more foreign investors to a real estate market only recently emerging from the doldrums.A luxury resort, Ms. Ugalde argued, would not damage the surroundings because the new infrastructure would be built on only a tenth of the estate\u2019s 14,113 hectares, or 34,874 acres, while the rest would remain as a nature park.\u201cIf you go to Asia, you can see amazing resorts built without any environmental damage,\u201d Ms. Ugalde said.Among those interested in the estate is one of France\u2019s richest men, Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, and his wife, the actress Salma Hayek. The couple took a helicopter flight over the property earlier this year to decide whether to bid on it.Ms. Ugalde would not discuss whether Mr. Pinault was the front-runner to buy La Almoraima. Yet she conceded that the investors who have shown an interest in the estate include \u201csome of the wealthiest people in the world, some of whom are just thinking about enjoying the place for themselves.\u201dThat has not pleased local residents or political parties. Opposition to the project is visible at the local town hall of Castellar de la Frontera, run by the United Left Party, which has hung a banner from its balcony denouncing the planned sale.The regional government of Andalusia, which is run by Spain\u2019s main opposition Socialist Party, is opposing the sale as well. It recently persuaded a court to rule against the project, by extending the area protected as a nature park to the whole estate. The national government is appealing the ruling.While environmentalists welcomed the support, they were quick to note that the Socialists had helped accelerate Spain\u2019s construction boom while they were the party in power at the national level from 2004 to 2011.The Socialist opposition to the project \u201cis just part of the political game once you become the opposition party,\u201d said Mr. S\u00e1nchez P\u00e9rez of the Equo Party. \u201cWhen the Socialists were in power, they promoted some of the most absurd projects.\u201dHe cited the half-built Algarrobico hotel, set on a pristine beach, which has been the subject of a long court battle and is one of several disputed projects that remain unused but standing, even though the Supreme Court ruled against the hotel\u2019s location in 2012. Similarly, the regional government of Extremadura was ordered last year by the Supreme Court to destroy an island resort built in Valdeca\u00f1as, a protected nature reserve.Since then, the Extremadura government has continued to argue against the \u20ac34 million cost of the destruction, claiming that it would be \u201cbetter for the environment\u201d to keep the resort.As for La Almoraima, Jorge Bezares, who represents an association of businesses and residents who live near the estate, said Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government was showing \u201clittle sensitivity toward what should have been an opportunity to preserve an emblematic and untouched estate.\u201dWhatever the financial logic for the government of divesting from La Almoraima, most locals believe they will not share the benefits.Cristina Castilla, who lives nearby and has been jobless for six years, gave a gloomy forecast. Even if a luxury resort is built on the estate, she said, \u201call the new jobs will be given to outsiders and none will go to the people who already live here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gov. Scott Walker Wins Re-election in Wisconsin, and Hope of Higher Office", "Date": "2014-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWisconsinWEST ALLIS, Wis. \u2014 Scott Walker, the Republican who made a national name for himself by clashing with labor unions, won a second term as governor of this state on Tuesday, keeping alive the possibility that he may be among the candidates for president in 2016.Mr. Walker\u2019s victory after a battering, intense campaign was his third successful election in just four years: In 2012, he became the nation\u2019s first governor to survive a recall election. On Tuesday, Mr. Walker beat Mary Burke, a Democrat who was little known statewide until recently and whose only previous campaign had been for a seat on Madison\u2019s school board. In a rousing 10-minute victory speech, Mr. Walker described the challenges of the past few months, as well as those of the past few years, seemingly referring to his battle with the unions and the subsequent recall.\u201cThere was a group out of Washington \u2014 Washington-based special interests \u2014 who thought they could spend a lot of money and a lot of time in the state and somehow convince the people of this state to be against something,\u201d Mr. Walker told hundreds of supporters at an exposition center at the State Fair Park.\u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you, I\u2019m an optimist. I believed all along if we got a positive message out that in the end people of the state wanted to be for something not against something, and look what happened,\u201d he said.In a state traditionally accustomed to polite negotiation across party lines, some in Wisconsin said residents over the past four years seemed more divided than ever. Democratic lawmakers fled the state at one point in an effort to block the vote on union bargaining rights, recall elections were held for officeholders from both parties, and families and friends chose sides \u2014 sometimes opposing ones. Mr. Walker\u2019s push to cut bargaining rights and to require most public sector workers to pay more for their health care and pensions drew tens of thousands of protesters to Madison, the state capital, in early 2011. But in recent months, the state\u2019s economy was the single largest focus of the governor\u2019s race. Through the campaign, Ms. Burke, 55, portrayed herself as a clear alternative to Mr. Walker. She said she would bring to state government her business expertise, which includes a degree from Harvard Business School and time as an executive at Trek Bicycle Corporation, a company founded by her father. Just after Mr. Walker won the recall election, Republicans began mentioning him among a list of possible candidates for president in 2016. Mr. Walker\u2019s success at pushing through a conservative agenda, then surviving a recall challenge in a state that twice favored President Obama gave him a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 Republicans saw as appealing for a White House run. Yet Mr. Walker needed to win a second term as governor on Tuesday to remain viable in that regard, and some political analysts said a decisive margin of victory was needed to bolster the case for a future presidential run.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Election 2014: What Do the Midterms Tell Us About 2016?", "Date": "2014-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 2014 election will be a four-part test that will tell us more than who will win control of the Senate.First, how much damage has been inflicted over the past six years on the Democratic Party\u2019s brand?Second, has the political calculus shifted enough to give Democratic presidential candidates a shot at Georgia, breaking the Republican Party\u2019s grip on the Deep South? Have two traditionally Democratic states in the Midwest, Michigan and Wisconsin, become viable targets for Republicans in 2016?Third, after the investment of millions of dollars by the Republican National Committee and conservative organizations affiliated with the Koch brothers, has the Republican Party caught up with or surpassed Democrats in this year\u2019s technology-intensive, data-driven voter turnout operations?Fourth, have Republican candidates found ways to lessen the liabilities of hard right views on abortion, same sex marriage, contraception and other sex and reproduction linked issues?In 2010, Pew found that Hispanic support for Democrats over Republicans stood at 65-22. Going into the current election, support for Democrats over Republicans declined 14 points to 57-28.The Harvard Institute of Politics \u201cMillennial voter\u201d survey found that among 18- to 29-year-olds who \u201cdefinitely\u201d will vote, 51 percent said they would prefer a Republican-run Congress; 47 percent said they favored Democratic control. This compares to a 55-43 margin in support of Democratic control of Congress in a 2010 I.O.P. survey of this age group.Extensive polling has already demonstrated that some of the states considered reliable sources of Democratic or Republican Electoral College votes are shifting to a more competitive status.Win or lose, Nunn and Carter\u2019s respectable showing in a low turnout midterm election is virtually certain to turn Georgia into a Democratic presidential target in 2016. The last Democratic presidential candidate to carry Georgia was Bill Clinton in 1992 (who then lost Georgia to Bob Dole in 1996).Details down to precinct level results in all the competitive races this year will be studied closely by party officials and political scientists to determine whether Republicans have caught up with Democrats in the world of big-data, high-tech voter mobilization.In the last two presidential elections, the Obama campaign and Democratic interest groups remained far ahead of Republicans in the so-called ground war techniques of locating favorable voters wherever they can be found, registering citizens likely to be supportive, and making sure every supporter casts a ballot, in person, by mail, or through early voting processes.If Republicans find an effective means to combat Democratic charges that the Republican Party is anti-women, Democrats will lose one of their most potent political weapons.Taken together, the current contest and the 2010 election demonstrate the strength of the Republican Party in low-turnout, midterm years. Perhaps the most significant development in 2014 is the ability of Republican candidates to break with hard right conservative orthodoxy \u2013 even candidates whose own roots are in the hard right. This capacity, insofar as it is carried over into 2016, has the potential to break the pro-Democratic tilt of presidential elections and to force a major strategic re-evaluation by politicians and operatives in both parties.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greek Budget Forecasts Growth, but Creditors Are Skeptical on Deficit", "Date": "2014-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 The Greek authorities presented a budget Friday that forecasts healthy growth after a deep recession and includes substantial tax cuts for the first time in four years. But the upbeat assessment lacked the approval of the country\u2019s international creditors, who remain skeptical that Greece can meet economic targets amid political uncertainty.The budget, introduced in Parliament by Finance Minister Gikas Hardouvelis, predicts that the economy will grow by 2.9 percent in 2015. The Greek economy has shrunk by one-quarter since 2008. The blueprint is expected to face a vote on Dec. 7.Last week, European figures showed that Greece, once the epicenter of the euro crisis, grew faster than any eurozone country in the third quarter of this year, expanding 0.7 percent over the previous quarter.However, the country\u2019s troika of international creditors has not approved the plan, and Christos Staikouras, Mr. Hardouvelis\u2019s own deputy, indicated that the lenders were not convinced that Greece would meet its budget targets for next year.\u201cThe troika has different estimates,\u201d Mr. Staikouras said. \u201cThey see a fiscal gap for 2015.\u201dThe blueprint forecasts a primary surplus \u2014 a budget in the black before debt repayments \u2014 of 3 percent of gross domestic product and sees the country\u2019s debt burden easing to 171 percent of annual gross domestic product, from 174 percent this year.It also promises relief, notably 30 percent reductions in both a tax on heating oil and an income tax surcharge.Representatives of the troika, which consists of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, have collectively granted 240 billion euros, or $300 billion, in loans to rescue the Greek economy since 2010.The troika suspended its latest review of Greece\u2019s progress in imposing economic changes in October amid disagreements over when they should be put into effect and over the creditors\u2019 view that the government will miss its deficit target of 0.2 percent of G.D.P., which would oblige authorities to impose more painful cuts. Despite a flurry of emails and teleconference calls, the rift remained unresolved on Friday.The two sides are also battling over previously agreed-to changes to labor laws that would make it easier for employers in the private sector to fire employees en masse and a second overhaul of the pension system.Independent economists were also skeptical about the budget. One, Ioannis Tsarmougelis of the University of the Aegean, pointed to \u201ctragic mistakes\u201d on both sides, arguing that the continuation of an economic program that has hammered the \u201creal economy\u201d in Greece was doomed to failure.\u201cWithout a special liquidity injection from the E.C.B., the Greek economy will never mend,\u201d Mr. Tsarmougelis said, adding that sky-high borrowing costs were also a brake on recovery.Prime Minister Antonis Samaras led Greece\u2019s return to borrowing in financial markets this year and has said that the country could emerge from the I.M.F. portion of the bailout program even before it is due to end in early 2016.The prospect of an unsupervised Greece, however, has spooked investors, resulting in a sell-off of Greek bonds in October that pushed yields above 8 percent.Investors say they are concerned about political instability. Early elections are likely as the political opposition has pledged to block the government\u2019s candidate for president, a move that would lead to a general election. Under that scenario, the leftist party Syriza \u2014 which has ridden a wave of anti-austerity sentiment that has spread to France and Italy as Germany continues to champion fiscal discipline \u2014 would be likely to win.Mr. Tsarmougelis says the political uncertainty is helping solidify the deadlock with the troika because the government is more focused on its own survival than on pursuing an unpopular economic program.As the government argues with the troika over proposals, social tensions are rising. Unions are gearing up for a general strike Thursday to draw attention to the enduring impact of four years of austerity \u2014 with unemployment remaining above 25 percent and household incomes slashed by a third following a series of cuts to salaries and pensions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Circular Economy of Recycled Paper", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROERMOND, The Netherlands \u2014 Three times a week, tanker trucks make an hourlong journey from a baby-food factory in Nunspeet, in the central Netherlands, to a paper mill in the southeastern city of Roermond. The trucks carry 90 cubic meters, or about 24,000 gallons, a week of phosphate produced as a waste byproduct at the baby-food factory, to be fed to bacteria in an anaerobic fermentation tank at the mill.One person\u2019s trash can be another\u2019s treasure. \u201cThey had a lot of expenses to get rid of it, and we had expense to get it, so we are both happy,\u201d said Mark Nabuurs, the manager of innovation and development at the Roermond plant.Mr. Nabuurs and other executives at Roermond Papier, a unit of the Smurfit Kappa packaging company, based in Dublin, cite the phosphate deal as an example of the company\u2019s commitment to the idea of a circular economy. In a traditional linear economy, products are made from raw materials and everything \u2014 byproduct waste and product alike \u2014 ends in the scrap heap. In a circular economy, the product is made from recycled materials and ends up being recycled itself.\u201cThe linear economy is at an end. I really believe it is over,\u201d said Jo Cox, the general manager of the Roermond plant which, in an industry once associated with water pollution and deforestation, has won several environmental awards over the years. The mill makes brown packing paper exclusively from recycled and alternative fibers, and it has made changes to its production processes, its supply chain and its waste disposal practices to reduce its environmental footprint.It currently produces less than a kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, of solid waste for every metric ton of paper that it makes, converting combustible waste into fuel pellets that it sells as a byproduct to other industries. It uses natural gas and biogas to generate power and steam. It uses just 2.7 liters, or 0.7 gallons, of water to produce a kilogram of paper, less than 2 percent of the volume needed to produce the same amount in a conventional mill: The water, drawn from a nearby river, is recycled several times, and cleaned by organic processes before being returned to its original source.\u201cI\u2019m like a priest, I\u2019m always talking about the religion of the circular economy,\u201d said Mr. Cox.To make the mill\u2019s processes circular, the management and innovation team has expended much effort looking for alternative sources for raw materials and new \u2014 preferably profitable \u2014 uses for what would have once been waste.With the backing of Smurfit Kappa, a commitment to the circular economy has been built into its operating mandate since 2009, Mr. Cox said, formalizing a more than decade-long campaign to eliminate waste and use more recycled materials.While much of the impetus for this campaign has come from the need to satisfy its increasingly environmentally conscious customers, Mr. Cox said, sustainability has also paid off financially.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with making money,\u201d he said. Globally, the paper industry is having difficulties doing just that. As businesses and bureaucracies increasingly go digital, paper mills \u2014 especially those making white writing paper \u2014 are feeling the pinch, said Thad Maloney, a professor in the department of forest products technology at Aalto University in Finland, and an expert in pulp and paper: \u201cMills have to become more competitive by becoming more efficient.\u201d Paper mills that produce coarse brown paper for packaging are also more likely to rely on recycled paper for feedstock \u2014 something the Roermond mill has been doing since the 1970s. They have the advantage, moreover, of not having to go through bleaching and extensive pulping processes that are costly and potentially an environmental hazard.\u201cBroadly speaking, if what you are doing is recycling fiber into something that is just packing paper, you are ahead,\u201d said Paul Johnston, who runs the Greenpeace laboratories at the University of Exeter in Britain.At the Roermond mill, bales of neatly stacked recovered paper fill several outside lots. The mill\u2019s records show that it uses more than a million bales, or about 650,000 tons, a year.Located in a heavily industrialized region straddling the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, the mill has the advantage that used paper is plentiful and cheap. The region has high rates of paper use and recycling; the recycling rate in the Netherlands is as high as 80 percent.In this respect, at least, European mills are better positioned than competitors in less developed countries like China: China does not have enough recycled paper to feed its many mills \u2014 even those producing packing paper, Professor Maloney said. \u201cIn order to use recycled fiber, you need a big population that provides the recycled waste,\u201d he said.The bales \u2014 typically about 1.5 meters square, or 16 feet square, of compressed paper tied with thick metal wire \u2014 are loaded on a conveyor belt and hoisted up three stories before being treated with hot water and dropped back to ground level in a machine called the pulper. Here the fiber is cleaned of contaminants ranging from metal paper clips to paper-coating plastics and waxes.While the cleaned pulp and water mixture goes to the mill\u2019s three paper machines, most of the nonfibrous waste is processed into a byproduct that the mill calls Rofire, a waxy-looking pellet that can be burned at an optimal temperature, in place of coal, in the furnaces of the limestone industry. Mr. Cox cites the production of Rofire as another waste loop closed, turning waste into fuel for another industry and an income stream for the mill, while saving some 20,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions that would have been produced by burning coal, according to the mill\u2019s calculations.The mill also claims to have been the first in Europe to install air-tight waste sludge processing tanks, some 30 years ago, to make biogas from the sludge left behind by the paper manufacturing process.

{"Headline": "Obama Arrives in China on Trip With Complex Agenda", "Date": "2014-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 President Obama arrived here on Monday morning for a three-day visit that will capture the complexities of the United States-China relationship: the tensions of a rising power confronting an established one, as well as the promise that the world\u2019s two largest economies could find common cause on issues like climate change. Touching down under skies that were a government-mandated blue \u2014 the authorities idled factories and kept vehicles off the roads to clear the air \u2014 Mr. Obama plunged into a hectic schedule that mixed the solemn rituals of a state visit with the deal-making of an economic summit meeting.Mr. Obama\u2019s visit, his second as president, began on a promising note on Saturday with North Korea\u2019s release of two Americans held there. Administration officials did not speculate about whether the release was timed to the visit, but it sent an unmistakably conciliatory message on the eve of talks that are certain to include the nuclear-armed rogue state.The centerpiece of the visit will be Mr. Obama\u2019s session with President Xi Jinping in the Great Hall of the People on Wednesday, where he will encounter a Chinese leader who has moved boldly to restore the primacy of the Communist Party with a radical anticorruption campaign, an overhaul of China\u2019s economy and a crackdown on dissent.Before that, though, Mr. Obama will meet with Joko Widodo, a plain-spoken populist whose recent election as president of Indonesia is a vivid contrast to the authoritarian ambitions of Mr. Xi. Mr. Widodo, like Mr. Obama, is here for a meeting of Pacific Rim leaders.Later on Monday, Mr. Obama was to speak to business executives from that group, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. He will also meet leaders from 11 countries involved in trying to create the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an ambitious American-led trade pact that would be a central pillar of Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cstrategic pivot\u201d to Asia.The White House has methodically lowered expectations that a deal will be reached in Beijing. But the fact that Mr. Obama is meeting the other leaders so early in the trip \u2014 combined with recent reports of progress in talks with one of the key participants, Japan \u2014 has prompted trade analysts to speculate that there could be some kind of a surprise.The Trans-Pacific Partnership does not include China, so Mr. Obama\u2019s main commercial proposal for the Chinese will be a new bilateral investment treaty between the countries. Economists said it could be the most significant opening of the Chinese market for American companies since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.American businesspeople view the treaty as an indicator of how serious Mr. Xi is about overhauling the Chinese economy, after a start that many describe as shaky. It would require the Chinese to open dozens of sensitive markets, some that remained closed to American companies, or required Chinese partners.\u201cOptimism is moderating in the American business community,\u201d said John Frisbie, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council. \u201cThe reason for that softening is policy uncertainty. What\u2019s the reform policy direction? We\u2019ve seen little tangible impact so far.\u201dProgress on an investment treaty could smooth other sources of friction in the relationship, particularly the systematic hacking of American companies by the Chinese. A joint working group set up to tackle cybercrime abruptly stopped meeting after American prosecutors filed hacking charges against several Chinese military officers.Mr. Obama raised the issue of cybercrime with Mr. Xi at their first leader-to-leader meeting at the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage, Calif., in June 2013. By all accounts, that conversation did not go well, and the dialogue has only gotten testier since then.The two leaders did sign an agreement at that meeting to cut hydrofluorocarbon emissions, and the White House hopes to build on that this week in broader discussions between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi about climate change. John Podesta, a senior adviser to the president who oversees climate change policy, is part of the delegation.The goal would be for China and the United States to announce a common position on new emissions-reductions targets before the next climate change talks in Paris next year. While it is unlikely that either country will announce specific targets until next March, even a general statement of commitment by the two leaders could galvanize the process.Shortly before Air Force One took off for Beijing, after midnight on Sunday, administration officials offered additional details on the secret trip to Pyongyang made by the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., which resulted in the freeing of two Americans who had been imprisoned in North Korea, Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller.Mr. Clapper, one official said, carried a brief letter to North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, certifying that he was the president\u2019s personal emissary and that his sole mission was to obtain the release of the two men. He did not meet with Mr. Kim, dealing with other officials.Mr. Clapper, the official said, was chosen by the White House after a surprise overture by the North Koreans because he was a security official, not a diplomat, which kept the trip out of the realm of diplomacy.\u201cWhile this addresses an important irritant in our relationship,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules imposed by the White House, \u201cit certainly doesn\u2019t address the underlying concerns we have about their nuclear program.\u201dThere is a precedent for timing such a release to the visit of a prominent American: Last December, North Korea freed an 85-year-old military veteran from Palo Alto, Calif., Merrell Newman, during a visit to South Korea by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Follows a Shellacking at the Polls?", "Date": "2014-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter from AmericaWASHINGTON \u2014 It is not a good sign for a president when there is talk in the days before an election of a \u201cshellacking\u201d \u2014 the term President Obama used in 2010 to acknowledge crushing Democratic midterm losses.But a shellacking it was on Tuesday: Democrats lost control of the Senate, suffered further losses in the House of Representatives, and lost governorships even in liberal-leaning states like Maryland.Now the post-mortems and predictions begin: How did Democrats fall so low? And what does it mean for the president, the parties, Oval Office aspirants and the country?For Democrats, the public\u2019s sour mood is perplexing: The economy is growing (especially compared with Europe\u2019s), unemployment is falling, and the federal deficit is shrinking. Yet, a series of problems \u2014 from the shaky rollout of Mr. Obama\u2019s health care overhaul to troubles across the Middle East and the flawed initial response to Ebola \u2014 have shaken Americans\u2019 confidence.Still, as Mr. Obama confirmed with his decisive re-election victory in 2012 (and as Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton had done before), there can be life after a shellacking.Mr. Obama, like any president, retains significant power over foreign policy; already he has broad Republican backing for airstrikes on the Islamic State militant group.He can also use executive action to advance Democratic priorities on energy, gay rights and climate change.But any progress he makes on those issues might well be overshadowed if, as expected, he announces new rules to help millions of undocumented immigrants remain legally in the country.At that point, things could quickly turn tense.Mr. Obama is in a tight corner. He had promised action on immigration before September, but postponed it to appease vulnerable Democratic candidates, leaving normally friendly Latino voters furious over the delay; one Democratic congressman, Luis Guti\u00e9rrez of Illinois, warned of a \u201ccivil war\u201d in the party.But if the president does act, the real fury will come from the right. The standard post-election professions of good will could evaporate and prospects for compromise vanish even before Republicans take control of the Senate in January.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the presumed next majority leader, said Wednesday that unilateral action by Mr. Obama on immigration would be \u201ca big mistake\u201d that \u201cpoisons the well\u201d for future cooperation.Mr. Obama acknowledged the concerns. But he told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that he had waited years for Congress to act, and \u201cwhat we can\u2019t do is just keep on waiting.\u201d Congress, he added, could still pass an immigration overhaul, superseding his own actions.How all this plays out in the eyes of millions of Latino voters could be critical to the hopes of both parties in 2016.Mr. McConnell had tentatively offered an olive branch as the Republican gains became clear on Tuesday. He expected no sudden embrace from Mr. Obama, he said \u2014 their relationship has been chilly. But, he said, \u201cperpetual conflict\u201d was not inevitable, either.He and Mr. Obama said they had spoken and sketched out the possibility of cooperation on trade (a big deal, with talks continuing on European and Pacific trade pacts), corporate taxation and improvements to outdated roads and bridges.Still, if Mr. McConnell, a canny deal maker who rode into Congress on Ronald Reagan\u2019s coattails in 1984, is to pass any significant legislation, he will need a modicum of party unity, support from a few Democrats \u2014 and the absence of a presidential veto.But in the traditionally genteel Senate, Mr. McConnell will face a particularly unruly herd of Republicans. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, whose interest in a presidential run is no secret, said Wednesday that he might not endorse Mr. McConnell as leader; he favors a more confrontational Senate.And as other potential Republican presidential aspirants in the Senate \u2014 Marco Rubio of Florida or Rand Paul of Kentucky \u2014 seek to distinguish themselves, cross-aisle cooperation will hardly be a top priority.So, gridlock or compromise? Will the president find ways to deal with an often implacable Congress, or are his frustrations just beginning? Will Republicans seek to craft a record of accomplishments, or will a divided party overplay its winning hand?Stay tuned.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript of New York Times Interview With President Ma Ying-jeou of Taiwan", "Date": "2014-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFollowing is a transcript, provided by the Taiwanese government, of an interview with President Ma Ying-jeou conducted by The New York Times in Taipei on Friday. Mr. Ma mainly spoke in Chinese, but briefly answered a question in English.Q. The first question we wanted to ask is, since we have APEC coming up in a week and a half, what has Beijing lost and what has Taiwan lost by your not meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing?Q. You\u2019ve voiced support for democracy in Hong Kong. Has Beijing\u2019s reaction to the protests in Hong Kong changed your thinking about cross-strait relations, and are you risking cross-strait ties by voicing support for democracy in Hong Kong?Another key point is that we believe that if mainland China can practice democracy in Hong Kong or if mainland China itself can become more democratic, then we can shorten the psychological distance between people from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. This would be a great step toward creating closer cross-strait ties over the long term.Q. Xi Jinping seemed to be voicing more support for the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d approach even for Taiwan earlier this week as opposed to the 1992 consensus. Have events in Hong Kong, in your view, made China potentially more eager for a more controlling role in long-term bilateral relations with Taiwan? Q. Changing subjects to trade. There are two competing visions now for trade in the Pacific. There\u2019s Beijing\u2019s Ftaap \u2014 the Free Trade Agreement of the Asia Pacific \u2014 and then there\u2019s also the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Washington is suggesting. Which do you think fits Taiwan\u2019s economy better? Which has more appeal for you?It must be understood that Taiwan is quite behind the rest of Asia in terms of signing free trade agreements (F.T.A.s) and joining in regional economic integration.Ascertaining whether a country is making sufficient efforts on these fronts involves looking at what percent of its exports is covered by F.T.A.s. For Singapore, it exceeds 70 percent, meaning that over 70 percent of Singapore\u2019s exports are covered by F.T.A.s, so they are subject to lower-tariff, or even zero-tariff treatment. Sometimes these exports are also free from other, nontariff barriers. But for Taiwan, the figure is 10 percent, or just under 10 percent. As a result, we do not enjoy equal treatment vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors, meaning that our products\u2019 market share in other countries will gradually shrink. This is a matter of life and death for us, because 70 percent of our G.D.P. growth is dependent on foreign trade.Q. Do you have any regrets that Taiwan did not make a bigger effort, then, to be included in the first round of T.P.P.?When nations sign free trade agreements, it is primarily for economic reasons. There are, of course, political implications. For the Republic of China, political interference is greater [than that affecting other countries]. We do not enjoy diplomatic ties with our main trading partners. When we want to trade with them, it\u2019s fine, but when we seek an F.T.A., they hesitate for fear that mainland China will oppose it. This is one reason few countries were, in the past, willing to sign F.T.A.s with us.After I took office, we signed the Cross-Straits Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (E.C.F.A.) with our largest trading partner, mainland China. Since then, we have signed an investment agreement with Japan, an economic cooperation agreement with New Zealand and an economic partnership agreement with Singapore. We hope to sign similar agreements with our main trading partners in Asia and Europe by simultaneously contacting many countries and negotiating accords with them one by one.We realize that this will not be easy, because there will always be politically motivated interference.Q. I\u2019d like to ask about the fishing agreement with Japan surrounding Diaoyu Islands and the waters there. Has that eased tensions, and was that agreement something you discussed with Beijing beforehand?Coincidentally, the situation concerning the Diaoyutai Islands changed about this time. The result of Japan\u2019s nationalization of the islands aroused opposition among the people of both Taiwan and mainland China. At this time, I proposed the East China Sea Peace Initiative, concerned that should increased tensions lead to regional conflict, this would be extremely detrimental to the engine of global economic growth. It would not only affect Asian nations. I proposed the initiative on August 5, 2012. Japan responded in November, stating that they were willing to talk with us about this issue, and within five months, we had an agreement. In the year before we signed, we had 17 clashes over fishing rights, sometimes leading to standoffs between our nations\u2019 respective coast guards. Since the agreement\u2019s signing, there has been but one, for which there was no standoff and which was resolved quickly. So that\u2019s the political implication.Economically, both sides have enjoyed larger catches, especially of high-quality fish like bluefin tuna. This has been beneficial to the fishermen of both sides. So we have achieved both peace and prosperity. We have set sovereignty questions aside, not allowing these to hinder resource development and relevant negotiations.Q. Do you see any possibility in reaching a similar arrangement with mainland China? However, the thinking in the East China Sea Peace Initiative, which I proposed, is that the three parties \u2014 mainland China, Japan, and Taiwan \u2014 could split up to conduct three sets of parallel bilateral dialogues: Japan-mainland China, mainland China-Taiwan and Taiwan-Japan, to carry out negotiations on various issues involving marine issues. These could include fisheries development, oil and natural gas exploration and sea rescue cooperation. We have worked with mainland China on sea rescue for years. In addition, there could be other nonconventional security issues, such as marine science research and marine environmental protection. So there is great potential for cooperation.At present, Japan and mainland China, as well as Taiwan and Japan, have concluded separate fisheries agreements. In addition, we have carried out sea rescue exercises with mainland China for many years. All these developments are positive. Perhaps we can step by step build three bilateral mechanisms; then, if conditions are appropriate, it could perhaps become one trilateral mechanism.Q. Do you expect in the near future to deal with the Philippines on judicial cooperation in the Bashi Strait? And can that be the beginning of a broader cooperation with the Philippines on maritime issues? Both parties reached consensus on these points last year, although we have yet to sign an agreement; nevertheless, only one point of contention remains. The closest distance between the Philippines and Taiwan is less than 200 nautical miles. If both sides were to demarcate their respective E.E.Z.s (exclusive economic zone), there would be an overlap of over 100 nautical miles. Under such conditions, this sort of a law enforcement agreement will help reduce causes of dispute. However, looking at the long term, attaining a fisheries agreement will require much more time and effort.In 1898, the United States fought a war with Spain over the Philippines. After the U.S. won, the Treaty of Peace Between the United States and Spain ceded sovereignty over the Philippines to the U.S. However, since there are more than 7,000 Philippine islands, it was difficult to clearly demarcate the area. So they just used latitude and longitude to roughly demarcate this area. However, after the Philippines gained independence in 1946, it regarded all of the area within the latitude and longitude coordinates as its offshore waters. Some of the islands within this area are more than 100 nautical miles from the boundary lines. Under such conditions, it is easy for our fishing vessels to inadvertently enter what the Philippines sees as its territorial waters. Since this is stipulated by the constitution of the Philippines, it is difficult for them to deal with this issue. Before these issues are resolved, it will be difficult to sign a fisheries agreement.The Philippines often complains that our fishermen transgress their borders to fish, entering their territorial waters or E.E.Z. So, after we reached consensus, we have repeatedly told our fishermen that if they operate legally, we will protect them. However, if they enter the territorial waters of the Philippines, we cannot do so. Thus, our policy for the protection of fishermen is to \u201cprotect fishing, not wrongdoing.\u201dQ. Given that the consensus with the Philippines and the agreement with Japan seem to be reducing tensions in those directions, do you want Taiwan to play a greater role in the South China Sea, particularly with regard to the Philippines\u2019 claims, but also even Malaysia and Vietnam, and particularly given that the Republic of China and the People\u2019s Republic of China have the same historical antecedents for their respective claims? There is a basic principle in the Law of the Sea, that land dominates the sea. Thus marine claims begin with land; however, even if it is logically this way, when resolving disputes, it is not impossible to first resolve resource development issues. If we think back to the past, sovereignty is indivisible, but resources can be shared. In fact, in many areas of the world there is already a similar kind of development, including Europe\u2019s North Sea, which in the 1960s and 1970s was an area of dispute, but once they realized that continuing to dispute would never produce results, they changed to cooperation. Joint development of resources resulted in the emergence of an important brand on the international oil market, Brent Crude.In the East China Sea, we are in fact following this kind of logic. When we signed the fisheries agreement with Japan, we did not abandon our sovereignty claim. We regard the Diaoyutais as territory of the Republic of China, and offshore islands appertaining to Taiwan. This stance has never changed. However, in the fourth article of the Taiwan-Japan fisheries agreement, it says that the actions or measures adopted by both parties under this agreement do not affect our rights and interests under the Law of the Sea. By using this approach to shelve our disputes temporarily, the problem became smaller, not larger. Following this sort of resolution, in the future, if there is the opportunity, we can still explore issues pertaining to sovereignty; otherwise, we can explore other issues of resource development, such as oil and gas, or other newly discovered resources that I just mentioned. If the South China Sea issues can be approached from this angle, perhaps solutions can be found to some of them.Q. Taiwan has expressed interest in developing its own submarines. How important is that to Taiwan? And if you go ahead with developing your own submarines, would you rely on technology from the U.S. and do you expect to get that? Q. Where does that stand? I understand that you have formal requests to the United States. Have you received any reply on obtaining submarine technology that would allow you to build subs in your own shipyards?Q. Is there a formal recent request you made? I have heard different versions on this, a formal recent request for submarine technology that you would build into vessels that would actually be assembled in Taiwanese shipyards. Or was it not an actual recent formal request for a specific technology that would allow you to do this at all?Q. Taiwanese companies have conspicuously not been punished in recent months as China has confronted multinationals from the United States, Europe and Japan, accusing them of offenses like breaking antimonopoly laws. Is this because Taiwan has an understanding with China that they are not going after your companies, that you are somehow exempt from the economic nationalism because they see you as part of China? Why is it that Taiwanese companies seem to have this exemption from the current crackdown on foreign companies, more broadly, in China? You just mentioned antimonopoly laws. Could it be because Taiwan\u2019s businesses are not so large and therefore are less likely to violate these laws? I am not sure about that.Q. Do you foresee a way to address the pork issue with the United States such that you can get a bilateral investment agreement done with the United States before you leave office?With regards to beef, after many rounds of negotiations with the U.S., we now permit the import of beef with a maximum residue limit of 10 pbb. This problem has now been resolved. The U.S. said two years ago that beef and pork imports could be discussed separately, and we have proceeded accordingly. Therefore, the two sides will need to conduct further discussions on this issue.Second, pork accounts for a very small proportion of U.S. exports to the R.O.C. We have opened our market to U.S. pork. The only restriction is that pork containing ractopamine is not allowed. U.S. pork exports, whether to Russia, the European Union, or mainland China, do not contain ractopamine. Taiwan imports a very small volume of U.S. pork, far less than Russia, the E.U., or mainland China. We see no reason why pork exported to Taiwan cannot be ractopamine-free. We do not think that this is a big issue. It should not impede our negotiations with the U.S. on a number of other issues, especially a bilateral investment agreement. Otherwise it would be a shame because U.S. exports very little pork to Taiwan. I do not think that the slogan we now hear \u2014 no pork, no talks \u2014 is very wise.Q. Do you have any concern that Taiwan\u2019s ever-growing economic ties to the mainland, and now that mainland China has passed the United States as the biggest trading partner of Taiwan, mean that Taiwan is losing its political and security flexibility, that it is becoming too dependent on China economically?Mainland China is the largest trading partner of 17 of its 23 neighboring countries. Their bilateral trade values are extremely high because mainland China is the world\u2019s second largest economy and largest exporter. We can take a look at U.S. relations with Canada and Mexico. The three countries have formed a North American free trade area. About 75 percent of Mexican and Canadian exports are destined for the U.S., while the U.S. supplies about 50 percent of their respective total imports. Therefore, their bilateral trade dependence is 65 percent, which is far higher than that in cross-strait trade. Some people might say that U.S. relations with Canada and Mexico are different from cross-strait ties. Their political relations are certainly different. Economically, however, the countries are located in close proximity, share similar cultures and ethnic backgrounds, as well as close relations. That they would have a large trade volume is inevitable. If mainland China were to account for only 10 percent of our total trade and the U.S., 50 percent, it would be [almost] impossible economically. However, this happened before. I remember when I had just returned from the U.S., around 1981 to 1988, half or more than half of Taiwan\u2019s exports were destined for the U.S. Our trade with mainland China and other countries gradually became more balanced. Things change. Judging from the present situation, we have not yet become over-dependent on mainland China. Our trade with the mainland has indeed continued to increase, but its share of total trade has decreased. The present situation warrants our attention but does not call for excessive anxiety.Q. Going back to your support for democracy in Hong Kong, Taiwan had protests earlier this year. Many people pointed out similarities between the two. While the details are different, the fundamental issue concerns the influence of China. But you were also critical of the protests here. Do you see any contradiction in your standpoint, or do you see any similarities or differences between the two protest movements?After seeing that their first demand had been accepted, they made a second. They called for the establishment of an oversight act for agreements between Taiwan and mainland China. A month prior to this, the KMT party caucus in the Legislative Yuan had reached consensus with the Executive Yuan on creating a four-stage oversight mechanism. On April 3, before the protest movement ended, the Executive Yuan approved a draft of such an act and sent it to the Legislative Yuan. Today, more than six months later, the draft still has not gotten through the legislature.Meanwhile, the students called for dialogue with the government. On March 22, Premier Jiang walked from the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan, and went among the crowd gathered there for a discussion. But the students said that the trade in services agreement should first be withdrawn before they would engage in dialogue. As far as I know, this was the first time that the highest-ranking official of the executive branch of the R.O.C. government went into a group of protesters to discuss their demands \u2014 it was really quite something. However, he was rejected, and walked back to the Executive Yuan. Even though the students requested dialogue with government officials, when a government official came to talk with them, he was turned away.The next day, I held a press conference explaining the government\u2019s position. On March 25, I came out and said that I was willing to exchange views with students at the office of the president. Such a meeting would be public and could have been broadcast on television. In total, I issued an invitation for dialogue seven times, but each time, the students put forward reasons for not wanting to meet with me. For example, if we were to meet, they said, I could not request that the KMT party caucus in the Legislative Yuan exercise party discipline. They also said that a meeting should not be held in the office of the president, but on Kaitakelan Boulevard. I wonder how things are in other countries, but I, as president, extended seven invitations to speak with students, and though these were all rejected, I believe we did our part as a responsive government.In fact, we met most of their demands, except for withdrawing the trade in services agreement and renegotiating it. We could not have agreed to that demand. Doing so would be unacceptable in the international arena. If we had done so, the international community would regard us as an unreliable trade partner, which would then affect our ability to sign similar agreements with other countries. So I have mentioned two differences, which are the goals of the protests as well as the responses of the respective governments. The students fundamentally disagree with our mainland China policy. In fact, our mainland China policy has had the support of a large majority of our people. They [the protesters] believe that the trade in services agreement is a black box accord, but in fact, before being sent to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, it was handled with the highest degree of transparency since constitutional rule was instituted in the R.O.C.Before the agreement was signed by the two sides on June 21 of last year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (M.O.E.A.) held 110 rounds of consultations with 264 representatives from 46 service-economy sectors. For each of these there is a record. In addition, before the agreement was sent to the Legislative Yuan, three formal reports were made to relevant committees of the Legislative Yuan. After it was sent to the Legislative Yuan, the M.O.E.A. held more than 140 large-scale seminars, which were attended by more than 7,900 people. In March of this year, before the legislative review had started, 20 public hearings were held. Since the R.O.C. Legislative Yuan was established, no bill has been afforded this much time or deliberation. Nevertheless, it still is regarded as a black box process. With the agreement having already entered the Legislative Yuan, and with so many public hearings having been organized, how can it still be regarded as not transparent? The key point is that they [the opposition] do not want this bill to be reviewed [by the Legislative Yuan]. They want to block it from moving forward.In Western democracies, if the opposition wants to block a bill from moving forward, a filibuster is often the tactic used. A lawmaker proposing such a filibuster must speak uninterrupted for more than 10 hours to achieve his goal. I think the longest I have heard of was more than 23 hours. In our legislature, the opposition can simply use violence to occupy the speaker\u2019s podium and stop proceedings. In the current session of the legislature, we have already witnessed more than 90 such instances. They do not want us to sign the trade in services agreement with mainland China. However, this will greatly harm Taiwan\u2019s development. The number of countries that have signed free trade agreements with us is limited, hurting our competitiveness. In addition, the service sector in mainland China is not as developed as ours, and entering the mainland China market would present great opportunities for Taiwan\u2019s service industry.I want to emphasize again that regarding the protest movements in Hong Kong and Taiwan, we welcome democracy, but oppose violence. No democratic country can allow its legislature or executive government agencies to be occupied by anyone, including students. That\u2019s violence, not democracy.Advertisement"}

Mr. Putin got a chilly reception from several leaders, including from Prime Minister Tony Abbott of Australia and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada, who told him, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll shake your hand, but I have only one thing to say to you: You need to get out of Ukraine.\u201dPrime Minister David Cameron of Britain also condemned Mr. Putin\u2019s actions, saying the Russian leader was at a \u201ccrossroads.\u201d\u201cIf he continues to destabilize Ukraine, there\u2019ll be further sanctions, further measures, and there will be a completely different relationship between European countries and America on the one hand, and Russia on the other,\u201d Mr. Cameron said during a news conference in Brisbane.Mr. Putin himself put a positive spin on events, saying before leaving Brisbane that virtually every issue discussed had been helpful \u2014 even the issue of new sanctions over Ukraine \u2014 and that he was leaving early only because he had a long flight home.\u201cOur work took place in a very constructive spirit and produced results,\u201d he told reporters, according to a transcript on the Kremlin website.Ukraine was not a topic for the broad meetings but had come up repeatedly during his one-on-one sessions with other world leaders. Mr. Putin said he had gotten across his point of view that sanctions hurt both those who impose them and those who are targeted.The foreign ministers of the European Union plan to meet in Brussels on Monday to discuss the sanctions and the situation in Ukraine, where sightings of suspected Russian military convoys have fueled speculation that a new rebel offensive is near.\u201cIt might sound strange to you, but I think there are good hopes for being able to settle this situation,\u201d Mr. Putin said, without delving into specifics. He did express surprise, however, that the Ukrainian government in Kiev was moving to sever all financial ties with the breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, calling it \u201can economic blockade.\u201d\u201cWhy are the authorities in Kiev now cutting off these regions with their own hands? I do not understand this,\u201d he said, adding that this was not the right way to go about saving money. \u201cI do not think this is a fatal blow, though,\u201d he added.Mr. Putin denied that he was leaving early because he had been singled out for criticism at the summit meeting, attributing his departure to his work ethic. The flight from Brisbane to Vladivostok was nine hours, then he needed another nine to reach Moscow, he explained.\u201cWe still have to get home and be ready for work on Monday,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt would be nice to be able to sleep for four or five hours.\u201dThe summit meeting was also shadowed by concerns about the state of the military campaign against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, which Mr. Obama has said is at too early a stage to say whether the United States and its coalition allies are winning.Mr. Obama denied reports that he had ordered a formal review of the strategy against the militants in Syria. He said that while the White House was constantly reviewing its tactics in both Syria and Iraq, the basic elements of the strategy remained in place.Rebuffing a growing chorus of skeptics of his strategy, the president said the United States would never make \u201ccommon cause\u201d with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in the campaign against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, because that would alienate the country\u2019s Sunni Muslim population.\u201cWe have communicated to the Syrian regime that when we operate, going after ISIL in their air space, that they would be well advised not to take us on,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cBeyond that, there\u2019s no expectation that we are in some ways going to enter an alliance with Assad. He is not credible in that country.\u201dAt the same time, he said, the United States was not exploring ways to remove Mr. Assad from office \u2014 a recognition that the campaign against the Islamic State fighters had given Mr. Assad breathing room. Any lasting political settlement in Syria, he said, would have to involve Iran and Turkey, as well as the Assad government\u2019s primary patron, Russia.While Mr. Obama continued to rule out the use of American ground troops in the campaign \u2014 and said the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, had not recommended using them, either \u2014 he said there were cases in which troops might be necessary. After declining to speculate about those scenarios, he did just that.\u201cIf we discover that ISIL had gotten possession of a nuclear weapon,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cand we had to run an operation to get it out of their hands, then yes, you can anticipate that not only would Chairman Dempsey recommend sending U.S. ground troops to get that weapon out of their hands, but I would order it.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s comments came at the end of a hectic weeklong trip to Asia that produced a landmark climate-change agreement with China, progress on a number of trade negotiations and a return visit for the president to Myanmar, during which he admonished its military-dominated government that it needed to keep the reform process on track.\u201cIf you ask me, I say that\u2019s a pretty good week,\u201d he said. \u201cI intend to build on that momentum when I return home tomorrow.\u201dReviewing his trip, the president appeared particularly proud of the pact between the United States and China to develop a common position on additional reductions in carbon emissions before the next round of global climate talks in Paris in 2015.The president said there was \u201cno excuse\u201d for both developed and developing nations not to come together \u201cto achieve a strong global climate agreement next year.\u201d With the American economy currently outperforming those of Europe and Japan, Mr. Obama came into this meeting with a stronger hand than he has had in previous meetings. Administration officials said they had succeeded in pushing a message of growth-oriented policies into the leaders\u2019 communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of the meeting.The communiqu\u00e9 is usually more balanced between the virtues of growth and austerity. But, Mr. Obama said, \u201call the G-20 countries announced strategies to increase growth and put more people to work.\u201dNeil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Moscow, and Jenny Anderson from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "OPEC Holds Production Unchanged; Prices Fall ", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn news of the decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the price of Brent crude oil, a global benchmark, fell an additional $4 to a four-year low of about $73. American crude dropped below $70, an even more significant threshold.A more than 30 percent decline in prices in recent months has shaken the 12-member group. For three years, OPEC had little trouble keeping prices in the $100-a-barrel range that many of its members consider satisfactory.But markets have spun out of OPEC\u2019s control of late. Prices have come under pressure as global output of crude oil outstripped demand this year. Analysts forecast excess supplies of crude to continue to build in 2015.The main new source of supply is oil extracted from shale in the United States, which is expected to add about one million barrels a day of oil production this year and an additional one million barrels a day in 2015.OPEC seems at a loss about how to cope with this new source of competition and is also struggling to influence other big producers outside the organization like Russia and Brazil. Unable to come up with a strategy for handling these new developments, the cartel has decided not to intervene, evidently hoping that low prices will eventually curb production in the United States.The price decline \u201cdoes not mean we should really rush and do something,\" OPEC\u2019s secretary general, Abdalla El-Badri, told reporters after the meeting here on Thursday. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to panic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to see how the market behaves.\u201dEven though lower prices will hurt oil producers in the United States, the American economy will probably benefit as consumers have more money to spend and companies\u2019 energy bills decline. Europe and Japan, both large oil importers, are also likely to get a boost from lower prices, although in Europe high taxes on energy limit gains for consumers.Lower prices, on the other hand, could be very painful for OPEC producers, who depend heavily on oil revenue.Some of the world\u2019s largest exporters of oil, including Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela, are members of OPEC. The group meets at least a couple of times a year, usually in Vienna, where the organization has its headquarters, but sometimes more often to discuss and try to manage the global oil markets.While Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have each stashed away hundreds of billions of dollars in savings to buffer the effects of lower prices, Iran, Algeria and Venezuela, for example, will struggle to finance their government budgets at current price levels, according to a recent study by Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at Roubini Global Economics.Venezuela and some other producers badly wanted a cut to prop up prices and will be bitterly disappointed by the meeting\u2019s outcome.Analysts say that Thursday\u2019s announcement signals a radical change on the part of OPEC. Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at the market research IHS firm, called the announcement \u201ca major tactical shift.\u201d For decades OPEC has intervened to manage oil prices, cutting production when necessary. \u201cNow they are defending volume and letting the rest take care of itself,\u201d he said.Analysts say that at least some OPEC powers appear to have recognized that lower prices may prevail for a considerable time. In that situation, the organization needs to work on regaining market share.While exports of crude oil from the United States are still restricted, the surge in output is being felt on global markets as a result of the increased export of refined petroleum products like gasoline.American imports from OPEC and elsewhere have also been sharply reduced, forcing OPEC producers to compete for the remaining markets in Asia and Europe. Iran, for instance, is storing as much as 100,000 barrels a day on tankers because it is unable to find markets.Analysts say the surge in supply from the United States poses particular challenges to OPEC because there is little the producers\u2019 group can do but hope that lower prices will eventually discourage investment in drilling in the United States, thus reducing production.The dynamic has shades of the early 1980s, when new crude supplies emerged from the North Sea, Alaska and Mexico, sending prices falling and squeezing OPEC\u2019s market share.\u201cOPEC faces its greatest threat since the early 1980s,\u201d said Mr. Bahree, the analyst.This divide between the countries that can endure low prices and those whose economic needs are more pressing is probably affecting OPEC\u2019s efforts to come up with a response to the declining price.Despite an effort to maintain a calm front, there were signs of frustration. During the traditional session with reporters at the beginning of Thursday\u2019s meeting the Saudi oil minister, Ali Al-Naimi, angrily shooed away reporters and refused to answer questions.Mr. Naimi had apparently grown weary of being surrounded by reporters as he tried to make his way through the lobby of Vienna\u2019s Grand Hotel, which serves as a kind of informal headquarters for OPEC meetings because the Saudis and other OPEC delegates always stay there.Mr. Naimi, an important figure in OPEC because of Saudi Arabia\u2019s dominant role and his own long tenure, has been in Vienna since Monday, meeting with other producers from both inside and outside the organization in an effort to devise a unified response.Igor Sechin, the chief of Russia\u2019s state-controlled Rosneft, met with Mr. Naimi to discuss cutting production, but no agreement was reached. OPEC officials had high hopes that Russia might join the organization in cutting production.OPEC may be facing a prolonged period of weak markets for its crude. IHS forecasts that the growth of supply outside of OPEC next year will exceed global demand growth, leaving no room for OPEC countries to increase their production.At least for the time being, OPEC appears to have decided it will be too difficult to negotiate the production cuts with individual members that analysts say are necessary to have a strong impact on the market. OPEC has not had individual production quotas since 2011, when it agreed to operate on the basis of group output targets rather than individual limits. Restoring quotas is likely to be a lengthy and difficult exercise because the quotas are matters of prestige and economic power.Several OPEC countries have the potential to increase their production. Iraq has ambitions to greatly increase above its present three million barrels a day, and its officials insist that they have the right to make up for decades of lost output and should not be bound by OPEC limits. Iran, too, could eventually greatly lift output if international sanctions are lifted.OPEC may be retaining the informal system of recent years, in which Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, have adjusted production according to market conditions. These countries have benefited from the political turmoil, sanctions and other problems that have curtailed production in countries like Iran, Venezuela and Libya.Floyd Norris, whose High &\nLow Finance column normally appears\non this page, is on vacation.Advertisement"}

Chinese institutions with ties to Western entities, no matter how benign, have also come under attack. And state-run newspapers have taken to blaming \u201chostile foreign forces\u201d for any major disturbance, whether it is ethnic violence in western China or student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong.The vilification of foreigners as enemies of China has been a staple of propaganda by the Communist Party since before its rise to power, and analysts say the leadership tends to ramp up such rhetoric when it feels under pressure at home.\u201cHistorically, during every period with many deep conflicts within the country, there has been a surge of antiforeign sentiments from the party,\u201d said Zhang Lifan, a historian, pointing to Mao Zedong\u2019s disastrous Cultural Revolution as an example. At the moment, he said, \u201cthe political establishment needs the public to turn their rage toward foreign countries\u201d because anger over the widening gap between rich and poor in China has reached \u201ccrisis levels.\u201dBut unlike earlier campaigns targeting the West, the current wave of nationalism comes as China is ascendant. Mr. Xi presides over a country that is on the verge of overtaking the United States as the world\u2019s largest economy and that enjoys influence around the world, especially in Asia, where it has sought to expand its territorial footprint.Wang Jiangsong, a professor of labor relations at the China Institute of Industrial Relations, was quoted in the newspaper as saying that the authorities had secretly tracked transfers of overseas money to the Chinese organizations and were worried that \u201csome NGOs would be manipulated by overseas forces and conduct activities that may endanger national security and undermine social stability.\u201dThe campaign has reached into academia as well. An employee of an American organization that promotes dialogue among scholars said some Chinese professors who work on international relations were no longer writing or saying anything in public that cast the United States in a positive light, for fear of being accused of spying. The employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to antagonize Chinese partners, added that one Chinese university had barred visiting American scholars from lecturing if their research did not conform to the party line.The pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong have been a favorite target. Last Friday, Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper close to the party, ran a front-page article under a headline that said the newspaper had found \u201cironclad evidence\u201d that the United States had been secretly plotting the local Occupy movement since 2006.Some have questioned the sincerity, or pointed out the hypocrisy, of the party\u2019s tirades against the West, noting that many party officials have children or other family members living and even applying for citizenship overseas. Mr. Xi\u2019s daughter, Xi Mingze, attended Harvard University under a pseudonym.\u201cHow can Chinese officials really be anti-American?\u201d asked Zhan Jiang, a media studies professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University. \u201cAntiforeign sentiments will always be present in China because of China\u2019s unique history,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the public\u2019s opinion of the West will not change because of what the party says.\u201dDan Levin contributed reporting, and Mia Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Will Save the Democratic Party From Itself?", "Date": "2014-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot everyone agrees that Hillary Clinton\u2019s selection as the Democratic nominee is unstoppable. The first to challenge her is Jim Webb, a one-term former senator from Virginia.Here is the case for the Democratic Party renegade.Our Constitution established a government not to protect the dominance of an aristocratic elite, but under the principle that there should be no permanent aristocracy, that every single American should have equal protection under the law, and a fair opportunity to achieve at the very highest levels.Webb suggested that he could bring working class whites back into the Democratic fold and restore the biracial Democratic coalition:We have drifted to the fringes of allowing the very inequalities that our Constitution was supposed to prevent. Walk into some of our inner cities if you dare, and see the stagnation, poverty, crime and lack of opportunity that still affects so many African-Americans. Or travel to the Appalachian Mountains, where my own ancestors settled and whose cultural values I still share, and view the poorest counties in America \u2013 who happen to be more than 90 percent white, and who live in the reality that \u201cif you\u2019re poor and white you\u2019re out of sight.\u201dThe Democratic Party used to be the place where people like these could come not for a handout but for an honest handshake, good full-time jobs, quality education, health care they can afford, and the vital, overriding belief that we\u2019re all in this together and the system is not rigged.Webb\u2019s exploration of a presidential bid is based on the premise that he can tap into a crucial but alienated segment of the electorate.Webb\u2019s election history \u2013 his victory in Virginia is the only race that he has run \u2013 suggests that he will have difficulty achieving his goals. Before we turn to examine the forces that will make his candidacy a difficult one, let\u2019s take a look at some positives.migrated to America in the eighteenth century, traveling in groups of families and bringing with them not only long experience as rebels and outcasts but also unparalleled skills as frontiersmen and guerrilla fighters. Their cultural identity reflected acute individualism, dislike of aristocracy and a military tradition, and, over time, the Scots-Irish defined the attitudes and values of the military, of working class America, and even of the peculiarly populist form of American democracy itself.Webb is one answer to the weaknesses of today\u2019s center-left, the so-called \u201cupstairs-downstairs\u201d coalition described by Joel Kotkin, presidential fellow in Urban Futures at Chapman University. Kotkin argues in his recently published book, \u201cThe New Class Conflict,\u201d that the Democratic Party has been taken over by what he calls \u201cgentry liberals,\u201d an elite that has undermined the historic purpose of the Democratic Party.Kotkin contends thatThe great raison d'\u00eatre for left-wing politics \u2013 advocating for the middle- and working classes \u2013 has been refocused to attend more closely to the policy imperatives and interests of small, highly affluent classes, as well as the powerful public sector.I asked Kotkin what he thought of the themes Webb intends to raise, and he wrote back \u201cI think he\u2019s onto something.\u201dMost Democratic politicians and strategists, according to Kotkin, \u201cjust have no feel at all \u2014 as Harry Truman and Bill Clinton did, for example \u2014 for the aspirations of the middle class. This is why they are losing them, and deservedly so.\u201dMorris Fiorina, a political scientist at Stanford, is similarly critical of the \u201cupscale capture\u201d of the Democratic Party. In an email, he wrote that in the aftermath of the financial collapse of 2008,the country is desperate for economic relief, but as time goes on it becomes clear that the administration\u2019s economic policy is to take care of the financial sector, where hundreds of people are clearly guilty of fraud in any layman\u2019s view. The result is building disappointment, resentment, and rage in the public, which results in the 2010 debacle.\u201cToday,\u201d Fiorina writes,We have a situation where voters can choose between a party that openly admits to being a lap dog of Wall Street and a party that by its actions clearly is a lap dog but denies it. At least vote for the honest one.Asked about Webb, Fiorina replied, \u201cthe emotional side of me loves him.\u201d But, Fiorina cautioned, \u201cthe rational side is worried about how he would actually behave if he were president.\u201dClinton, Ball said,is polished and produced and perfectly calibrated. He is not. He is rough. He is authentic. He cares about issues. He speaks plainly. He doesn\u2019t try to oversmile, for example, he just is exactly who he is. And there\u2019s something very compelling about that, and it is a stark contrast from the very carefully packaged and branded Clinton image.seems an improbable candidate. He has taken illiberal positions, was President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Navy secretary, has few relationships within the Democratic Party, and has no serious fund-raising network. What he does possess is a long-held and forceful opposition to U.S. interventions in Iraq and Libya, and potentially Syria, as well as solid anti-Wall Street credentials. In Democratic primaries, these may be Clinton\u2019s greatest impediments to rallying a hard-core activist base.The results of this comparison do not support the portrayal of Webb as a candidate equipped to win over key white constituencies.Take, for example, the ballots cast by white men. Webb lost among these voters by a 24-point margin, 38-62. Exit poll data on all House races in 2006 shows that Democratic House candidates lost white men by a smaller 9-point margin, 44-53. White women voted for Allen over Webb by 53-47; while House Democratic candidates split the votes of white women, 49-50.Similarly, self-identified conservatives chose Allen over Webb by a 76-point margin, 12-88, while House Democratic candidates lost this segment of the electorate by a substantial but smaller margin, 58 points (20-78). Webb did not do any better with white evangelical and born-again Protestants, losing these voters by a larger margin than did House Democratic candidates.Tester and McCaskill both performed better among white men and women, conservatives and white born-again and evangelical Protestants, than Webb did.Let\u2019s forget Webb for a moment and take the question a step further. What are the prospects of winning the presidential nomination for a candidate who challenges current Democratic Party strategic orthodoxy? This strategy calls for identity group, rather than class-based, mobilization, on the assumption that turning out single women, the young, and racial and ethnic minorities is more effective than an uphill struggle to revive support in the recalcitrant white middle and working class.As much as such a shift to a class-based strategy might result in economic policies more beneficial to less affluent Democratic constituencies, and therefore to more votes in the long haul, so far there has been insufficient intraparty pressure to force a change in strategic orientation.There are, however, fundamental problems with the current Democratic strategy, not least of which is that it is a strategy for winning presidential elections but not necessarily for exerting real political control.Insofar as the Republican Party tempers its retrograde stance on social-sexual and moral-racial issues, Democratic campaigns stressing alleged threats from conservatives \u2014 the threat to freedom and privacy posed by the Christian right; the threat to Hispanic family unity posed by anti-immigrant activists; the threat to programs serving the poor posed by deficit hawks \u2014 will run out of gas.Democrats, according to Pew, retained an advantage on less tangible qualities such as empathy, honesty and a willingness to compromise.If those numbers do not change significantly before Nov. 8, 2016, it won\u2019t matter whether the nominee seeks to strengthen a biracial coalition by broadening white support or by increasing turnout among the party\u2019s identity group constituencies. The Democrats\u2019 lack of credibility on economic issues will hobble, if not extinguish, the party\u2019s prospects. Unless the Democrats develop a coherent, comprehensive strategy for the have-nots, it won\u2019t matter whether the party\u2019s nominee is Clinton, Webb or anyone else.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Iran-Ukraine Affair", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHave you heard about the Iran-Ukraine affair?I am not suggesting there is any such formal Iran-Ukraine trade-off between the Obama administration and Putin. I am suggesting that the Russian leader has a keen eye for American weakness and an exquisite sense of timing. The abrupt flaring of new fighting in eastern Ukraine, and the abrupt Russian readiness to help on Iran ahead of the Nov. 24 deadline for nuclear talks, are not a mere coincidence. They are part of a Russian strategy and, for now, the United States is playing along.An Iran nuclear deal would be good for the United States, Iran and the world. President Obama understands its importance, hence his recent reported letter to the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. An accord could place all Iran\u2019s irreversible nuclear capacity in a limited and verifiable box, ensuring there is never an Iranian bomb, while ushering the last sizeable emerging market nation into the global economy. It would change the blocked politics of the Middle East, confounding America\u2019s enemies and forcing sometimes manipulative allies to think in new and perhaps constructive ways. The deal, at this point, represents the last hope for any significant Obama legacy in the Middle East. It is clear that he wants it.But the unspoken price of an Iran deal, vital as it is, cannot be the loss of Ukraine and the unraveling of NATO. Putin has already annexed Crimea despite Russia\u2019s signed agreement in 1994 \u201cto respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.\u201d There is every reason to believe he has designs on all Ukraine. The West\u2019s mistake has been to think that Putin is not serious in wishing to reconstitute the Soviet Union in new guise.The current Russian buildup has all the signs of preparation for an offensive. Large, unmarked convoys of heavy weapons and tanks manned by personnel without insignia on their uniforms (like those who took over Crimea) have been seen rumbling toward the front lines in rebel-held territory. Sophisticated artillery and ground-to-air missile systems have been moved into position. Units all the way from the east and far north of Russia have been massed. You don\u2019t move military units thousands of miles for nothing.A retired NATO general who recently held talks with the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, told me that intelligence estimates are of some 45,000 regular Russian troops on the border; tens of thousands of Russian irregulars of various stripes inside Ukraine organized by a smaller number of Russian officers and military personnel; some 450 battle tanks and over 700 pieces of artillery.\u201cUkraine has no real fighting capacity to face all this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think we\u2019re their friends and don\u2019t understand why we won\u2019t help them. They are frustrated and afraid because they can see a hammer coming at them.\u201dIn response to Putin\u2019s hammer, the West has expressed concern. The United States National Security Council spokeswoman has said, \u201cWe are very concerned.\u201d The European Union has called the reports of convoys of heavy weapons \u201cvery worrying.\u201d Concern and worry do not stop a hammer. Poroshenko\u2019s requests to Obama for substantial American military assistance should not have been rejected.Watch Putin\u2019s actions. Be very wary of his words. That is the lesson of the past year. It has not been learned. It is nice that the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and Secretary of State John Kerry have just agreed to exchange information on Ukraine and called for respect for a September cease-fire that is unraveling in the smoke and fire of Donetsk. It is also meaningless. Lavrov feigns the innocent on the military buildup. That\u2019s his good-cop role.The reality is dangerous. A quarter-century after the fall of the Berlin Wall, as balloons go up in the German capital, a nation of 45 million people that wants to enjoy the fruits of European freedom is being abandoned to Russian dismemberment. If that happens, if Ukraine is lost, America\u2019s promise to its NATO allies in the Baltics and Eastern Europe is not going to be viewed as credible. A core Russian strategic objective since 1945 \u2014 the decoupling of American and European defense \u2014 will be on its way to realization.I just hope the refrain inside the White House is not: \u201cWe can\u2019t annoy the Russians on Ukraine. They\u2019re being helpful on Iran. We won\u2019t get a deal without them.\u201d But I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. An Iran-Ukraine affair is plausible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Persecution, Guardian of Lake Tai Spotlights China\u2019s Polluters ", "Date": "2014-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byZHOUTIE, China \u2014 By autumn, the stench of Lake Tai and the freakish green glow of its waters usually fade with the ebbing of the summer heat, but this year is different. Standing on a concrete embankment overlooking a fetid, floating array of plastic bottles, foam takeout containers, flip-flops and the occasional dead fish, Wu Lihong, the lake\u2019s unofficial guardian, shook his head in disgust.\u201cIf you jumped into this water, you\u2019d shed a layer of skin,\u201d he said one recent afternoon. \u201cThe government claims they are cleaning up the lake, but as you can see, it\u2019s just not true.\u201dSince the 2007 crisis, which drew widespread domestic news media coverage and prompted a special meeting of the cabinet, the government has spent billions of dollars cleaning up the lake, the country\u2019s third-largest freshwater body. But environmentalists say it has little to show for the money. Hundreds of chemical plants, textile mills and ceramics workshops continue to dump their noxious effluent into the waterways that feed into Lake Tai.\u201cSome progress has been made, but we haven\u2019t yet reached a turning point,\u201d said Ma Jun, one of the country\u2019s leading environmentalists. \u201cFor many factories, the cost of violating the rules is lower than the cost of compliance.\u201dSince emerging from prison in 2010, Mr. Wu has continued his advocacy work, prompting a predictable response from the authorities. He is subjected to periods of confinement at his home in Zhoutie, a village on Lake Tai. His cellphone is monitored by the police and he is barred from traveling beyond Yixing, the township in eastern Jiangsu Province that includes Zhoutie.Plainclothes police officers often accompany him on shopping excursions, and surveillance cameras line the narrow road to his home. Vengeful officials, he said, have even stymied his efforts to find a job by warning away would-be employers. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the garden in front of my house, I\u2019d probably starve,\u201d said Mr. Wu, a short, pudgy-faced man who often sounds like he is shouting, even when indoors.Reached by phone, an employee of the Zhoutie public security bureau denied that it curtailed Mr. Wu\u2019s freedom.But some local officials oppose policies they fear could close factories and eliminate jobs. They also prefer to deal with environmental problems their own way, if at all, which is why Mr. Wu ran into trouble with officials in Jiangsu, a relatively wealthy slice of coastal China that has prospered from its fecund, well-watered landscape but even more from industrial development, which has fouled the region\u2019s rivers and canals.Beginning in the mid-1990s, when he began noticing a sickly rainbow hue in the once-pristine creeks near his home, Mr. Wu began a campaign to name and shame polluting factories in Zhoutie. He collected water samples in plastic bottles, wrote letters to high-ranking environmental officials and invited television reporters to film how factories secretly discharged their wastewater at night.In 2001, after local officials drained and dredged a canal that had been polluted by a dye plant in advance of an inspection tour from Beijing, Mr. Wu exposed their ruse \u2014 which included dumping carp into the canal and dispatching villagers with fishing rods to complete the Potemkin image of ecological recovery. In the years that followed, he became something of a media celebrity; in 2005, the National People\u2019s Congress named him an \u201cEnvironmental Warrior.\u201dBack in Yixing, which earns 80 percent of its tax revenue from local industry, officials were furious. In 2007, as he was preparing a lawsuit against the environmental bureau, Mr. Wu was arrested and charged with trying to blackmail a company in exchange for withholding accusations of wrongdoing. During his interrogation, Mr. Wu said, he was whipped with willow branches, burned with cigarettes and kept in solitary confinement with little to eat. \u201cThe abuse was more than I could take, so of course I signed the confession they had drawn up,\u201d he later said.That summer, shortly before he was put on trial, the industrial effluent flowing into Lake Tai from the 2,000 factories in the region reached a tipping point, prompting the algae bloom that forced officials in the nearby city of Wuxi to cut off water to two million residents.Under the glare of a national spotlight, Jiangsu officials said they would spend more than $14 billion to clean up the lake and vowed to address the problem of toxic algae blooms within five years.But the money, government researchers acknowledge, has had a negligible impact. According to the Lake Tai Basin Authority, 90 percent of water samples taken from the lake this summer were considered so toxic that contact with human skin was ill-advised. Wuxi, in the meantime, has found an alternative source for its drinking water.In a recent interview with Xinhua Daily, Zhang Limin, deputy director of the Lake Tai Water Pollution Prevention Office, said the flood of contaminants had begun to level off, although it is still more than three times as much as the lake can absorb without killing most aquatic life.Flushing the lake with water from the Yangtze River has improved water quality somewhat, though critics say it simply pushes pollution further downstream. These days, many polluters have built pipelines to centralized waste-treatment plants that are incapable of handling the flow. Others simply pipe waste directly into waterways through underground conduits that allow them to avoid detection.But environmentalists say there is reason for hope. In April, the central government revised the nation\u2019s environmental law for the first time since 1989, imposing steep fines on polluters and requiring companies to disclose pollution data. The regulations, which take effect in January, will also allow environmental groups to file public interest lawsuits against factories that break the law.Mr. Ma, the environmentalist, said the new measures include important tools for cleaning up Lake Tai and other ailing bodies of water, but the key would be enforcement. \u201cAll it takes is the mayor or the head of a county saying, \u2018You can\u2019t touch this factory. It\u2019s too important to the local economy,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said.Mr. Wu said he was less hopeful, noting how little has changed in recent years despite intense pressure from Beijing and the billions of dollars spent. \u201cA lot of that money ends up lining the pockets of local officials,\u201d he said.His outspokenness has taken a toll on his family, who have also been subjected to frequent harassment. Last year his daughter, Wu Yunlei, went to the United States on a tourist visa and promptly requested political asylum. \u201cWhen I was younger, I didn\u2019t understand what my father was doing and I was often angry about the trouble it caused us, but now I\u2019ve come to appreciate it,\u201d she said in an email.Once content to focus on the environment, Mr. Wu now believes that healing his beloved lake requires more sweeping change. \u201cIf with all their wealth, the Communist Party can\u2019t clean up this lake, it tells you the problem is much bigger,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve come to realize the root of the problem is the system itself.\u201dPatrick Zuo contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding a Retirement Haven to Suit You", "Date": "2014-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial SectionMore than 10 years ago, Barbara Zierten and her husband retired to a small town in California\u2019s scenic \u201cgold country,\u201d in the Sierra Nevada foothills.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful here,\u201d said Ms. Zierten, 73, explaining the attraction of the area east of San Francisco. They also were on a tight budget and reasoned that a small town would be cheaper.But as time has passed, they have decided the area isn\u2019t an ideal fit. For one thing, the library is open only part time. \u201cI\u2019m a reader,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s frustrating.\u201d And a bad experience with a hospital has led her to seek treatment for health concerns in San Francisco, a two- to three-hour drive.Perhaps most dispiriting to Ms. Zierten, a liberal who closely follows politics, is that the population\u2019s views tend to be much more conservative than her own. Particularly irksome is one resident who often puts up large signs critical of Barack Obama: \u201cThe latest said, \u2018President Ebola.\u2019 \u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t do my research,\u201d she conceded. The couple is now contemplating relocating to Sacramento.As Ms. Zierten learned, shopping for a retirement community should ideally involve more than a perusal of real estate circulars, a check of local tax rates and a glance at the average temperature. When choosing a place to live for two decades or more, retirees also should consider whether a community reflects their values, and if the place can truly meet their needs for health care, as well as social and cultural activities as they grow older.Thinking through what they want, and then taking time to research communities that seem to be a good fit, can help retirees avoid disappointment and potentially costly financial mistakes, Jane Bryant Quinn, a personal finance journalist, advises. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to move, start years in advance,\u201d she said.Catherine Frank, director of the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, urges retirees to visit a prospective community and live there as they would expect to, on a daily basis. Pay attention to how you will shop, how you will get around, how you will occupy your time, she says, and be specific with your requirements. \u201cDo you have heart problems, so you need good cardiac care?\u201d Ms. Frank presses. \u201cCan you live a healthy lifestyle there by going walking or biking?\u201dOne obvious approach is to subscribe to the local newspaper or peruse it online. Catherine Moore, 65, who is retiring in Temple, N.H., early next year after a career at an outdoor equipment retailer, went further than that. Before choosing the place, she read the minutes from its town meeting, a uniquely New England form of government, to find out what sort of issues the local population was facing and how it handled them \u2014 \u201ca capsule view of what people value and how they compromise or agree to disagree,\u201d she wrote in an email.Town meeting notes can often be found online, she said, and can give insight into whether the community is likely to offer friends and neighbors who help one another. \u201cI don\u2019t have to agree with my neighbor\u2019s political views to know that he will be over with his chain saw to clear my drive after an ice storm,\u201d she said.Buck Bragg, 67, a former corporate insurance lawyer, recalls being \u201cintoxicated\u201d at the idea of moving after he retired. He and his wife, Nancy, a former college educator, had initially relocated to Alaska after he graduated from law school but ended up moving to live in Bloomington, Ill., for his career. They enjoyed raising their children there, he said, but welcomed the chance to go elsewhere. After attending a seminar on retirement planning in Asheville, N.C., he realized that the city had much of what they were seeking, including scenic beauty, a low crime rate and senior-friendly activities, like book clubs.He and his wife had thought they would build a home in a development that offered golf. But after moving to Asheville in 2010, they found they liked doing different things, like yoga. They opted instead to rent downtown, which offers a vibrant restaurant and art scene as well as proximity to mountains for hiking. Mr. Bragg advises renting a home for at least six months initially, to see how easy it is to meet people and chat with local residents who are familiar with neighborhood specifics. \u201cYou need to know what they know,\u201d he said.The list, which was updated Tuesday, includes many cities and towns \u2014 like Madison, Wis., and Iowa City, Iowa \u2014 that aren\u2019t necessarily thought of as traditional retirement destinations. Its top locations offer strong economies with employment options, since many people of retirement age want to work at least part time; opportunities for learning and cultural engagement; access to quality health care; and good transportation.The report developed an index using 84 criteria, based on publicly available data, to rank more than 350 communities. It does include data on the weather and golf courses but goes further. For instance, a town\u2019s \u201cwellness\u201d rank factors in the number of fast-food restaurants per capita and rates of diabetes, as well as the percentage of hospitals offering geriatric services. Its \u201ccommunity engagement\u201d rank reflects the number of libraries and Y.M.C.A.s, as well as the level of senior volunteerism.College towns appear often on the Milken list, which comes as no surprise to Marilyn and Richard Frey, who settled in Oxford, Miss. \u2014 not on the list but home to the University of Mississippi.The Freys, in their 70s, spent much of their lives as teachers, then had second careers working as managers for the La Quinta hotel chain. While working in El Paso, they bought land for a home in the mountains of New Mexico, but then worried that the location might be too remote as they aged. \u201cWe began to rethink the whole thing,\u201d Mrs. Frey said.They settled on new criteria: affordability, airport proximity for international travel and access to arts and entertainment options. Mr. Frey retired first and took charge of the couple\u2019s relocation effort. He attended a conference hosted by the state of Mississippi, and he returned home with a stack of packets about various communities. \u201cI put them in three piles: yes, no, and maybe,\u201d he recalled.Mr. Frey then rented a car and drove across the state, visiting 10 promising locations. \u201cI drove the neighborhoods,\u201d he said. \u201cI visited supermarkets.\u201dA spring trip to Mississippi with his wife led them to focus on Oxford: \u201cI remember the daffodils,\u201d she said. They moved there in early 2002. They like that the downtown square has three bookstores that host talks by visiting authors. They attend theater productions and can take classes and attend sporting events at Ole Miss.Jerry Swerling, a public relations professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School in Los Angeles, is using an approach somewhat similar to the Freys\u2019, with a heavier emphasis on initial Internet research. He and his wife, Karen, a professional costume designer, love their home and the climate in California, but they want a place on the East Coast with a lower cost of living when they retire next year. They aim to sell their current home and buy a less expensive one.They have used traditional starting points, like magazine lists of \u201cbest retirement places,\u201d as well as ideas from friends. \u201cIf a place crops up on multiple lists, I\u2019ll look at it,\u201d he said. Their goal: a lively, urban area with access to Amtrak, so they can travel by train to visit Washington, New York and New England. \u201cWe need a place with cinema, museums,\u201d he said.Ideally, they would like a neighborhood where they can walk a block or two for a drink or a meal. He uses the real estate website Zillow, which allows users to track listings in specific neighborhoods; a mapping function lets users see, say, the number of nearby restaurants and cafes. \u201cTo me, cafes are a symbol of civilization,\u201d he said. He also checks a crime mapping site, raidsonline.com, to gauge a neighborhood\u2019s safety.One catch, he said, is health care. Many retirement rankings measure the number of doctors per capita, but that\u2019s not helpful if the doctors aren\u2019t in your particular insurance plan. (Individual plans offered under the Affordable Care Act, in particular, might have very narrow doctor networks.) Mr. Swerling, 67, is eligible for Medicare but his wife won\u2019t be yet, so they expect they will have to find an interim health plan for her.They have narrowed their list to a handful of communities on the mid-Atlantic seaboard, including Richmond, Va., which they like for its rich history. They are planning a driving trip in December and will stay a night or two in several locations.Deeper reconnaissance is now a priority for Ms. Zierten, the California retiree. She has subscribed to Sacramento Magazine, partly to learn about goings-on in the city, where she and her husband, John Dahlen, hope to move. And she plans to spend time at local breakfast haunts, \u201ceavesdropping\u201d on conversations. \u201cIf everyone\u2019s talking about death panels,\u201d she said, referring to a term that conservatives use to argue against the Affordable Care Act, she will probably look elsewhere. She doesn\u2019t mind opposing viewpoints, she said. But, \u201cYou want to find a comfort level.\u201dCategories include, for instance, \u201cUrban Suburbs,\u201d wealthy, mostly white areas close to big cities that voted heavily for President Obama in 2012. \u201cEvangelical Hubs\u201d are largely white, with lower incomes; these areas are quite conservative and voted overwhelmingly for the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney.Antoine Yoshinaka, an assistant professor of government at American University, said that if you really wanted to get more specific, you could find information about voting patterns at the precinct level by contacting the elections division of the secretary of state for your state.But he cautioned that even that approach would not guarantee that your neighbor would share your views: \u201cThere\u2019s no one perfect measure.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about finding a place to retire misstated the number of criteria used by the Milken Institute in ranking the \u201cBest Cities for Successful Aging.\u201d It is 84 \u2014 not 78, the original number of criteria used in 2012.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "J.C. Penney and Macy\u2019s Post Lackluster Sales Before Holidays ", "Date": "2014-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJ.C. Penney and Macy\u2019s both reported lackluster sales in the third quarter, the latest sign that despite low gas prices and improving job numbers, retailers just cannot persuade shoppers to spend.Both retailers cited warmer fall weather as one of the reasons sales were off, as consumers postponed buying heavier clothes and items for winter. J.C. Penney reported a loss of 62 cents a share on sales of $2.76 billion in the third quarter, compared with a loss of $1.94 a share on $2.78 billion for the same period last year. Analysts were expecting the company, which is in the middle of a major turnaround, to post revenue of $2.81 billion, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. Home and fine jewelry helped drive sales, the retailer said in its earnings announcement, although same-store sales were also flat compared with last year. The chain has been busy getting back on its feet after missteps in marketing and pricing led to steep losses. Last year, Penney\u2019s board ousted the former chief executive, Ron Johnson, after just 17 months on the job.\u201cWe are nearing the completion of J.C. Penney\u2019s turnaround,\u201d Myron E. Ullman, J.C. Penney\u2019s chief executive, told analysts in a conference call after the earnings announcement. \u201cBut competition is certainly rigorous and fierce. We recognize we have to compete every week, every day.\u201d He said that like other retailers, sales had slowed in September and October despite a strong start to the back-to-school season. Aside from weather-related dips in sales, Mr. Ullman also said he suspected that customers were holding back on spending until the year-end sales.But keeping costs down helped its profit rise to $217 million, or 61 cents a share, up from $177 million, or 47 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago.\u201cWe are very pleased with our third-quarter earnings, even though the sales performance fell short of our expectations,\u201d Terry J. Lundgren, Macy\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cWe knew we were up against very strong third-quarter sales growth for our company last year.\u201dMacy\u2019s has at least reported modest increases in profit this year. For the first three quarters of 2014, it had net income of $733 million, up from $675 million for the same period last year.In particular, Mr. Lundgren highlighted the company\u2019s strategies for online shoppers, including offering in-store pickup that could help drive foot traffic to its brick-and-mortar Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s stores.Still, Macy\u2019s lowered its expectations for the rest of 2014. The company forecast that earnings per diluted share for the year would range from $4.25 to $4.35, down from its earlier forecast of $4.40 to $4.50.Karen M. Hoguet, Macy\u2019s chief financial officer, also blamed warmer weather for the sluggish sales. But she said Macy\u2019s would have its \u201caccelerator pushed to the floor this holiday season,\u201d and expressed optimism about the company\u2019s strategy to get customers into the stores. By offering in-store pickup, more customers flock to the Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s locations during the holiday season, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re finding a significant up-spend in total on the customers that are coming into the store,\u201d Ms. Hoguet said during a call with analysts to discuss the company\u2019s third quarter results.The mix of sluggish retail sales with a recovering economy has puzzled analysts, who had expected shoppers to emphatically return to stores after signs of improving consumer confidence, lower gas prices and a fall in unemployment. But disappointing results from the retailers themselves have prompted analysts to temper their expectations for a shopping rebound. \u201cPersistent softness among publicly traded retailers is somewhat puzzling to us given current economic conditions,\u201d Ken Perkins, president of the analytics company, Retail Metrics, wrote in a note. He pointed to a lack of wage gains for lower-income consumers, as well as a shift in spending toward autos, mobile data plans and smartphones, as negatives for retailers.Savvy consumers have grown accustomed to waiting for the aggressive holiday discounts that have become the norm in recent years, said Robert Plaza, a senior equity analyst at Key Private Bank. That made the sales season even more critical for retailers this year, he said.\u201cPeople are saving up. They\u2019re waiting for the year-end sales,\u201d he said. In response, retailers are trying to squeeze the most out of their holiday season sales. Walmart\u2019s Black Friday sales will now stretch over a five-day period, from 12:01 a.m. online on Thanksgiving and running through \u201cCyber Monday\u201d on Dec. 1, the retail giant said this week.\u201cIt became Black Friday, then it became Thursday, and now it\u2019s becoming weeklong. Maybe it\u2019s going to be November,\u201d Duncan Mac Naughton, executive vice president and chief merchandising officer for Walmart U.S., said in a call on Tuesday.J.C. Penney is also gearing up for a longer, harder sell to shoppers this holiday season.\u201cThough they have more money to spend because of low fuel prices, they\u2019re still savvy and want to make sure they\u2019re spending their money wisely,\u201d Mr. Ullman said. \u201cWe feel that we\u2019re well prepared for Black Friday week, if you want to call it that.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xi Jinping\u2019s Rapid Rise in China Presents Challenges to the U.S.", "Date": "2014-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisHONG KONG \u2014 President Obama will sit down Wednesday with the kind of Chinese leader no American president has ever encountered: a strongman with bold ambitions at home and abroad who sees China as a great power peer of the United States.For over 20 years, the Chinese Communist Party elite largely made decisions by consensus, seeking to avoid a repeat of the turbulence under Mao and Deng Xiaoping. But less than two years after assuming power, Mr. Xi has emerged as more than the \u201cfirst among equals\u201d in the ruling Politburo Standing Committee, shaking the longstanding assumption that China would be steered by steady, if often ponderous, collective leadership.The implications of his rise for the United States, and for Mr. Obama, are two-sided. When the two leaders meet, Mr. Obama may have a surer sense that his counterpart has the power to make good on his promises. On Wednesday, they unveiled a deal on curbing greenhouse gases, including a landmark agreement by China to reach a peak in carbon dioxide emissions by about 2030. On Tuesday, China also said it would eliminate tariffs on many information technology products. But so much now depends on Mr. Xi\u2019s political calculations, and he has shown himself to be wary of the West and disinclined to make concessions under pressure.Signs of Mr. Xi\u2019s ascendancy are everywhere, from the collections of his speeches selling in bookstores to the intense, often adulatory, news coverage of his busy routine. In lighter moments, the state-run news media have taken to calling him \u201cXi Dada\u201d: roughly, Big Papa Xi.Mr. Xi, 61, has shaken up party ranks with an extended campaign against official corruption and pursued a crackdown on dissent that has dismayed liberal intellectuals. Rather than distribute portfolios among his colleagues, he has hoarded control of the party\u2019s most important policy committees, known as \u201cleading small groups,\u201d and established several new ones under his command: on national security, military overhauls, economic restructuring and control of the Internet.\u201cXi has been more vigorous than anyone probably had imagined he would be,\u201d Professor Yang said. \u201cWe did anticipate some strong moves on his part, but not the scale, the breadth and the scope of his initiatives.\u201dMr. Xi has overseen a muscular foreign policy, pressing China\u2019s claims to disputed seas and islands, deepening rifts with Japan and neighbors in Southeast Asia. Those tensions have been tempered, for now, by an agreement with Japan on Friday acknowledging their differences and a trade agreement with South Korea announced Monday.At the same time, Mr. Xi\u2019s administration has resurrected and amplified traditional party themes that China\u2019s woes have been exacerbated, even instigated, by \u201chostile forces\u201d controlled by Western governments. Chinese officials accuse the United States of seeking to topple Communist Party rule, most recently by supporting pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong, a charge the United States government denies.Gnawing fear and anxiety, Professor Shirk and other China experts say, are the flip side of China\u2019s new strength and assertiveness, and may go a long way toward explaining what can appear to be dissonant positions.The sources of China\u2019s insecurities are many: public discontent over smog, graft and land seizures; a bureaucracy and military rotted by corruption; tumult in Hong Kong; ethnic strife in Tibet and Xinjiang; and the uncertain effects of slowing economic growth.Several China scholars said Mr. Xi was likely to defy early expectations that he might shift to a more moderate course after consolidating power. Such a shift could be seen as a sign of dangerous weakness, they said.Echoing previous party leaders, Mr. Xi has said that China needs a stable and peaceful international neighborhood so that it can focus on its domestic needs, and analysts said that focus could encourage his government to contain tensions with Japan and neighbors in Southeast Asia. \u201cIt looks to me like there has been a recalibration, a kind of learning from the reaction of your neighbors\u201d by China, Professor Shirk said.But Ms. Economy said she was skeptical that the calm would last.\u201cThere is certainly a foreign policy debate underway within China over whether China\u2019s assertiveness in the region has been harmful to China\u2019s broader foreign policy objectives,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that it has been resolved in a way that suggests this moderation is permanent.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Parliament Passes Measure to Break Up Google in Symbolic Vote", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlthough merely symbolic \u2014 the resolution carries no legal weight \u2014 the move came the day after a separate European body sought to further expand citizens\u2019 \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d privacy protections against Google.Both moves are also playing out against the backdrop of a long-running investigation by the European authorities of Google, on which the European Union\u2019s new antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, is still getting up to speed.A breakup of Google in Europe will almost certainly not happen, legal experts say. And whether any of the various policy moves afoot will ever significantly curtail the company\u2019s business operations across the region is still too soon to gauge.But taken together, the level of policy-making activity being devoted to the company signifies the growing antipathy to American technological dominance in the European Union even as its citizens grow ever more reliant on its gadgetry and conveniences. Not since European officials spent years seeking to rein in the powers of an earlier tech titan, Microsoft, has an American company drawn such scrutiny on this side of the Atlantic.European fears of American technology giants have been stoked in the last 18 months by the revelations of Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about American intelligence agencies\u2019 spying activities and perceived easy access to the world\u2019s tech infrastructure. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany publicly complained when it was discovered last year that her cellphone had most likely been tapped by American intelligence.In one sense, Thursday\u2019s vote amounts to little more than political posturing because the Parliament has no formal power over antitrust policy in the 28 countries of the European Union. That power rests with the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm. Yet the vote could raise pressure on Ms. Vestager to speed a decision on whether to bring formal antitrust charges against Google in an investigation that began in 2010. That inquiry involves Google\u2019s dominant position in Europe\u2019s Internet search business and asks whether the company\u2019s search results favor other Google-related services and hobble competing search advertising platforms.But even if Ms. Vestager finds fault on Google\u2019s part, analysts said, the most likely outcome might be changes in its business practices and even possibly a big fine \u2014 as happened in past European investigations with Microsoft as well as another American tech giant, the chip maker Intel.\u201cBreaking up Google would be unprecedented in all kinds of ways and seems hugely unlikely in absence of massive, proven consumer harm \u2014 and it\u2019s very unclear to me whether the commission is going to find that harm,\u201d said Mario Mariniello of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels.He noted that United States antitrust officials had never found reason to censure Google, despite its market power on both sides of the Atlantic. He said it was \u201chard to see how Europe could do this alone, and what would be the basis for doing something so fundamentally different from the U.S. authorities.\u201dRicardo Cardoso, spokesman for Ms. Vestager, said after the parliamentary vote that she would not be swayed by the result. Antitrust should be \u201cindependent from politics\u201d so that Europe\u2019s \u201cprocedures are not put into question,\u201d he said.A Google spokesman, Al Verney, declined to comment.The vote was taken on a broader resolution on the digital economy that passed with 384 votes in favor, 174 against and 56 abstentions.The lengthy resolution broadly called on the European authorities to break down barriers in digital commerce and was backed by significant numbers of lawmakers in the main conservative and socialist political blocs in the Parliament, the only directly elected body in the European Union.Ms. Vestager, a free-market Dane who took office on Nov. 1, succeeded Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, who started the antitrust investigation of Google. Mr. Almunia tried three times to settle with the company but abandoned those efforts after its competitors and other groups said the proposed settlement terms would not be enough to allow for fair competition. Google\u2019s search engine, with about 90 percent of the market in some European Union countries, is even more dominant in Europe than it is in the United States.Ms. Vestager has said she would take the necessary time before deciding on the next steps in that antitrust case. She must also decide whether to open a formal investigation into Android, Google\u2019s mobile operating system. A preliminary inquiry, also begun under Mr. Almunia, has been considering whether Google uses Android to discriminate against non-Google applications.The power of the commission to break up companies was made explicit in 2003. In a landmark case in 2008, the German energy utility E.ON agreed to sell its extra-high-voltage network as part of a settlement, not something unilaterally imposed on the company.In the case of technology companies that have already run the antitrust gantlet in Europe, the main penalty has been the use of fines. The largest single fine yet levied in such a case was 1.1 billion euros, or $1.37 billion, in 2009 against Intel for abusing its dominance in the computer chip market. But Microsoft underwent a series of investigations and settlements, racking up a total of more $3 billion in European fines over the course of a decade, including a penalty in 2013 for failing to adhere to an earlier settlement.For Google, its inability to reach a settlement with the European Commission despite years of trying means the company could still potentially face a fine of nearly $6 billion, or 10 percent of global annual sales, and restrictions on its freedom to do business in Europe if it is eventually found to have broken the bloc\u2019s competition laws.Among the proponents of tough antitrust action against Google in Europe are major American technology companies like Microsoft and Yelp, as well as powerful German and French publishing groups that have formed a lobbying group called the Open Internet Project. That Microsoft now finds itself lobbying against the current market giant indicates how quickly the dynamics can change in the digital economy.The breakup language was introduced by Andreas Schwab, a German member of the European Parliament.

{"Headline": "To China, Shift in Obama\u2019s Political Fortunes Eclipses U.S. Economic Gains", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byListening PostWASHINGTON \u2014 The last time President Obama went to China, five years ago, he was a political supernova from a nation with a depleted, debt-ridden economy. When he returns to Beijing on Monday, he will be a political casualty from a country with a resurgent economy.White House officials hope the later distinction will outweigh the earlier one when Mr. Obama meets with President Xi Jinping before traveling on to Myanmar and Australia. But they are likely to be disappointed: China, analysts say, is likely to dwell more on Mr. Obama\u2019s electoral reversals than on the comparatively robust American recovery.\u201cPolitics trumps economics, at the end of the day,\u201d said Nicholas R. Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. That is not to understate the shift in economic fortunes between China and the United States since 2009. At that time, in the depths of the financial crisis, visiting Americans were lectured by Chinese officials about the need for the United States to put its fiscal house in order. Now, Mr. Obama has cut the deficit in half while the Chinese economy is the one slowing sharply, weighed down by a sea of bad loans.But Mr. Lardy said the Chinese economy was not as troubled as some in Washington believe. The government, he said, was orchestrating a slowdown in growth to squeeze out excesses in housing and other markets \u2014 a difficult process that he said Beijing was managing fairly well. Mr. Obama, meanwhile, has been preoccupied by other crises, from the Ebola outbreak to the threat posed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The Republican takeover of the Senate has added to doubts that the president will have either the time or the political influence to push forward his much-promoted strategic pivot to Asia.China\u2019s state media has been unforgiving about Mr. Obama\u2019s political travails. \u201cObama always utters \u2018Yes, we can,\u2019 which led to the high expectations people had for him,\u201d said The Global Times, an English-language website affiliated with People\u2019s Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, in a postelection editorial. \u201cBut he has done an insipid job, offering nearly nothing to his supporters. U.S. society has grown tired of his banality.\u201dThe timing of the editorial, just a few days before Mr. Obama\u2019s arrival in Beijing, was unusual. But it reflects a broader nationalist strain in China, embodied by Mr. Xi, who has consolidated his power and displayed few signs of conciliation toward Mr. Obama on thorny issues like Chinese cyberattacks on American companies.Mr. Obama\u2019s best bet to counter doubts about his standing, analysts said, will be to move quickly on projects that reinforce America\u2019s presence in the region, like a proposed trade deal, and in areas where China and the United States can work together, like climate change.\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of, in part, communicating through your body language, through your ambitions, and through what you commit to,\u201d said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a China adviser in the Clinton administration who is now at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThat\u2019s an important part of what he\u2019ll do, but I certainly think that the election does not help him in that.\u201dOne of the areas where a Republican-controlled Congress might actually help rather than hinder Mr. Obama is in passing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an ambitious trade pact involving 12 countries that is a centerpiece of the president\u2019s pivot to Asia.Negotiations for a deal have bogged down in the last year, in part because Japan and other Asian countries are reluctant to make big concessions without knowing whether Mr. Obama will have \u201cfast-track\u201d authority to pass a treaty in Congress. The White House held off asking for such authority before the midterm elections, at the request of Democrats.Now, though, a free-trade-friendly Congress is more likely to grant Mr. Obama fast-track authority. That could give the administration a window to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2015 before the next presidential election. While in Beijing, Mr. Obama is expected to meet with leaders of the countries involved in the negotiation. They will be there for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, an annual meeting of Pacific Rim countries being held in China. The United States trade representative, Michael B. Froman, has played down expectations for any breakthrough in Beijing. And China, which has not been invited to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, will be watching the American efforts with some skepticism.Still, Mr. Xi and Mr. Obama could find common ground on climate change. As the world\u2019s two largest carbon emitters, China and the United States are trying to develop a common position on new targets for emissions reductions in advance of climate talks in Paris next year. The thinking is that they could then pull the rest of the world into a treaty.While the Chinese may view Mr. Obama as a diminished figure, analysts say they are well aware that his successor \u2014 whether Hillary Rodham Clinton or a Republican \u2014 could end up taking a tougher line toward China. That means they will keep looking for ways to work with him.Administration officials reject the contention that Mr. Obama\u2019s focus on Asia has been impeded by events elsewhere in the world. Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, noted that it was his second visit to the region this year \u2014 a \u201csubstantial investment of time and attention,\u201d she said, given \u201call the issues that we are all facing.\u201dOn the eve of the trip, the White House got good news from unlikely sources: Japan and China, which agreed to set aside a longstanding dispute over islands in the East China Sea. The United States has fretted about being drawn into an increasingly dangerous confrontation. \u201cThe tensions between Japan and China have been overshadowing the whole region, and the relationship between the United States and China,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China adviser to Mr. Obama. \u201cWhen relations between China and its neighbors are stable, that helps us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Populists Challenge European Political Order", "Date": "2014-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical Economy A specter is haunting Europe, the specter of populism. The old political order of Britain, France, Italy and Spain \u2014 not to mention smaller countries such as Greece \u2014 is facing challenges from populist movements, of the right and the left. Of the major European Union economies, only Germany is largely untouched.Last week, the United Kingdom Independence Party, a right-wing populist party, won its second seat in the British Parliament. Podemos, a Spanish left-wing populist group whose name means \u201cwe can,\u201d is leading in the opinion polls despite having been founded less than a year ago. In France, the right-wing National Front is rocking the establishment, while in Italy the hard-to-categorize Five-Star Movement is a force to be reckoned with.With the exception of Greece, where the radical left Syriza movement may take control of the government if there is an election next year, none of the populist groups is close to power. But if the traditional parties continue to fail the people for another electoral cycle, the populists could storm the barricades.The establishment has a lot to answer for. In some countries, it has been corrupt. In others, it has merely had its nose in the trough, enjoying the fruits of public office. Everywhere, politicians have spent energy spinning stories so they can hang onto power, rather than solving problems. They have lost touch with their electorates.The cures proposed by the populists, however, are worse than the disease. UKIP wants to pull Britain out of the European Union. The National Front wants to destroy the Union. The Five-Star Movement wants to yank Italy out of the euro. Podemos wants to audit part of the national debt before writing it off. Syriza wants to write off half of Greece\u2019s debts. Such policies, if ever implemented, would create a new set of economic crises. Policies such as pulling out of the Union would involve losing full access to its single market. Abandoning the euro, disastrous though the currency has been, or unilateral debt write-offs would lead to bank runs and capital controls. The armies of the unemployed would rise, not fall.Populism is good at tapping into discontent but it comes up with bad, superficial solutions. That, indeed, is perhaps the most appropriate definition of the phenomenon.But what is the best way of tackling the specter? Action is needed on two fronts.First, Europe needs to fix its economy. The economic malaise throughout the euro zone is not the only factor behind the rise of populism. But it has certainly fueled it and will continue to unless it is addressed.A grand bargain involving national governments, the European Central Bank and the European Commission is desperately needed. Governments have to press ahead with structural reforms to improve the \u201csupply side\u201d; the central bank has to loosen monetary policy further to improve demand and get inflation up to its target; and the commission needs to come up with an ambitious investment program to give the economy a fiscal lift.Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission president, is due to present his investment program this week. In theory, with interest rates so low, it should be possible to come up with something that moves the needle. But it is unclear whether Germany, which has a huge sway over Union policy, would agree.But even if the economy is fixed, that won\u2019t be the end of populism. Look at Britain, where growth is strong but so is UKIP. The lack of integrity in politics is the second big factor fueling populism.This is borne out by research by two British academics, Will Jennings and Gerry Stoker. In a recent essay, as part of a series on populism published by the Policy Network, a London-based research institution , they summarized the mood of the electorate as follows:\u201cWhat emerges is a sense of being failed by a political class that lacks the competence and strength of character to follow the right policy options and, above all, is regarded as too short- termist, media-obsessed and in cahoots with the rich and powerful to provide leadership in the public interest.\u201dThere are similar feelings across Europe. But what can be done to re- establish trust with the people and put integrity in politics at center stage?There is, admittedly, no easy solution. But part of the solution, certainly, has to be zero tolerance toward corruption and cheating. Part of it, too, should be to acknowledge the failings of politics.European politicians have to both display integrity and show they can be effective. Otherwise, they will continue to tremble at the rise of populism.Advertisement"}

He refuses to do math and word exercises in school. Does he have a learning disorder? He melts down when his mother parks in the wrong spot. Could he be on the autism spectrum? There\u2019s chaos in his home life. Is trauma an issue?Trying to control this boy\u2019s behavior with Risperdal without trying to understand it is a long way from best practices. His pediatrician is quoted as saying, \u201cHe\u2019s got M.S.D. \u2014 Matthias Specific Disorder.\u201d That may be intended as humor, but giving a child an accurate diagnosis is a serious matter.To the Editor:There is no greater burden placed upon parents with challenging children than the decision to accept the strong recommendations from medical figures to dose their children with antipsychotic drugs. I faced the same situation as Joelle Kendle in 1998, when my son was 5 years old. I yielded, unfortunately.My son died suddenly 10 years later from an adverse side effect called neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a result of a buildup of antipsychotic drugs over time.I have two suggestions for Ms. Kendle and other parents: Resist the huge pressure to dose with antipsychotic drugs (they never helped my son; they simply caused side effects), and pursue pediatric neurological solutions and alternative therapies. It turns out my son had learning disabilities that, in part, provoked his challenging behavior.There is explosive growth in prescribing antipsychotics to children under 18, and most prescriptions for children have little or no clinical support of efficacy. It is just guesswork.To the Editor:\u201cOne Drug or 2?\u201d creates the impression that the only choices available to Dr. Lawrence Diller and the mother of the patient were to add Risperdal to the stimulant treatment or to do nothing. There are many pharmacological options available in this situation, including raising the dose of the Adderall; switching to a different stimulant; adding one of several nonstimulant, nonantipsychotic drugs such as Tenex, Kapvay or Strattera; or using an antipsychotic other than Risperdal. Avoiding antipsychotics is preferable. The writer is a child psychiatrist and a clinical professor of psychiatry at Penn State College of Medicine.To the Editor:Contrary to widely held beliefs and drug-company marketing, there is little scientific support for the idea that drugs work for A.D.H.D.Instead, long-term studies have shown that most children who receive a diagnosis of A.D.H.D. in the late preschool or early school years outgrow it. Those who appear to have been helped with medications have instead outgrown the symptoms. Adding additional medications, including antipsychotics, or increasing the dose, or both, does not change this finding.What studies have shown does help prevent the development of A.D.H.D., and can remove its symptoms, is fully functional parenting and the supportive community that such parenting requires. This is what has deteriorated in recent years as many families, except for the very wealthy, have been punished by our changing economy. More and more is demanded of parents in the workplace, making it less and less possible for them to provide what their children need. The result: more and more A.D.H.D., including ever more severe cases. The writer is a retired psychologist and lecturer at Vanderbilt University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Trade Deal with U.S., E.U. Official Reinforces Plans to Press Ahead", "Date": "2014-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union\u2019s new trade commissioner said on Friday that she and her American counterpart were committed to injecting new energy into stalled trans-Atlantic trade negotiations.\u201cWe are both very, very committed to push forward,\u201d the European commissioner, Cecilia Malmstrom, told reporters after a meeting with Michael Froman, the United States trade representative. \u201cHe really believes in this, and I do as well.\u201dNegotiations for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a pact aimed at lowering tariffs and reducing regulatory barriers to encourage job creation and economic growth in Europe and the United States, began last year but have yielded few results after seven rounds. They have been effectively frozen during the midterm elections in the United States and a leadership changeover at the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union.The comments by Ms. Malmstrom, who spoke on the margins of a meeting of European Union member states\u2019 trade ministers and is not yet a month into her new job, came after talks last weekend between European Union leaders and President Obama at the Group of 20 meeting in Australia. There, David Cameron, the British prime minister, called for \u201crocket boosters\u201d to be put on efforts to reach a deal. Mr. Froman was to meet on Friday with several European Union officials as part of an effort to reinvigorate the trade negotiations.Despite voicing enthusiasm on Friday, Ms. Malmstrom said there were no immediate plans for an early resumption of the talks. The next round is scheduled for February in Brussels. Mr. Froman said his meeting with Ms. Malmstrom had been \u201can opportunity to get acquainted\u201d and to agree \u201cto work together to have a fresh start to the negotiations.\u201dIn coming weeks and months, Mr. Froman said, the United States will be \u201clooking for a clear signal that the E.U. is similarly focused on achieving an ambitious and comprehensive agreement, and doing so as soon as possible.\u201dMs. Malmstrom said on Friday that she would travel to Washington Dec. 9 for more talks with Mr. Froman. The idea was \u201cto see if we can put a fresh start into those negotiations,\u201d she said.The talks began with great fanfare in early 2013, after President Obama announced the project in his State of the Union address. The Europeans expressed hope for a preliminary deal by the end of 2014. But that optimism quickly ebbed away.European nations have dug in their heels over sectors like food and farming, while Congress has balked at Mr. Obama\u2019s trade agenda.Many Europeans also suspect the United States is more interested in a trade deal with Pacific nations than with them and are looking for signs of more engagement in trans-Atlantic trade.Moreover, any deal could get delayed until after the American presidential election in 2016 unless Washington shows more commitment to the talks, Phil Hogan, the European commissioner for agriculture, warned early this week. The Americans \u201care more interested in the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d Mr. Hogan told reporters. \u201cThere is no demonstration of a serious intent at the moment to have a T.T.I.P. deal on the American side.\u201d he said.Mr. Hogan, after holding his own meeting on Friday with Mr. Froman of the United States, said in a statement that he was committed to reaching \u201ca balanced agreement.\u201dPublic interest groups on both sides of the Atlantic have argued that a trade pact might simply hand more power to multinational corporations.A central area of discord has been a clause that gives companies the right to sue governments to enforce the terms of any trade deal. Critics say that including the clause could undermine European standards of environmental and social protection. The European Commission has already received 150,000 public comments about that provision.Powerful figures like Sigmar Gabriel, the German economy minister, have called that clause unnecessary, and Matthias Fekl, the French junior minister for trade, said in an interview on Wednesday that including it would make any deal unacceptable to Europe.\u201cIf it stays I think it will make a deal impossible,\u201d Mr. Fekl said, adding that neither the European Parliament nor member states\u2019 own legislators appeared willing to ratify it. \u201cThat\u2019s the political reality, and not only for France,\u201d he said.But American officials have insisted that the enforcement mechanism, formally known as investor-state dispute settlement, remains an essential aspect of the deal.That is a view partly shared by European negotiators, who say the clause is commonplace in other European trade deals, including recently agreed-upon accords with Canada and Singapore. Those deals still require ratification by European lawmakers.To ease concerns that the trans-Atlantic deal is being negotiated behind closed doors to meet corporate demands, Ms. Malmstrom said this week that more of the documents used in the talks would be made available for inspection by a larger number of members of the European Parliament, and that more documents also would be made available to the general public.On Friday, the European trade ministers meeting in Brussels endorsed that approach in written conclusions, citing the need \u201cto better communicate the scope and benefits of the agreement and to enhance transparency and dialogue with civil society.\u201dFrance has also been a proponent of keeping some parts of the European economy sheltered from the effects of any eventual deal. Mr. Fekl this week underlined his government\u2019s opposition to opening European markets to genetically modified foods and to dropping protections for the French film and television industry.Mr. Fekl also said Europe would continue to insist, despite American objections, that financial regulation needed to be covered in the pact. He said the United States also needed to agree not to use the names of European foodstuffs that carry special protections, like Brie cheese and Parma ham.James Kanter reported from Brussels and David Jolly from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hollywood Works to Maintain Its World Dominance", "Date": "2014-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANTA MONICA, Calif. \u2014 Twice in the last few months, there was a faint knock on the door of American supremacy in the global film market.In early September, a Chinese-language fantasy, \u201cThe Monkey King,\u201d climbed to No. 21 at the worldwide box office, with $186.1 million in sales. A few weeks later, a Chinese comedy, \u201cBreakup Buddies,\u201d shot to No. 22, with $143.1 million in ticket sales as of last week.As competitive threats go, that isn\u2019t much. But Hollywood can always find something to fret about.On Wednesday, when roughly 8,000 foreign and domestic film buyers, sellers and producers converge here at the annual American Film Market, domestic film officials will be worrying mostly about subtle shifts and distant footsteps in an international industry that is still dominated by American studios, talent and tastes.According to Rentrak\u2019s box-office tracking service, United States companies and their partners backed the top 20 performers at the world box office every year for the last five. A rare standout was \u201cIntouchables\u201d in 2012, from France, ranked 16th, with $432.6 million in global sales, just behind Universal Pictures\u2019 British-created \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d with $442 million.While the domestic box office has faltered \u2014 after a soft summer it is down 3.8 percent for the year, to about $8.5 billion, according to Rentrak \u2014 the United States has scored new triumphs abroad. To date, Rentrak\u2019s data shows, the year\u2019s best performer is Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cTransformers: Age of Extinction,\u201d with about $1.1 billion in world sales, much of that in China.In all, markets outside the United States accounted for roughly $25 billion of $35.9 billion in worldwide box-office sales last year, according to the Motion Picture Association of America. Precisely what share of international sales was captured by American-based companies is unclear, but they remained dominant.Still, Jonathan Wolf, the American Film Market\u2019s managing director, has been watching what he calls \u201ca global shift away from U. S. product over the last 25 years.\u201dGovernment subsidies for local film have changed tastes in some regions of the world. That shift, and a new generation of television-trained international filmmakers, Mr. Wolf said, have slowly undermined American-based film in ways that will again be apparent at this year\u2019s market. Over a decade, he noted, English-language film exporters have dropped to about 63 percent from 73 percent among those at his event, while United States-based exporters now account for roughly 47 percent of the American Film Market\u2019s pool, down from 53 percent 10 years earlier.American companies have looked to China for growth through collaborative ventures. But Chinese viewers, with a nudge from government policies that encourage theater owners to keep domestic films on screen, have shown an increasing tilt toward purely Chinese movies.According to Rentrak, American studio titles accounted for 39 percent of Chinese ticket sales in 2013, down from 44 percent a year earlier. Speaking in October, Rob Cain, a producer and consultant with considerable experience in China, said the American share was back to almost 44 percent.Of nine films to take in more than $100 million at the Chinese box office at that point, five were Chinese films. But an expected strong performance by Paramount\u2019s \u201cInterstellar\u201d will probably keep the American share relatively high through the year\u2019s end, Mr. Cain said.China, aside from a deeply rooted, action-oriented Hong Kong movie culture, has yet to become a powerful exporter of film. To date, it has been more like India, a prolific producer whose wares are mostly viewed within its borders, and among a vibrant diaspora around the world.A spokeswoman for the Motion Picture Association of America, a policy group for the major studios, declined to discuss the Russian situation because the potential for changes there remains uncertain.For major producers like QED International, which financed \u201cFury\u201d for Sony Pictures, or Red Granite Pictures, whose \u201cDumb and Dumber To\u201d will be released Nov. 14 in the United States, the loss of Russian sales would knock a hole in a financial model that has tapped foreign buyers for the funds to make some major American films. \u201cThe studios seem to be in a de-risking strategy,\u201d said Riza Aziz, co-owner of Red Granite. He spoke of increasing reluctance by American studios to use their own capital, relying instead on money raised by others, often through foreign sales.Christopher J. McFarland, Mr. Aziz\u2019s partner in Red Granite, said his prime concern was that a global downturn, as in 2008, would quickly impair international film finance. \u201cYou\u2019re always worried about the world economy,\u201d he said.Sometimes, film executives have more specific concerns. Victor Loewy, a producer who previously headed Canada\u2019s Alliance Films, said foreign markets, while robust, have had to contend with a rush of American movies targeted at a relatively narrow audience. One example was \u201cHeaven Is for Real,\u201d a faith-based film that posted $90.4 million in sales in the United States, but only about $9.8 million abroad, when Sony released it this year. \u201cThose films don\u2019t travel well,\u201d Mr. Loewy said.Another sore spot is a move by the American distributors of smaller films toward tiny theatrical releases, with an almost immediate turnover to video-on-demand. That kind of domestic release pattern builds little momentum for foreign distributors, who may find themselves holding rights to a movie that makes no impression abroad, because it was never a hit in the United States.That situation and other concerns, said Rena Ronson, who handles film finance and other issues for Hollywood\u2019s United Talent Agency, has contributed to a world market that remains vibrant but increasingly demands that almost everything \u2014 genre, star, story, American distribution plan \u2014 be perfectly aligned.\u201cYou have to tick all the boxes,\u201d Ms. Ronson said.Advertisement"}

On the surface, it doesn\u2019t seem wrong to wager on your own potential success, unless you somehow believe all gambling to be unethical. But there are some real problems with betting on yourself to win \u2014 they\u2019re just less obvious and harder to explain.Here\u2019s why: If an athlete bets on himself only periodically \u2014 or even if he bets varying amounts, depending on the opponent \u2014 he is opening a window for corruption. If other gamblers know that a player who regularly bets on himself to win is suddenly not betting against a specific team (or if an athlete who usually wagers $1,000 a game has changed one particular bet to $10), he\u2019s sending other gamblers a signal: It\u2019s an admission by an active participant that he is not confident. The game cannot be objectively viewed as a tossup, which is necessary to any sport\u2019s integrity. The outcome isn\u2019t fixed, but it is compromised. The third detail, however, presents the truest threat of malfeasance. A vast majority of gambling in the United States is conducted illegally, often through organized crime. For the average gambler, this has no significant consequence. But let\u2019s say an N.B.A. player bets huge sums on his team every night through an illegal bookmaker, and his squad suffers through a miserable losing streak. He loses more than he can afford to pay. How would a player in that position escape from this debt? What can he offer a bookie in exchange for debt relief? The answer is obvious: He can provide inside information about his own team, he can offer to shave points and he can offer to throw games. In the informal economy, an athlete who gambles poorly on himself is exceedingly vulnerable. As a consequence, so is his sport.THE FOAMY PHONYNo. You\u2019re a liar and a low-rent con artist.

They also point to the fact that U.S. law forbids making concessions to a terrorist group. The administration has countered by saying that the Taliban over all \u2014 unlike ISIS \u2014 has not been designated a terrorist group.Of course, these distinctions are purely rhetorical for people like Diane and John Foley, who saw their son James beheaded on TV.How does ISIS use its money?Until Mr. Cohen\u2019s recent statements, I assumed that ISIS was also holding its money outside the financial system, perhaps in safes inside the various buildings they control. If they are using local banks, that would create another dimension of sophistication.Why do journalists put themselves in such danger?Journalists travel to war zones because it is our duty to bear witness and to report on world events.Because of what has happened to James Foley and the others, major news organizations including The New York Times have pulled back from traveling into the rebel and insurgent held areas of Syria. This pullout has meant that there is little objective, on-the-ground reporting that is coming out of the Syrian civil war right now.How can we help?Kayla Mueller was one of at least 23 foreign hostages from 12 countries who were kidnapped by Syrian insurgents, sold or handed over to the Islamic State, and held underground in a prison near the Syrian city of Raqqa.Thank you for your thoughtful comments.The families of the American hostages have tried to raise money privately. This has been anything but easy. Diane Foley, the mother of the slain journalist, described to me the agonizing task of having to ask for donations. It was humiliating and frightening. In an effort to save her son\u2019s life, she was essentially passing around a hat asking people to donate money, which they knew would go into the coffers of one of the world\u2019s most brutal terrorist groups.Of the 15 hostages that were released from ISIS captivity, the majority were freed after their governments paid their ransoms through a network of intermediaries. The one exception is the ransom paid to free Daniel Rye Ottosen, a 25-year-old photojournalist from Copenhagen. Mr. Ottosen is a former athlete, and his family and friends bonded together to raise the sizable ransom, organizing to deliver it to the captors when the Danish government refused to intervene.What impact does the American policy have on ISIS?What real difference would one or two ransoms have made to events on the ground? None, except to save these hostages.Does anyone imagine that ISIS will now forgo taking any American hostages because we didn\u2019t pay? Does anyone imagine they are short of money, that one ransom would have made a difference?We should never abandon our people.You are correct in stating that ISIS makes most of its money from the war economy they control, including as much as $1 million per day in oil revenue. What we know is that there were 23 Western hostages, and that at least 15 were released for ransom. I don\u2019t know the exact number that was paid to free each one, but former hostages say that the ransoms were, on average, 2 million euros per person. This of course means that some were more and some were less, but let\u2019s just take this estimate at face value and assume that each hostage paid 2 million euros, or approximately $2.5 million, to be freed. That would mean that ISIS has netted around 30 million euros so far from ransoms for hostages they held for up to 13 months.This pales in comparison to the oil revenue, which at $1 million per day would mean that the group is making $30 million in a single month.Families of the American hostages have been critical of the government\u2019s decision not to pay, and some people sympathize, particularly when the outcome for people like James Foley and Steven Sotloff was a horrific death.I cannot say for sure if terrorist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda are avoiding kidnapping Americans. But the numbers suggest that they are targeting nationals of countries that are known to pay ransoms.What role does Saudi Arabia play?Why can\u2019t we call a spade a spade?Let that whole region rot with those bushy bearded criminals biting the hand that feeds them.Blockade is the answer.So far, no such intermediary has emerged for dealing with ISIS.What about other Arab countries?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "His Nightmares Starred Communists, Not Nazis", "Date": "2014-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis year is his centenary, and the event has been celebrated with concerts in Chicago, Warsaw, London and elsewhere. The most personal commemoration comes on Sunday, when his surviving family members present a Panufnik Day at one of London\u2019s newest concert halls, Kings Place. Panufnik\u2019s family is a powerhouse of creativity: His widow, Camilla Jessel, is a photographer; his daughter, Roxanna, is a composer; and his son, Jem, is an artist and filmmaker. They have pooled their talents for this commemorative day to tell \u2014 in words, music and images, with other performers \u2014 the story of Panufnik\u2019s roller coaster life. The tale begins in Warsaw in the 1930s, where the teenage Andrzej showed extraordinary promise and won fame with a piano trio whose lyricism and structural clarity established two enduring elements in his creative makeup. Then the Nazis invaded Poland. Formal concert life collapsed; Gestapo raids and summary arrests occurred every day. Panufnik\u2019s life moved underground, where he wrote Resistance songs and formed a piano duo with his fellow composer Witold Lutoslawski, playing four-hand arrangements of works from Beethoven to boogie-woogie in cafes and bars.\u201cThey were young men not expecting to survive from one day to the next, so they didn\u2019t care much what they did,\u201d said Ms. Jessel, 77. \u201cA lot of this music was banned, and the Nazis cracked down on anything that involved patriotic feeling. It was dangerous.\u201dBy the time of the Warsaw Uprising, in 1944, Panufnik had left the city for the Polish countryside. When he returned in 1945, he found that all his manuscripts had been destroyed. His whole work, to that time, had been wiped out.Painstakingly, he reconstructed some of it from memory, including his \u201cTragic Overture,\u201d which gives musical voice to the sounds of conflict, with an endlessly repeated four-note rhythm spattering across the score like machine gun fire. By the late 1940s, he had re-established himself at the forefront of Polish music. He nursed two orchestras, the Krakow and Warsaw Philharmonics, back to postwar life. The incoming Communist regime, to which he was initially sympathetic, showered him with privilege. \u201cWhenever he had nightmares about Warsaw,\u201d Ms. Jessel recalled in an interview, \u201cthey involved Communists, not Nazis. He said in war you expected to die, but Communism got at your head, and that was worse.\u201dPanufnik eventually escaped, under circumstances of high drama that involved car chases and giving the slip to minders, in 1954, via Switzerland to Britain, where he claimed political asylum.Because he was penniless \u2014 he had arrived at the age of 39, Ms. Jesssel said, with nothing more than shirts and scores \u2014 his new life was not easy. As he put it himself repeatedly at the time, \u201cI went from being No. 1 to being no one.\u201d Although the British musical establishment was initially welcoming, things changed \u2014 probably, Ms. Jessel said, because \u201cthe Poles were making mischief.\u201d\u201cBack home, they erased his name from the record,\u201d she said. \u201cHe became a nonperson. But overseas, it seems to be the case that government agents spread rumors about him being dishonest and untrustworthy, designed to damage his reputation and lose him support. \u201cI\u2019ve never quite got to the bottom of it all, but it certainly affected people\u2019s judgment,\u201d she said. No doubt it seemed na\u00efve and folksy. Certainly it kept him off the radio when a hard-line modernist named William Glock took charge of music broadcasting at the BBC. Panufnik was feeling isolated and ignored when his future wife, an attractive woman half his age \u2014 a debutante from an impressively grand English family \u2014 entered his life in 1961 and fell in love with him. \u201cWe got to know each other,\u201d Ms. Jessel remembered, \u201cbecause someone thought I could help with his correspondence.\u201d They married in 1963 and moved into a handsome house by the Thames at Twickenham. With the help of friends like Yehudi Menuhin, Georg Solti and Leopold Stokowski (who used the Twickenham house as a European hideaway), his life turned around.\u201cOnce the children were born,\u201d Ms. Jessel said, \u201che started writing fluently again. It was roots going down.\u201d The outpouring of work made him almost as much an English composer as he was a Polish one. Eight of his 10 surviving symphonies were written in England and explain why, just before he died in 1991, he was awarded a British knighthood.\u201cPeople in Poland always ask if he felt himself British in the end,\u201d Ms. Jessel said. \u201cAnd, of course, they never knew much about him there, except for hostile propaganda. But thanks to the centenary, the Poles now want to know. They\u2019ve realized his place in 20th-century history and want explanations. So I get bombarded with questions: Why did he leave? What happened in England? Did he belong?\u201dThe answer to that final question has to be: up to a point. Despite the knighthood, which took many by surprise, he was an \u00e9migr\u00e9 who never totally adapted. Almost every score looked back to Poland, either as a love letter to its ancient past or a grief note for its troubled present. In the 1980s, there was a bassoon concerto, commissioned by a Polish group in Milwaukee, lamenting the murder of the Warsaw priest Jerzy Popieluszko, and a symphony in support of Solidarity. \u201cAlthough I could not stand shoulder to shoulder with my compatriots,\u201d he said in an interview that was rebroadcast by the BBC, \u201cat least I could join them through my music.\u201dInfluenced by these preoccupations, vividly expressed in honest, straightforward terms, Panufnik\u2019s music may have seemed too simple for mid-20th-century modernists. But now, in a postmodern era comfortable with Minimalism and accepting of musical experience from Adams to Xenakis, different rules apply. Camilla Jessel believes her husband\u2019s moment has come.

{"Headline": "Student Debt: A Calculator Focused on College Majors", "Date": "2014-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDegrees of Education\u25a0 Debt burdens vary a lot across majors, not surprisingly. In the sixth year of repayment, typical drama, music, religion and anthropology majors are still devoting more than 10 percent of their earnings to loan repayment. Other majors with fairly high early repayment burdens include philosophy, psychology and education. By contrast, engineering, computer science, economics and nursing majors are paying 6 percent or less of earnings in their sixth year.\u25a0 Surprisingly, many of the majors that pay the least directly out of college also have the biggest raises in the first few years. Graduates who major in therapy professions, nutrition or fine arts, for instance, all make less than $20,000 coming out of college, but all see their pay more than double in the first five years. A typical nurse, by contrast, makes almost $45,000 in the first year but receives about a 20 percent raise over the next five years.\u201cThe traditional way students are asked to repay their loans doesn\u2019t take that earnings path into account,\u201d Mr. Hershbein said, \u201cso it\u2019s very hard at the beginning of repayment \u2014 when defaults and nonpayment occur most often \u2014 but gets easier over time.\u201dThe analysis focuses only on students who graduate from a four-year college and do not enroll in graduate school. That means it excludes many of the biggest winners (who earn the larger salaries that come with graduate degrees) and the biggest losers (those who accumulate debt but don\u2019t get a degree) in the current system.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Higher Quit Rate Among Employees Actually Offers Hope", "Date": "2014-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryday EconomicsFrom the Fed\u2019s perspective, this is important. A higher quit rate suggests that the labor market is recovering, but it bears watching because confident workers are more likely to push for wage increases, which might translate into inflation.Thursday morning the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the quit rate went up sharply in September, to 2 percent, returning to its level at the onset of the recession. It is worth putting this latest data point in context, though. The quit rate had been stuck at 1.8 percent over the previous seven months, even though firms were hiring rapidly and the unemployment rate was falling sharply.Far from suggesting a sharp improvement in labor market conditions, today\u2019s report suggests that the quit rate is now roughly where you might expect it to be, given the unemployment rate.Both the quit rate and unemployment remain at levels that suggest the labor market recovery remains unfinished work. With so many people still out of work, and those working still feeling their situation is precarious, it\u2019s little surprise that employers are not feeling pressured to increase wages.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Our Art Equal to the Challenges of Our Times?", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCross CutsEver since the financial crisis of 2008, I\u2019ve been waiting for \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath.\u201d Or maybe \u201cA Raisin in the Sun,\u201d or \u201cDeath of a Salesman,\u201d a Zola novel or a Woody Guthrie ballad \u2014 something that would sum up the injustices and worries of the times, and put a human face on the impersonal movements of history. The originals are all still around, available for revival and rediscovery and part of a robust artistic record of hard times past. But we are in the midst of hard times now, and it feels as if art is failing us.For the past few years, like a lot of other people, I\u2019ve been preoccupied \u2014 sometimes to the point of obsession, lost sleep, free-floating dread and active despair \u2014 by the economic state of the world. I spend more time than is healthy pondering the global labor market, the minimum wage, rising inequality, the collapse of the middle class, Thomas Piketty, Janet Yellen and the gross domestic product in China, India and Brazil. Closer to home, I\u2019m grateful for my luck and worried about my neighbors, anxious about my children\u2019s prospects and troubled by the fissures that divide my city and my country.Strictly speaking, none of this has much to do with my designated area of professional expertise, which could reasonably be defined as writing about the stuff that people seek out to escape such worries and anxieties. Serious art and popular entertainment, in their diverse ways, offer refuge and distraction. Their pleasures and comforts are not trivial, but essential. Art is the domain of solved problems, even if the problems are formal and the solutions artificial.But if art, ideally, floats free of the grim reality of work, need and sustenance, that reality is nonetheless its raw material and its context. Intentionally or not, artists in every form and style draw on and refashion the facts of life that surround them, and the resulting work takes its place among those facts. What I\u2019m grandly and abstractly calling \u201cworks of art\u201d are more concretely and prosaically books, songs, movies, plays, television series, environmental installations, paintings, operas and anything else that falls into the bin of consumer goods marked \u201cCulture.\u201d These goods are bought and sold, whether as physical objects, ephemeral real-time experiences or digital artifacts. Their making requires labor, capital and a market for distribution. The money might come from foundations, Kickstarter campaigns or retail sales or advertising revenue. The commerce between artist and public is brokered by the traditional culture industry (publishing houses, television networks, record labels and movie studios) and also by disruptive upstarts like Amazon, Netflix, Google and iTunes. But the whole system, from top to bottom, from the Metropolitan Opera House to the busker in the subway station below it, is inescapably part of the capitalist economy.And that economy, in turn, provides an endless stream of subject matter. Much as I respect the efforts of economists and social scientists to explain the world and the intermittent efforts of politicians to change it, I trust artists and writers more. Not necessarily to be righteous or infallible, or even consistent or coherent; not to instruct or advocate, but rather, through the integrity and discipline they bring to making something new, to tell the truth.But I want to go further. I want to know more about the political economy of art at the present moment, to think about how artists are affected by changes in the distribution of wealth and the definition of work, and about how their work addresses these changes. So I decided to ask them.This fall I sent out a plea, accompanied by a questionnaire. My intention was to conduct a bit of unscientific research, and also to advance a discussion about what art has done and should do at this moment of political impasse, racial tension and economic crisis, which at once resembles earlier such moments and has its own particular character. My questions were simple and far from new. The social responsibility of art has been a topic for debate since the ancients. But the answers that came back \u2014 from playwrights, filmmakers, rappers, poets and storytellers who have directly confronted these issues \u2014 testify to the complexity and the urgency of the issue. These thoughts \u2014 largely shared by email, and edited and condensed for space here \u2014 convey the sense of a conversation that is going on wherever audiences and creators grapple with the relationship between art and the world. It is my hope that what these artists have to say will provoke reactions from other artists and from readers, viewers and listeners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Deluge,\u2019 by Adam Tooze", "Date": "2014-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.This American hegemony is all the more striking given how little the United States mattered to world politics over a century ago. For anyone seeking to understand how American predominance was achieved in the years after World War I, and why it catastrophically failed to keep the hard-won peace, Adam Tooze has written an essential book. Epic in scope, boldly argumentative, deftly interweaving military and economic narratives, \u201cThe Deluge\u201d is splendid interpretive history.Rather than starting at a conventional moment like the outbreak of World War I, Tooze begins midstream in 1916 \u2014 the year of the gory battles of Verdun and the Somme, but also the year when the economic output of the United States exceeded that of the British Empire. From then until today, writes Tooze, a professor of history at Yale, \u201cAmerican economic might would be the decisive factor in the shaping of the world order.\u201d The emerging capitalist titan could convert its financial and industrial strength into military might \u2014 as Woodrow Wilson snapped about Britain in 1916, \u201cLet us build a navy bigger than hers and do what we please.\u201dWhile leaving the United States comparatively unscathed, the Great War devastated and radicalized European societies. It brought nightmare glimpses of future enormities, as when Erich Ludendorff, a top German general, planned in 1918 to uproot some two million people from annexed Polish territory, neutralizing its Jewish population and making them emigrate. That same year, Trotsky declared that \u201cviolence is a holy and historically progressive force,\u201d and Lenin vowed to establish \u201cconcentration camps\u201d for \u201cunreliable elements.\u201dStill, after the guns fell silent, there were real reasons to hope the victorious liberal powers could establish a collective security system and stabilize the global economy. Britain sought to use the League of Nations to solidify an American partnership, while France wanted to see \u201cjustice fortified\u201d through a historic democratic alignment with Britain and the United States. There were flickering American hopes for democracy in revolutionary Russia, although they were soon extinguished by the Bolsheviks. In Japan, for all the clout of the imperialists, there were also liberals and constitutionalists working in a nascent parliamentary system who temporarily restrained the militarists who would later wreak such devastation across Asia. And in Germany itself, the majority democratic parties \u2014 which today constitute the bedrock of the pacifist Federal Republic \u2014 pressed for a negotiated end to the war, then stood up against German fascists and Communists.So Tooze narrates the tumultuous and violent 1920s as a heartbreakingly avoidable tragedy, with the big democracies needlessly squandering their supremacy. Above all, grand liberal projects would never succeed without American engagement. With the United States emerging exponentially more powerful from the war, France and Britain would need its support to deter possible new German aggression. Even when the United States refused to assert itself, Tooze argues, the interwar order \u201cwas defined in large part by the absent presence of its most defining element \u2014 the new power of the United States.\u201d America did not merely fail to join the League of Nations, but by 1924 declared it potentially hostile while failing to give France a firm security guarantee.The central figure of the period is Woodrow Wilson, who appears here as an exasperating but tough-minded visionary. For all his pieties, he was unflinching about seeking American dominance. Contrary to the image of Wilson as an unheeding fantasist, Tooze paints him as deeply influenced by Edmund Burke, decrying the French Revolution and hoping instead for gradual and generational change. Even Wilson\u2019s sweeping Fourteen Points appear here as reflections of his \u201cconservative evolutionary liberalism.\u201d He doubted that Germany could sustain democracy and disdained its brave liberal leaders as \u201cnondescript creatures.\u201d And he was a consummate bigot, worrying that Japan\u2019s formidable rise while Europe was tearing itself apart threatened \u201cwhite supremacy on this planet.\u201dThe Americans, declaring themselves foes of militarism and imperialism, saw the world in a different light from established powers like Britain and France or upstarts like Germany and Japan. Wilson, in Tooze\u2019s telling, was dedicated not just to the peacemaking League of Nations, but also to \u201cAmerican hegemony against all shades of European and Japanese imperialism.\u201d Standing aloof from the colonialists on both sides, disgustedly scorning the Great War as a \u201cquarrel to settle economic rivalries between Germany and England,\u201d Wilson had only belatedly been jerked into the fighting by Germany\u2019s disastrous policy of unrestricted submarine warfare. Before and after the war, he famously sought an evenhanded \u201cpeace without victory.\u201dTo this day, the Treaty of Versailles evokes a ruinously bungled peace, a dire example consciously avoided by later leaders as varied as Henry Stimson and Indira Gandhi. But rather than simply dismissing the treaty as harshly punitive to Germany, Tooze maintains that most of its problems stemmed from its awkward respect for German national sovereignty, unlike prior European peace settlements. As bitterly as many Germans resented the treaty\u2019s restrictions and reparations, they were, he suggests, merely being subjected to a more modern type of limited sovereignty dawning across Europe. It\u2019s a particular virtue of \u201cThe Deluge\u201d that it recounts a world crisis, spiraling from Europe to Asia, with oppressive empires buckling in India, Africa and the Middle East. Obviously mindful of today\u2019s rising great power, Tooze suggests that China, then a fledgling and fractious republic, might have aligned itself with the United States in World War I. But when China abandoned its neutrality and spurned Germany in 1917, Wilson offered a disappointingly meek response, convincing a predatory Japan that America could be surprisingly easily bullied. Tooze perceptively notes that this reveals a general tendency by Wilson to raise democratic hopes and then dash them. When democratic hopes for a perpetual peace inevitably withered, the fascists and totalitarians seized their fatal chance. As World War I was drawing to a close in 1918, Wilson said he was \u201cthinking now only of putting the United States into a position of strength and justice. I am now playing for 100 years hence.\u201d With only a few years to go until then, we are still reckoning with the awful aftershocks of that era\u2019s failures.

It\u2019s also the fact that he is Christian and ethnic Chinese, and is improbably running the capital of the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation.Mr. Basuki, a 48-year-old Protestant whose grandfather was a tin miner from Guangzhou, China, was sworn in Wednesday at the State Palace by President Joko Widodo.\u201cWhen people told me \u2018the Chinese are a minority,\u2019 my father would say to tell them that we are more patriotic,\u201d Mr. Basuki said in a recent interview. \u201cIf one day Indonesia is occupied by a foreign country, my father said he would be in front of the front line to fight for our independence again.\u201dSince then, he has added to his confrontational reputation by closing the capital\u2019s most notorious nightclub after an off-duty police officer died there of a drug overdose, and by evicting thousands of illegal street vendors who had been compounding Jakarta\u2019s chronic traffic problems.\u201cIf you want to live in comfort, you have to get everything in order,\u201d Mr. Basuki said. \u201cAnd if you want to put everything in order, you have to have law enforcement.\u201dMr. Basuki\u2019s rise is a mark of the gains made by ethnic Chinese politicians since Indonesia\u2019s transition to democracy in 1999 \u2014 particularly since direct elections were implemented at all levels of government, including local offices that were once filled by appointment.\u201cWhile there were no actual political restrictions, for all intent and purposes, Chinese were restricted from the public domain for decades,\u201d said Kevin Evans, founder of Pemilu Asia, an Indonesian firm that collects political data. \u201cWith direct elections of district chiefs, mayors and lawmakers at the provincial level, ethnic Chinese are running and winning, and winning in districts where the Chinese population is a small minority.\u201dThough Chinese-Indonesians make up just over 1 percent of the vast Indonesian archipelago\u2019s population, historically they have tended to wield economic clout beyond their numbers, which has often led to resentment. For decades, they were subjected to discriminatory laws and regulations.Anti-Chinese sentiment exploded into rioting in cities across Indonesia in 1998, amid protests against then-President Suharto\u2019s authoritarian rule. In Jakarta, more than a thousand people were killed in the rioting, more than 150 women were raped and entire blocks in the Chinatown district were razed.While some affluent Chinese families fled to neighboring Singapore after the riots, Mr. Basuki\u2019s family stayed. \u201cWe are descendants of China, but our motherland is Indonesia,\u201d he said.A former mining consultant, Mr. Basuki first ran for office in 2005, winning a local election on his native island of Belitung, off the southeast coast of Sumatra, in a district where 93 percent of the voters were Muslim. \u201cI asked them why they wanted me to run, because I am of Chinese descent and a Christian,\u201d he recalled of the local residents who approached him. \u201cThey said, \u2018We don\u2019t care \u2014 we know who you are. We know your character.\u2019 \u201d\u201cThe indigenous Indonesians may have the numbers, but Chinese dominate the economy,\u201d Mr. Bambang said. \u201cSo these people are thinking, \u2018Will they control the politics with Ahok as governor?\u2019 \u201dOpponents made Mr. Basuki\u2019s ethnicity and religion an issue during Jakarta\u2019s 2012 gubernatorial race, when he was Mr. Joko\u2019s running mate. And when Mr. Joko, a Muslim, ran for president, he was subjected to a rumor campaign that characterized him as an ethnic-Chinese Christian.Mr. Basuki\u2019s \u201cjust get it done\u201d attitude has been applauded by many Jakartans, but he has critics. Last month, members of the hard-line Islamic Defenders Front clashed with the police outside the Jakarta City Council and City Hall buildings as they protested Mr. Basuki\u2019s pending swearing-in, saying that a non-Muslim should not be governor.Nonetheless, he is preparing to move into the colonial-style governor\u2019s office on the southern end of Jakarta\u2019s National Monument Park, opposite the State Palace. He is already thinking about what\u2019s next.\u201cI think it\u2019s easier to solve national problems like corruption if you are a president than as a governor,\u201d Mr. Basuki said. \u201cWho knows? I\u2019d only need to move just across the park.\u201dAn article last Sunday about Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, who recently became only the second Chinese Christian governor of Jakarta, Indonesia, the capital of an overwhelmingly Muslim nation, misstated the role of Bambang Harymurti, who commented on prejudices against Chinese Indonesians. He is a former editor in chief of Tempo magazine, a leading Indonesian weekly, not a founder.Advertisement"}

Shelby, an Alabama Republican who is slated to be the next chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has called the bureau \u201cthe most powerful yet unaccountable bureaucracy in the federal government.\u201dOne possible compromise might be the creation of a five-member panel of commissioners to oversee the bureau, experts said, much like the ones that oversee the Securities and Exchange Commission and several other regulatory agencies.Business leaders sounded an optimistic note in the wake of the election Wednesday, while also acknowledging that Washington may not change its ways. \u201cThere\u2019s been dysfunction for the last several years in the leadership of both political parties and both branches of government,\u201d said Doug Oberhelman, chief executive of Caterpillar.\u201cPeople are fed up, and this should be a wonderful wake-up call for our leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth parties should hear it, and if they don\u2019t we\u2019re headed for a really big tidal wave in 2016.\u201dAfter pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the most expensive midterm election in history, corporate donors are eager to see their agenda tackled by a party that has traditionally been much more sympathetic to big business.\u201cWith the Republicans controlling both houses, the corporations that have been financing their campaigns for years are going to expect to see a return on their investment,\u201d said Robert J. Shapiro, who was a top Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration and is now chairman of Sonecon, a Washington economic and security consulting firm.He foresees a big push to lower the corporate tax rate while closing some loopholes so that the package does not reduce overall revenue for the government.American companies have also been pressing Washington for a deal that would let them bring back profits earned overseas without incurring the current 35 percent federal tax rate on corporate earnings.Known as repatriation, advocates say it could bring back the roughly $2 trillion in earnings companies have stashed abroad for new investments or dividends in the United States. As with the rest of corporate tax reform, broad changes in tax law like this have proved elusive in the past, but President Obama has suggested a possible deal in which some of the revenue from that move would be used to help finance investments in infrastructure projects. \u201cThere\u2019s a great desire for it, and the idea of tax reform is great, but the details are really tough,\u201d said Tony Fratto, who served in the White House and the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush, and is now a top communications consultant for companies like G.E. and several major financial services firms at Hamilton Place Strategies in Washington.In addition, any tax break for business would be a tough sell at a time when many Americans remain frustrated with the economy and have not profited much from a booming stock market or surging corporate profits.\u201cThe beneficiaries will be multinationals with business overseas,\u201d Mr. Fratto said. \u201cI believe it would help the economy but it\u2019s hard to explain politically.\u201dIn theory, new trade deals with Europe and Asia have support from the White House and many Republicans, but rounding up the votes to pass them will also prove politically difficult. The Republican takeover of the Senate is likely to sharpen debate on a number of energy issues, and, with support from several Democrats from energy-rich states, put pressure on President Obama to finally decide whether to allow the Keystone XL pipeline to be built to connect Canadian oil sand fields with American refineries on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.Republicans in Congress are also expected to try to curb plans by the administration to control greenhouse gas emissions by imposing strict new rules on coal-fired power plants.Oil executives expressed exuberant satisfaction with the election results.\u201cThe Republican-controlled Congress can start making the president make some decisions on energy matters \u2014 from the Keystone XL pipeline to lifting the ban on crude exports,\u201d said James W. Noe, a senior vice president of Hercules Offshore, a drilling company that works in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pampered Baby Knows How to Crawl", "Date": "2014-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel15 PhotosSTEWARTSTOWN, N.H. \u2014 When Robert Reed and his family turned their all-terrain vehicles onto a dirt trail in far northern New Hampshire, he was surprised to see tracks from a bigger machine. The rough trail is typically used only by riders of all-terrain vehicles frolicking on a new 1,000-mile regional network of A.T.V. trails called Ride the Wilds.Mr. Reed figured he was following the path of a game warden in a pickup, so he was intrigued when the family\u2019s A.T.V.s reached the top of Sugar Hill and he saw a sparkly blue Mercedes-Benz GLA250.\u201cThat car must have very good traction,\u201d he said.Mercedes would be pleased with that comment, since the GLA was equipped with 4Matic all-wheel drive. It might be less enthusiastic about the \u201ccar\u201d description, since the G in the model name is the company\u2019s designation for a sport utility vehicle with \u201csome off-road capability.\u201dMercedes describes the new-for-2015 model as \u201cthe gateway\u201d to its S.U.V. lineup. The GLA enters a growing segment of small luxury S.U.V.s like the Audi Q3, BMW X1, Lexus NX, Lincoln MKC and a new Land Rover, the Discovery Sport, that goes on sale next year.But while the GLA badge announces \u201csport utility vehicle,\u201d its mechanical underpinnings whisper \u201ccar.\u201d Much of the GLA\u2019s innards is shared with the least expensive Mercedes automobile sold here, the CLA-Class, which was new for 2014.The most affordable GLA will be the front-drive GLA250, which is due to reach showrooms next spring with a starting price of $32,225. On sale now is the all-wheel-drive 4Matic version priced at $34,225. That is about $6,600 less than its GLK350 sibling, which is about four inches longer and had previously been the least-expensive Mercedes S.U.V.Also available now is the GLA45 AMG, a high-performance 355-horsepower version priced at $49,225 and up.Mercedes is not particularly generous with standard features. Basic equipment on the GLA250 4Matic test car did not include a compass, garage door opener, auto-dimming mirrors or dual-climate controls. All are part of a $2,300 Premium Package that included a fancier stereo. Other options, including a navigation system, bi-xenon headlights and blind-spot detection brought the total to $41,625.But the company isn\u2019t counting on no-extra-cost features to attract buyers. It\u2019s figuring the Mercedes name will be the main attraction for consumers considering their first luxury vehicle. Even though competitors may offer more standard equipment, \u201cit is just the prestige of knowing there is a lot going into a Mercedes,\u201d said M. Bart Herring, general manager for product management at Mercedes-Benz USA.Despite a price that nearly touched $42,000, the test car\u2019s interior didn\u2019t look particularly luxurious, a trait that it shares with most of its competitors \u2014 the biggest exception being the Lincoln MKC, which offers elegant design and materials, if not the same degree of prestige. The GLA can be noisy on bad roads, but the surroundings are comfortable. The controls are generally easy to use, although some of the buttons \u2014 like the fan speed setting \u2014 are small.Mercedes says there is 17.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row. That\u2019s about the same as the Lexus NX and a little more than the Audi Q3, but about eight cubic feet less than the MKC and BMW X1.On pavement, the GLA250 4Matic isn\u2019t so much sporty as it is eagerly compliant. Its light steering is predictable but lacks road feel. Body lean is nicely controlled, and the brake pedal has a quick, firm and reassuring feel. The body has the exceptional solidity one expects of a Mercedes. Indeed, the GLA feels far stronger than competitors like the Q3 and particularly the shaky MKC. The rough-road ride, however, can be jolting.Power comes from an engine shared with the CLA sedan, a 2-liter direct-injection 4-cylinder rated at 208 horsepower. The turbocharged engine produces 258 pound-feet of torque at an accessible 1,250 revolutions per minute, which means that it responds quickly, particularly with the 7-speed automatic. But as with most 4-cylinder engines there\u2019s a droning and vibration at low engine speeds that seems inappropriate in a Mercedes.In Car and Driver\u2019s testing, it took 6.4 seconds to go from zero to 60 miles per hour. The federal economy estimate is 24 m.p.g. in town, 32 on the highway.The GLA250 4Matic has eight inches of ground clearance, helpful in deep snow or while traveling a rough dirt road. In addition, there\u2019s an off-road button that recalibrates the transmission and how the engine responds to allow delicate power inputs, which is helpful on rough terrain. Another feature helps to slow the vehicle on steep descents.Mercedes\u2019 claim that the GLA is an S.U.V. is comical in the case of the high-performance version, the GLA45 AMG, whose 4.8 inches of ground clearance is less than some cars\u2019. Rather, think of it as a very hot hatchback, like a Volkswagen GTI or Mazdaspeed 3 with more exclusivity, performance and a higher price tag.The GLA45\u2019s 355-horsepower engine is a turbocharged 2-liter twin-cam 4-cylinder rated at 332 pound-feet of torque between 2,250 and 5,000 r.p.m. The transmission is also a 7-speed automatic, and a sport suspension is standard.Re-engineering by AMG, the company\u2019s in-house tuning operation, has resulted in a firm ride and instant responses whether accelerating, stopping or turning. That\u2019s accompanied by enough lateral grip that one might assume any corner can be taken at high speed. This might, however, be an ill-advised assumption.Mercedes says the GLA45\u2019s unloaded weight of 3,457 pounds is only 29 more than the GLA250 4Matic, and the acceleration is impressive under any circumstance. Mercedes says it takes only 4.8 seconds to reach 60 m.p.h., and the top speed is 155 m.p.h. The combination of power and handling makes the CLA45 such an engaging companion that one might temporarily forget the cost of such entertainment.Though the price starts below $50,000, the test vehicle carried a sticker of $60,705 with options including leather upholstery, carbon-fiber trim, an upgraded interior, a rearview camera and navigation system, blind spot assist, a performance exhaust and a panorama sunroof.Fuel economy is estimated at 23 m.p.g. city and 29 m.p.g. highway. As with the GLA250, premium fuel is recommended but not necessary.Mercedes predicts that the GLAs will appeal to upwardly mobile buyers in their 30\u2019s. But such vehicles also likely to attract those who once bought midsize cars or S.U.V.s and are interested in a smaller vehicle with \u201cpremium content,\u201d Jeff Schuster, the senior vice president for forecasting at LMC Automotive, wrote in an e-mail.But despite Mercedes\u2019 marketing wizardry and the GLA\u2019s sport-utility tag it\u2019s a good guess that Mr. Reed and his A.T.V.-riding family have seen their first and last GLA on anything that could be remotely considered off road.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fight for $15.37 an Hour ", "Date": "2014-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost Sunday mornings last summer, Julia Gould set up a table at the Hollywood Farmers Market. Alongside stalls selling shiitake mushrooms, free-range poultry and orange-blossom honey, she was selling an idea: a $15.37-an-hour minimum wage for the city\u2019s hotel workers \u2014 more than twice the federal minimum wage and one of the highest minimum wages in the nation.As shoppers wandered past, Ms. Gould asked them to sign a petition calling on the Los Angeles City Council to approve the proposal. She also urged them to write on a whiteboard their reasons for supporting the higher wage. One shopper wrote that \u201cto live a healthy life, you need a living wage,\u201d while a woman carrying a Starbucks coffee scribbled that she supported the idea \u201cbecause rent is expensive.\u201d A second community organizer photographed these shoppers and their hand-scrawled signs and then posted those pictures on Facebook and Twitter, steering them to Mitch O\u2019Farrell, the City Council member who represents Hollywood. Mr. O\u2019Farrell had questioned the wisdom of the $15.37 wage proposal, fearing that it would force hotels to lay off some of the city\u2019s 17,000 hotel workers. \u201cWe were trying to show him that his constituents cared about this,\u201d Ms. Gould said.As labor unions have dwindled in numbers and influence, more than 200 nonunion worker advocacy groups, including Laane, have sprouted across the nation, struggling to find new ways to lift wages and improve working conditions. Laane, in particular, pioneered the idea of having unions join forces with advocates for immigrants, women, African-Americans and the environment \u2014 and using their combined power to influence local lawmakers. Laane is not well known outside Los Angeles, but its achievements have been copied in many other cities. The group persuaded the Los Angeles City Council to enact one of the nation\u2019s first living-wage laws in 1997 \u2014 the current version requires pay of $12.28 an hour for workers employed by city contractors or companies receiving city tax breaks. More than 100 cities and counties have adopted similar laws. In 2001, when developers sought to build a hotel and entertainment complex near the Staples Center, Laane and its community partners pressured them\u00a0into agreeing to\u00a0pay a living wage (currently $12.28 an hour)\u00a0and to hire workers from\u00a0low-income neighborhoods. Activists in Pittsburgh, San Diego and Austin, Tex., have won similar \u201ccommunity benefits agreements\u201d from developers.Since it was founded two decades ago, Laane has focused on increasing pay for low-wage workers in Los Angeles. But only in the last few years have inequality and three decades of wage stagnation at the low end of the economic ladder firmly entered the national conversation. In midterm elections this month, voters in four Republican-leaning states \u2014 Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota \u2014 and in the heavily Democratic city of San Francisco approved higher minimum wages. And while President Obama\u2019s proposal to raise the federal minimum to $10.10 from $7.25 has stalled, some business leaders support it, saying low wages hurt business because consumers don\u2019t have enough money. The C.E.O.s of Costco and the Container Store have endorsed a $10.10 minimum, while the Gap is voluntarily raising base pay to $10 an hour by June. Laane, however, was seeking far more than that for hotel workers. It argued that Los Angeles is one of the nation\u2019s most expensive places to live and that $15.37 is the bare minimum for a decent life for workers and their families. Unlike labor unions, Laane doesn\u2019t bargain with corporations \u2014 even when its work affects a private industry. Rather, it uses its power to influence the political process. Which is why Julia Gould helped to gather 8,000 signatures last summer. And why Councilman O\u2019Farrell was suddenly getting a flood of emails and visits from local priests, ministers and rabbis. Seeds of a CampaignLaane\u2019s organizers hatched plans for the higher hotel wage 20 months ago. Its goal was not only to have the City Council approve the bill, but to do so in a landslide vote. In some ways, the campaign was a practice run toward a bigger goal: a citywide minimum wage. Laane wants $15 an hour; Mayor Eric Garcetti has proposed $13.25. The City Council is expected to vote on the proposal next year. Laane\u2019s confidence grew out of a 2012 referendum in which voters in Long Beach, a city of 470,000 just south of Los Angeles, overwhelmingly approved a $13-an-hour minimum for hotel workers. It was highly unusual to have a referendum to raise wages in just one industry.Laane decided to focus on the hotel industry, Mr. Elmendorf said, because such a high percentage of its workers live in poverty. In Los Angeles, hotel housekeepers earn close to $10 an hour, on average, according to the Economic Roundtable, a research group, while the city\u2019s hotel industry is booming thanks to the many business travelers and tourists.To win big in the City Council, the campaign\u2019s organizers knew they had to rally numbers as well as emotion. In the months before the campaign went public, Laane\u2019s staff researchers put together a 34-page report to make the case that the higher wage would be good for the city\u2019s economy.From February on, a stream of clergy members \u2014 often joined by hotel workers \u2014 knocked on council members\u2019 doors.This kind of coalition-building has been central to Laane\u2019s strategy since it was founded in 1993 by a husband-and-wife team, along with Ms. Janis, to serve as labor\u2019s bridge to community groups. At the time, that couple \u2014 Miguel Contreras and Maria Elena Durazo \u2014 were officials in the hotel workers union. \u201cWe saw that it was hard to win through the traditional way of unionizing \u2014 there was so much employer opposition,\u201d Ms. Durazo said. \u201cWe needed a new entity to look at things differently.\u201dLaane increasingly describes itself as a labor-environmental organization. It pushed for an overhaul of the city\u2019s waste-hauling industry, to take effect in 2017: To win contracts, haulers must pledge to increase the amount that is recycled, use low-pollution trucks, pay a living wage and improve safety. Critics argue that Laane\u2019s strategy sometimes hides its real intent. To help restore manufacturing jobs in California, Laane persuaded the transportation authority in Los Angeles to buy hundreds of buses and rail cars from proposed local factories \u2014 a move that could create 800 jobs \u2014 instead of importing those vehicles from Asia.\u201cThey have done a good job of finding ways to use city rules and regulations to unionize the work force,\u201d Mr. Toebben said.Ms. Tynan, Laane\u2019s executive director, argued that the critics have it all wrong. Laane, she said, is \u201cpro-growth, not anti-business.\u201d And while Laane is pro-union, she said, a vast majority of the workers helped by its policies are not union members and most probably never will be. \u201cThis whole idea that raising wages is a left idea is nutty,\u201d Ms. Tynan said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make an economy move if people don\u2019t have money to spend.\u201d\u2018The Heart Wins Out\u2019\u201cThe real tragedy of this is that some people are going to lose their jobs,\u201d Mr. Parks said.Nonetheless, he had no doubt that the proposal would pass. The reason, he said, was that so many council members were indebted to \u2014 and allied with \u2014 labor.Los Angeles was long considered the most anti-union city outside the South. For decades, a business establishment dominated city politics. But that began changing around 1990. Oil giants, major banks and aerospace companies based in Los Angeles were taken over or moved away, and with them went many hands-on civic leaders. And hundreds of thousands of Hispanic immigrants were moving to the city.Mr. Contreras, who helped found Laane, saw labor and these immigrants as the answer to filling the city\u2019s power vacuum. At the time, Hispanics in California were fuming that Republicans had pushed through the anti-immigrant Proposition 187. Mr. Contreras, who became political director of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor in 1994, saw the opportunity and started mobilizing.And that they did, getting many union members and recently naturalized immigrants to the polls. Bolstered by labor\u2019s foot soldiers, the Democrats regained control of the State Assembly in 1996 \u2014 the year Mr. Contreras became head of the labor federation. Over the following years, he and his allies helped elect pro-labor candidates to the Los Angeles City Council and the state legislature. One coup was the election of Hilda Solis, a crusader for labor, to a Congressional seat in 2000; in the Democratic primary that year, she trounced Matthew G. Martinez, a nine-term centrist Democrat, by more than a 2-to-1 margin. (Ms. Solis later became secretary of labor under President Obama.)Soon, City Council members were courting Mr. Contreras, eager to stay on labor\u2019s good side. He died in 2005, and his widow, Ms. Durazo, later became the labor federation\u2019s head. Like him, she used its considerable power to advance Laane\u2019s agenda. Though politically shrewd, the Los Angeles labor movement sometimes makes bad bets. In the City Council election, labor backed Mr. O\u2019Farrell\u2019s opponent in the primary even though Mr. O\u2019Farrell considered himself friendly to labor. He was upset that unions had snubbed him and instead backed a candidate who said unions would \u201cbe on the inside\u201d if he won. \u201cThey tried to bury me,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Farrell said.Now, eager to rack up an overwhelming majority in the push for a $15.37 wage, Laane wanted Mr. O\u2019Farrell\u2019s vote. With the Chamber of Commerce denouncing the proposal, Laane supporters knocked on the doors of thousands of small businesses to seek their support and to show that not all businesses were against the plan. Ultimately, 750 small-business owners signed a petition backing the higher wage, with hundreds placing \u201cRaise L.A.\u201d stickers in their windows.On the day in late September when the vote was scheduled, hundreds of hotel workers filled the council\u2019s ornate, high-ceilinged chamber. In a tense speech minutes before the final vote, Mr. O\u2019Farrell again told of his ambivalence, noting the study that predicted jobs would be lost. He nonetheless indicated that he would vote yes. \u201cAt the end of the day, between the intellect and the heart,\u201d he said, \u201cthe heart wins out.\u201d The vote was called, and the council approved the bill, 12 to 3. The crowd erupted. Afterward, Mr. O\u2019Farrell denied that the pressure campaign had affected his vote. He said he ultimately backed the bill because it \u201clifts people who work very hard\u201d and because \u201cI have a lot of constituents who are working mothers, including many who work in the hotel industry.\u201dOne working mother at the council session was Magdali Martinez, a hotel room attendant earning $11.42 an hour.\u201cI\u2019m overjoyed,\u201d Ms. Martinez, 44, a mother of three, said minutes after the vote. \u201cThis is really going to help my family. We don\u2019t have enough money coming in. We often have to choose between falling behind on our gas bill or our phone bill.\u201dMs. Martinez, whose husband works at an auto body shop, said the 35 percent raise would help send their son to dental school in their native Guatemala.Mayor Garcetti, who had endorsed the $15.37 proposal early on, signed the wage increase into law in October. His wife, Amy Elaine Wakeland, has served as co-chairwoman of Laane\u2019s advisory board. \u201cLaane has helped bring a sense of urgency for social justice in a town where people are falling behind,\u201d Mr. Garcetti said.Many say that without Laane\u2019s spadework, Mr. Garcetti would never have proposed a citywide minimum wage of $13.25 an hour. If it is enacted, the city would have the highest minimum wage after Seattle\u2019s and San Francisco\u2019s. But the citywide plan is facing far more opposition from small business than the hotel proposal did, and the City Council has commissioned a study on the effects of a $13.25 minimum, especially on small businesses.Laane, meanwhile, is again bringing together a coalition of neighborhood and immigrant groups, unions and environmentalists, to press members of the City Council. So Mr. O\u2019Farrell should expect visits from a few more rabbis and priests. Minimum Wages: California\u2019s ScorecardAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "There\u2019s a Giant Contradiction at the Heart of the U.S. Economy", "Date": "2014-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProspects for GrowthSuppose you told an economist these facts and only these facts: Long-term interest rates have fallen sharply over just a few months. Prices for oil and other much-needed commodities have been in free fall in the face of weak demand. Markets are predicting that inflation will be low in the years ahead and that the central bank will keep interest rates lower for longer.Knowing only those facts, the economist would conclude that this country was staring down the barrel of a significant economic slowdown, and maybe even a recession.What would that economist conclude, though, if stock prices are consistently rising toward record highs, job gains are the best in years, corporate sales and profits are rising, and business surveys and other real-time indicators of the economy point to steady expansion?That country, of course, would seem to have a perfectly strong economic outlook. And as you have surely guessed, both these situations apply to the same country at the same time, which is to say the United States in November 2014.This is the central paradox of the economy as the year nears its end. And the giant question facing the United States going into 2015 is which set of indicators are giving a more accurate view of where things are headed. In one telling, the nation is on track for the strongest year since the recovery began over five years ago; in another, Americans should brace for yet more sluggishness and uncertainty.Looking solid as well are those pieces of data that usually serve as advance warning that the economy is faltering. The Conference Board\u2019s index of leading economic indicators rose a healthy 0.9 percent in October and hasn\u2019t logged a monthly decline since January. The stock market rally continued Friday after moves by the People\u2019s Bank of China and European Central Bank that signaled easier money ahead.The trouble, if it can be called that, is in the corners of the bond and commodity markets that often presage problems in the economy.When investors become more concerned about the economic outlook, they tend to shift money into bonds, tolerating lower yields in exchange for safety and the expectation of lower interest rates in the years ahead because of the weak economy. For example, a sharp decline in yields during the second half of 2007 foretold the recession that began in December of that year.And while the price of oil and other commodities is influenced by many factors other than the overall state of the domestic economy (supply, weather and so on), the steep sell-off since this summer has been an indicator that global demand is considerably weaker than had appeared likely as recently as the spring.There are three basic ways to resolve the contradictions among these pieces of data, each with different implications for the United States economy in 2015 and beyond. It\u2019s All Overseas Maybe the moves in bond and commodity markets reflect a shortfall in economic growth outside the United States, and the American economy will continue to hum despite weakness almost everywhere else.In this telling, the drop in bond yields and oil prices actually has little to do with what is happening in the United States, but rather is driven by the persistent weakness of the European and Japanese economies, paired with disappointing growth in once-strong emerging markets, including China and Brazil.Even if this narrative is correct, though, it raises a worrying problem: How long can the United States remain an island of solid growth in the face of a slumping world economy?Markets Are DistortedMaybe the various market-based indicators of where the economy is going are sending misleading signals because of idiosyncratic circumstances.And the commodity sell-off, in this telling, is less a signal of future economic weakness and more a consequence of factors peculiar to those markets. Supplies of oil are rising because of the American and Canadian energy boom. Supplies of corn and other agricultural products are booming thanks to better weather during the growing season this year.And these two trends reinforce each other. Falling commodity prices mean lower inflation, which makes bonds more attractive, driving bond yields down further.If this interpretation is correct, the markets aren\u2019t telling us much at all about the economic future.A Slowing U.S. Economy?Perhaps the situation in the United States is gloomier than the conventional economic measures are telling us so far. It could be, in this version, that this is a bit like the second half of 2007, when market measures pointed to a downturn but a recession didn\u2019t begin until December.The drop in oil prices may partly reflect that industry in the United States is demanding less energy than in the recent past as it anticipates weaker demand. Perhaps the bond market knows something that just hasn\u2019t shown up in the official economic statistics yet.Macroeconomic Advisers, a leading forecasting firm, has cut its estimate of how fast the economy is growing in the fourth quarter (now about midway over). It pegs it at 2.2 percent, down from 3 percent, and its November forecast has overall economic growth for the year below its previous estimate by half a percentage point.If economic data remain strong over the next couple of months, it may be safe to toss out this possibility, but until then, the darkest timeline has to be considered, given the mixed messages that the global markets are sending.An earlier version of this analysis misstated the economic growth forecast of Macroeconomic Advisers in November. It forecast growth for the year at half a percentage point below its previous estimate, not half a percent.The Upshot presents news, analysis\nand graphics about politics\nand policy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Asks F.C.C. to Adopt Tough Net Neutrality Rules", "Date": "2014-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In his most direct effort yet to influence the debate about the Internet\u2019s future, President Obama said on Monday that a free and open Internet was as critical to Americans\u2019 lives as electricity and telephone service and should be regulated like those utilities to protect consumers.The Federal Communications Commission, Mr. Obama said, needs to adopt the strictest rules possible to prevent broadband companies from blocking or intentionally slowing down legal content and from allowing content providers to pay for a fast lane to reach consumers. That approach, he said, demands thinking about both wired and wireless broadband service as a public utility.\u201cFor almost a century, our law has recognized that companies who connect you to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access into and out of your home or business,\u201d Mr. Obama, who is traveling in Asia, said in a statement and a video on the White House website. \u201cIt is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information \u2014 whether a phone call or a packet of data.\u201dThe president\u2019s move was widely interpreted as giving political support to Tom Wheeler, the F.C.C. chairman. Mr. Wheeler is close to settling on a plan to protect an open Internet, often known as net neutrality, and Mr. Obama\u2019s statement could push him to adopt a more aggressive approach. Any set of rules needs three votes from the five-member commission, which now has three Democrats and two Republicans. The debate may hinge on whether Internet access is considered a necessity, like electricity, or more of an often-costly option, like cable TV. The proposal was hailed by Internet content companies like Netflix, Democrats in Congress and consumer advocacy groups. But the leading providers of Internet access, increasingly dependent on revenue from broadband subscriptions, quickly denounced the proposal. Republicans and some investment groups also spoke out against the plan, saying the regulation was heavy-handed and would kill online investment and innovation.The F.C.C.\u2019s previous rules for net neutrality were struck down in January by a federal appeals court, leaving the commission in search of new rules. In May, the commission released a proposal that would maintain a light regulatory touch, which Mr. Obama said was not strong enough. Mr. Wheeler, who was appointed by Mr. Obama, said he agreed with the president that \u201cthe Internet must remain an open platform for free expression, innovation and economic growth.\u201d But he stopped short of promising to follow the president\u2019s recommendation, saying more time was needed to consider options and adopt an approach that could \u201cwithstand any legal challenges it may face.\u201dAs an independent agency, the F.C.C. does not directly answer to the president. It answers more to Congress, which controls its budget and the laws under which it operates. Several efforts to enact net neutrality legislation over the last decade have failed to advance. While Mr. Obama has long offered vocal support on the idea of net neutrality, he has been more opaque about how it should be achieved through policy. In the last six months, almost four million people have sent comments about net neutrality to the F.C.C., the vast majority of them part of an organized campaign supporting strong rules. And in September, representatives from the websites Etsy, Kickstarter and Vimeo, among others, met with Megan J. Smith, Mr. Obama\u2019s chief technology officer, and other senior officials to ask the president to lean on the F.C.C. to impose the stricter rules that would treat broadband as a public utility. Internet content companies fear that if broadband providers can charge content companies for premium access to customers, start-ups and other small companies will be shut out.A week ago, after floating a proposal for a hybrid approach that would classify part of broadband service as a public utility, Mr. Wheeler was warned by his aides that numerous legal issues could thwart his approach.Last Thursday, Jeffrey D. Zients, the director of the National Economic Council, a White House agency that advises Mr. Obama, informed Mr. Wheeler of the president\u2019s intention to urge tough net neutrality rules, officials said. By weighing in forcefully now, officials said, the president hopes that his voice will add to the pressure on the F.C.C. But broadband companies like Verizon, which successfully challenged the F.C.C.\u2019s last net neutrality rules, said that the president\u2019s plan was unacceptable. And companies that make the routers and servers that are used to build the Internet backbone, represented by the Telecommunications Industry Association, said they \u201cstrongly urge regulators to refrain from reclassification that will guarantee harm to consumers, the economy and the very technologies we\u2019re trying to protect.\u201dShares of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the country\u2019s two largest wired broadband Internet providers, fell about 4 percent on Monday. Shares of Verizon fell slightly, while AT&T and CenturyLink rose in a market that ended marginally higher. Shares of Google, Netflix and other content providers advanced.Republican leaders also objected to Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal, including Senator John Thune of South Dakota, who is in line to take over the chairmanship of the Senate Commerce Committee in the Republican-controlled Senate next year.Mr. Thune said the effort \u201cwould turn the Internet into a government-regulated utility and stifle our nation\u2019s dynamic and robust Internet sector with rules written nearly 80 years ago for plain old telephone service\u201d \u2014 referring to the Communications Act of 1934, which created the F.C.C. to regulate wire and radio communications, including common carriers like telephone service.Specifically, Mr. Obama has proposed reclassifying Internet service \u2014 both wired and wireless \u2014 as a Title II telecommunications service under the Communications Act. That would allow the F.C.C. to write rules that would forbid blocking of legal content and discrimination by a broadband company against any provider of content.But Title II does not by itself ban the ability of a broadband provider to charge a content company for a preferred service. \u201cYou need strong rules, and you probably use some of the other powers of the commission to augment those rules,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, president of Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group. Title II also carries with it the possibility of regulating rates, but Mr. Obama asked the F.C.C. to refrain \u201cfrom rate regulation and other provisions less relevant to broadband services.\u201dBut forbearance from portions of the law are not always easy, because Title II has upward of 1,000 requirements, said Robert M. McDowell, a former F.C.C. commissioner.\u201cAs a legal matter,\u201d Mr. McDowell said, \u201cit would be very difficult for the F.C.C. to subject the Internet to common-carrier regulation while at same time forbearing from the vast majority of Title II.\u201dOnce the regulation is challenged in court, he said, \u201cThat is what makes this whole idea very wobbly.\u201dMichael D. Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Struggle to Erase Saudi Extremism", "Date": "2014-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsThe rise of the Islamic State has once again turned the spotlight on Saudi Arabia, which is accused of supplying the theological foundation of the movement\u2019s brutal ideology, as well as many of its fighters and funders.The kingdom faced similar criticism in 2001 after 15 of the 19 hijackers in the 9/11 terrorist attacks were found to be Saudi. As a result, when King Abdullah ascended to the throne four years later, he established the Financial Investigation Unit to halt terror financing and cracked down on extremist rhetoric in the mosque. But the heart of his campaign against extremism was a major revamp of the nation\u2019s education system.Almost a decade later, it is apparent that, however laudable, Saudi reforms have not gone far enough. More critically, it is clear that fighting extremism through education reform is insufficient. More needs to be done to confront the Islamic State \u2014 a clear and present danger to the country\u2019s survival as well as to its assertion that Islam is a compassionate and peaceful faith.For decades, Saudi education was controlled by religious conservatives who promoted a narrow-minded brand of Islam. Graduates tended to be incurious and lacking the skills to modernize Saudi society and its economy.To change this outcome, Abdullah expanded the number of Saudi universities from 8 to 25. He closed conservative teachers colleges, and improved teacher training to encourage critical thinking over rote learning. Math and science instruction was increased. Some, but not all, bigoted language was removed from religious textbooks. And an emphasis was placed on Islam being a \u201cmoderate\u201d religion. Hundreds of teachers who propagated extremist ideas were fired.The crown jewel of Abdullah\u2019s education reform is the overseas scholarship program that since 2005 has sent thousands of young Saudis abroad to study everything from English to engineering. Today more than 125,000 Saudis are studying in about 30 countries, more than 70,000 of them in the United States. Not only did the king want Saudis to acquire useful job skills, he also wanted their minds opened up by experiencing foreign cultures and modern societies. These educational reforms, which included new emphasis on science, technology, engineering, medicine and math, are impressive. Indeed, they stand out in the Arab world. But Saudi students still do not get a good grounding in history, economics or comparative analysis. During our years living in the kingdom, we heard some young Saudis say they did not know there had been a World War I or II. Comparative religion, political theory and philosophy are not taught. Indeed, for some Saudi educators, these are dangerous subjects.Certainly religious attitudes among young people are shifting, though this may be due as much to Internet access as to education reforms. In a recent study of youth attitudes, one of us found that young Saudis are more willing than their parents to explore other versions of Islam, and are more skeptical of religious edicts from official clerics. Many youths express a desire for less enforcement of religion and greater interest in Islam\u2019s diversity. Women particularly say they want to delink Islam from Saudi cultural norms that discriminate against women.A George Washington University grad student, Nouf Al Sadiq, argued in a recent essay that schools in her home country need to do more to promote religious tolerance. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be an \u2018us\u2019 versus \u2018them\u2019 battle or a battle between Muslims and Infidels,\u201d wrote Ms. al-Sadiq. \u201cIn fact, there doesn\u2019t have to be a battle against anyone.\u201dBut the reality is that young Saudis don\u2019t emerge from school into an environment where there is freedom to debate the issues that convulse Islam today. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite. Reports abound: Saudi clerics often preached hatred and intolerance against Muslim minority sects, particularly Shiite. Saudi Arabia stands alone among Arab countries in prohibiting Christian or any other worship services in public. Too often, Saudis who voice concerns about religion or governance are arrested, lose their jobs or have their books banned.This helps explain the initial reluctance among ordinary folks, as well as the clerical establishment, to publicly condemn the Islamic State. Stung by attacks on Sunnis by Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq and by Hezbollah fighters in Syria, some Saudis saw the Islamic State, no matter how murderous, as a comeback for \u201cTeam Sunni.\u201d Only after the king chided his clerical leadership for being \u201clazy\u201d in not denouncing the Islamic State did they voice disapproval. To be sure, only a small minority of Saudis \u2014 one poll estimates 5 percent \u2014 sympathize with the Islamic State. Still, that\u2019s a large enough fringe to create a lot of violence. It needs to be more openly confronted by the rest of Saudi society and its brutal version of Islam totally discredited. This appears to be the aim of a recent announcement that a forum for national dialogue established several years ago by the king will hold 20 public sessions focusing on a \u201cfuture national vision to tackle the problem of extremism,\u201d the Arab News has reported. This is important, for without the blessing of the leadership, Saudis will be reluctant to share their hopes and fears about the future of the state and Islam. But such a national conversation needs to go beyond extremism. It needs to discuss what Islam means in modern times, how to apply the values of Islamic pluralism, and how Islamic morality can inform political theory and economic planning. Such a dialogue should also reverse the glorification of jihad over its intellectual counterpart, ijtihad. A commitment to ijtihad, which is the struggle to reach new understandings of Islam through reflection on its scriptures, is what made Islam an expansive faith that supported scientific research and intellectual curiosity. It is why the faithful were admonished that \u201cthe ink of the scholar is more holy than the blood of the martyr.\u201dBeyond this national dialogue, other actions are necessary. Abdullah should rekindle the Arab world\u2019s devotion to the pursuit of all knowledge, make hate speech unacceptable by punishing Saudis who use it, and order state institutions to reflect tolerance for all faiths. He should also move to forge a more moderate, less sectarian clerical establishment. This is urgently needed before right-wing religious militancy becomes an even more serious issue, which may happen if combat-hardened Saudis come home from fighting with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In addition, private funding for extremist causes needs greater scrutiny. These steps could lead the region out of its downward spiral by providing a riveting example for other Arab countries. As one of Islam\u2019s most influential leaders, King Abdullah is eminently qualified to lead such a far-reaching initiative. The peace of the region and the image of Islam await his action.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Art of Xi Jinping", "Date": "2014-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Last month, President Xi Jinping of China addressed a forum of prominent artists and writers in Beijing to enlighten us with his views on the arts. In a talk liberally seasoned with cultural allusions, Mr. Xi made a show of his literary knowledge and explained how he sees the role of art in today\u2019s China. According to the Xinhua news agency, Mr. Xi said the emphasis by artists on \u201cquantity over quality\u201d has led to a one-size-fits-all approach to the production of art. Culture is derivative, plagiaristic and stereotyped, he said; it produces \u201cmechanized fast food\u201d that is full of \u201cvulgarity\u201d and \u201clust.\u201d He instructed artists on how and what to create: \u201cUse a realistic spirit and romantic feelings to illuminate real life, deploy light to dispel darkness, and goodness to defeat ugliness. Let people see the good, feel hope, have dreams.\u201d And he made clear where artists stand in his China: Artists should implement \u201cthe party\u2019s policies on the arts.\u201d Artists should not \u201close themselves in the tide of market economy nor go astray while answering the question of \u2018whom to serve.\u201d\u2019 \u201cThe arts must serve the people and serve socialism.\u201d The recent gathering reminded many people of the Yan\u2019an Talks on Literature and Art in 1942, where Chairman Mao, Mr. Xi\u2019s idol, established the principles of \u201cparty literature,\u201d bringing Chinese literature into the stable of Communist propaganda. Since then, all of China\u2019s writers\u2019 organizations have been government entities, all literary prizes have been bestowed by the state, and all published works must endure rigorous censorship. Writers and artists cannot criticize: their role is to chirp about a golden age of China, or suffer the consequences of being banned or arrested.Following the president\u2019s speech, a \u201cLearn from Xi Jinping\u201d campaign swept across the country. Artists and writers piped up, one after another on social media, to congratulate Mr. Xi for being well-read or to praise his remarks. Many artists said they found his words inspiring. In a country like China, even casual remarks by the top leaders have an unsurpassable authority. Mr. Xi\u2019s enthusiasm can spark new trends in Chinese letters, his criticism can mold the entire field of literature.Few people question whether Mr. Xi has the credentials to tell writers what to do. In the past few months, he has become the best-selling author in China, perhaps even in the world. His book \u201cNew Sayings From Zhijiang,\u201d a collection of newspaper columns based on Communist Party dogma that he wrote in the early 2000s when he was secretary of Zhejiang Province, shot to the top of the charts after his elevation to the presidency in 2012. Two follow-up books have done even better.Ever since Chairman Mao, every party leader has been a best-selling author. Indeed, we have been blessed with a series of all-around geniuses. Mao, the revolutionary, government leader and military strategist, was also a poet, calligrapher and prodigious swimmer. Deng Xiaoping was a bridge master. Xi Jinping has been celebrated not only for his writing talent but also for his soccer skills. Censorship is the greatest obstruction to the flourishing of writing and the creative arts. Rather than engaging the Chinese people about creative expression, Mr. Xi is just laying down the law: \u201cYour writing must be patriotic;\u201d \u201cyou must honor our glorious cultural traditions;\u201d literature and art must not be contaminated by \u201cthe stench of money.\u201d Although these words have no legal significance, they are far more effective than any edict because, through a national campaign to \u201cLearn from Papa Xi,\u201d they will inevitably give birth to new guidelines for the publishing and film industries and set the standard for all kinds of prizes and awards. In the coming years, even if Chinese writing and the arts can purge itself of the so-called stench of money, after this speech, the foul smell of Mr. Xi\u2019s words will linger. The most dangerous aspect of Mr. Xi\u2019s speech could be his negative appraisal of the arts. Phrases like \u201cvulgarity,\u201d \u201clust\u201d and \u201csensual entertainment\u201d could well become the slogans of a future party campaign to \u201crectify\u201d the arts. Only five days after the Beijing symposium, the Guangming Daily newspaper published an opinion article saying that writers and artists in thrall to \u201cWestern theories\u201d need to resist \u201cunhealthy thoughts, low tastes and mistaken ideas,\u201d and indeed dare to \u201cpublicly and unequivocally criticize them.\u201dThe crux of Mr. Xi\u2019s much touted \u201cChina dream\u201d is a peace that is intolerant of dissent. A teacher who doesn\u2019t obey the party (like the legal scholars Zhang Xuezhong and Chen Hongguo) will be pressured to leave his university post; a publication that doesn\u2019t obey the party (like Southern Weekend and China Through the Ages) will be punished; an individual who crosses the party (like the lawyer Pu Zhiqiang and the rights activist Guo Yushan) will be locked up. Now the government has fixed its sights on literature and the arts. We can imagine that the government\u2019s list of forbidden films, broadcasts and publications will swell with additional categories of banned work. Even though many of Mr. Xi\u2019s boosters are proclaiming a new spring in the arts, I think that before that spring arrives, we will endure a long winter. The tragedy of the early 20th century journalist and literary writer Wang Shiwei is a disturbing point of reference for many artists who value free expression. The one-time Mao supporter wrote an essay critical of the chairman and the party elite in 1942 before the infamous Yan\u2019an forum on literature and art. He was then criticized, beaten and imprisoned for several years before being hacked to death, his remains reportedly dropped in a well.In his fateful essay, Wang said that he had done his best \u201cto strive for the light.\u201d Seventy-two years later, as today\u2019s artists face a similar situation, how many could stand up and say, like Wang, that they\u2019ve done everything they could to see the light?

{"Headline": "Business vs. Economics", "Date": "2014-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome of the people I\u2019ve spoken to here argue that the opposition of many Japanese business leaders to the Bank of Japan\u2019s actions shows that it\u2019s on the wrong track. In saying this, they\u2019re echoing a common sentiment in many countries, including America \u2014 the belief that if you want to fix an ailing economy, you should turn to people who have been successful in business, like leaders of major corporations, entrepreneurs and wealthy investors. After all, doesn\u2019t their success with money mean that they know how the economy really works?Actually, no. In fact, business leaders often give remarkably bad economic advice, especially in troubled times. And I think it\u2019s important to understand why.And on the other side, the past few years have seen repeated vindication for policy makers who have never met a payroll, but do know a lot about economic theory and history. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have navigated their way through a once-in-three-generations economic crisis under the leadership of former college professors \u2014 Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen and Mervyn King \u2014 who, among other things, had the courage to defy all those tycoons demanding that they stop printing money. The European Central Bank brought the euro back from the brink of collapse under the leadership of Mario Draghi, who spent the bulk of his career in academia and public service.Obviously there are business leaders who have gotten the economic analysis right, and plenty of academics who have gotten it wrong. (Don\u2019t get me started.) But success in business does not seem to convey any special insight into economic policy. Why? So think of what happens when a successful businessperson looks at a troubled economy and tries to apply the lessons of business experience. He or (rarely) she sees the troubled economy as something like a troubled company, which needs to cut costs and become competitive. To create jobs, the businessperson thinks, wages must come down, expenses must be reduced; in general, belts must be tightened. And surely gimmicks like deficit spending or printing more money can\u2019t solve what must be a fundamental problem.In reality, however, cutting wages and spending in a depressed economy just aggravates the real problem, which is inadequate demand. Deficit spending and aggressive money-printing, on the other hand, can help a lot.But how can this kind of logic be sold to business leaders, especially when it comes from pointy-headed academic types? The fate of the world economy may hinge on the answer.Here in Japan, the fight against deflation is all too likely to fail if conventional notions of prudence prevail. But can unconventionality triumph over the instincts of business leaders? Stay tuned. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lone Star State Bets Heavily on a Space Economy", "Date": "2014-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Someday capsules sent aloft from a New Mexico desert will whisk celebrity passengers on flights into suborbital space.And someday rockets taking off from a sandy beach in Texas will carry colonists to Mars.What is the point of space, after all, if it cannot be filled with grandiose dreams?The space exploration company, founded by the billionaire investor Elon Musk, announced earlier this year that it would open a private orbital launch facility on Boca Chica Beach near Brownsville. The very first human who steps foot on Mars, Mr. Musk told a crowd on groundbreaking day, could be launched from the beach. Mr. Musk has upped the space-race ante, offering humankind a way to hedge its bet against extinction on Earth.\u201cThe thing that\u2019s going to fundamentally affect humanity\u2019s future is, are we a multiplanet species or are we a single-planet species?\u201d Mr. Musk said at the groundbreaking. \u201cA single-planet species is much more vulnerable than a multiplanet species, because if some calamity were to happen to one planet, it could destroy civilization, maybe bring an end to humanity.\u201dIt is the kind of promise a city like Brownsville, where 34 percent of the population lives below the poverty level, sees as a game-changer. SpaceX is among a growing group of companies competing in a new kind of space race \u2014 an effort to monetize manned spaceflights. Several of the competitors have operations in Texas. While private companies are running the race, public dollars are often fueling it.Keith Graf, the director of the Texas Office of Aerospace, Aviation and Defense, says the state\u2019s wide-open skies and areas of low population are attracting companies that see profits in private spaceflight. \u201cOne of the first private rockets ever launched was actually launched from Texas, Matagorda Bay, almost 30 years ago in 1982 \u2014 it\u2019s continuing on that legacy,\u201d Mr. Graf said. Mr. Musk\u2019s vision for SpaceX is to make spaceflight more accessible, and ultimately to colonize Mars. It is a vision that many public officials in Texas have embraced, and that Mr. Musk considers essential. But Mr. Musk is not in Brownsville because he wanted to go to Texas. He is there because state officials have been more than willing to roll out the red carpet for SpaceX and other space companies. There are, of course, no guarantees that all will end well. Critics point to New Mexico, where the government invested more than $200 million in Spaceport America. Though it was pitched as a hub for space tourism for the rich and famous, Virgin Galactic has yet to launch a manned flight into space from the facility. \u201cSomeday it\u2019ll probably be viable, but what\u2019s that someday?\u201d Mr. Gessing said. \u201cFifty, 100 years? You\u2019ve got to talk about the time value of money, and whether taxpayers should be really footing the bill for this kind of thing.\u201dMr. Gessing said he did not think it wise for public money to be invested in the spaceward dreams of billionaires. \u201cI just don\u2019t see the market for this kind of facility out there, in terms of demand. In New Mexico\u2019s case, it was an extremely misguided decision,\u201d he said, adding that even more public money would be spent in the future on maintenance. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the rub for us, not just that they put all their eggs in one basket, but that they spent so much money.\u201dMr. Graf acknowledged that spaceflights were risky, but said the investments Texas had made were smart. \u201cThe industry itself is risky, but so is getting on an airplane or driving to work every day,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are inherent risks. But we\u2019re placing our money wisely, and it is going into infrastructure to help grow the industry. And in Texas, primarily, it\u2019s the private industry that\u2019s making the capital investments.\u201d When asked about the risks, both safety and financial, Mr. Salinas brushed them off, saying the SpaceX facility in Brownsville was different than the New Mexico site.\u201cThat\u2019s why they call it rocket science \u2014 it\u2019s not easy to get spacecraft into outer space,\u201d Mr. Salinas said. \u201cDo we have full faith in the project? Yes, because it\u2019s Elon Musk. When you are able to say this is a person that reminds us of what Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and, to a certain extent, what Henry Ford and Thomas Edison have done, then it\u2019s very easy to believe and see his vision.\u201dPaul Baffes, who calls himself a \u201cNewSpace consultant\u201d and is a member of the Greater Austin Space Economy Working Group, said turning over the reins of space exploration and development to private industry would encourage innovation. \u201cWhen you open this up to thousands of people, that\u2019s when you really will see innovation happen in space,\u201d Mr. Baffes said. \u201cWe\u2019re opening this up to as many innovators as we can find out there, and that\u2019s when we\u2019re really going to see the space program cash in on the promise we\u2019ve all wanted it to do, for so many years.\u201dbblanchard@texastribune.org Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Democrats, Finding a Message That Works", "Date": "2014-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 To recover from their debacle in the midterm elections, Democrats have seized on two questionable propositions: They lost mainly because of President Obama\u2019s unpopularity, and the 2016 presidential election will be more favorable.Across the United States, Democrats ran away from the president, and the electorate this year wasn\u2019t the same as during the 2012 presidential campaign: It included three percentage points more of white voters, with an equal drop in people of color; the number of younger voters fell by a third, while the number of older voters increased by that much. This helped Republicans.Turnout, exit polls and other data suggest another Achilles\u2019 heel for Democrats: the lack of any real focus on the economy. Many candidates talked about raising the minimum wage and achieving pay equity for women. But Republicans often co-opted those issues. Minimum-wage initiatives carried in five states, sometimes with the support of conservative Republicans such as Representative Tom Cotton, who unseated a Democrat, Senator Mark Pryor, in Arkansas.Most Republicans had a coherent economic message: Downsize government, reduce domestic spending, cut taxes and curb regulations on business.The Democrats got trounced with the middle class, according to exit polls. Among voters earning $50,000 to $100,000 \u2014 more than a third of the electorate \u2014 Republicans had an 11-point advantage.In several Senate races \u2014 North Carolina, Colorado, probably Alaska \u2014 the outcomes would have been reversed had Democrats lost fewer of these voters.Democrats are sure to keep stressing pay equity \u2014 appealing to female voters \u2014 and raising the minimum wage. They will also press to expand the valuable earned income tax credit for the working poor. However, these measures only marginally affect wage stagnation and the lagging middle class.There are smart Democratic policy researchers who think about this a lot, including Alan S. Blinder and Alan B. Krueger, both Princeton University economists and former top Democratic officials.In general, their message for Democrats is to shift from a defensive posture as deficit reducers to become proactive advocates of stimulus measures, especially a major infrastructure initiative. A robust economy won\u2019t end wage stagnation or income inequality, but it\u2019s a step.Inequality is getting worse in America: The gap between rich and poor is growing, while the middle class is stalled. And upward mobility, a centerpiece of the American dream, is more limited. According to Raj Chetty, a Harvard economist who has done seminal work on social mobility, data shows that there is only a 7.5 percent chance an American born in the lowest economic quintile will move to the top quintile; the chances are almost twice as good in Canada.An element in addressing this, Democratic economists say, is changes in tax policy, with the focus on the working and middle classes. Mr. Krueger also calls for creating more incentives for profit-sharing and employee stock options for workers.Worker representation, they say, is critical to change.\u201cWe need to tilt the playing field in favor of rather than against unions,\u201d said Mr. Blinder, who was an economic adviser to President Bill Clinton and vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.Mr. Krueger, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for Mr. Obama, said Democrats \u201cneed to think creatively about worker representation in the workplace,\u201d citing models in Germany. He suggests expanding initiatives such as Sara Horowitz\u2019s Freelancers Union, with its support system and health insurance coverage opportunities for independent workers.Democratic candidates, especially at the presidential level, have to fashion this and more into an economic message that addresses anxieties and frustrations and projects a more promising future. That is a tough task. But if they forfeit, as they did this election season, the outcome may be similar. Advertisement"}
